                                        <p>ATLANTA (AP) — Delta Air Lines is changing its employee uniform policy following a turbulent ride through a social media storm started by an X user’s outrage over two flight attendants who were photographed wearing Palestinian flag pins.</p><p>The uproar over the July 10 post on X, which described the Palestinian pins as “Hamas badges,” led Delta to ban its employees from wearing pins representing any country or nationality besides the U.S. The rule will take effect Monday.</p><p>“We are proud of our diverse base of employees and customers and the foundation of our brand, which is to connect the world and provide a premium experience,” the Atlanta-based airline said in a statement “We are taking this step to help ensure a safe, comfortable and welcoming environment for all.”</p><p>Delta’s policy shift reflects the ongoing tensions surrounding the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">Israel-Hamas war,</a></span> which has triggered high-profile protests that, among other things, have roiled college campuses.</p>
    

<p>Both attendants pictured wearing the pins were in compliance with Delta’s previous policy giving employees more flexibility with uniform accessories. </p>



<p>Before Delta announced its new policy, one of its employees escalated the situation by posting a reply on X asserting the attendants wearing the Palestinian pins were violating company rules and sympathizing with passengers who might be “terrified” by it. That post has since been deleted but was captured in a screenshot shared by the American Muslim rights group CAIR, the Council on American-Islamic Relations.</p>
    
<p>Delta apologized <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://x.com/Delta/status/1811471772367077668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a post</a></span> and said the employee responsible for the reply had been removed from handling its social media communications.</p><p>“What happened with Delta is just the latest example of anti-Palestinian racism,” Edward Ahmed Mitchell, the national deputy executive director of CAIR, told The Washington Post. He said the group welcomed Delta’s apology. “And my hope is that this incident will begin to slowly, slowly move the needle in a different direction.”</p>

<li>** Potential consequences**: The mSpy data breach is expected to reveal more information about the company's customers and potential users, while the Heritage Foundation breach highlights the importance of cybersecurity and the potential consequences of cyberattacks on organizations and individuals.</li>

Much of it was “useless,” according to “vio,” one of the hackers with the group SeigSec, which said it targeted the Heritage Foundation because “Project 2025 threatens the rights of abortion health care and LGBTQ+ communities in particular.” Still, the intrusion <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/heritage-foundation-gay-furry-hackers-texts-1235057421/">apparently irked</a> Heritage columnist Mike Howell, whose alleged chat with “vio” was <a data-offer-url="https://files.catbox.moe/i0tkbp.txt" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://files.catbox.moe/i0tkbp.txt"}' href="https://files.catbox.moe/i0tkbp.txt" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">leaked</a> and later <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/MHowellTweets/status/1811114191513702455" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/MHowellTweets/status/1811114191513702455"}' href="https://x.com/MHowellTweets/status/1811114191513702455" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">shared</a> by Howell.

CDK Global, which provides software to US car dealerships, seems to have picked the latter option. According to researchers at crypto tracing firm TRM Labs, CDK sent 387 bitcoin, worth around $25 million, to an account believed to be controlled by the BlackSuite ransomware gang. CDK has not confirmed the payment, but if accurate it would be at least the second major payment to ransomware gangs this year. In March, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alphv-change-healthcare-ransomware-payment/">Change Healthcare paid a $22 million ransom</a> to help end the disruption to medical facilities across the US. The problem with paying—besides costing a literal fortune—is that it can encourage more ransomware attacks. In fact, following Change Healthcare’s payment, researchers at security firm Recorded Future saw <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/change-healthcare-22-million-payment-ransomware-spike/">the largest spike in ransomware attacks targeting the health care industry</a> in the four years that it has tracked the criminal activity. The catch, of course, is that paying can work: CDK <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/business/cdk-global-dealers-online/index.html">indicated last week</a> that nearly all of the 15,000 dealerships it works with are back online.</p><p class="paywall">The US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-leads-efforts-among-federal-international-and-private-sector-partners">announced</a> on Tuesday that US, Canadian, and Dutch authorities seized two domains used to operate a “bot farm” allegedly created by RT, the Russian state media organization, and operated by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). The DOJ says it identified 968 social media accounts linked to the bot farm that were used to amplify RT content online. The RT bot farm was created in 2022, according to the DOJ, and commandeered by an FSB agent in 2023. It is unclear what impact the bot farm had, and the DOJ says its investigation is ongoing.</p></div></div>

								<p>Two of the largest banks in the US are declaring a loss on a whopping $3.5 billion in debts that customers can’t pay back.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/quarterly-earnings/2024/2nd-quarter/36a0b862-cc80-4e28-bf1b-5cfa07dc9637.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> its net charge-offs, which are delinquent debts that banks do not expect to receive, hit $2.2 billion in the second quarter of the year.</p>


<p>That’s a $200 million increase from the previous quarter and an $800 million increase from Q2 of 2023.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wells Fargo <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/earnings/second-quarter-2024-earnings.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> its net charge-offs surged from $764 billion in Q2 of 2023 to $1.3 billion last quarter – a 70% increase.</p>
<p>Although the pace of inflation has reduced, Wells Fargo’s chief financial officer Michael Santomassimo says many customers are clearly struggling as their credit card balances rise and savings dwindle, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/business/wells-fargo-jpmorgan-citibank.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reports</a> the New York Times.</p>
<p><em>“[Inflation is] still cumulatively having a bit impact. The folks on the lower end of the wealth or income spectrum are struggling more than folks that are on the higher end.”</em></p>
<p>In addition to its charge-offs, JPMorgan declared an additional $500 million in losses from failing mortgage investments.</p>
<p>US banks have been sounding the alarm on its customers’ growing credit card balances and issues in the commercial real estate industry since last year.</p>
<p>In its new report, Wells Fargo says it earned a Q2 profit of $4.9 billion, although the bank’s shares tumbled 6% on Friday after net interest income fell short of estimates.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase reported a quarterly profit of $13.1 billion as its stock hovers near its all-time high.</p>

    <p>Based on the article, here are 5 key points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Investors are betting on a Fed rate cut</strong>: The article suggests that investors are expecting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which is likely to spur a rotation from overvalued stocks to undervalued ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bull market continues</strong>: Despite concerns about overvaluation, the article notes that the bull market in stocks is still ongoing, with many investors expecting it to continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on neglected stocks</strong>: A rate cut could lead to a shift away from popular, overvalued stocks and towards those that have been neglected or undervalued, providing new opportunities for investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rotating from crowded stocks</strong>: The article highlights the potential for a "rotation" from crowded, overvalued stocks to those that have been underappreciated, as investors seek to capitalize on undervalued opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Timing of rate cut uncertain</strong>: While investors are betting on a rate cut, the timing of the cut is unclear, and the Federal Reserve is expected to provide more guidance on monetary policy in the coming weeks.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Vending machines selling ammunition are coming to grocery stores</strong>: American Rounds, a company, is distributing vending machines that sell ammunition in grocery stores in Alabama, Texas, and Oklahoma.</p>
</li>

            Vending machines selling ammunition will now be in grocery stores in Alabama, Texas and Oklahoma – a move that has generated mixed feelings from officials in those states.
    </p>

            American Rounds, the distributor of the machines, uses AI technology to scan the customers’ identification as well as facial recognition software to verify a customer’s identity, according to the company’s website.

            The software works together to verify the buyer’s age and that the person using the machine matches the identification scanned.

            Each machine sells ammunition for various firearm calibers, including rifles, shotguns and handguns, according to American Rounds.

            Grant Magers, CEO of American Rounds, said local grocery stores approached him in the spring of 2023 about utilizing his technology to sell ammunition. The company rolled out its first dispenser in Alabama last November.

            “It’s not much different than setting up any other business,” Magers said.

            The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has allowed the machines, telling CNN in a statement: “A federal license is not required to sell ammunition. However, commercial sales of ammunition must comply with state laws as well as any applicable federal laws.”
    </p>

            CNN has reached out to the Alabama and Texas attorneys general to confirm the legality of the dispensers in their respective states.

            Earlier this month, the ammunition dispenser in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, was taken down and relocated by American Rounds.

            “We as a business … made the decision to relocate that machine because we weren’t having the sales that we wanted to at that location compared to our other spots,” Magers said.

            Kip Tyner, a member of Tuscaloosa city council, told CNN: “It may be getting in the hands of people who are not that responsible. I just don’t see it as a necessity.”
    </p>

            “There could be a dispute, and someone got upset with someone else and instead of cooling off and having to go to the store the next day they could go to the grocery store to get ammunition and use it for the wrong reasons,” Tyner said.
    </p>

            American Rounds plans to expand into more states, having already received offers from stores in California, Florida and Hawaii, among others, Magers said. The company, he said, is setting up two more dispensers in Texas and Colorado within the next couple of weeks.

I don't want it happening on my flight," said Downey-Freiman. "I don't ever think of that. I have a laptop, sure. And you figure it's safe because you've used it forever.  But sometimes, they do get hot." </p><p>They say after this incident, they will pay close attention to their latops in their bags.</p><p>"No one thinks about that.

<p>Every qualified citizen of the United States receives payments for Social Security and other benefits throughout the month. Therefore, you could have the money available in the coming days if you qualify for any <strong>SSI, SSDI, and Social Security payments.</strong> But only a specific group of Americans get Social Security payments 2024 during the third week of July. To find out if you will receive the money or not, you must be eligible and a member of that specific group. </p>




<p>For half of the recipients, the Social Security Administration’s July payment schedule is already set. In any case, for two of the four categories of US retirees who receive a fresh benefit from the SSA each month, the money has already been distributed. Following the July 3 and July 10 Social Security and SSI payments, there will be many pay days throughout the summer.</p>




<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Social Security, SSI and SSDI Full List of Payments in the USA</strong></h2>



<p>Retirees can get their <strong>Social Security benefits</strong> on up to four different days each month, so keep that in mind. Another payment that is made on the first of every month is Supplemental Security Income, however it is subject to some limitations. While, there are no SSI payments made during the third week of the month for retirement benefits, whether or not they are from SSDI. </p>



<p><strong>July 17th is the Social Security July 2024 payment date,</strong> and there are two conditions we must fulfill in order to get a check. The beneficiary must have been receiving the benefit from May 1997 onwards, and the applicant must be born between the 11th and the 20th of any given month. To get your Social Security Administration benefit of up to $4,873 and collect the payment for that day, you only need to meet these two requirements.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">













</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Upcoming SSA July 2024 Payments</strong></h3>



<p>The <strong>17th and 24th of July, 2024, will see the mailing of the upcoming two Social Security Administration benefits</strong>. This indicates that, if we fulfill certain requirements, we will be eligible to get the benefit on the third or fourth Wednesday. We must have received the benefit since after May 1997 in order to be eligible to receive payment on July 17, 2024.</p>



<p>Having a birthdate between the eleventh and twentieth of any given month is another requirements that has to be fulfilled. On the other hand, the 24th of this month will mark the end of the July benefit payment. For the benefit to be applied on this day, the beneficiary’s birthday must fall between the 21st and the 31st of any given month.</p>





<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New SSI check from SSA in Weeks</strong></h3>



<p>After the July 24th payment is sent by the Social Security Administration, no more payments will be sent this month. That means we won’t be receiving a new check for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) until August. There might be two cases of this additional check in August. On the first of the month, the first payment will be made and on August 30 is when the second of these checks is supposed to be delivered. </p>



<p>Not all Americans will get payment on the same day of mailing, but the Social Security Administration will mail the checks on these two days. If we would want the check to arrive right away, we must enable direct deposit. If not, the money will not appear in our bank account until a few days later. The money will come through sooner or later, in any case.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SSDI July 2024 upcoming payments</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>On July 17, 2024, the SSA will make another payment. This means that if your birthday comes between 11 and 20, you will get money in your bank account provided you are not on SSI, did not receive benefits before to May 1997, and are not on any other programs.</li>



<li>Your next SSDI payment, if you were born after July 20, 2024, will be received on that day. August’s SSDI payouts fall on the second, 14, 21, and 28 and September 3, 11, 18, and 25.</li>



<li>However, average payouts are more regular and reasonable. An SSDI check or direct deposit as of May 2024 will typically pays $1,537.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SSA July Payment 2024 Requirements</strong></h3>



<p>On July 17, 2024, retirees will get their next Social Security Administration payout. The fact that these payments will only benefit a specific group of recipients. There are two things you need to do to get this check. Also a retirement pension from May 1997 onward is also a requirement. On July 17th, only then will we be eligible to receive the payment from the SSA. Remember that to get the payment the same day it is received, Direct Deposit must also be enabled.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">













</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who gets the next payment from SSA?</strong></h3>



<p>The Social Security Administration will send out its next payment on July 17, 2024. This payment is not for every American. We must fulfill a few requirements in order to be eligible for this payment. In order to get this payout, you must:</p>



<ul>
<li>Have a birthday in any month between the 11th and the 20th.</li>



<li>Have been getting benefits from Social Security since after May 1997.</li>
</ul>



<p>The SSA will issue us a check on July 17th if we meet both of the conditions. It is true, though, that not every beneficiary in this group will be able to obtain a check on this specific day because the day a check is received depends on how it is collected.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article about JPMorgan's CFO Jeremy Barnum's conference call:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>No sign of consumer pullback</strong>: Despite cautious results from consumer companies like PepsiCo, JPMorgan's data shows no indication of consumers pulling back due to inflation or election concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer spending is flattish in real terms</strong>: Barnum stated that consumer spending in real terms is "sort of flattish", with booming growth but no significant weakness.</li>
<li><strong>Rotation of spending out of discretionary categories</strong>: JPMorgan's data shows a small trend of consumers shifting their spending away from discretionary categories (e.g. entertainment) and towards more essential goods and services.</li>
<li><strong>Strong consumer backdrop</strong>: Despite economic slowdown, JPMorgan's data indicates a healthy consumer environment, with low unemployment rates, stable GDP growth, and no concerns about consumer debt.</li>
<li><strong>No significance to Jamie Dimon's absence</strong>: Barnum reassured reporters that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's absence from the conference call was simply due to a travel conflict, with no underlying issues or concerns.</li>

Is there anything you're seeing in your debit or credit data that would suggest consumers are pulling back, whether because of inflation or election concerns?</p><p><strong>Barnum:</strong> Short answer is no. So we've made a couple of these points over time, but I'll just reiterate them here. So our broad take is that the consumer spending in real terms is sort of flattish. So I'm seeing booming spending growth, but we're also not seeing, you know, any meaningful weakness there. Like with this data, you can always take a magnifying glass to it and try to go deep, and one of the things that we've seen a little bit in the spending patterns in the lower income segments, you are starting to see a little bit of evidence, some rotation of spending out of discretionary and nondiscretionary, which is traditionally, for obvious reasons, ... understood to be a little bit of a sign of weakness.</p><p>But in a world where the unemployment rate is 4.1% and GDP growth is slowing a little bit, the data that we're seeing on the consumer side is entirely consistent with that economic environment. And the big picture backdrop, whether it's spending or charge-offs or delinquency rates, cash buffers, etc., is still consistent with quite a healthy consumer. You know, it's not a concern at this point.</p><p><strong>Of note:</strong> JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was interestingly not on the call per the usual. We were told it was due to a travel conflict, as he was flying back from an event in Germany. There is nothing more to read into it, Barnum said in response to a reporter's question on Dimon's absence.</p></div></div>

  <p id="IG4T6z">Two years ago, Kroger and Albertsons announced plans to merge into a single company, which would create the second-largest grocery retail chain in the country, behind only Walmart. <a href="https://www.eater.com/23654209/kroger-albertsons-merger-ftc-lawsuit-effects-customers-workers">Critics of the deal</a> have argued that this consolidation would lead to higher prices and reduced pay and benefits for workers, and the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general in Washington and Colorado have sued the grocery giants in hopes of blocking it. In an attempt to get regulators to approve the deal, Kroger and Albertsons <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-albertsons-kroger-reiterate-store-135212354.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAd9V49jMb_JX10tJbHCFFMSBAJHrE2qW91cvJmq17yPZvRwljLKif8JUhVKUMGC_iP5Ign4M_RXELJQAmfZWMRUv6lPzMi2CmPem4vhWIw7ahPP53wwKA1ehKkoNKe92n_cip4RCfgrEt-etBxaqQp6zIZ2IDQEGfk_WpI1ks14&amp;guccounter=2">promised</a> to divest from hundreds of stores to dilute their combined market power.</p>
<p id="tlyhnt">This week they came out with the list of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___et__p_23960851__t_w__d_D&amp;id=66960X1516589&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/07/09/kroger-albertsons-merger-stores-sold-cs-wholesale-list/74346928007/&amp;referrer=eater.com&amp;sref=https://seattle.eater.com/2024/7/12/24196810/kroger-albertsons-merger-grocery-store-sales-seattle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-cdata='{"rewritten_url":"https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___et__p_23960851__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516589\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/07/09/kroger-albertsons-merger-stores-sold-cs-wholesale-list/74346928007/\u0026referrer=eater.com\u0026sref=https://seattle.eater.com/2024/7/12/24196810/kroger-albertsons-merger-grocery-store-sales-seattle","subtag_max_length":50,"subtag_delim_length":3,"subtag_key":"xcust","subtag_data":{"xcust":"___et__p_23960851__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder","id":"66960X1516589","xs":"1","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/07/09/kroger-albertsons-merger-stores-sold-cs-wholesale-list/74346928007/","referrer":"eater.com","sref":"https://seattle.eater.com/2024/7/12/24196810/kroger-albertsons-merger-grocery-store-sales-seattle"},"encode_subtag":false}'>579 stores</a> that would be sold to a New Hampshire–based company called C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers, and it would have a big impact on the Seattle metro area. A whopping 124 stores in Washington — more than any other state — were on the list, including “nearly 70 in the Seattle area,” <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/124-wa-stores-threatened-by-the-kroger-and-albertsons-merger/">reports the <em>Seattle Times</em></a>. That includes 12 QFCs and three Safeways in Seattle, plus more, the paper says:</p>
<blockquote><p id="cmpyXO">Other Seattle-area divested locations include five QFC stores in Bellevue, two QFC stores and three Safeway stores in Tacoma, two Safeway stores and two QFC stores in Kirkland, and three QFC stores and one Safeway store in Redmond. No Fred Meyer locations appear to be on the list of divested stores. </p></blockquote>
<p id="U9Rhkq">The primary concern for shoppers is that these stores will eventually close after being sold. C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers, as its name suggests, is mostly a distributor, though it operates the Piggly Wiggly and Grand Union grocery chains. </p>
<p id="MRz23S">“The divestiture plan ensures no stores will close as a result of the merger and that all frontline associates will remain employed, all existing collective bargaining agreements will continue, and associates will continue to receive industry-leading health care and pension benefits alongside bargained-for wages,” C&amp;S’s strong operational focus coupled with its experienced management team and financial resources will position it to successfully operate divested stores for years to come.</p>
<p id="2cpHWD">Critics of the deal contend that C&amp;S doesn’t have the resources or know-how to effectively run the spun-off Kroger/Albertsons stores and will have to close some — which is what happened a decade ago when Albertsons sold 146 stores to a chain called Haggen, which later filed for bankruptcy and sued Albertsons (unsuccessfully) for <a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1053572/why-grocery-chain-haggen-once-sued-albertsons/">not providing support</a> that it had promised in the deal. </p>

Just upstairs is the chef’s second restaurant — two-Michelin-starred Jônt — which operates as a tasting menu-only restaurant focused on wood-fired Japanese cuisine.</cnx-span></p><hr class="border last"></div></div></div></div><p id="zDw3fg">In a <a href="https://agportal-s3bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/0093_Complaint_AmendRedactions_WA_021224%20%28002%29.pdf?VersionId=m0mkgZNbOms.m8h.qwHNHJVdEmXIVFR8">February court filing</a>, Bob Ferguson, the Washington attorney general, drew a direct comparison between the Haggen fiasco and the proposed sale of stores, writing, “C&amp;S is not a sufficiently established and sophisticated competitor to restore the competition that will be lost if Kroger is permitted to acquire an established, successful competitor like Albertsons.” Ferguson also noted that “because this divestiture proposal disproportionately impacts Washington stores, the failure of this proposed divestiture would be particularly harmful here.”</p>
<p id="YmLdXd">Kroger and Albertsons have pushed back against the idea that the divesture would lead to closures or layoffs. “The divestiture plan ensures no stores will close as a result of the merger and that all frontline associates will remain employed, all existing collective bargaining agreements will continue, and associates will continue to receive industry-leading health care and pension benefits alongside bargained-for wages,” a Kroger spokesperson said in a statement. “C&amp;S’s strong operational focus coupled with its experienced management team and financial resources will position it to successfully operate divested stores for years to come”.</p>
<p id="7rZkj0">But critics say that C&amp;S has not committed to keeping open all the stores it will acquire over the long term. <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/124-wa-stores-threatened-by-the-kroger-and-albertsons-merger/">According to the</a> <em>Seattle Times</em>, when C&amp;S reps met with the United Food and Commercial Workers union, they “refused to affirm the earlier promise by Kroger and Albertsons that no locations would close as a result of the merger.” (C&amp;S did not respond to a request to comment from Eater Seattle.)</p>
<p id="QC2F97">There’s still a chance this merger may not become reality. There are several court dates coming up in the next several months, and the <em>Times </em>reports that some experts think that if the Federal Trade Commission gets an injunction temporarily blocking the deal, Kroger and Albertsons may just abandon it altogether.</p>
<p id="kyLTvX"><em>Update 7/12, 4:13 p.m.: This story has been updated to include comment from Kroger.</em></p>

<li><strong>FAA gives green light to Boeing 777X</strong>: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given its green light to Boeing to begin certification flights for the 777X, its latest wide-body jet.</li>
<li><strong>Long-awaited approval</strong>: This is a long-awaited milestone for Boeing, which has been working on the 777X program for several years. The plane is a major upgrade to Boeing's existing 777 aircraft.</li>
<li><strong>787 delays not repeated</strong>: Boeing has made significant changes to its production process and quality control measures to avoid repeated delays like those experienced with the 787 Dreamliner program.</li>
<li><strong>First flight expected soon</strong>: The first certification flight of the 777X is expected to take place in the coming weeks, followed by a series of test flights to demonstrate the plane's safety and performance.</li>
<li><strong>Airbus rival</strong>: The 777X is seen as a key rival to Airbus's A350 and A350-1000, and its certification will give Boeing a boost in the competitive wide-body jet market. The 777X is expected to be a commercial success, with estimated sales of over 300 aircraft.</li>

In order for that lender to make a profit and reduce risk to itself, it will charge interest on the principal — that is, the amount you borrowed.</p><p>Expressed as a percentage, a mortgage interest rate is essentially the cost of borrowing money. It can vary based on several factors, such as your <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/credit-score-needed-for-mortgage" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>credit score</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/what-is-your-dti-ratio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>debt-to-income ratio</u></a> (DTI), <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/first-time-homebuyer-down-payment-assistance?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>down payment</u></a>, loan amount and repayment term.</p><p>After getting a mortgage, you’ll typically receive an <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/first-time-homebuyers-mortgage-amortization-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>amortization schedule</u></a>, which shows your payment schedule over the life of the loan. It also indicates how much of each payment goes toward the principal balance versus the interest.</p><p>Near the beginning of the loan term, you’ll spend more money on interest and less on the principal balance. As you approach the end of the repayment term, you’ll pay more toward the principal and less toward interest.</p><p>Your mortgage interest rate can be either fixed or adjustable. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the rate will be consistent for the duration of the loan. With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate can fluctuate with the market.</p><p>Keep in mind that a mortgage’s interest rate is not the same as its annual percentage rate (APR). This is because an APR includes both the interest rate and any other lender fees or charges.</p><p>Mortgage rates change frequently — sometimes on a daily basis. Inflation plays a significant role in these fluctuations. Interest rates tend to rise in periods of high inflation, whereas they tend to drop or remain roughly the same in times of low inflation. Other factors, like the economic climate, demand and inventory can also impact the current average mortgage rates.</p><p>To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible’s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score.

Generally, they reserve the lowest rates for low-risk borrowers — that is, those with a higher credit score, income and down payment amount. Here are some other personal factors that may determine your mortgage rate:</p><ul><li>Location of the home</li><li>Price of the home</li><li>Your credit score and credit history</li><li>Loan term</li><li>Loan type (e.g., conventional or FHA)</li><li>Interest rate type (fixed or adjustable)</li><li>Down payment amount</li><li>Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio</li><li>DTI</li></ul><p>Other indirect factors that may determine the mortgage rate include:</p><ul><li>Current economic conditions</li><li>Rate of inflation</li><li>Market conditions</li><li>Housing construction supply, demand, and costs</li><li>Consumer spending</li><li>Stock market</li><li>10-year Treasury yields</li><li>Federal Reserve policies</li><li>Current employment rate</li></ul><h2><a name="how-to-compare-mortgage-rates" id="how-to-compare-mortgage-rates"></a>How to compare mortgage rates</h2><p>Along with certain economic and personal factors, the lender you choose can also affect your mortgage rate. Some lenders have higher average mortgage rates than others, regardless of your credit or financial situation. That’s why it’s important to compare lenders and loan offers.</p><p>Here are some of the best ways to compare mortgage rates and ensure you get the best one:</p><ul><li><strong>Shop around for lenders: </strong>Compare several lenders to find the best rates and lowest fees. Even if the rate is only lower by a few basis points, it could still save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.</li><li><strong>Get several loan estimates: </strong>A loan estimate comes with a more personalized rate and fees based on factors like income, employment, and the property’s location. Review and compare loan estimates from several lenders.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved for a mortgage: </strong><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/mortgage-preapproval?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-approval</a> doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a loan, but it can give you a better idea of what you qualify for and at what interest rate. You’ll need to complete an application and undergo a hard credit check.</li><li><strong>Consider a mortgage rate lock: </strong>A <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/money/lock-or-float-mortgage-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>mortgage rate lock</u></a> lets you lock in the current mortgage rate for a certain amount of time — often between 30 and 90 days. During this time, you can continue shopping around for a home without worrying about the rate changing.</li><li><strong>Choose between an adjustable- and fixed-rate mortgage: </strong>The interest rate type can affect how much you pay over time, so consider your options carefully.</li></ul><p>One other way to compare mortgage rates is with a mortgage calculator. Use a calculator to determine your monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan. Just remember, certain fees like homeowners insurance or taxes might not be included in the calculations.</p><p>Here’s a simple example of what a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might look like versus a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage:</p><h3>15-year fixed-rate</h3><ul><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>$300,000</li><li><strong>Interest rate: </strong>6.29%</li><li><strong>Monthly payment: </strong>$2,579</li><li><strong>Total interest charges: </strong>$164,186</li><li><strong>Total loan amount: </strong>$464,186</li></ul><h3>30-year fixed-rate</h3><ul><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>$300,000</li><li><strong>Interest rate: </strong>6.89%</li><li><strong>Monthly payment: </strong>$1,974</li><li><strong>Total interest charges: </strong>$410,566</li><li><strong>Total loan amount: </strong>$710,565</li></ul><h2><a name="pros-and-cons-of-mortgages" id="pros-and-cons-of-mortgages"></a>Pros and cons of mortgages</h2><p>If you’re thinking about taking out a mortgage, here are some benefits to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Predictable monthly payments: </strong>Fixed-rate mortgage loans come with a set interest rate that doesn’t change over the life of the loan. This means more consistent monthly payments.</li><li><strong>Potentially low interest rates: </strong>With good credit and a high down payment, you could get a competitive interest rate. Adjustable-rate mortgages may also come with a lower initial interest rate than fixed-rate loans.</li><li><strong>Tax benefits: </strong>Having a mortgage could make you eligible for certain tax benefits, such as a <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/mortgage-interest-deduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>mortgage interest deduction</u></a>.</li><li><strong>Potential asset: </strong>Real estate is often considered an asset. As you pay down your loan, you can also build home equity, which you can use for other things like debt consolidation or home improvement projects.</li><li><strong>Credit score boost: </strong>With on-time payments, you can build your credit score.</li></ul><p>And here are some of the biggest downsides of getting a mortgage:</p><ul><li><strong>Expensive fees and interest: </strong>You could end up paying thousands of dollars in interest and other fees over the life of the loan. You will also be responsible for maintenance, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/property-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>property taxes</u></a>, and homeowners insurance.</li><li><strong>Long-term debt: </strong>Taking out a mortgage is a major financial commitment. Typical loan terms are 10, 15, 20, and 30 years.</li><li><strong>Potential rate changes: </strong>If you get an <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/adjustable-rate-mortgage-definition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>adjustable rate</u></a>, the interest rate could increase.</li></ul><h2><a name="how-to-qualify-for-a-mortgage" id="how-to-qualify-for-a-mortgage"></a>How to qualify for a mortgage</h2><p>Requirements vary by lender, but here are the typical steps to qualify for a mortgage:</p><ol><li><strong>Have steady employment and income: </strong>You’ll need to provide proof of income when applying for a home loan. This may include money from your regular job, alimony, military benefits, commissions, or Social Security payments. You may also need to provide proof of at least two years’ worth of employment at your current company.</li><li><strong>Review any assets: </strong>Lenders consider your assets when deciding whether to lend you money. Common assets include money in your bank account or investment accounts.</li><li><strong>Know your DTI: </strong>Your DTI is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward your monthly debts — like installment loans, lines of credit, or rent. The lower your DTI, the better your approval odds.</li><li><strong>Check your credit score: </strong>To get the best mortgage rate possible, you’ll need to have good credit. However, each loan type has a different credit score requirement. For example, you’ll need a credit score of 580 or higher to qualify for an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment.</li><li><strong>Know the property type: </strong>During the loan application process, you may need to specify whether the home you want to buy is your primary residence. Lenders often view a primary residence as less risky, so they may have more lenient requirements than if you were to get a secondary or investment property.</li><li><strong>Choose the loan type: </strong>Many types of mortgage loans exist, including conventional loans, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/va-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>VA loans</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/usda-loans-what-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>USDA loans</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/how-to-use-fha-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>FHA loans</u></a>, and jumbo loans. Consider your options and pick the best one for your needs.</li><li><strong>Prepare for upfront and closing costs: </strong>Depending on the loan type, you may need to make a down payment. The exact amount depends on the loan type and lender. A USDA loan, for example, has no minimum down payment requirement for eligible buyers. With a conventional loan, you’ll need to put down 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI). You may also be responsible for paying any closing costs when signing for the loan.</li></ol><h2><a name="how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage" id="how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage"></a>How to apply for a mortgage</h2><p>Here are the basic steps to apply for a <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/what-is-a-mortgage?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mortgage</a>, and what you can typically expect during the process:</p><ol><li><a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/money/some-of-the-best-mortgage-lenders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Choose a lender</u></strong></a><strong>: </strong>Compare several lenders to see the types of loans they offer, their average mortgage rates, repayment terms, and fees. Also, check if they offer any down payment assistance programs or closing cost credits.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved: </strong>Complete the pre-approval process to boost your chances of getting your dream home. You’ll need identifying documents, as well as documents verifying your employment, income, assets, and debts.</li><li><strong>Submit a formal application: </strong>Complete your chosen lender’s application process — either in person or online — and upload any required documents.</li><li><strong>Wait for the lender to process your loan: </strong>It can take some time for the lender to review your application and make a decision. In some cases, they may request additional information about your finances, assets, or liabilities. Provide this information as soon as possible to prevent delays.</li><li><strong>Complete the closing process: </strong>If approved for a loan, you’ll receive a closing disclosure with information about the loan and any closing costs. Review it, pay the down payment and closing costs, and sign the final loan documents. Some lenders have an online closing process, while others require you to go in person. If you are not approved, you can talk to your lender to get more information and determine how you can remedy any issues.</li></ol><h2><a name="how-to-refinance-a-mortgage" id="how-to-refinance-a-mortgage"></a>How to refinance a mortgage</h2><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/how-to-refinance-mortgage-easy-steps" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Refinancing your mortgage</u></a> lets you trade your current loan for a new one.

	Unless it gets the written consent of Skydance, Paramount is not allowed to enter any joint venture or “omnibus content licensing and/or subscriber acquisition/migration” arrangement involving Paramount+. Per the contract terms, Paramount “shall also consult with Skydance in good faith with respect to any material developments” relating to the negotiations involving a JV arrangement for Paramount+.

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In addition, Paramount may not enter into any new contract with respect to the bundling of Paramount+ with “any of the top seven third-party streaming services (by number of U.S. subscribers)” or do such a deal “outside the ordinary course of business.” Paramount also must get approval to do a deal that would extend the term of an existing streaming distribution contract by more than one year.</p>

	One potential streaming partner for Paramount is Warner Bros. Discovery, which is open to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/max-paramount-plus-warner-bros-discovery-streaming-joint-venture-1236058533/">exploring a combination of Max and Paramount+</a>. </p>

	“We’ve had a bunch of inbound [inquiries] from a number of people about partnerships that could involve a partnership with another player or players. And so we will evaluate all that,” according to Jeff Shell, the RedBird exec and ex-NBCUniversal CEO who is set to become president of Paramount when the deal closes. Shell, speaking on Monday’s presentation for investors, also noted that Paramount’s current management team has “come up with a plan potentially on the international business, which is likely to be executed between now and closing, which we also think will be quite compelling to the cash flow generation of the DTC segment.” </p>

	Chris McCarthy, president and CEO, Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks, at a June 25 town hall meeting for employees <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-ceos-town-hall-layoffs-bankers-asset-sales-1236047993/">said that</a> on the international front, “we are advancing talks with potential partners that will significantly transform the scale and economics of the [streaming] service making it profitable and driving long-term value. This approach could also serve as a model for the U.S.”

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Meanwhile, there are other restrictions spelled out in the agreement. For example, as is customary, neither Skydance nor Paramount is allowed to greenlight “the production, acquisition or financing of any Property” or commit “to produce, acquire or finance any Property” without the other company’s OK. There are some exceptions to the greenlight-approval provision, but what those are remain confidential.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Under agreement with Skydance and financial backer RedBird Capital Partners, the special committee of Paramount’s board of directors has a 45-day go-shop period during which it will be permitted to “actively solicit and evaluate alternative acquisition proposals.” According to Paramount, it “does not intend to disclose developments with respect to the go-shop process unless and until it determines such disclosure is appropriate or is otherwise required.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The go-shop window expires 11:59 p.m. ET on Aug. 21, 2024. If Paramount Global is engaged in talks with a prospective bidder that the board’s special committee for M&amp;A has determined “in good faith is or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,” the company may extend the go-shop period until Sept. 5, 2024.</p>

	<a href="https://variety.com/vip/what-european-box-office-could-teach-hollywood-1236048473/"></a>The “go-shop” provision of the deal was agreed to by the Skydance team in lieu of giving Paramount Global’s nonvoting shareholders approval over the deal, and it’s seemingly intended to minimize the threat of shareholder litigation against the Paramount board and Shari Redstone’s National Amusements Inc., which owns the controlling voting stake in Paramount.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“The special committee [of Paramount’s board] has done a full and exhaustive and fair process to land the transaction with us,” David Ellison, CEO and founder of <a href="https://variety.com/t/skydance-media/" id="auto-tag_skydance-media_1" data-tag="skydance-media">Skydance Media</a>, told Paramount investors in a presentation Monday. “So we believe it’s appropriate… if anybody comes out of the woodwork to give them 45 days to see if that happens.” </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	There’s no sign yet that anyone else will come forward to snatch Paramount away from Skydance. In May, Sony Pictures and private-equity giant Apollo Global Management <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/sony-apollo-paramount-global-acquisition-offer-cash-1235981220/">emerged as prospective bidders for Paramount Global</a> but have since backed off their $26 billion all-cash offer to buy the entire company.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Wells Fargo's net income declined 1% year over year</strong>: The company reported a net income of $4.91 billion in the second quarter of 2024, down from $4.96 billion in the same period last year.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue rose 1% to $20.69 billion</strong>: Wells Fargo's revenue beat analyst expectations of $20.29 billion, driven by an increase in noninterest income.</li>
<li><strong>Net interest income dropped 9% year over year</strong>: The decline was due to the impact of higher interest rates on funding costs, including lower deposit balances and customer migration to higher-yielding products.</li>
<li><strong>Noninterest income increased 19% year over year</strong>: The growth was driven primarily by higher trading revenue in the Markets business, higher investment banking fees, and improved results from venture capital investments.</li>
<li><strong>Average loans fell 3% year over year and 1% sequentially</strong>: Average loans declined due to declines in most loan categories, partially offset by higher credit card loan balances, while average deposits remained stagnant at $1.35 trillion.</li>
