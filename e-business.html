    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Increased tariffs on Chinese EVs</strong>: President Joe Biden has announced plans to quadruple tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) to 100%, up from the current 25% import tax. This move aims to promote American investments and jobs in the EV sector.</li>
<li><strong>Effectiveness of tariffs</strong>: However, experts believe that the increased tariffs will not entirely prevent Chinese automakers from entering the U.S. market. Instead, they may delay the entry of Chinese EVs, but they will eventually come to the U.S.</li>
<li><strong>Chinese automakers' quality improvement</strong>: In recent years, Chinese automakers have improved the quality of their vehicles, thanks to subsidies from the Chinese government to grow domestic production. This has led to a decline in market share for global automakers, such as General Motors, in the Chinese market.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for loopholes</strong>: The tariff increase may not entirely eliminate Chinese imports, as some manufacturers may circumvent the tariffs by assembling vehicles in other countries, such as Mexico, and then importing them to the U.S.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Western automakers</strong>: Experts advise Western automakers to prepare to compete with Chinese manufacturers or risk being left behind. This requires Western companies to "up their game" and focus on developing competitive products to rival Chinese automakers.</li>

It also does nothing to address current or future gas-powered vehicles imported from the Communist country to the U.S.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>Automotive and trade experts say the increased tariffs are a near-term protectionism act that may delay but won’t stop Chinese automakers from coming to the U.S. with EVs.</p><p>“They’re going to be here.

For example, a small EV from Warren Buffett-backed BYD called the Seagull <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/22/byd-seagull-ev-puts-global-auto-execs-politicians-on-edge.html">starts at around $10,000</a> and reportedly banks a profit for the increasingly influential Chinese automaker.</p><p>Though the Seagull isn’t yet sold on U.S. soil, BYD is expanding its vehicles globally, and some believe it’s only a matter of time before more China-made vehicles arrive in the U.S.</p><p>Even with the new 100% tariff, its pricing would likely be in line with or better than many EVs currently on sale in the U.S.</p><p>“Ultimately, we think protectionism from the West could remain a near-term overhang for Chinese EV/parts makers aiming for rapid global expansion, but we think it is unlikely to halt China’s EV push in the long run,” Morgan Stanley analyst Tim Hsiao said in an investor note this week.</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Read more CNBC news on Chinese EVs</h2></div></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>Though some automakers currently import gas-powered vehicles from China into the U.S., the numbers are small.

The company, in a statement, said it is “currently evaluating the announcement of tariff increases from the Biden Administration,” saying it believes “free trade is essential to speed up the transition to more sustainable mobility through increased EV adoption.”</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline1"></a>Green goals</h2><div class="group"><p>Biden’s focus on China-made EVs — and the exclusion of gas-powered vehicles in the higher levies — fits with the White House’s clean energy agenda, which has emphasized electric vehicle production and adoption as well as enhanced U.S. charging infrastructure.</p><p>“EVs are where we’re focused in terms of placing tariffs, because that’s where we’ve made hundreds of billions of dollars of public investments. We’ve made those investments to build resilience in our clean technology supply chains. And so that’s our focus here,” a senior administration official told reporters this week.</p><p>It’s possible U.S. officials are taking a warning sign from Europe, where Chinese automakers have quickly flooded markets with gas-saving EVs and undercut domestic automakers.</p><p>Chinese companies accounted for 8% of Europe’s all-electric vehicle sales as of September and could increase their share to 15% by 2025, the European Union said in October 2023. The EU believes Chinese EVs are undercutting the prices of local models by about 20%.</p><p>The Biden administration’s new EV tariffs could have a ripple effect on other countries, including in Europe, if they’re successful in stemming Chinese exports, according to Coco Zhang, vice president of ESG research at ING Group.</p><p>She said similar tariffs elsewhere could force Chinese companies to move more quickly to establish local production operations or joint ventures with other companies in an attempt to lower export costs.</p><p>“From China’s perspective, if there can be supply or other sorts of partnerships, they can still find their way going into the U.S. market,” Zhang said.</p><p>Such moves would be reminiscent of how Japanese automakers such as Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor as well as South Korea’s Hyundai Motor, including Kia Motors, entered the U.S. market in recent decades.</p><p><em>– CNBC’s Rebecca Picciotto and Michael Bloom contributed to this report.</em></p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-2"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Don’t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO</h2></div></div></div></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

            However, April’s report did show some slight progress on what’s been the biggest Achilles heel: Shelter inflation eased to 5.5%, its lowest annual rate since May 2022.

            Housing costs “have been a pretty persistent area of pain over the past several years,” John Sedunov, professor of finance and real estate at Villanova University, told CNN.

            The housing component of the CPI has proved frustrating for economists and other observers because the government’s measurement of shelter costs come with a considerable lag. Private sector sources of real estate data have shown a cooling rental market.
    </p>

            When taking those housing costs out of the equation, a closely watched “supercore” index measuring services inflation that excludes shelter costs rose just 0.2% for the month, its slowest pace since last summer.

            The Federal Reserve has been wanting to see meaningful process on inflation before it starts trimming back interest rates. Those rates are at a 23-year high following an aggressive, yearslong rate-hiking campaign by the central bank to throw water on smoldering demand and tame decades-high inflation.

            “The last month or two had looked like maybe the improvement was stalling, and this [report] looks like it’s continuing at a slow pace,” Erica Groshen, a former BLS commissioner who serves as senior economics adviser at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CNN.

            “Potentially, that’s an indication of consumers getting tapped out,” Sedunov said. “At the end of the day, that retail softening is an indicator that maybe there’s going to be less pressure on prices in certain areas going forward, which could have a continuing moderating effect on inflation.”

	<a href="https://deadline.com/tag/netflix/" id="auto-tag_netflix" data-tag="netflix">Netflix</a>‘s 18-month-old <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/advertising/" id="auto-tag_advertising" data-tag="advertising">advertising</a> tier has nearly doubled in size since the start of 2024, reaching 40 million monthly active users around the world.</p>





<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The streaming giant revealed the number at its first in-person upfronts presentation in New York. Last year, in a presentation conducted in a virtual format due to the WGA strike, the company said it had 5 million MAUs, and the number grew to 23 million by January.</p>






<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Netflix President of Advertising Amy Reinhard told the crowd that 40% of all signups now come from the ads plan in countries where it is available. Pricing plays a role in that – at $7 a month, the plan is well below many other services and the company’s own ad-free options. It is also cheaper for an account holder to sign up to a new ad-supported account rather than pay to share their password.

	</p>
<p></p>





<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	After insisting for years that they would never accept advertising, citing privacy concerns and other factors, Netflix execs hastily announced their reversal on an earnings call in 2022. Microsoft was enlisted as a partner to help ramp up the capability, which reached the market in select territories later that year in a remarkable sprint from first public disclosure to first ad served.

</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Despite the bumpy start, advertising has come to be embraced by the company (and many bulls on Wall Street) as a key strategic initiative. As it has developed its ad tier, Netflix has also stocked it with live programming, from comedy to award shows to sports. Earlier Wednesday, Netflix and the NFL <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/netflix-nfl-christmas-day-games-streaming-1235917212/">announced</a> that the streaming giant would carry two Christmas Day games this season, and at least one holiday contest in two seasons after that.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In addition to the stats, Reinhard announced Netflix will launch an in-house ad tech platform. This will give advertisers new ways to buy, new insights to leverage, and new ways to measure impact. </p>





<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Bringing our ad tech in-house will allow us to power the ads plan with the same level of excellence that’s made Netflix the leader in streaming technology today,” she said.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria unveiled a number of new film and TV titles, but she also spent time giving advertisers a sense of audience engagement. More than 70% of Netflix’s ad-supported subscribers watch for more than 10 hours a month, according to Nielsen, a 15% higher level of viewing than the nearest competitor.

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Our audiences are highly engaged — and by engaged I mean that they are choosing to spend their time watching Netflix,” she said. “That’s important because engagement is the key to success in streaming. When people watch our shows and movies, they get more value from Netflix, they stick around longer, and they’re more likely to recommend us to their friends. And this matters to all of you because you want to be where the audiences are, too.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Peter Naylor, Vice President of Advertising Sales, closed the presentation on a final, upbeat note. “There’s a lot to be excited about over the next year,” he said. “But the story of ads on Netflix this year is pretty simple: It’s about growth and momentum.”</p>

<li>Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) and 15 Republican senators are introducing a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to overturn a new rule issued by the Labor Department, which updates the definition of an investment advice fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.</li>

The New York Fed called attention to America’s “maxed-out borrowers” in a<a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2024/05/delinquency-is-increasingly-in-the-cards-for-maxed-out-borrowers/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"> report</a> this week.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Credit card balances, and attendant delinquencies, have been rising steadily since late 2021, a sharp reversal from the historic lows recorded at the pandemic’s peak. Delinquencies have risen past pre-pandemic levels, the Fed reports.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Maxed-out cardholders are far more likely to miss payments. Borrowers who became delinquent in early 2024 had a median “utilization rate” of 90% on their cards: On average, they were pretty much maxed out.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“This makes sense,” the Fed report states, “since using practically all of your available credit could indicate a tight cash-flow situation.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>Learn more:</strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":body nav (cc)|e|auto spike click:6|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a" href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/credit-cards/best-credit-cards/">Best credit cards of 2023</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The nation’s collective credit-card balance stands at<a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"> $1.12 trillion</a>, near a record high, the Fed reports.

In the first quarter of 2024, 6.9% of credit card balances fell into “<a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2024/20240514#:~:text=Annualized%2C%20approximately%208.9%25%20of%20credit,auto%20loans%20transitioned%20into%20delinquency." data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">serious delinquency</a>,” 90 or more days late, according to Fed data, up from 4.6% in early 2023.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The overall credit-card delinquency rate<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"> was 3.1%</a> at the end of 2023, the highest level since 2011.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“There’s no question that people are leaning more on their cards to help them as prices continue to rise,” said<a href="https://www.mattschulz.com/about/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"> Matt Schulz</a>, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. “It also isn’t surprising that we’re seeing delinquencies increase.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Younger Americans are more likely to be maxed out. According to the new Fed report, the share of maxed-out cardholders varies by generation: 4.8% for boomers, 9.6% for Gen X, 12.1% for millennials and 15.3% for Gen Z.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Those figures do not include delinquent cardholders. Add them in, and the numbers get bigger. Among all borrowers, current and delinquent, 18% of cardholders are maxed out.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Higher “max-out” rates for younger cardholders are partly a matter of credit limits: Younger borrowers have lower ones. The median credit limit for Gen Z is $4,500, the Fed says, compared with $16,300 for millennials.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Lower limits make it easier to max out,” Schulz said.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/media/2022/07/19/USATODAY/usatsports/imageForEntry3-HOc.jpg?width=660&amp;height=372&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/media/2022/07/19/USATODAY/usatsports/imageForEntry3-HOc.jpg?width=1320&amp;height=744&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="For borrowers who can’t keep up, there has probably never been a worse time to own a credit card."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="For borrowers who can’t keep up, there has probably never been a worse time to own a credit card." data-c-credit="Bernie_photo / IStock Via Getty Images"></p></figure><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Credit-card interest rates: 'from bad to worse'</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">For borrowers who can’t keep up, there has probably never been a worse time to own a credit card.

Prices have risen steadily in the past few years. Inflation peaked at a 40-year high of 9.1% in mid-2022. Inflation<a href="/story/money/2024/05/15/cpi-report-april-inflation-data/73687727007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"> eased to 3.4%</a> in April but remains a drag on the American consumer.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Nearly half of all credit card holders carry balances from month to month, Bankrate has found in<a href="https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/chasing-rewards-in-debt/#insights" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"> recent surveys</a>.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In other words, at least half of all credit-card customers are not experiencing the credit-card crisis. The interest rate doesn’t matter if you pay the balance off at month’s end.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“For those who pay in full, life is great. They get rewards, they get buyer’s protections, they get convenience,” Rossman said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Do you have credit-card debt or not?

A higher limit means you’re using less of your available credit, a metric that can raise your credit score.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">If you fear you lack the discipline to stop using your maxed-out card, maybe it’s time to get old-school.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“I would say, put the card away,” said<a href="https://www.greenbeeadvisory.com/about" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"> Catherine Valega</a>, a certified financial planner in Boston. “Hide it.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Meme stocks, a type of stock that rises in value due to social media hype rather than traditional financial fundamentals, experienced a sharp decline in value. Shares of companies like GameStop, AMC Entertainment, BlackBerry, and Virgin Galactic plummeted by up to 20% in value.</li>
<li>The sudden decline is attributed to the expectation that the hype around these stocks will fade, and investors will quickly sell their shares, causing prices to drop further.</li>
<li>Meme stocks are considered high-risk investments because they are often driven by social media sentiment rather than traditional financial metrics like growth and profits. These companies may also face challenges in their core businesses, adding to the risks for small investors.</li>
<li>GameStop, a video game retailer, has struggled to grow and recorded a net loss of $331.1 million in its fiscal year 2023, while AMC Entertainment reported a loss of $135 million in the first quarter of 2024.</li>
<li>Experts warn that meme stocks tend to be volatile, with large swings in value, and may not be suitable for small investors who are trying to make a profit.</li>

    <div><section class="content__body"><p>Investor appetite for "meme stocks" may already be waning. </p><p>The shares of GameStop, AMC Entertainment, BlackBerry and other companies embraced by retail traders plunged on Wednesday.</p><p>After soaring more than 130% earlier this week, GameStop shares plunged 19 to $32.44 in Wednesday trading. AMC, a theater chain, shed 20%; business software maker BlackBerry fell 6.4%; and Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson's space flight company, tumbled 17%.</p>    
  <p>The stocks had surged the previous day after Keith Gill, known online by his handle "Roaring Kitty," resurfaced on X (formerly Twitter) after a three-year hiatus. Gill, who has a large following on social media platforms, became the face of meme stock traders in 2021 after he bought shares of GameStop, a video game retailers, for $53,000 and turned it into a multi-million stake amid growing hype around the stock. </p><p>But meme stocks carry risks for small investors hoping to make a profit because such shares tend to be volatile, with large swings in either direction, experts have cautioned.</p>

<p>"People are only buying because they believe more people will come in and buy after them, so they can sell at a higher price to those new buyers," noted Cory Mitchell, an analyst with Trading.biz, in an email. "The stock may go higher in the short-term, but unless the company has a massive turnaround whatever rally develops will be followed by swift and severe selling."</p><h2><strong>What are meme stocks?</strong></h2><p>Meme stocks are companies whose shares are lifted by social media buzz rather than traditional financial fundamentals such as growth and profits. Meme stocks are typically unprofitable or face challenges in their core businesses, which add to the risks for small investors, experts added. </p><p>GameStop has struggled to grow, with the company recording a net loss of $331.1 million on revenue of $5.9 billion for its fiscal year 2023, compared with a loss of $381.3 million on revenue of $6 billion the previous year, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ.</p><p>"The company appeared to lose significant market share for hardware and software (in particular) in the fourth quarter, as it underperformed modest industry growth by a wide margin," Wedbush analysts said in a research note.</p>

However, they’ve <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/30/business/gas-prices-inflation-oil/index.html">started to cool</a> in recent weeks.

            Spending was also higher at clothing and accessory stores (+1.6%), food and beverage stores (+0.8%) as well as at restaurants and bars (+0.2%).

            Almost all other sectors saw monthly declines in spending. The biggest decline was online retail sales, which fell by 1.2% last month. That’s a significant development given online sales have been a bright spot in prior months.

            Wednesday’s retail report is another piece of evidence that the economy is slowing. That’s good in the sense that it doesn’t give retailers the ability to pass along higher prices to consumers if they aren’t willing to accept them, which had previously been the case.

    <div><section class="content__body"><p><em>Washington </em>— A pair of brothers from New York and Boston were taken into federal custody Tuesday, accused by prosecutors of devising a novel criminal scheme to steal about $25 million in cryptocurrency from a commonly used blockchain, according to a newly unsealed indictment. </p><p>Anton and James Peraire-Bueno were charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Investigators accused them of spending months plotting their theft within the Ethereum blockchain, baiting their victims and establishing shell companies to hide their illicit profits. </p><p>According to charging documents, the pair studied math and computer science "at one of the most prestigious universities in the country," which prosecutors said afforded them a unique set of skills that allowed them to carry out the first-of-its-kind endeavor in a matter of seconds. James Peraire-Bueno is listed as a <a href="https://commencement.mit.edu/sites/default/files/MIT.Commencement.Program2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">2021 graduate</a> of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the MIT Registrar's Office confirmed that Anton Peraire-Bueno earned a B.S. in computer science and engineering in February 2024, and James Peraire-Bueno earned a B.S. in mathematics, computer science and aerospace engineering in June 2019, as well as a M.S. in aeronautics and astronautics in June 2021.</p>    
  <p>The brothers allegedly started laying the groundwork in December 2022, engaging in what investigators called a "baiting" operation that targeted three specific victim traders on the digital Ethereum platform. They are specifically accused of exploiting the "validators" on the blockchain, vital components of the integrity and security of transactions. </p><p>"In doing so, they fraudulently gained access to pending private transactions and used that access to alter certain transactions and obtain their victims' cryptocurrency," prosecutors alleged in court documents. </p>

<p>Investigators said the defendants' plot took months to plan but just 12 seconds to execute, allegedly raking in approximately $25 million from their unwitting victims. </p><p>From April and June of last year, Peraire-Buenos are accused of laundering their money through shell companies. Prosecutors said the duo even rejected repeated requests from a victim, the victim's attorney and an Ethereum representative to return the cryptocurrency. </p><p>They were arrested on Tuesday and are expected to make their initial appearances in New York and Boston federal courts on Wednesday. </p><p>"As cryptocurrency markets continue to evolve, the Justice Department will continue to root out fraud, support victims, and restore confidence to these markets," Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. </p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The housing market is being pressured by the high mortgage rate of over 7%. Purchase applications have dropped 2% from the previous week, and home builder sentiment has fallen to its lowest level since January.</li>
<li>The recent fall in yields is giving a boost to home builders, with the ITB index rising. Wells Fargo has even hiked its price target to $150 a share for Toll Brothers.</li>
<li>Mortgage rate expert Matt Graham believes that a 1% drop in rates would be significant and would help both purchase and refinance applications. He also thinks that as long as rates remain below 7%, people will feel that it's not the worst thing.</li>
<li>Graham notes that people have become more accustomed to the higher rate range and that the market has acclimated to the current environment. However, he remains cautious and believes that there could be a false start in the rate decline if rates don't break above the previous high.</li>
<li>The larger takeaway is that as long as rates remain steady, people will be less likely to buy or sell homes, leaving home builders to pick up the slack and try to stimulate the market.</li>

    MORE SIGNS OF THAT SEVEN PLUS  PERCENT MORTGAGE RATE PRESSURING HOUSING. PURCHASE APPLICATIONS FOR THE  WEEK ENDING MAY 10 DROPPED 2%  FROM THE WEEK PRIOR.

COULD THIS STATUS QUO REMAIN THE STATUS QUO FOR QUITE SOMETIME? >> IT'S HARD TO SAY WHEN IT  COMES TO HOME BUILDING. I'M MORE OF A RATES GUY, SO I  THINK IF WE DO GET SOME RELIEF  IN RATES, IT WILL HELP BOTH  SIDES OF THE SPECTRUM, PURCHASES AND REFINANCES. >> WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER A TEN  BASIS POINT DROP OR SOMETHING  MORE SIGNIFICANT? >> I THINK SOMETHING LIKE A 1%  DROP. WE'VE SEEN MORE THAN TEN BASIS  POINTS JUST TODAY AFTER THE CPI  DATA. >> I THINK AS LONG AS WE GET  BELOW 7% AT THIS POINT, PEOPLE  FEEL LIKE IT'S NOT THE WORST  THING. >> PEOPLE HAVE DEFINITELY  ACCLIMATED TO THIS NEW RATE  RANGE. WHEN WE FIRST GOT TO THIS RANGE, IT REALLY SHUT OFF VOLUME  QUICKLY. NOW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT RATES ARE HIGHER, AND PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BUY ARE BUYING. >> I LIKE HOW YOU SAID MORE  BROADLY, WE HAVE SEEN THIS  BEFORE. PEOPLE STARTING TO CELEBRATE,  MORTGAGE RATES ARE GOING DOWN. WE'VE SEEN THREE FALSE STARTS IN THAT DIRECTION ALREADY. DO YOU THINK THIS COULD BE  ANOTHER? >> IT'S SORT OF IN PROGRESS,  RIGHT? IT DEPENDS HOW YOU WANT TO  DEFINE A FALSE START. IF WE DEFINE IT AS EARLY 2024  WITH RATES MOVING BACK UP AFTER  A REALLY NICE IMPROVEMENT AT THE END OF 2023, YES, IT'S A FALSE  START. BUT THERE'S A CASE TO BE MADE  THAT YOU WANT TO SET A LINE WITH THE PREVIOUS HIGH. AND YOU ONLY SAY, WELL, IT WAS A FALSE START IF RATES BREAK BACK  ABOVE THAT PREVIOUS HIGH, WHICH  THEY HAVEN'T DONE YET. I THINK THERE'S A CHANCE ANY WAY THAT LATE 2023'S HIGHS IN  OCTOBER SPECIFICALLY, COULD BE  SORT OF A HIGH WATER MARK THAT  WAS DRIVEN BY A LITTLE BIT OF  EXCESSIVE DEFENSIVENESS AND  FEAR. ALL THAT IS PREDICATED ON THE  HOPE THAT INFLATION, CORE  INFLATION STAYS BELOW A MONTHLY  RATE OF 0.3, 0.2, AND IN THAT  CASE, WE ARE DEFINITELY SEEN THE HIGHS IN LATE 2023. >> THE LARGER TAKEAWAY IS AS  LONG AS RATES REMAIN WHERE THEY  ARE, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO STAY  PUT IN THEIR EXISTING HOMES, AND THAT LEAVES THE HOME BUILDERS TO PICK UP THE SLACK. I DON'T THINK, LIKE YOU SAID, IT WOULD TAKE A BIG MOVE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER TO BREAK US OUT OF  THAT LONG-TERM TREND. >> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. HOME BUILDERS HAS BEEN THE ONLY  GAME IN TOWN WITH RATE WHERE IS  THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. AND THERE'S BEEN INCREASING  PREDISPOSITION FOR PEOPLE WITH  SUPER LOW RATES TO HOLD ONTO  THOSE RHOMES, EVEN IF THEY MOVE. SO THAT PUTS CONSTATEMENTS ON  INVENTORY AND PUSHES THE BALL  BACK INTO HOME BUILDER'S COURT. >> AS ELECTION SEASON HEATS UP,  I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED TO HEAR  ABOUT BRINGING HOUSING COSTS  DOWN ORE MAKE IT MORE  AFFORDABLE, THOSE KINDS OF  THINGS. ARE YOU HEARING ANYTHING LIKE  THAT? IS THE MARKET HEARING ANYTHING  LIKE THAT? >> THERE ARE A FEW SORT OF -- I  WOULD SAY IT WOULD BE  INCONSEQUENTIAL THINGS FLOATING  AROUND.

THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CRITICISMS  OF UP-FRONT MORTGAGE COSTS,  WHICH IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IN  A ROUND ABOUT WAY, THE  GOVERNMENT IS DRIVING SOME OF  THE THINGS THAT CREATE THOSE  UP-FRONT COSTS. YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY HARD TO  IMMEDIATELY AND QUICKLY ALTER  THE COST OF FINANCING A HOME  WITH GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES  UNLESS THAT INITIATIVE IS  SOMEHOW GUARANTEEING A LOWER  INTEREST RATE. >> RIGHT. THAT LEAVES US WITH JUST THE TWO ADJUSTMENTS OR TWO LEVERS TO  PULL, WHICH IS THE PRICE  OVERALL, AND THE COST OF  BORROWING IN ORDER TO FUND THAT. SO IF YOU LOOK OUT INTO THE  PLAYBOOK FOR THE FALL, AS THE  MARKET STARTS TO THINK ABOUT  WHETHER THE FED IS GOING TO CUT  IN SENT, OR MAYBE DECEMBER AS WE JUST HEARD, HOW DO YOU THINK  THAT WILL AFFECT MORTGAGE RATES? >> YEAH, I THINK THAT MORTGAGE  RATES WILL LEAD THE WAY, IF THEY SENSE THAT THE ECONOMIC DATA IS  GOING TO GIVE THE FED THE GREEN  LIGHT. IT'S NOT JUST MORTGAGE RATES,  BUT TREASURY YIELDS, OTHER  LONG-TERM DEBT THAT TRADES, YOU  KNOW, MOMENT TO MOMENT, OPPOSED  TO THE FED. THE MARKET DOES A GOOD JOB OF  GETTING AHEAD OF THAT. WE'LL SEE LONG-TERM RATES MOVE  LOWER EVEN THOUGH THE FED IS  MOVING T
