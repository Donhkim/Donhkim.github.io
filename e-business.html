<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>US Economy Adds Jobs</strong>: The US economy added 206,000 new jobs in June, marking the 42nd consecutive month of job growth. However, unemployment rate inched up to 4.1%, the highest level in over two years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Government Hiring Boosts Jobs</strong>: Government hiring accounted for more than a third of the new jobs added in June, followed by healthcare, social assistance, and construction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cooling Labor Market</strong>: Job gains in April and May were revised downward by over 100,000 jobs, indicating a slowing labor market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fed Rate Hikes</strong>: The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in response to inflation concerns, and the market is waiting to see if the Fed will continue to raise rates or pause due to cooling job growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Debates</strong>: The market is divided on whether the recent job growth numbers indicate a need for rate cuts or not. Some argue that the good news will keep the Fed on hold, while others believe the Fed may use this opportunity to slow down the economy.</p>

            <p><strong>Amna Nawaz:</strong></p>
            <p>Today, President Joe Biden is digging in. In more than one appearance today, he underscored that he has no plans to leave the campaign, despite calls from some Democrats and supporters. We will have more on that story later in the program.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. economy added more jobs than expected last month, marking the 42nd consecutive month of job growth; 206,000 new jobs were added in June. Government hiring accounted for more than a third of those, followed by health care, social assistance and construction. Unemployment also inched up to 4.1 percent, making it the first time it's risen above 4 percent in more than two years.</p><p>And there were other signs of a cooling labor market. Job gains in April and may were revised downward by more than 100,000 jobs.</p><p>For a deeper look at what this means for the economy, I'm joined by Roben Farzad, host of public radio's "Full Disclosure."</p><p>Roben, always good to see you.</p><p>So what do these numbers say to you? Is it a sign that the economy may be cooling?</p><p>Roben Farzad, Host, "Full Disclosure": Certainly, market watchers have been looking for that, econ watchers, for the longest time, because the Fed had to ratchet up rates after its error, I think, coming out of the pandemic and leaving rates too low for too long, and so still in the process, I think, of mopping up inflation.</p><p>But it's odd. Are you rooting for good news? Yes, if you're the White House. Are you rooting for bad news? Maybe if you're investors or traders. And yet the market is at an all-time high. Real estate is at an all-time high. Crypto is looking puff.</p><p>So it's a real debate on Wall Street. Do we even need rate cuts? Maybe the Fed just needs an excuse to maybe take down a little and wait and see.</p>

                                        <p>CHICAGO (AP) — Part of the experience of a NASCAR race is hearing the engine roar, the rumble of each car’s approach and the zip when it whizzes past at more than 150 mph.</p><p>NASCAR unveiled its first electric racecar Saturday in downtown Chicago, but it doesn’t thunder when the grand marshal says “drivers, start your engines.”</p><p>It hums. </p><p>The top motorsports series in North America partnered with Chevrolet, Ford, Toyota and electrification company ABB to demonstrate a high-performance electric vehicle and gauge fan interest in electric racing. </p><p>They want to represent electric vehicles, and more broadly electrification, in racing as cool, fun and accessible, said Riley Nelson, NASCAR’s head of sustainability. </p><p>The Associated Press got a first look at the $1.5 million prototype. The only person who has driven it so far is semi-retired NASCAR driver David Ragan. The plan is to put the car on the Chicago street course for some fast laps on Sunday morning.</p>
    

<p>Ragan said the sound and smell were unlike anything he has experienced since first hitting the racetrack at age 11. He could hear squealing tires. He could smell the brakes. In gasoline-powered cars, the engine’s sound and smell and heat from the exhaust overpower everything else. But after hundreds of laps, this time Ragan’s ears weren’t ringing. It was really wild, he said.</p>



<p>Unlike typical sports coupes, the new car is actually a crossover utility vehicle. A huge wing on the back makes it aerodynamic enough to be a racecar. </p>
    
<p>It accelerates almost twice as fast as top gas-powered racecars and can stop almost immediately. But its lap time at Martinsville Speedway in Virginia was two-tenths of a second slower because it takes the corners slower due to being heavier. Ragan said it may go even faster; he wasn’t pushing the one-of-a-kind vehicle to its limits. Risk-taking is for racing, not testing, he said.</p>
    

<p>Eric Warren, who heads global motorsports competition for General Motors, said market research showed more than half of avid NASCAR fans surveyed would be more interested in purchasing an electric vehicle if they were exposed to it through racing. A main message is taking care with energy and optimizing it, he said. </p><p>“We’re committed to electric vehicles,” Warren said. “Racing gives a great platform to discuss a lot of those concepts and educate fans. It’s a laboratory for us to try some new technologies and learn as we educate.”</p><p>Burning gas pollutes the air and produces carbon dioxide, which warms the atmosphere and leads to more extreme weather. Burning one gallon produces about 19 pounds of carbon dioxide, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Racing events consume thousands of gallons in a weekend.</p><p>The event would certainly be quieter with more electric cars, though many fans love the roar of engines when the green flag drops.</p><p>A group of kids, including the children of ABB employees, pulled the cover off the car as part of the unveiling before Saturday’s NASCAR Xfinity Series stop. Dean Radejewski, 16, of Chicago, stopped to check out the car as he made his way through the area near Buckingham Fountain.</p>
    

<p>“I think it’s pretty cool that they’re stepping into the newer age, where all the stuff’s going electric,” Radejewski said. “I feel like it’s going to be maybe a bit more reliable, maybe a bit safer, too, since less fuel to light on fire.”</p><p>Radejewski also was intrigued by the possibility of a NASCAR EV series.</p><p>“It would be more racing to watch,” he said. “So even better.”</p><p>If NASCAR pursues electric racing, John Probst, NASCAR senior vice president and chief racing development officer said he thinks they could reinvent the fan experience. One option could be a DJ. </p><p>“It’s our goal to entertain our fans,” he said. “If our fans tell us this is what they want to see, we know how to create a racing series around pretty much anything.”</p><p>NASCAR is not the first motorsports organization to get into electric car racing. Formula E is an all-electric racing series that started a decade ago. But its fan base is far smaller than NASCAR’s. </p>
    

<p>The new car is part of a broader sustainability plan by NASCAR. ABB is now NASCAR’s official electrification partner. It will help NASCAR bring in more electricity from renewable sources. </p><p>NASCAR also owns 15 tracks around the U.S., many along major thoroughfares. ABB plans to install its electric-vehicle charging stations at those tracks and connect them to the grid. They will be compatible with regular electric cars and available for anyone to use, not just racegoers. </p><p>By 2028, NASCAR says it will introduce sustainable racing fuel, recycle at all events and use 100% renewable electricity at facilities and tracks it owns. By 2035, it aims to cut operating emissions to “net zero.” </p><p>That’s why the number 35 appears on the black, white and red car, along with ABB. The auto body is made from plant-based materials, a flax-based composite by the Swiss company Bcomp, rather than the typical carbon fiber composite. </p>
    

<p>NASCAR is also exploring racing with cars that run on hydrogen. IMSA, the sports car series owned by NASCAR, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/sports-automobile-racing-daytona-beach-3f21aa36dd7f42b1c1b6f13d7cfe0e41">switched to hybrid engines in 2023</a></span>.

Formula 1 plans to use sustainable fuel in all cars starting in 2026 as part of new engine regulations. </p><p>Ford Performance, on its own, built eight cutting-edge electric demonstration vehicles in four years. </p><p>“Fans want to have some connection or relationship to the racecar,” said Mark Rushbrook, global director of Ford Performance Motorsports. “As more and more customers are buying all-electric vehicles, there will be, we believe, a growing number of people that want to watch full electric racing.”</p><p>U.S. electric vehicle sales overall rose 7% during the first half of the year, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/auto-sales-prices-second-quarter-1b2b789a695b6265475ad804bf8be069">according to preliminary tallies Tuesday</a></span> by Motorintelligence.com. EVs accounted for 7.6% of the U.S. new vehicle market, about the same as it was for all of last year. </p><p>ABB Executive Vice President Michael Plaster hopes kids who see the new car at NASCAR events will ask questions about moving toward a future that runs on clean electricity, and may one day want to work on electrical products and solutions. ABB is investing billions to grow its U.S. business.</p><p>“As far as getting interest and attention, and having the forum to talk about this whole energy transition, I can’t think of a better way to do it,” Plaster said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>McDermott reported from Providence, R.I.

<p>In late June, Mt. Gox trustees announced the exchange, which collapsed 10 years ago, would begin distributing almost $10 billion worth of funds in bitcoin, bitcoin cash and fiat currency to its creditors in early July.</p>
<p><em>07/06 update: The bitcoin price crash has found a floor, with the broader crypto market rebounding slightly after its steep sell-off this week. </em></p>
<p><em>However, traders and analysts remain fearful the bitcoin price crash could send ethereum, XRP, solana and other major cryptocurrencies lower. </em></p>
<p><em>The widely-followed Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index, created by data site Alternative.me, has dropped to its lowest level since January 2023, just after the bitcoin price had crashed to just $17,000 in the aftermath of the FTX crypto exchange implosion, and is now teetering on the verge of "extreme fear."</em></p>
<p><em>"The crypto market cap has fallen back below $2 trillion, accelerating its decline and losing over 8%, while many altcoins have suffered double-digit losses within the last 24 hours," Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, said in emailed comments that called the bitcoin price crash "terrifying."</em></p>
<p><em>Bitcoin's "200-day moving average failed to act as support, and we saw an acceleration in the sell-off after a break below this line," Kuptsikevich wrote, adding the ethereum price "situation looks like a pause before a new downward impulse that could take the price back to $2,300."</em></p>

<p>"The direction of bitcoin in the coming days will be determined by the selling pressure from Mt. Gox users," Rachel Lin, the chief executive of decentralized exchange SynFutures, said in emailed comments.</p>
<p>"The market expects most Mt. Gox users dump their tokens, but we might see a bounce back if the selling is lower than anticipated. On the other hand, if there is enough selling to push the price lower, we might be looking at the $50,000 level soon."</p>
<p>Lin warned the "crucial levels" for bitcoin and ethereum were $60,000 and $3,350, respectively—both of which have now been "decisively" broken.</p>

<p>Summer is still in full swing and there’s so much to look forward to, including a BIG sale happening on July 7th.</p>
<p><span id="more-715236"></span></p>

<p>If you love Target as much as we do, then you’ll want to mark July 7th on your calendar because <strong>Target will be hosting its annual Circle Week sale.</strong> The sale includes HUGE savings on several items, including Disney merch! We were able to take a sneak peek at what will be included in the sale, and we are excited to get our online shopping ON.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-715242 aligncenter" src="https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-094048-700x217.png" alt="" srcset="https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-094048-700x217.png 700w, https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-094048-300x93.png 300w, https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-094048-768x238.png 768w, https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-094048.png 1201w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>During the sale, select <strong>fragrances, skincare &amp; sun care products will be 20% off</strong>. This is a great deal, especially if you’re planning an upcoming trip to Disney World because, as you may already know, sunscreen and lotion are essential to beat the hot Florida heat. Also, who doesn’t love a new perfume to pack with you?</p>
<figure id="attachment_715251" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-715251" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-715251" src="https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-095811.png" alt="" srcset="https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-095811.png 342w, https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-095811-300x167.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-715251" class="wp-caption-text">©Target</figcaption></figure>
<p>And for those of us who love our beauty products and need to restock, or want to try something new, Target is giving out a <strong>$10 gift card when you spend $40 on select skin and hair care products from Ulta Beauty at Target</strong>. This is great if you’ve been reading up on our go-to makeup products for a day at the parks because a lot of us on the AllEars team find most of our favorite beauty products at Ulta Beauty.</p>
<figure id="attachment_715254" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-715254" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-715254" src="https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-100645.png" alt="" srcset="https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-100645.png 371w, https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-100645-300x218.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-715254" class="wp-caption-text">©Target</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another awesome deal is that<strong> 30% off is being offered during the sale on select shirts, tanks, and dresses</strong>. It can be a little overwhelming when you have to pack several different outfits for a trip, but now you can kill two birds with one stone by finding what you need and saving some major bucks during the sale. Plus, Target usually has some fun graphic tees that often include Disney-inspired designs!</p>
<figure id="attachment_715252" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-715252" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-715252 size-full" src="https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-100115.png" alt="" srcset="https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-100115.png 575w, https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-100115-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-715252" class="wp-caption-text">©Target</figcaption></figure>
<p>On top of all that (it truly just keeps getting better, doesn’t it?),<strong> select toys will be marked down up to 50% off</strong>! This includes plushies, figurine sets, dolls, and much more. And for those LEGO lovers out there, we’ll be keeping our eyes out for any Disney LEGO sets that will be discounted during the sale!</p>
<figure id="attachment_715253" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-715253" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-715253" src="https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-100514.png" alt="" srcset="https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-100514.png 377w, https://allears.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-05-100514-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-715253" class="wp-caption-text">©Target</figcaption></figure>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made a name for himself for being a workaholic. He is also known to poke fun at people who he disagrees with. These two habits made its way to X during Independence Day, as Elon Musk shared a notable update from Giga Texas, before throwing some shade on a fellow CEO. </p>



<p>Amidst the Independence Day celebrations a few days ago, Elon Musk posted a quick video update about Giga Texas’ upcoming supercomputer cluster. Drone footage taken of Giga Texas by longtime Tesla watchers indicate that the southend extension, which will house a <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-tesla-supercomputer-cluster-giga-texas-location/">“super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster,”</a> is progressing well. </p>



 








<p>As <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1809070845689516043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted by Musk in his update</a>, Tesla is just finalizing the construction of Giga Texas’ supercomputer cluster. He also noted that the electric vehicle maker would be attempting to get the supercomputer cluster online in the coming months. The cluster is expected to further accelerate the progress of Tesla’s FSD efforts, which is crucial for the rollout of the company’s dedicated Robotaxi, which will be unveiled on August 8, 2024.</p>



<p>While Musk was all work in his Giga Texas update during Independence Day, he also took some time to poke fun at Meta CEO Mark Zuckerburg, who posted a video of himself wakeboarding in a suit and sunglasses, sipping some beer, and holding up an American flag to celebrate the Fourth of July. Zuckerburg’s video went viral, with social media users noting that it made the Meta CEO very likable and cool. </p>



 



<p>Elon Musk, for his part, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1809075977093345758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threw some shade towards Zuckerberg</a>. In a response on X, Musk noted that he prefers to work. “May he continue to have fun on his yachts. I prefer to work,” Musk wrote. Musk’s reply received polarizing reactions from social media users, with some taking it as yet another dig at Zuckerberg and others claiming that it showed Musk was being jealous of the Meta CEO. </p>



<p>Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have been throwing shade at each other for years, and last year, it even seemed like an <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-vs-mark-zuckerberg-fight-walter-isaacson/">actual MMA fight between the two CEOs</a> was about to happen. Musk has been <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-slams-mark-zuckerberg-rosy-ai-view/">critical of Zuckerberg’s rosy view of AI</a>, and the Meta CEO has been critical of Neuralink’s efforts, stating in August 2022 that the brain implants being developed by the startup <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/neuralink-not-wanted-normal-people-mark-zuckerberg/">will not be wanted by “normal people.”</a></p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>EU imposes provisional penalty tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles</strong>: The European Union has raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) by up to 48% on top of existing duties, as a result of its investigation into China's subsidies for its EV industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automakers uncertain about retaliation</strong>: European automakers are unsure when and how China will retaliate against the EU's tariffs, which could lead to a trade war.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EU duties become definitive in November</strong>: The EU's duties will become final in November, but there is a possibility that negotiations could change the decision. EU member states could also block the extra tariffs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EU's EV quota policy strengthens its hand in negotiations</strong>: The EU's decision to require automakers to sell only new EVs by 2035 and tighten the quota starting this year could strengthen its hand in negotiations with China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EU's EV sales plateau at 2 million vehicles, threatening its automakers</strong>: Despite its strict EV quota policy, Europe's EV sales have hit a plateau of around 2 million vehicles this year and are only expected to reach 7-8 million by 2030, which could hurt European automakers.</p>

<p>The EU Thursday raised tariffs up to almost 48% with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/600104.SS/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/600104.SS/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/600104.SS/" aria-label="SAIC’s">SAIC’s</a> MG facing a 37.6% tariff on top of the existing 10%. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/company/geely-automobile-holdings-ltd/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.reuters.com/company/geely-automobile-holdings-ltd/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/company/geely-automobile-holdings-ltd/" aria-label="Geely">Geely</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/company/byd-co-ltd/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.reuters.com/company/byd-co-ltd/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/company/byd-co-ltd/" aria-label="BYD">BYD</a> attracted increased levies of 19.9% and 17.4%. Other manufacturers who cooperated with the EU investigation face an average duty of 20.8% while non-cooperators face the 37.6% extra charge.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p>The duties become definitive in November suggesting negotiations might change the decision. EU member states could block the extra tariffs, imposed after it decided China subsidies for its EV industry harms Europe’s automakers.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>

<p>Some experts are puzzled by the EU’s decision to possibly trigger a tariff war with China because it appears to be playing with a weak hand. The EU has decreed that its automakers sell only new EVs by 2035, with a tightening quota starting with just over 20% this year, moving quickly to about 80% by 2030.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"><p id="article-0-inread"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>The trouble is EV sales in Europe have hit a plateau of about two million this year, and most forecasts reckon this will reach only between seven and eight million by 2030. Seven million is only roughly 50%, seriously short of the required 80%. So curbing the growth of Chinese EV imports cast doubts on the EU’s targets.</p>

<p>Germany in particular is also exposed to any Chinese retaliation, according to Professor ManMohan Sodhi of Britain’s <a href="https://www.bayes.city.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.bayes.city.ac.uk/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.bayes.city.ac.uk/" aria-label="Bayes Business School">Bayes Business School</a>.</p>






<p>“The German auto industry has made a last-ditch desperate plea to the EU not to impose these tariffs. After all, the German auto industry exports three times as much as it imports from China by way of cars and four times as much by way of parts. The EU is now inviting the Chinese tit-for-tat response,” Sodhi said.</p>


<p>The Chinese government’s initial unofficial response had seemed relatively mild, aimed at raising tariffs on mainly German high-value gasoline powered sedans and SUVs response.</p><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-1" role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion><p class="color-body light-text">China European Union trade</p></fbs-accordion><small>getty</small></figcaption></figure>
<p>“China hoped the EU would get the hint and not get into a tariff war. As with any tariff war, the Chinese will now be forced to react forcefully despite the move not being in their economic interest,” Sodhi said in an email exchange.</p>
<p>German manufacturers like Mercedes and BMW have all pointed to the pluses of free trade, while Germany has supported a negotiated solution with China.</p>
<p>China has hinted at widening its scale of possible retaliation to include big European earners like French wine, cognac and agricultural products, Toulouse-France based Airbus Industrie’s airliners, and pork exports led by Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark and France.</p>
<p>Thom Groot, CEO of <a href="https://www.electriccarscheme.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.electriccarscheme.com/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.electriccarscheme.com/" aria-label="The Electric Car Scheme">The Electric Car Scheme</a>, expects a quick response from the Chinese.</p>
<p>“I would expect China will react quickly, first with strong words, and perhaps later, if behind-the-scenes discussions do not look like they will resolve the situation, with actions,” Groot said in an email.</p>
<p>Groot says EV demand in Europe has been held back by high prices, and this has inhibited production investment, which the Chinese have taken advantage of.</p>
<p>“What the U.K. and Europe need is stronger incentives to drive demand like (tax incentives) and equalizing taxes on public charging compared to charging at home, while simultaneously investing in the car manufacturing supply chain to catch up to the Chinese manufacturers which are currently ahead of the more established western manufacturers,” Groot said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.just-auto.com/analyst-comment/eu-tariffs-can-chinese-car-manufacturers-still-flourish/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.just-auto.com/analyst-comment/eu-tariffs-can-chinese-car-manufacturers-still-flourish/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.just-auto.com/analyst-comment/eu-tariffs-can-chinese-car-manufacturers-still-flourish/" aria-label="GlobalData analyst Sammy Chan">GlobalData analyst Sammy Chan</a> said even if the penalty tariff regime is maintained, sales of China’s cheaper EVs will grow.</p>
<p>Chinese automakers have developed cost advantages through vertical integration and controlling key components like batteries. BYD has been selling products in Europe for sometimes double or nearly triple its pricing in China, Chan said.</p>
<p>Rhodium Group said recently that at tariffs lower than 50% Chinese EVs would still be profitable because of their more efficient manufacturing. Investment bank UBS has said that gives the likes of BYD a 30% cost advantage.</p>
<p>“Despite the tariffs, we do expect to see further Chinese brand growth in the Economy segment. Because European brands currently lack Chinese BEV-makers’ efficiencies and lower cost structure they are having to launch entry-level BEVs later to avoid losing money, giving Chinese BEVs in these segments a clearer run,” Chan said.</p>

    <p>Here are five key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tesla's stock surges</strong>: Tesla's stock has risen over 25% in the past week, boosted by vehicle deliveries that exceeded expectations, eclipsing the modest gains of other "Magnificent Seven" companies.</li>
<li><strong>CEO Elon Musk's comments</strong>: In the past, Musk has said that Tesla isn't a car company, but rather a tech company. This statement was true during a period of faltering sales, but now that sales are high, it suggests the company is credible as a car company too.</li>
<li><strong>The power of touting an industry-leading product</strong>: Tesla's stock surge serves as a lesson for AI startups, highlighting the importance of having a strong product, not just relying on AI ambitions.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla's AI goals are closely tied to car sales</strong>: While Tesla has lofty AI goals, they are still closely linked to the company's car sales. This underscores the importance of a strong product (cars) to support AI ambitions.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla's approach to AI</strong>: Tesla's AI ambitions are now seen as a part of a broader business plan, rather than the sole aspect of it, which is a more appealing approach to investors.</li>

While convenient, the pitch was true enough. And the edict apparently goes both ways.</p><p>The <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-are-buying-into-ai-and-musk-any-way-they-can-morning-brief-100048708.html" data-ylk="slk:stock surge;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link" data-rapid_p="43">stock surge</a> speaks to the power of touting an industry-leading product — a lesson for AI startups — and the benefit of making AI ambitions a part of a broader business plan, rather than the sole aspect of it. But conversely, it underscores that Tesla’s heady AI goals are still closely tethered to its car sales.</p><p>Combining lofty techno-ambitions with moving cars off lots has been key to Musk’s salesmanship.</p><p>New upbeat vehicle delivery data counters a wave of negative sentiment.</p><p>Weighed down by stiffening competition in China, softening demand at home, price cuts, layoffs, and Musk’s legal and corporate dramas, Tesla had limped along as a Magnificent Seven laggard. But recent wins have a way of erasing earlier losses. And Tesla is now riding a string of victories, with an earnings report and a much-hyped robotaxi unveiling just around the corner.</p><p>In some ways, Tesla’s flexible identity as a car company when times are good and a tech company when the chips are down can be a hindrance to a clear corporate strategy. Is Tesla still gunning for a mass-market EV in every family’s driveway? Or is it a platform orchestrating a fleet of autonomous taxis expanding the frontier of AI technology?</p><p>It can be both, of course. And <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-robotaxi-unveiling-wont-just-be-about-the-technology-were-starting-a-new-book-170016124.html" data-ylk="slk:Musk is prone to wanting it all;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link" data-rapid_p="44">Musk is prone to wanting it all</a>. Investors don’t seem to mind which metaphorical cap the company is wearing on any particular day. Just as long as the numbers go up. AI can make that happen. And, for now, so can cars.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The US has a high gun ownership rate, with nearly half of Americans living in a household with guns, making it the most gun-dense country in the world.</li>
<li>American Rounds, a vending machine company, has introduced machines that dispense bullets from grocery stores, using artificial intelligence and facial recognition technologies to verify the buyer's age and identity.</li>
<li>Despite few regulations around ammunition purchases in the US, federal law requires buyers to be at least 18 years old to buy ammunition for long guns and 21 years old to buy bullets for handguns.</li>
<li>American Rounds' machines use a combination of AI technology, card scanning, and facial recognition software to verify the identity of the person using the machine and ensure they meet the age requirement.</li>
<li>The company's machines are currently available at six locations in Oklahoma, with plans to expand to other states and locations.</li>

                            <p>It’s no secret that Americans love guns. Not only do <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/">nearly half of Americans</a> say they live in a household with guns, but the U.S. beats out every other nation on Earth when it comes to gun density (the 2nd most gun-dense country <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/gun-control-yemen-style/273058/">is Yemen, and it’s not even close</a>). The U.S. is actually the only country that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-25/how-many-guns-in-the-us-buying-spree-bolsters-lead-as-most-armed-country">has more guns than people</a>. Given all that, it’s not much of a surprise that, in some states, you can now walk into a grocery store and buy bullets from a vending machine as if you were ordering a candy bar or a soda.</p>

 <p>Well, sorta. Not quite. The vending machine company behind this new trend, American Rounds, says it uses artificial intelligence and facial recognition technologies to verify that buyers are of legal age to buy bullets. So it’s a slightly more rigorous process than buying a Twix.</p> <p>There are shockingly few regulations around ammunition purchases in the U.S., but some of <a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/does-customer-have-be-certain-age-buy-firearms-or-ammunition-licensee#:~:text=Under%20the%20Gun%20Control%20Act,years%20of%20age%20or%20older.">the few that exist are age-based</a>. Federal law says you have to be at least 18 years old to buy ammunition for long guns, like rifles and shotguns, and if you want to buy bullets for handguns, you have to be at least 21. As such, American Rounds has created an identity verification mechanism for its bullet vending machines that can supposedly verify how old the person buying the ammunition is.</p>

 <p>Cleveland.com <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/nation/2024/07/vending-machines-selling-bullets-at-grocery-stores.html">originally reported</a> on the proliferation of American Rounds’ machines, writing that they were currently available at six locations in Oklahoma and Alabama. On Friday, a local news outlet in Alabama <a href="https://abc3340.com/news/local/grocery-store-removes-ammo-vending-machine-tuscaloosa-pell-city-st-clair-county-guns-rifles-357-magnum-12-gauge-shotgun-rifle-22-caliber-second-amendment-grant-majors-american-rounds-kip-tyner">reported</a> that a store in Tuscaloosa had removed one of the machines after “the legality of the machine was questioned” at a city council meeting. The city’s legal department admitted the machines were legal if they met proper zoning requirements. The store has said that it “removed the machine on July 3rd because of a lack of sales,” the outlet reported.</p> <p>Gizmodo reached out to American Rounds for more information about their business and will update this story if it responds.</p>            </div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The article suggests that investors approaching retirement may want to avoid paying taxes by investing in tax-exempt entities, such as business development companies (BDCs), midstream master limited partnerships (MLPs), and real estate investment trusts (REITs).</li>
<li>These entities are exempt from paying corporate income tax as pass-through entities, which means that investors can benefit from the tax-free status and avoid paying taxes on dividends.</li>
<li>The article recommends investing in three BDCs, three midstream MLPs, and three REITs, which can provide a 7.8% dividend yield and solid dividend growth.</li>
<li>By placing the REITs and BDCs in a Roth account and the MLPs in a taxable account, investors can avoid paying taxes on dividends, as the MLP distributions are almost entirely tax-free.</li>
<li>The article suggests that by holding these investments until death, investors can avoid paying taxes on the dividends and capitalize on the tax-free benefits of these tax-exempt entities.</li>

As many investors approach retirement, they become increasingly aware of the certainty of death. However, the motivation to avoid painful taxes also becomes quite strong. In<span class="paywall-full-content invisible"> this article, we will share a simple portfolio designed to generate a 7.8% dividend yield along with solid dividend growth while also avoiding taxes at the individual and corporate level.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">The way we accomplish this is by investing in three business development companies (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIZD" title="VanEck Vectors BDC Income ETF">BIZD</a>), three midstream MLPs (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMLP" title="ALPS Alerian MLP ETF">AMLP</a>), and three real estate investment trusts (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNQ" title="Vanguard Real Estate ETF">VNQ</a>) as all of these corporate structures are exempt from paying corporate income tax as pass-through entities. By placing the REITs and BDCs in a Roth account and the MLPs in a taxable account and<span class="paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible"> holding them until death, you get the benefits of not having to pay any taxes on dividends. This is because the MLP distributions are almost always considered to be return of capital, which means they are tax-deferred, and if you hold the MLPs until you die, you can pass them on to your heirs with a cost basis step-up, effectively rendering the distributions you have received in the meantime completely tax-free. Additionally, even if you live long enough for your return on capital to deplete your cost basis, by simply reinvesting some of your distributions in buying more of those same MLPs, you can increase your cost basis again, thereby continuing to defer paying taxes indefinitely. Note that this is not tax advice, as it merely reflects my own understanding of how things work, but I am not a tax expert.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Without further ado, let's discuss the nine stocks.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">BDCs</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">First, the BDCs include Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSDL" title="Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund">MSDL</a>), Blue Owl Corporation III (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OBDE" title="Blue Owl Capital Corporation III">OBDE</a>), and Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BXSL" title="Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.">BXSL</a>). I recently wrote a more <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702380-morgan-stanley-direct-lending-compelling-10-percent-defensive-yield-msdl-stock">in-depth article</a> on MSDL, but the bottom line is that they offer a very attractive 10.5% next 12-month dividend yield, they cover their dividend quite comfortably with net investment income, and they have strong underwriting performance with just 0.4% of the portfolio at cost on non-accrual, and 98.4% of the portfolio has an internal risk rating of either one or two. Additionally, 95% of the portfolio is invested in first-lien loans and 4% in second-lien loans, leaving a mere 1% in non-first or second-lien loans. On top of that, 94% of its portfolio is considered non-cyclical, and its net leverage ratio is very low at 0.77 times earnings, with an investment-grade credit rating. With such strong numbers behind it, and especially considering the fact that it trades at a very low premium to its net asset value at a time when its blue-chip peers like Hercules Capital (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HTGC" title="Hercules Capital, Inc.">HTGC</a>) and Main Street Capital (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAIN" title="Main Street Capital">MAIN</a>) trade at much larger premiums to NAV, MSDL makes for a great income stock for investors who want to be in business development companies right now but don't want to take on too much risk.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Meanwhile, OBDE has a 9.3% expected next 12-month total dividend yield, a leverage ratio of around 1, and 95.3% of its portfolio invested in debt, including 88.8% in first and second lien loans. It also has an investment-grade credit rating and trades at a 4.22% discount to NAV, making it one of the most attractive risk-adjusted BDC investment opportunities right now.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Last but not least, BXSL - despite trading at a fairly steep premium of 19.27%, and therefore I would not recommend buying it for someone concerned about total returns - offers a very attractive next 12-month dividend yield of 9.9% that is well covered by net investment income. This should be safe for the foreseeable future, especially because 98% of its portfolio is invested in debt, and 97.6% of the portfolio is in first or second-lien debt, with virtually all of that in first-lien loans, making it a very conservative portfolio. This is especially the case given that it is backed by Blackstone (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BX" title="Blackstone Inc.">BX</a>), which is the largest alternative asset manager in the world.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">MLPs</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The midstreams that I would hold right now in a retirement income portfolio are Enterprise Products Partners (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EPD" title="Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Common Units">EPD</a>), Energy Transfer (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ET" title="Energy Transfer LP Common Units">ET</a>), and MPLX (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPLX" title="MPLX LP Common Units">MPLX</a>).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I like Enterprise Products Partners because it has the strongest balance sheet in the midstream sector, with an A- credit rating and a 3 times leverage ratio. Its 7.4% distribution yield is very attractive and is covered about 1.7 times by distributable cash flow, and it is also growing its distribution at about a 5% CAGR, which is backed by similar distributable cash flow per unit growth. With its significant growth pipeline set to come online in the next few years, its leverage ratio is likely to drop even further, paving the way for even faster distribution growth and/or significant unit repurchases. Additionally, its portfolio is very well diversified and earns a wide moat rating from Morningstar.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I also like Energy Transfer right now because it has an attractive 7.9% distribution yield that's covered about 1.9 times by distributable cash flow. It is also growing its distribution at a 3-5% CAGR and has an investment-grade BBB credit rating. It is also pursuing attractive growth investments while recently redeeming a large number of its preferred units, which further strengthens its balance sheet and its common distribution safety. It will be interesting to see what it does next with the significant amount of excess cash flow that it generates, potentially opting for unit repurchases or faster distribution growth unless it decides to make a big acquisition.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">MPLX rounds out the group with a very strong track record of growing its distribution, currently yielding 8.4% on a next 12-month basis. Like Energy Transfer, it also has a BBB credit rating and comfortably covers its distribution. It has some solid growth investment projects underway that should continue to drive mid-single-digit distribution growth per year moving forward.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">REITs</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The three REITs that I like right now for a retirement income portfolio are W.P. Carey (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPC" title="W. P. Carey Inc.">WPC</a>), Realty Income (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/O" title="Realty Income Corporation">O</a>), and Mid-America Apartment Communities (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAA" title="Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.">MAA</a>). While these may not be my three favorite REITs from a total return perspective, I like them a lot from a yield and safety perspective.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">WPC has a 6.3% next 12-month dividend yield, trades at a discount to its net asset value, has a BBB+ credit rating, and recently exited the office sector. With a growing portfolio of quality industrial and warehouse properties and the majority of its rent comes from CPI-linked leases, it is uniquely well-positioned to weather periods of stagflation even if interest rates remain higher for longer.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">O does not have the significant CPI-linked exposure that WP Carey has, but it has an A- credit rating, arguably the best long-term track record of any major REIT, a 6% forward dividend yield that is well covered by earnings, and a very large and well-diversified portfolio of quality real estate that positions it very well to weather a recession.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Finally, MAA is a high-quality multifamily REIT that has a pristine balance sheet and an impressive long-term track record of generating attractive total returns and dividend growth. It offers a 4.3% next 12-month dividend yield and trades at a 9% discount to its net asset value. Putting that all together, MAA looks like an attractive way to diversify the portfolio into a defensive sector that also has attractive growth dynamics over the long term.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Investor Takeaway</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Keep in mind, as you can see from these nine selections, they are not all optimized for maximizing total returns, but the aggregate total return potential is still pretty solid. This is particularly true when you consider the starting yield for the next 12 months projected for the entire portfolio, assuming an equally weighted holding of each, is 7.8%. Meanwhile, the REITs and MLPs in this portfolio should be expected to grow on a weighted average of about 5% per year. The BDCs will likely grow at most 2% per year on average, though this will be choppy given that their kind of investment performance rises and falls with interest rates. Even if there is no growth from those holdings, in aggregate the dividends should grow at around a 3% annualized pace, which should be in line with long-term inflation levels.</p> <p class="before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It is also worth noting that the portfolio benefits from nice diversification. For one, it is very defensive in nature, so it should hold up fairly well during economic downturns. Additionally, triple net lease REITs tend to do best when interest rates fall, the BDCs will do better when interest rates rise, and the MLPs are more of an inflation hedge, given that energy tends to do best in high inflation environments, and - with their strong balance sheets and relatively internally funded growth investments - they are largely agnostic to where interest rates go, especially over short periods of time.</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li><strong>Nvidia's GPUs face competition</strong>: Nvidia's dominance in the GPU market may be challenged by custom-designed AI chips from companies like Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Meta Platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Custom-designed chips outperform GPUs in specific tasks</strong>: These custom chips, such as TPUs, can outperform GPUs in specific tasks, such as training AI models, if the workload is designed specifically for the chip.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia's GPUs still have a use case</strong>: Despite the emergence of custom-designed chips, Nvidia's GPUs are still well-suited for running initial models and may continue to be used in many applications.</li>
<li><strong>Replacement cycle will drive future demand</strong>: As existing GPUs reach the end of their life cycle (typically 3-5 years), they will need to be replaced, creating a steady stream of demand for Nvidia's products over the next five years.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia's long-term subscription effect</strong>: Even as competitors emerge, the need for GPUs to run AI models continuously will ensure a long-term subscription effect, driving recurring revenue for Nvidia and other GPU providers.</li>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p><strong>Nvidia </strong><span class="ticker">(NASDAQ: NVDA)</span> has done a lot over the past five years. Five years ago, it was nearing the bottom of a cycle thanks to a collapse in the cryptocurrency market. Now, it's reaching new highs as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand for creating artificial intelligence (AI) models.</p><p>While it would have been nearly impossible to predict all of the places Nvidia has gone over the past five years, I'm going to speculate on where it could go in the next five years. Although this prediction will likely be wrong in some ways, it's good at least to develop an investment thesis for the market's most dominant company right now.</p><h2>Nvidia's best-in-class GPUs are about to face some competition</h2><p>Nvidia's GPUs are -- hands down - the best in class. There's a reason why all of the biggest companies that provide the tools to make AI models or create them in-house are using Nvidia GPUs nearly exclusively. However, that exclusivity may be dwindling.</p><p>Because GPUs can do multiple calculations in parallel, they are fantastic for creating AI models. However, if the only thing that the GPU will be doing is training AI models, more efficient hardware is available. For instance, Google Cloud's tensor processing unit (TPU) is more effective at training AI models than a GPU <em>if</em> the workload is set up to be run on a TPU.</p><p>This still leaves a use case for GPUs, which are fantastic for running initial models. However, custom-designed AI chips like TPUs can exceed the performance of GPUs when they are used for a specific purpose.</p><p>Google Cloud isn't the only one creating these custom chips. <strong>Amazon </strong>Web Services, <strong>Microsoft </strong>Azure, and Meta Platforms are also creating their own custom-designed chips. This <em>could</em> present a problem for Nvidia over the next five years, as many of its largest customers are bringing these designs in-house. Demand for Nvidia GPUs will still likely be high, but it may not be as high as it is now.</p><p>On the plus side for Nvidia, all of the record-setting number of GPUs it has sold over the past year will eventually need to be replaced. While there is no hard and fast rule, it's common for these GPUs to last between three and five years in a data center. After that, they'll either need to be replaced (whether by some in-house design or Nvidia's latest product) or decommissioned.</p><p>The computing power to run these models continuously isn't going away, so decommissioning these GPUs isn't an option. This will create essentially a long-term subscription effect, and five years from now, Nvidia will likely see another wave of replacing the products it is selling right now.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="13"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>That's not to mention all of the technological improvements that will likely be made from now until then, as new chip technology (like <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor</strong>'s 2-nanometer chip technology that will be more efficient than the previous generation) will create more powerful and efficient GPUs that will help its users out over the long run.</p><p>But is all of that already baked into the stock price?</p><h2>Nvidia's profit margins are ripe for competition</h2><p>It's no secret that Nvidia's stock is expensive. The shares trade at 73 times trailing and 46 times forward earnings, which means significant growth is already priced into the stock.</p><p>However, Nvidia's record margins are not often discussed. Nvidia's near-60% profit-margin levels are unbelievable and are a primary reason why many companies are starting to design their chips in-house.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart</figcaption></p></figure><p>Because demand for Nvidia's GPUs is so high right now, the company can afford to charge a premium for its products.

This is a huge risk associated with the stock, as the market believes Nvidia's revenue will keep going straight up forever.</p><p>While demand for Nvidia's products will likely remain elevated, don't be surprised when Nvida faces challenges with in-house solutions in the next few years. There's an old saying that a company's margins are a competitor's opportunity, and when Nvidia's margins reach these levels, there's bound to be competition soon.</p><p>As a result, Nvidia's stock may face some pressure over the next five years. This unbelievable demand boom won't last forever, and the opportunity is just too large for every company to sit still <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/06/29/nvidias-stock-is-up-750-in-2-years-the-last-time-i/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=610e922b-904c-4160-9a08-7e4d1562c4ec" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:and watch Nvidia take their money.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16">and watch Nvidia take their money.</a></p><h2>Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity</h2><p>Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?
