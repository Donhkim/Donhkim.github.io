<ol>
<li><strong>Interest Rate Cut</strong>: The European Central Bank (ECB) lowered its interest rates for the first time in nearly five years, a sign that the bank is shifting its policy to combat inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation Target</strong>: The ECB's inflation target is 2%, and officials announced that inflation has returned to within sight of this target, prompting the rate cut.</li>
<li><strong>Deposit Rate</strong>: The benchmark deposit rate was lowered by a quarter-point to 3.75%, the highest rate in the ECB's 26-year history. The rate had been set at 4% since September.</li>
<li><strong>ECB President's Comment</strong>: Christine Lagarde, the ECB President, said that the inflation outlook has improved significantly, making it appropriate to reduce the degree of monetary policy restriction.</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong>: The rate cut is expected to have a positive impact on the economy, as it will make borrowing cheaper and stimulate economic growth.</li>

<ol>
<li>The US Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have launched investigations into three major developers of artificial intelligence (AI): Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI.</li>
<li>The Justice Department will lead a probe into Nvidia's dominance in the market for microprocessors that power AI, while the FTC will lead investigations into Microsoft and OpenAI.</li>
<li>The scrutiny is part of a broader effort by the Biden administration to rein in anticompetitive behavior across various industries, including healthcare, groceries, and technology.</li>
<li>The administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants such as Apple and Amazon, and has taken Microsoft to trial over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</li>
<li>The probes aim to ensure that these powerful companies do not engage in unfair business practices that harm competition and consumers, and that they comply with antitrust laws and regulations.</li>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks held steady Thursday as Wall Street’s momentum cooled following its latest record-setting day.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 barely budged a day after leaping to set an all-time high for the 25th time this year. It dipped by 1.07, or less than 0.1%, to 5,352.96. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 78.84, points, or 0.2%, to 38,886.17, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 14.78, or 0.1%, to 17,173.12 after hitting its own record.</p><p>Big Lots tumbled 18.2% after reporting a larger loss for the latest quarter than expected. The retailer said it missed targets for sales because its customers are continuing to pull back on their spending, particularly for things that aren’t essentials.</p><p>Another retailer, Five Below, gave more discouraging comments about how its customers are doing. Its profit and revenue last quarter fell short of analysts’ expectations, and CEO Joel Anderson said struggles for the company’s core lower-income customers dragged on results, even as it saw strong growth from its higher-income customers. Five Below’s stock fell 10.6%.</p>
    

<p>Many retailers and other companies have been highlighting a split between their customers making lower and higher incomes. Inflation is particularly <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-low-income-squeeze-profits-93d0614a3a0d0a93cf9e15e0985a7271">hurting those at the lower end</a></span>, who are struggling to keep up with a cost of living that’s still rising, even if inflation is not as fast as before. That threatens to crack a linchpin that’s kept the U.S. economy out of a recession despite high interest rates: strong spending by U.S. households.</p>



<p>Another factor that’s helped U.S. consumer spending stay so strong has been a remarkably solid job market. A report on Thursday showed some potential softening there as well.</p>
    
<p>More U.S. workers <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/unemployment-benefits-jobless-claims-layoffs-labor-0820e9f4b0412c392762ba7d392ce1a2">applied for unemployment benefits </a></span> last week than the week before, when economists were expecting to see a slight decline. The numbers are still low compared with history, but they could suggest some slowing in the job market.</p>
    

<p>Wall Street is actually hoping for just such a slowdown. That’s because a cooldown can drive inflation lower and convince the Federal Reserve to deliver the cuts to interest rates that traders desire so much. The danger is if the slowdown for the economy overshoots and turns into a recession, which would ultimately hurt stock prices.</p><p>In a potentially discouraging signal for markets, a separate report on Thursday said the productivity of U.S. workers wasn’t quite as strong in the first three months of the year as economists thought. That’s key because strong productivity gains could allow wages for U.S. workers to keep rising without adding as much upward pressure on inflation.</p><p>After the economic reports, Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained at 4.28%, where it was late Wednesday.</p><p>On Wall Street, Lululemon Athletica climbed 4.8% after reporting better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, in large part because of strong growth in sales outside the Americas. J.M. Smucker rose 4.6% after the company behind Uncrustables and Jif peanut butter likewise topped profit expectations.</p>
    

<p>Robinhood Markets rose 6.4% after saying it agreed to buy Bitstamp, a cryptocurrency exchange. Robinhood said the deal, which still needs regulatory approvals, will bring in customers from around the world, including the European Union and Asia. </p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/meme-stocks-wall-street-gamestop-amc-f56af9d8853d77180548028a1a7f3f0f">GameStop</a></span> soared 47.5% in the latest whipsaw move for the video-game retailer’s stock. It’s been particularly volatile since a central character from its initial supernova run in 2021 recently returned to social media after a yearslong hiatus. The online hero, who goes by Roaring Kitty among other nicknames, is scheduled to return to YouTube for a live stream on Friday. </p><p>Nvidia, meanwhile, reversed an early gain and slipped 1.1% a day after becoming the third company to see its total value top $3 trillion. The chip company has been riding a tidal wave of enthusiasm for artificial-intelligence technology. </p><p>Trading could be more exciting on Friday, when the U.S. government offers the latest monthly update on the job market. Economists expect it to show slight accelerations in hiring and average hourly wage gains from the month before.</p>
    

<p>“Policymakers have reasons to start feeling cautiously optimistic on the labor market front as wage growth is returning to a sustainable range while labor turnover is softening,” according to Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s chief Americas economist.</p><p>As of now, virtually no one expects the Federal Reserve to make any move on interest rates at its meeting next week. But the hope is still for the Fed to cut its main interest rate at least once this year, down from its highest level in more than two decades.</p><p>The <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/european-central-bank-interest-rates-cut-087f5a0eb5caf841266afb16c65e520b">European Central Bank </a></span> on Thursday became the latest in the world to cut its own interest rates. The bank’s president, Christine Lagarde, said inflation there had eased enough to begin lower rates but declined to say how the future path lower would look.</p><p>Stock indexes rose modestly in Europe following the widely expected decision. They were mixed in Asia, with indexes up 0.6% in Tokyo, down 0.5% in Shanghai and closed for trading because of a holiday in Seoul.</p><h2>___</h2><p>AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.</p>

<ol>

    This is Bentonville
downtown. This is the square. Directly behind you is the
Walmart Museum, the former location of Walton Five and
Dime that opened here originally. Retail giant Walmart is
building out a massive, roughly 350 acre campus in
its hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. The new site,
expected to accommodate more than 15000 employees, will
include 12 office buildings, a hotel and a daycare
center. And it's not just Walmart's
headquarters that is getting a makeover. Bentonville is
booming. Tell us a little bit about
Bentonville and who lives here. So, you're going to have a
lot of corporate office folks that are coming to
work with Walmart or Tyson or J.B. Hunt. The median income here is
99,000, which is 25% higher than the US average. One of the challenges with
high growth communities is how do you allow new people
to come in, but maintain the brand and the charm of what
makes it special? In addition to its bustling
restaurant scene, the town also boasts being a Mecca
for mountain bikers with more than 70 miles of
trails. It's home to an American
art museum, free to visitors, and will soon
have a state of the art medical school. But locals say growth has
led to some unintended consequences. Ten years ago, we had 14
homes that sold over $1 million. Last year, 2023,
we had 244 over $1 million. It's a big change. I'd say in the last 10 to 15
years, it's just exploded. In addition to cutting
hundreds of corporate jobs, Walmart is transferring
many of its workers from Dallas, Atlanta and Toronto
to Bentonville. Those newcomers will join
other transplants, like Tracy Robinson, who moved
from Miami to Bentonville for a job at Walmart. Hey Sammy. I kind of pooh-poohed the
idea of working at Walmart when I came across the job
posting, because I thought never in a million years
would I move to Arkansas. The town's newly minted hip
status could help Walmart poach talent from coastal
cities and the tech sector, but can it hold on to its
southern charm and character? CNBC went to
Bentonville, Arkansas, to find out. Things grow like wild here. After living in Washington,
D.C., New York and Miami, Tracy Robinson moved to
Bentonville in 2022. What do you have in your
head when you imagined Bentonville or living in
Arkansas? I had this. Vision of a really poor
rural community, maybe a little backwards and a
little conservative. You know we're going out,
don't you? Today, the 36 year old lives
with her dog, Stanley, and works in Walmart's baby
division as the Director of Sourcing for private
brands. Where we are today is kind
of everything that I would have imagined of the ideal
town or place or community that I would want to live
in. I can walk to work, I can
bike to work, I can walk to downtown on the weekends
and go to the farmer's market. Robinson says during her
short time in Bentonville, she's witnessed some of the
town's transformation. It's been ten new
restaurants that have opened in the two years that I've
been here. A driving force behind much
of that change is the family of Walmart founder Sam
Walton. Stewart and Tom Walton, Sam
Walton's grandsons, helped grow the area's mountain
biking culture. The Walton Family
Foundation has so far contributed $74 million
toward the construction of 163 miles of trails in
northwest Arkansas. In 2011, Alice Walton, Sam
Walton's daughter, helped launch the Crystal Bridges
Museum of American Art, encompassing 120 acres in
the Ozark woods and over five miles of trails. The Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, a
four year MD program and school, plans to enroll its
first class in 2025. I would say that Walmart
brought a lot of really amazing things here, and I
think that a lot of people have tagged on to that and
have really brought such an amazing culture and
atmosphere to this town that wouldn't have existed maybe
without them. There's a little bit of an
Aspen feel, a Colorado feel. A lot of people from
Colorado are coming here. It certainly has from a
museum feel and a job market feel, a little bit of a New
York piece. But it's the new Walmart
campus that could do the most to shape Bentonville's
new identity. Demolition and construction
at the site began in 2019. The first building to open
was a fitness center, complete with pickleball
courts and a swimming pool. It's an example of the
amenities that Walmart is adding to its campus to
attract talent from the coasts and around the
world. Walmart will open the rest of its campus in
phases beginning in 2025. When you moved to
Bentonville, how long did you think you would stay
here and how long do you think you'll stay now? My relocation package
required that I stay here a year, and that's what I had
committed to. And I think I'm a lifer
now. Yeah, this was all open
country back then. I can't remember. The first neighbor down
here probably was, I'm going to say a mile away, maybe. Gill Curran and his wife,
Sue, moved to Bentonville from Kansas City in 1971. In their early years, the
couple owned a 175 acre farm, raised cattle, and
ran a burger joint in town. What was it like in
downtown and in Bentonville at that period? Well, downtown, of course,
was small then, and Walmart was just really getting
going. But we loved it then. We loved the small town
atmosphere. Between 2010 and 2020, the
town's population shot up 53% to 54,000 residents. By 2022, median household
income increased to more than $99,000, up 37% from
2015. Have locals been priced out from the area? Yeah, I think
that's a struggle and honestly, I struggle with
that in that if you are buying a house today,
again, ten years ago, the average price per foot was
$83 per foot. Today that same category is
about $190 per foot. So yeah, it's a struggle. The house behind me is
actually listed for it was 2.35. Are they moving for Walmart? This couple actually is
moving for Walmart. The first Walmart store
opened in Rogers, Arkansas in 1962. Today, more than 1300
Walmart suppliers, including Mattel and Duracell, have a
presence in northwest Arkansas. It started with Walmart kind
of having their supplier group move in in 2003, and
that sort of is what took off. More people coming in,
honestly, people being I'm not kidding, crying in my
car like, "I am not moving to this place. Please don't
move me here." And over the years, it's gotten easier
and easier to bring people in. Bentonville flexes like
thousands and thousands of people every day coming in,
and that's why I can run specials on Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday when the vendors are in town. It's an insane economic
boom for us. With 1.6 million US workers, most
of them in stores and warehouses, Walmart is the
country's largest private employer. What have been
some of the changes that you've noticed that have
been more of the big city problems that come with
growth? A lot of the people that
come to town now are strangers to us. A lot of them come with
different values, systems; so it's kind of changed our
culture, I think. Every time I go to town
now, there's new construction and sometimes
there'll be a three story building that I never saw
before. The traffic is obviously a
huge problem. The population of Northwest
Arkansas is growing too, expected to almost double
from 576,000 in 2022 to nearly 1 million residents
by 2045. But if someone told you
Bentonville would become like this back then, what
would you have thought? I don't know, I probably
couldn't couldn't have visualized in any way, uh,
what it would have been. I would have never thought
of it that way. For one thing, Walmart, you
know, I don't believe anybody had the vision that
it's going to take over the world, you know? So.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The FDA has rescinded its marketing ban on Juul Labs, opening the door to possible authorization of the company's products.</li>
<li>The FDA initially blocked Juul's application to sell its vaping device and tobacco- and menthol-flavored pods in June 2022, citing a lack of sufficient evidence regarding the toxicological profile of the products.</li>
<li>The FDA paused the block just weeks later in July 2022 to conduct additional scientific review, and has now rescinded the ban.</li>
<li>Juul has claimed that its product can be used as a tool to stop smoking cigarettes, and the company has been working to get its products back on the market.</li>
<li>The FDA's decision to rescind the ban comes nearly two years after the agency ordered Juul's e-cigarettes and vaping products to be taken off the market in May 2022.</li>

In response to the 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey, the company said it was "pleased to see continued declines in underage use of all vapor products and JUUL products in particular."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"These data demonstrate that appropriate restrictions to access and marketing of vapor products work and can lead to meaningful reductions in underage use in a regulated marketplace," the company said. "The data further show the need to escalate enforcement against the illicit disposable products that now dominate youth use. That enforcement effort, if coupled with market authorizations for products that meet the statutory standard with science and evidence, can unlock the historic opportunity to reduce the deadly harm of combustible cigarettes while continuing to drive down underage use."</p></div></div>

            The US job market showed a softer side in April when just <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/03/economy/april-jobs-report-final/index.html">175,000 jobs were added</a>, marking one of the weakest months in the past three years.

            Based on initial estimates, May’s jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, due out Friday at 8:30 am ET, could be similar: Economists are expecting job growth of 180,000 payrolls and an unemployment rate that holds tight at 3.9%.

            In its battle to bring down inflation, the Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/markets-federal-reserve-meeting-05-01-24/index.html">has wanted to see</a> demand cool off so as to take the heat off price hikes and for the labor market to ease into a “better balance” of the supply and demand of workers — all without causing a spike in joblessness or triggering a recession.

            The slew of complementary employment data released in advance of Friday’s report seems to be teeing up just that: Job openings are shrinking, hiring is slowing, people aren’t quitting as much; however, layoff activity remains muted.

            “I think all of these measures are pretty much in line with things are cooling but in a very gradual descent,” said Crofoot, who formerly served as an economist for the BLS. “We don’t want the labor market to crash and burn, we want it to do what it’s doing, which is a gradual softening.”

            The May jobs report could cement a trend that the US hasn’t seen since the early 1950s: If the jobless rate comes in as expected, it would mark the 28th consecutive month of sub-4% unemployment, which would be the longest streak in more than 70 years.
    </p>

            “If unemployment stays below 4% for the 28th consecutive month, it will be cause for celebration,” economist Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, wrote in a note on Tuesday. “If the other data in the jobs report looks like they did in April, then it should help the Fed feel more comfortable about lowering interest rates.”
    </p>

            If the unemployment rate were to come in at or above 4% — something that’s not expected, given broader labor data but also not impossible, because the data that feeds into the monthly measurement is volatile — it could have a psychological effect, said Julia Pollak, chief economist with online job site ZipRecruiter.
    </p>

            “4% is thought of as a magical number — a number below which participation rises, below which we tend to see employment rates increase faster for women and for minorities,” she said. “Employers in a tight labor market, they have to do extraordinary things; they have to cast a wider net; they have to actively recruit non-traditional candidates; they have to offer more attractive job conditions, more flexibility, think about installing air conditioning in their trucks or offering a bus to employees. So, it is kind of a magical number.”

<p>Rubio’s Coastal Grill has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a mere days after the Mexican fast casual chain announced the <a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/business/rubios-coastal-grill-closes-over-a-dozen-san-diego-area-stores/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/business/rubios-coastal-grill-closes-over-a-dozen-san-diego-area-stores/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closure of nearly 50 stores across California</a> citing the “rising cost of doing business.”</p>



<p>In a statement, the Carlsbad-based chain said it is seeking the bankruptcy protection for reorganization to “facilitate the sale of the business.” The statement added it will continue at “normal operations” at its remaining 86 stores in the Golden State, Arizona and Nevada.</p>



<p>“Despite the Company’s best efforts to right-size the company, the continued challenging economic conditions have negatively impacted its ability to meet the demands of its debt burden,” Nicholas Rubin, chief restructuring officer of Rubio’s, said in a statement. </p>





<p>“The Company believes the best path forward for Rubio’s is through a court-supervised sale process that will position the brand for long-term success to grow and flourish,” he continued.</p>



<p>Rubio’s will be entering what is known as a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stalkinghorsebid.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,A%20stalking%20horse%20bid%20is%20an%20initial%20bid%20on%20the,to%20succeed%20in%20buying%20them." data-type="link" data-id="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stalkinghorsebid.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,A%20stalking%20horse%20bid%20is%20an%20initial%20bid%20on%20the,to%20succeed%20in%20buying%20them." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stalking horse purchase agreement</a>, which is a type of negotiation where the company determines the lowest bid price, to sell its business, according to the statement — something it expects to be completed in 75 days.</p>



<p>It will mark the second time Rubio’s Coastal Grill has filed for bankruptcy in the last five years. It first sought <a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/report-rubios-restaurant-chain-files-for-bankruptcy/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/report-rubios-restaurant-chain-files-for-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 11 bankruptcy back in 2020</a>, selling off ownership to an investment group to help pull the chain out of a financial downturn.</p>





<p>According to Wednesday’s statement, Rubio’s said it has “a commitment from its existing lender to provide debtor-in-possession financing and has more than adequate liquidity to meet all its operating needs during the sale process” this time around.</p>



<p>Last Friday, the chain announced the abrupt closure of nearly 50 “underperforming” stores across California, including 13 in San Diego County — where the chain originated back in 1983. According to the company, 24 stores in the Los Angeles area were also closed last week, as well as 11 in Northern California.</p>



<p>“Making the decision to close a store is never an easy one,” a spokesperson for Rubio’s Coastal Grill said at the time, adding the move came “after a thorough review of its operations and the current business climate.”</p>



<p>However, the move drew pushback from purported customers and workers on the chain’s social media. At <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7pGMNzvN7h/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">least one user who said they were a worker</a> on a recent Instagram post, which has now been cleared of comments, said they were informed of their store’s closure the day it happened.</p>





<p>Known for its fish tacos, Rubio’s Coastal Grill was founded in Mission Bay in 1983. Since then, the chain has expanded to <a href="https://rubios.com/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 100 stores</a> in California, Arizona and Nevada. According to the spokesperson, 86 stores will remain open after the closures.</p>

<li>The European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates for the first time in five years, which contributed to the increase in oil prices.</li>
<li>The private payrolls report showed a weaker-than-expected labor market, boosting hopes that the Fed will cut rates, which in turn boosted oil prices.</li>
<li>The probability of a rate cut by the Fed in September has increased to around 70%, according to Fed futures trading.</li>
<li>West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices rose to $75.55 per barrel, up $1.48, or 2%, while Brent oil prices rose to $79.87 per barrel, up $1.46, or 1.86%.</li>

    <div><p>Robinhood announced on Thursday that it has acquired Bitstamp, one of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, in an all-cash deal expected to be worth around $200 million. The acquisition, which is expected to close in the first half of 2025, will advance one of Robinhood’s strategic goals by expanding the company’s presence in overseas markets.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>Bitstamp has been a fixture of the crypto industry since 2011 when it launched in Slovenia, and then relocated to Luxembourg and the U.K. Its marketshare has declined in recent years, however, and despite having four to five million customers, Bitstamp now ranks 16th in trading volume among cryptocurrency exchanges. Its biggest market remains Europe, but it also has customers in the UK, Asia and the U.S.</p>



<p>In an interview with <em>Fortune</em>, Robinhood Crypto’s General Manager, Johann Kerbrat, pointed out that Bitstamp has 50 active licenses across the globe, and that the exchange also does a robust trade with institutions. He added that the deal will be a significant first step towards another of Robinhood’s strategic priorities, which is developing an institutional business to complement its fast-growing suite of consumer products.</p>



<p>The acquisition comes as a surprise since there had been no reports Bitstamp was up for sale, and as Robinhood is bouncing back from a brutal 2023 that saw the price of its shares, which are currently trading around $22, fall as low as $7. The downturn, which led to rumors that Robinhood had become an acquisition target, was part of a broader reckoning that cast doubt on the overall health of the fin-tech sector.</p>



<p>In 2024, the story has been much different for Robinhood as the company posted record earnings for Q1, and last week announced a $1 billion stock <a href="https://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/robinhood-announces-1-billion-share-repurchase-program/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/robinhood-announces-1-billion-share-repurchase-program/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">buyback</a>. Meanwhile, it has begun to move away from the feast-or-famine business of stock trading, adding services like <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/03/26/robinhood-credit-cards-10-karat-rewards/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/03/26/robinhood-credit-cards-10-karat-rewards/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">credit cards</a> and retirement accounts that are less prone to market fluctuations.</p><p></p>



<p>Robinhood’s acquisition of Bitstamp coincides with a huge upswing in the crypto markets that has seen the price of Bitcoin climb over 60% since the start of the year, and the company post <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/05/09/robinhoods-crypto-q1-revenue-tripled/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/05/09/robinhoods-crypto-q1-revenue-tripled/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">a three-fold</a> increase in crypto revenue during the first quarter.</p>



<p>The deal also has the potential to transform Robinhood’s current crypto operations, which primarily revolve around sourcing Bitcoin and other currencies from market makers. In acquiring Bitstamp, Robinhood will be able to source crypto from its own exchange instead, and potentially invite its customers to trade there. Bitstamp also offers as many as 85 digital tokens in some of its markets, compared to the dozen or so offered by Robinhood, as well as lending and <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/crash-course/staking/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/crypto/crash-course/staking/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">staking</a> services.</p>



<p>Any attempt by Robinhood to increase its crypto offerings in the U.S. could face scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which signaled in May that it plans to sue the company over its token offerings. The move by the SEC came as part of a broader assault on the crypto industry, but one that may be on <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/06/05/sec-debt-box-crypto-lawsuit-gensler-salt-lake-city/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/06/05/sec-debt-box-crypto-lawsuit-gensler-salt-lake-city/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">shaky legal ground </a>as both courts and elected officials have accused the agency of overreach. </p>



<p>As for whether Bitstamp will remain as a stand-alone brand, or be renamed as a Robinhood product, Kerbrat said it is premature to say since the deal will only be closing next year.</p>



<p>The acquisition comes nearly a year after reports that Bitstamp was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-07/crypto-exchange-bitstamp-in-fundraising-talks-seeks-expansion?sref=2jPYL79S" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-07/crypto-exchange-bitstamp-in-fundraising-talks-seeks-expansion?sref=2jPYL79S" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">in talks</a> to raise funds to expand its operations in the U.K. and Asia. At the time, the company’s CEO Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux said the company was not looking to sell itself.</p><p></p>



<p>In the Robinhood press release announcing the acquisition, Gratfieaux stated: “Bringing Bitstamp’s platform and expertise into Robinhood’s ecosystem will give users an enhanced trading experience with a continuing commitment to compliance, security, and customer-centricity.”</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Consumer Reports tested various children's snacks, including products from LesserEvil and Serenity Kids, and found that some of them contained high levels of lead, a harmful chemical that can cause health problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The snacks from LesserEvil and Serenity Kids, which are sold at retailers like Amazon, Target, and Walmart, claim to be healthier alternatives with no added sugars, but the tests found that they may not be as safe as they seem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tests revealed that two LesserEvil products and one product from Serenity Kids, which are made with cassava flour, contained high amounts of lead. This is concerning, as lead is known to be harmful to children's health, especially at an early age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Director of Food Policy at Consumer Reports, Brian Ronholm, stated that there is no safe level of lead for kids, and exposing them to it at an early age can create long-term problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tests also found harmful chemicals and metals such as arsenic, cadmium, and mercury in some of the products, although the article does not provide more details on the levels of these substances.</p>

<p><strong>Updates to Goods and Services</strong></p>

<p>In this release and in the accompanying “<a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/us-international-trade-goods-and-services-annual-revision">U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services, Annual Revision</a>” release (FT–900 Annual Revision), the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) are publishing revised statistics on trade in goods and services. With these releases, statistics on trade in goods, on both a Census basis and a balance of payments (BOP) basis, and statistics on trade in services are revised beginning with 2019.</p>

<p>Revised statistics on trade in goods reflect:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Corrections and adjustments to previously published not seasonally adjusted statistics for goods on a Census basis.</li>
	<li>End-use reclassifications of several commodities.</li>
	<li>Recalculated seasonal and trading-day adjustments.</li>
	<li>Newly available and revised source data on BOP adjustments, which are adjustments that BEA applies to goods on a Census basis to convert them to a BOP basis. See the “Goods (balance of payments basis)” section in the explanatory notes for more information.</li>
</ul>

<p>Revised statistics on trade in services reflect:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An improved estimation method for transport services.</li>
	<li>Newly available and revised source data, primarily from BEA surveys of international services.</li>
	<li>Recalculated seasonal adjustments.</li>
	<li>Revised temporal distributions of quarterly source data to monthly statistics. See the “Services” section in the explanatory notes for more information.</li>
</ul>

<p>This annual revision has not changed the overall trend in the annual goods and services deficit. The deficit was unrevised for 2019, was revised up for 2020, 2021, and 2023, and was revised down for 2022. The largest revision was for 2021 when the deficit was revised up 0.8 percent, reflecting a downward revision to the services surplus.</p>

<p>The revised statistics for goods on a BOP basis and for services will also be included in the “U.S. International Transactions, 1st Quarter 2024 and Annual Update” report and in BEA’s <a href="https://www.bea.gov/itable/international-transactions-services-and-investment-position">Interactive Data Application</a>, both to be released by BEA on June 20, 2024. For more information, see “<a href="https://apps.bea.gov/scb/issues/2024/04-april/0424-international-annual-revision-preview.htm">Preview of the 2024 Annual Update of the International Economic Accounts</a>” in the <em>Survey of Current Business</em>.</p>
