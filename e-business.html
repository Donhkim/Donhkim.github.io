	With the <a href="https://variety.com/t/skydance-media/" id="auto-tag_skydance-media" data-tag="skydance-media">Skydance Media</a> deal talks dead, the three executives leading <a href="https://variety.com/t/paramount-global/" id="auto-tag_paramount-global" data-tag="paramount-global">Paramount Global</a>’s Office of the CEO said they remain focused on a cost-cutting and growth plan for the media conglomerate as a standalone entity.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The trio — George Cheeks, president and CEO of CBS; Chris McCarthy, president and CEO, Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks; and Brian Robbins, president and Chief Executive Officer of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon — addressed the current situation in a companywide memo Wednesday. On Tuesday, Shari Redstone’s National Amusements, the controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, said <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-skydance-ends-talks-shari-redstone-1236027264/">it had ended merger talks with Skydance</a> because it was unable “to reach mutually acceptable terms regarding the potential transaction with Skydance Media for the acquisition of a controlling stake in NAI.”

<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“As you heard yesterday, the proposed transaction with Skydance Media is not moving forward. So, what does this mean for Paramount?” the execs wrote. “While the Board will always remain open to exploring strategic alternatives that create value for shareholders, we continue to focus on executing the strategic plan we unveiled last week during the Annual Shareholder Meeting, which we are confident will set the stage for growth for Paramount.”

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	At Paramount Global’s 2024 meeting of shareholders on June 4, the troika talked about their strategic “vision” going forward and outlined the plans as if Paramount will not be sold.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	At the meeting, they spoke at a high level about <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-shareholders-meeting-2024-skydance-deal-1236023661/">how they plan to cut upwards of $500 million in costs</a> annually through layoffs and other cost-reduction measures, pursue a joint venture with Paramount+ and potentially sell some assets (which they didn’t specify).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“To be clear, $500 million in cost savings is just the beginning,” Cheeks said, adding that the three co-CEOs expect to provide more details on the Q2 2024 earnings call in August.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The trio had planned to host a town hall June 5 to answer employee questions about the future of Paramount Global but, citing “ongoing speculation regarding potential M&amp;A,” they <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-town-hall-postponed-speculation-merger-skydance-1236025326/">rescheduled it for June 25</a>.

<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“We recognize that the last several months have not been easy as we manage through ongoing change and speculation,” the three co-CEOs wrote in the memo. “And, we should all expect some of this to undoubtedly continue as the media industry and our business continue to evolve.”</p>

Redstone <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-global-bob-bakish-ousted-ceo-1235984730/">gave former CEO Bob Bakish the boot on April 30</a>, reportedly over Bakish’s clash with Redstone over pursuing the deal with Skydance.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>As promised, we want to be as transparent as possible and share information whenever we can. </em></p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>Work is already underway, as we focus on three pillars:</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>• <strong>Transforming our streaming strategy</strong> to accelerate its path to profitability<br>• <strong>Streamlining the organization</strong> and reducing non-content costs<br>• <strong>Optimizing our asset mix</strong>, by divesting some of our businesses to help pay down our debt</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>As we advance each of these initiatives, we will continue to prioritize investment in our world class franchises, films, series and sports, which are the core of our business.</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>Importantly, we want to thank you for your hard work and your continued focus. We recognize that the last several months have not been easy as we manage through ongoing change and speculation. And, we should all expect some of this to undoubtedly continue as the media industry and our business continue to evolve.</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>As we look ahead, we are confident about what’s in store for Paramount. We believe in you and we believe in Paramount. We have the content, the people, and the right plan to ensure a strong future. And, we look forward to discussing our strategy in more detail at our Global Town Hall on June 25.</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>In the meantime, we hope you’re able to participate in Community Day and spend time with colleagues while giving back to local communities around the world.</em></p>

            “After the court-ordered deadline passed on September 9, 2021, the FDA could have ordered every single unauthorized e<strong>-</strong>cigarette off the market, and that’s what it should have done,” Sen.

            King said the FDA has received 27 million applications for e-cigarette products. But unlike with companies that make drugs and medical devices, which pay user fees that fund the agency’s work, the FDA is not allowed to collect fees from e-cigarette makers. King<strong> </strong>asked the Senate committee for the authority to fund this increased workload.

Over the past five years, there has been a 60% decline in the number of middle and high school students using e-cigarettes, King said.

            Enforcement of the law is the other challenge, the FDA and DOJ said at the hearing. The FDA has conducted thousands of inspections of e-cigarette manufacturers and distributors resulting in nearly 900 warning letters, King said. More than 500 warning letters have gone to retail stores, King said, but if the letters are ignored that’s as far as the FDA can go, so it must rely on the DOJ and other agencies.

            “Senator, we have been acting on a number of fronts,” Rao replied.

            Rao testified that many manufacturers whose products have been denied FDA authorization make minimal alterations and resubmit for approval. Some overseas e-cigarette makers will also misrepresent shipments in an effort to slip past regulators, and some stores make their own products.

<li>Elliott Management, an activist investment firm, is launching a campaign to oust Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan and Executive Chairman Gary Kelly due to the airline's underperformance compared to its rivals.</li>

<li>Southwest Airlines has responded to the campaign by saying that the company welcomes feedback from all shareholders, but remains confident in its CEO and leadership team's ability to evolve the business and drive long-term value for all stakeholders.</li>
<li>The campaign by Elliott and Artisan is part of an ongoing effort to address Southwest Airlines' underperformance, with Artisan's Daniel O'Keefe and Michael McKinnon stating that the company needs new leadership to drive long-term value for all stakeholders.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Discussion of Financial Statements</strong>: The speaker is asking about the difference between revenue and earnings in financial statements, and how to analyze them. The speaker explains that revenue is before expenses, while earnings (or net income) is after expenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Funding of the Agency</strong>: The speaker is discussing the funding scheme for their agency, which is funded by the Federal Reserve System's combined earnings. However, it is noted that the Federal Reserve stopped earning money in September 2022 and is now losing money, which has affected the funding scheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supreme Court Ruling</strong>: The speaker mentions that the agency has won a lawsuit in the Supreme Court, which declared the funding scheme constitutional under the Appropriations Clause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Concerns about Profitability</strong>: The speaker expresses confusion about companies making "too much money" and whether this is a concern for the agency. They mention that they analyze financial statements, but the distinction between revenue and earnings is important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accounting Principles</strong>: The speaker references Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and notes that earnings can be used in various contexts, but in accounting, net income is what is typically referred to.</p>

    is recognized thank you Mr chairman Mr director good to see you thanks for coming um I always enjoy your testimony I when I look for a Common Thread through your running throughout your testimony and I look at your your agency's behavior the one of the common threads I see is that and I'm not going to ask you to comment on this is that in in your judge some companies in America are making too much money now when you and you analyze their financial statements I do you not uh sure do you distinguish between revenue and earnings when you analyze a financial statement well sure we look at all things and I would say that we what's the difference between revenue and earnings um well these are all used locally sometimes those are similar in in gap accounting which is what most us companies don't tell me about Gap just tell me your understanding of the difference between revenue and earnings uh well I can share with you revenue and net income so those are the two factors that when you say are on financial statements earnings is another word for net income uh well earnings can you use for many different things but in in in generally AC accepted accounting principles net income is what all of our banks are really using okay well revenue is before expenses and earnings net income is after expenses is that no I think like when when people go to work they say my earnings were this I mean that their salary so I think we we tend to look at accounting definition they may say that but but and when you analyze a financial statement you look at expenses don't you if you you don't just equate Revenue with with earnings do you oh totally and and I think your suggestion that we think companies are too profitable we think about competition what are the options people have here's what I'm here's what is confusing me um we all know um unless you were playing frisbee on the quad during econ 101 or Accounting 101 there's difference between revenue and earnings um I I I want to ask about the way you're funded um I looked at congress's statute looking for it here it says here's how you're funded and and and and you just won your lawsuit in the Supreme Court um each year beginning on the designated transfer date in each quarter thereafter the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve where you get your money shall transfer to your agency from the combined earning earnings of the Federal Reserve System the amount determined by the director to be reasonably necessary to carry out the authorities of the bureau it says the combined earnings not the revenue now for the longest time the Federal Reserve was earning money but that stopped in what September of 2022 now they are losing money they don't have any earnings they're no longer transferring earnings to the general fund and the Supreme Court based its decision on saying that this funding scheme is is constitutional under the Appropriations Clause by saying that U these earnings would go to the general fund from the Federal Reserve so getting them directly from the general fund is no big deal how how are you entitled any money right now Federal Reserve doesn't have any earnings well we we've heard of this Theory I think it's one of the latest ones it's not a the it's Congressional well I I think there's a you you raised the difference between revenue and net income there are other places throughout our laws I can tell you we've looked at this issue we do believe wholeheartedly everyone is complying with the statute I know you believe that but if you look at what if you I'm aware with what you said you read the if fact I just finish my question sure if you read the opinion and I did and you read the statute it says here bigger than Dallas the federal you can only get your money from the Federal Reserve out of earnings now the Federal Reserve has not had any earnings since September of 20 20 22 isn't that correct no that's not correct from a net income persp do is but they've generated Lots come on I I appreciate what you're saying I'm happy to discuss this with you but I think we' looked my point is everything every penny you've gotten under this congression I don't think Congress wanted you gotten if I could finish my thoughts sure I know you don't like to hear this but the law is the law you've been operating illegally no that's not true sir yes you have there have been no earnings doesn't this put in Jeopardy every one of your rules we've heard this everyone and every well you're going to hear it again because it's the law we didn't say Revenue in the statute we said earnings how how can you possibly argue that the Federal Reserve has had earnings they're losing money I'm happy to discuss this with you but we have looked at this Theory before I know you have but yeah I'm over I'm sorry tell me why you're mad at Chase B you're not that sorry Senator but go ahead you're mad at PayPal and Chase Bank can you tell me real quickly before shared Cuts me off why you're mad the concern is that we have seen an incident at PayPal where there was an attempt to censor People based on their speech we've also seen that those companies are now going to be offering reportedly Advertising based on your individual transaction data I I I feel some of this is something we all need to figure out together are you gonna punish every company that has censored people speech I do think I applaud that part oh I I think censorship have approve no I think we should I think we're on the same page I'm over I'm sorry thanks for your Indulgence Mr chairman you're not sorry and I wasn't indulging you but thank you Senator I'm I'm Sor as I could be well I will send you later Senator Warner fruit basket to make up thank you Mr ch

								<p>Donald Trump vocalized his support for <a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/bitcoin" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> — and for bringing mining operations for the digital currency to the United States — in a Truth Social post, weeks after championing the crime-linked coin at the Libertarian National Convention, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/05/26/libertarian-convention-booing/">to boos</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112601639679885930">post</a>, put up minutes before midnight Eastern time on Tuesday, reads “VOTE FOR TRUMP! Bitcoin mining may be our last line of defense against a CBDC,” or a central bank digital currency, a digital form of currency that a bank like the Federal Reserve could hypothetically implement. </p>
<p>Though he rallied against the niche potential currency, Trump also demonstrated his lack of digital fluency in the post, arguing that making, or mining, all Bitcoin in the United States will “help us be ENERGY DOMINANT.” Bitcoin mining is among the most energy-intensive computer processes, and there is no link between energy production and the invented currency.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which reached an all-time value high this March, have grown significantly in popularity over the past several years, but it's unlikely that Trump’s attempt to court the crypto-bro vote will be a decisive factor in the election, with a 2023 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/10/majority-of-americans-arent-confident-in-the-safety-and-reliability-of-cryptocurrency/">Pew poll</a> finding that the vast majority of Americans reject the currency as a safe and reliable store of value.</p>
<p>Trump also attacked "Biden’s hatred of Bitcoin," claiming that he was helping foreign powers by not embracing the inherently worthless tokens. </p>
<p>While the Biden administration has been mostly quiet on the issue of Bitcoin, and the Biden campaign <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/299851/biden-campaign-in-talks-to-accept-crypto-donations-through-coinbase-commerce-sources">reportedly</a> even considered accepting the digital commodity in donations, Democrats in the Senate advanced a bill through the intelligence select committee which would <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/10/senate-bill-could-open-crypto-to-us-sanctions-but-industry-trying-to-head-it-off/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cryptocodex&amp;cdlcid=5d67e01f195063fa4f65341a">place more scrutiny</a> on cryptocurrency transactions, worrying some traders.</p>
<p>The highly-volatile digital coins have been linked to numerous illicit activities, including drug and human trafficking, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/12/14/cryptocurrency-was-always-a-scam%E2%80%94powered-by-male-privilege/">scams,</a> and terrorism. The coins’ use of a blockchain, which anonymizes the exchange process, makes them ideal for crime. Cryptocurrency exchange boss Sam Bankman-Fried <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/03/28/lack-of-any-remorse-tears-into-sam-bankman-fried-as-he-sentences-him-to-25-years/">landed 25 years</a> in prison after defrauding customers and investors to the tune of nearly $10 billion. </p>
