<ol>
<li>Activists held a press conference to protest the expansion of Tesla's electric car factory in Germany, claiming that local residents have not had their concerns heard by the company and the Brandenburg state government.</li>
<li>At least 1,000 protesters participated in the protest, with the Disrupt Tesla group stating that the issue goes beyond Tesla and affects other auto manufacturers as well.</li>
<li>The protest was largely peaceful, with some minor clashes between police and activists, but no information was provided on injuries or arrests.</li>
<li>The protesters accused local politicians of betraying their trust and ignoring the concerns of local residents, with some residents claiming that the company and government are not listening to their concerns.</li>
<li>The protesters are planning to engage in civil disobedience to bring attention to their cause and prevent the expansion of the factory, with the Disrupt Tesla group stating that they "must prevent this and will prevent it".</li>

<p>At least 1,000 activists participated in the protests, according to police.</p>

<p>Their comments came as authorities readied for a repeat of <a class="internal-link" href="/en/protesters-attempt-to-storm-teslas-factory-near-berlin/a-69046103">violent clashes between police and demonstrators the previous day</a>.<br>

<p>A police spokesperson said that the march on Saturday largely proceeded peacefully.</p>

<p>Police said that there had been minor clashes with activists, but did not initially provide any information on injuries or arrests.</p>

<h2>What did the protesters say?</h2>

<p>The Disrupt Tesla group said the political and environmental problem went beyond the <a class="internal-link" href="/en/elon-musk/t-63587027">Elon Musk</a>-owned carmaker and extended to other auto manufacturers.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter if it's Tesla, VW or Mercedes — car companies and their political supporters are responsible for selling out our lifeblood," said Disrupt Tesla group spokeswoman Lucia Mende, ahead of a planned demonstration.</p>

<p>"We must prevent this and we will prevent it," she added.</p>

<p>Some residents in Grünheide, where <a class="internal-link" href="/en/germany-elon-musk-visits-tesla-factory-after-power-sabotage/a-68511988">billionaire Musk</a> has built his only European Tesla factory, say both the company and the Brandenburg state government have not paid attention to citizens' interests in pressing ahead with the expansion.</p>

<p>"They are going through with it, they are not listening to the sensitivities of the local people," said spokesman Steffen Schorcht, a spokesman for a citizens' initiative. "It only serves the interests of Tesla."</p><div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"><h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Taking on Tesla — Fight for the Forest" class="headline"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"><g fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"></path></g></svg>Taking on Tesla — Fight for the Forest</h2><div class="render-container"><div class="sc-djLfiL bWQlcR sc-gSYeb fALeZZ"><div class="bg-poster"><video id="video-68996009" dir="ltr" controls="" playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-duration="12:36" data-play-btn-title="Play video" class="dw-player video-js vjs-fluid"><source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/repoe/repoe20240504_gesamtHD_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"><track src="https://www.dw.com/media/subtitles/69045611" srclang="en" label="ENGLISH"><p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p></track></source></video></div></div></div></div>

<p>"If you're fighting and keep hitting a wall and don't know what else to do, then sometimes the only thing left is civil disobedience."</p>

<h2>Police prepared for further flare-ups</h2>

<p>Police said they were braced for more trouble after multiple people were arrested after activists attempted to break into the factory on Friday evening.  </p>

<p>Regional broadcaster RBB said several hundred people ran toward the Tesla facility, with many wearing masks and dressed in black.</p>

<p>Hundreds of demonstrators had gathered near the site on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>"We are aware," said a police spokesman adding that the situation had been calm in the night and the morning.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Activists set up a protest camp, including tree houses, near the factory in late February and have been there ever since. </span></p>

<p>Opponents of the expansion, which would include a freight depot and requires forest to be cleared, say their concerns are chiefly environmental.</p>

<p>They criticize the production of electric cars in general and have cited fears about the possible pollution of local drinking water.</p>

<p>Activists also cite environmental destruction in countries like Argentina or <a class="internal-link" href="/en/russia-china-ahead-in-race-for-bolivias-lithium/a-67843534">Bolivia where the mineral lithium, needed for electric car batteries, is mined</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Tesla's CEO Elon Musk told staff on April 15 that the company plans to cut more than 10% of its workforce.</li>
<li>This comes as Tesla staff entered their fourth straight week of layoff notices.</li>
<li>Musk's focus has shifted towards Tesla, similar to how he approached the company after acquiring Twitter in 2022, which involved selling some of his Tesla shares to fund the purchase.</li>
<li>The layoffs are part of a broader restructuring effort at Tesla, with some employees describing the atmosphere as "chaos" and "uncertainty".</li>
<li>The exact reasons behind the layoffs are unclear, but it's been reported that Tesla is facing challenges in the electric vehicle market, including supply chain disruptions and global economic downturns.</li>

The surge in retirees is <a href="https://www.empower.com/the-currency/money/silver-wave-4-million-americans-will-turn-65-2024#:~:text=Turning%2065%20in%202024%20is,of%2010%2C000%20the%20decade%20before." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:expected to last through 2027;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="0">expected to last through 2027</a>.</p><p>While boomers have had decades to save, invest, and prepare for the next chapter, there are a few strategies they may have overlooked. For those nearing retirement, here are five tips from financial advisors to maximize money—and longevity—in the golden years.</p><h2>1. Consider a <strong>Roth conversion</strong></h2><p>Most people are familiar with 401(k)s and IRAs, but there are other retirement accounts that belong in your financial plan, like a Roth IRA. Though they are usually thought to be best for younger workers due to the <a href="https://www.schwab.com/ira/roth-ira/contribution-limits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:income cap on contributions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0">income cap on contributions</a>, you can still get the benefits of a Roth even if you make too much to contribute to one outright, via a Roth conversion.</p><p>As the name implies, the strategy involves converting your traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. When you make the conversion, you’re essentially moving funds from a pre-tax vehicle to a post-tax vehicle; you’ll pay taxes on the money now at your current rate, and then it will grow tax-free.</p><p>The benefits are plenty, advisors say. You’ll enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement (assuming you meet the other requirements) and no required-minimum distributions during your lifetime. This is a good way to add tax diversification to your financial plan and reduce your lifetime tax bill.</p><h2>2. Optimize your taxable account</h2><p>Speaking of which, tax diversification can go beyond 401(k)s and IRAs. Taxable accounts also play an important role, and it's important to know which to tap first.</p><p>"With a 401(k) or IRA, it is all pre-tax and subject to income tax, so the federal and state government may 'own' around 30% to 50% of those accounts," says Scott Bishop, a Texas-based certified financial planner (CFP). "If money is in a Roth IRA or taxable brokerage account, the results may be different."</p><p>A taxable account doesn't have the tax benefits of a retirement account, but it also doesn't have the restrictions they do. It allows you to invest for the future, but without the contribution limits, withdrawal penalties, required distributions, and so on.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>It is especially useful to have some funds in a brokerage account if you're not sure what tax bracket you'll be in in retirement; withdrawals from a taxable account are taxed at the <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/smart-money/capital-gains-tax-rates" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:capital gains rate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="0">capital gains rate</a>, whereas money taken out of a 401(k) is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate (which will likely be higher). And with a taxable account, only the gains are taxed, whereas the entire withdrawal from a 401(k) is. Having an array of accounts allows you to develop a strategic withdrawal strategy.</p><p>"Just as you diversify your investments to help tackle the uncertainty of the markets, diversifying the tax treatment of your accounts can help you weather the uncertainty of the tax landscape and manage your income in retirement," writes Judith Ward, a CFP, for <a href="https://www.troweprice.com/personal-investing/resources/insights/4-reasons-to-save-for-retirement-in-a-taxable-account.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:T. Rowe Price;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0">T. Rowe Price</a>.</p><p>And of course, you will want a chunk of money set aside in cash, in case of emergency. Wes Battle, a Maryland-based CFP, says the ideal amount is six months' worth of expenses.</p><h2>3. Delay Social Security</h2><p>Though some people are eligible to start taking Social Security benefits as early as 62, financial advisors say it's best to postpone doing so until age 70, or at least to when you reach the so-called full retirement age, if at all possible. That will increase the benefit amount and help you lower your taxable income, because you will have spent some of your savings from your other retirement accounts first. "This is one of the most overlooked opportunities in financial planning," says Andy Baxley, a CFP in Illinois.</p><p>The full retirement age depends on when you were born. For those born in 1960 or later, full retirement age is 67. For those born between 1955 through the end of 1959, it is between 66 and 2 months and 66 and 10 months. If you were born before 1955, it is 66 (and you've already reached it). Delaying until age 70 means you can earn a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/delayret.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"delayed retirement" credit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link " data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="0">"delayed retirement" credit</a>, which gets you a higher benefit.</p><p>Even if 70 isn't likely, delaying them even a few years or months can make a big difference in the size of the check you end up getting. You can view your projected benefit amount on your annual Social Security statement, which you can view on the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/statement.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Social Security Administration's website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="0">Social Security Administration's website</a>.</p><h2>4. Fine-tune your budget</h2><p>Many people (and <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/06/22/americans-save-millions-work-longer-to-retire-comfortably/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:financial media;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="0">financial media</a>) focus on reaching a <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/17/comfortable-retirement-requires-saving-more-than-one-million/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:magic retirement savings "number,";elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link " data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="0">magic retirement savings "number,"</a> be it $1 million or <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/10/magic-retirement-number-financial-advisors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$1.46 million or more;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="0">$1.46 million or more</a>. But the more important numbers for near-retirees to focus on are actually those in their retirement budget, says Bishop. They can be broken into the following categories:</p><ol class="caas-list"><li><p><strong>Fixed costs</strong>. That's your mortgage or rent, insurance, property taxes, food, healthcare, and so on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discretionary costs</strong>. That includes estimated expenses for the fun things you'll do in retirement, including traveling, dining out, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Planned future costs</strong>. Fixed and discretionary costs may make up most of your budget most of the time, but you can run into trouble if you're not anticipating other expenses, like home repair costs, new cars, long-term care, etc.</p></li></ol><p>The budget "needs to be thoughtful and conservative," Bishop says. An advisor can help you think through contingent costs and craft one that works for your family.</p><p>That said, your budget can always change. Sandi Weaver, a CFP in Kansas, suggests testing out a monthly withdrawal amount for around six months, and then readjusting as needed. Expenses change in retirement, and it's okay for your plan to change too.</p><p>"Don't sweat the small stuff," Weaver says. "The retirement phase is long, [potentially] 30-plus years, so if you get the finances wrong for one to two years, you can get it back on track."</p><h2>5. Make an 'unretirement plan'</h2><p>Finally, advisors say while getting the finances and tax strategies right is important, equally so is making the most of your days in retirement: You have a financial plan, but you'll want a holistic life plan as well. How will you keep your mind and body healthy? Are you interested in volunteering? Would part-time work be better? Do you want to help with your grandkids? Without some forethought, it might be more difficult than you think to easily fill your time.</p><p>One strategy is to <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/16/baby-boomers-unretirement-plans-not-your-grandparents-retirement/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:create a so-called unretirement plan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="0">create a so-called unretirement plan</a>. Outlined by Mark Walton, a Peabody award-winning journalist, in his book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unretired-Highly-Effective-People-Happily/dp/1736009400/ref=sr_1_1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Unretired: How Highly Effective People Live Happily Ever After;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="0">Unretired: How Highly Effective People Live Happily Ever After</a></em>, this involves thinking through what fascinates you and what you could dedicate your time to in retirement. It could be (full- or part-time) work, though it doesn't have to be.</p><p>"Soon-to-be retirees should keep in mind that those who are retiring to something are more successful than those that are retiring from something," says Howard Pressman, a Virginia-based CFP. "Twenty-four hours is a long time if you're just sitting on the porch yelling at the neighborhood kids to stay off your lawn."</p><p>He suggests asking yourself questions including, where will you live? How will you stay engaged? How will you stay active? How will you replace lost social connections from work?</p><p>"The clearer this vision is, the easier the transition will be," says Pressman.

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">At the start of the year, Tesla’s Supercharger team was tasked with the impossible. “We were on an exponential path,” a former team member told TechCrunch, adding that the new targets were “super-duper crazy.” Despite the bottlenecks that such expectations can create, “every time they upped the metric, we met it.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Then, one day in April, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/30/elon-musk-tesla-charging-policy-layoffs-cuts/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/30/elon-musk-tesla-charging-policy-layoffs-cuts/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="0" mrfobservableid="6cc14035-c09f-4efe-84a8-c636a61f199a">CEO Elon Musk axed the entire division</a>, even though it was profitable last year. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">With more than<a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity-locations#/analyze?country=US&amp;fuel=ELEC&amp;ev_networks=Tesla" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-mrf-link="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity-locations#/analyze?country=US&amp;fuel=ELEC&amp;ev_networks=Tesla" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="1" mrfobservableid="58d9fc15-0c1f-45ca-aee9-2df9e5e08270"> 25,000 charging ports</a> in the U.S. and over 50,000 worldwide, the Supercharger network is the undisputed king of EV fast charging. Widespread, well-maintained and fast, the network has transformed the way people viewed EVs, assuaging concerns about range anxiety for wide swaths of the car-buying public. But with the recent layoffs, Musk cast a cloud over the private infrastructure project.</p>

	
	


	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While some people expected layoffs to hit the Supercharger division, few thought it would be eliminated. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“We built the best network in the world,” according to the former Tesla employee who spoke to TechCrunch. “We were minding the ship. Nothing was frivolous.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It wasn’t enough to save the team. Hundreds of people who were responsible for the construction of a linchpin for the company were suddenly gone. That wipeout has industry watchers, shareholders and former Tesla employees wondering how it will affect EV owners and the company. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The automaker has hit a rough patch lately, with sales not growing at their usual breakneck pace. Price cuts aimed at boosting sales have affected profits, which were<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/23/tesla-profits-drop-55-company-says-ev-sales-under-pressure-from-hybrids/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/23/tesla-profits-drop-55-company-says-ev-sales-under-pressure-from-hybrids/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="2" mrfobservableid="7b66ef63-c4d8-4ea3-b335-186736e28cfe"> down 55%</a> in the first quarter from the same year-ago period. With Tesla getting squeezed, Musk made cuts — not with a scalpel, but with a chainsaw.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Before the layoffs, the Supercharger network appeared poised to extend its lead over competitors. </p>

	
	


	
	


<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_97.jpg?w=680" alt="" class="wp-image-2770289" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_97.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_97.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_97.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_97.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_97.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_97.jpg?resize=1200,801 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_97.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tesla</figcaption></figure>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">One source explained that Tesla had refined production and installation of Superchargers to the point where each post could cost as little as $20,000 to install, less than half the nearest competitor. A significantly more powerful version 4 of the Supercharger hardware, once poised for a broader rollout, now appears stalled.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At the time of the layoffs, dozens of Supercharger sites were in various stages of planning and construction, according to insider information shared with TechCrunch. Some sites that were almost ready to be opened are either in limbo or may not be opened at all, the source said.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Tesla was previously in a strong position to win awards through the federally funded National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which has $5 billion to disburse to build a robust nationwide network of fast chargers. </p>

	
	


	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company had also been focusing its expansion plans on places with high demand, they added. Where the federal government was interested in improving coverage on a certain route and demand hadn’t yet materialized, Tesla’s policy team would prioritize winning NEVI funding for the site, according to the source.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“Everything was purposeful. Everything had a target,” one source told TechCrunch..</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Often that meant building Superchargers at new sites, which are more straightforward to develop. Expanding existing ones is incredibly challenging, the source said, because leases often need to be renegotiated, utility upgrades coordinated and existing infrastructure worked around, all while continuing to serve existing customers. “Your cost per stall is exponentially higher than a fresh site.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Analysts have long speculated that the Supercharger network could easily become a<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/08/25/tesla-supercharger-network-billion-business-wedbush/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-mrf-link="https://electrek.co/2023/08/25/tesla-supercharger-network-billion-business-wedbush/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="6" mrfobservableid="f14de3ab-f28f-40f2-a56e-3f4b0dfaaa17"> profit center</a>, much like Amazon did when it opened its cloud services to other companies. But there, Tesla had Amazon beat: The Supercharger team was told that the network was profitable, the source said, even before other automakers gained access.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Tesla opened the first Supercharger station in September 2012 as the first examples of the Model S prowled the streets. Early models could deliver 100 kW, which was a big number at the time: CHAdeMO, a competing standard used by the Nissan Leaf, maxed out at 62.5 kW at the time, and the Combined Charging System (CCS) was still in the prototype phase.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The first stations opened in California, and soon more started sprouting up along highways on the East Coast, then the Midwest and Texas. Within a year, the company upgraded the equipment, bumping maximum power to 120 kW. And within three years, Tesla had a network that<a href="https://supercharge.info/map" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-mrf-link="https://supercharge.info/map" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="7" mrfobservableid="2d473737-1c2a-4c97-9c84-8c3cab72a5bf"> spanned the U.S.</a>, making coast-to-coast electric travel possible. As the company entered Europe, China and other countries, it added Superchargers there, too. Today, the network supports nearly 60,000 charging stalls on four continents.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In the early years, Tesla Model S and X owners enjoyed unlimited charging at the stations — an incentive aimed at winning over new customers. When the Model 3 rolled out, the company started billing new owners for charging sessions, though the process was far easier than what competitors offered. Drivers simply had to plug the car in, and Tesla would bill a credit card on file.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Today’s Supercharger posts support up to 250 kW charging speeds. Other networks top out at 350 kW, but they aren’t nearly as reliable. Tesla says its <a href="https://www.tesla.com/impact/product" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-mrf-link="https://www.tesla.com/impact/product" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="8" mrfobservableid="6c4a8517-942f-4306-92ba-15583733fbd3">network’s uptime is 99.95%</a>, far better than its competitors. Real-world usage suggests that’s not far from the truth: A University of California–Berkeley survey of EV drivers in the San Francisco Bay Area found that while 25% of non-Tesla drivers experienced major problems with public chargers, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16372#:~:text=For%20public%20EV%20charging%20stations,of%20the%20time%20based%20on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-mrf-link="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16372#:~:text=For%20public%20EV%20charging%20stations,of%20the%20time%20based%20on" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="9" mrfobservableid="ab1daf8a-c2cd-4444-81fe-7d90941554c7">only 4% of Tesla drivers did at Superchargers</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For over a decade, Superchargers were available only to Tesla owners. Because charge sessions had to be initiated by a handshake between the vehicle and the charger, and because billing happened behind the scenes, Tesla had tight control over who could use them. The company’s proprietary plug design didn’t hurt, either.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">That started to change in the fall of 2022, when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/11/tesla-opens-its-ev-connector-design-to-other-automakers/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/11/tesla-opens-its-ev-connector-design-to-other-automakers/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="10" mrfobservableid="753d9591-348e-4024-b17e-474b08811206">made the details of its plug design available</a> to other automakers. (By that point, Tesla was already using the same communications protocol as CCS when charging.) Then, in May 2023, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/25/ford-to-bring-teslas-charging-tech-into-its-future-evs/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/25/ford-to-bring-teslas-charging-tech-into-its-future-evs/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="11" mrfobservableid="e4f3b9a4-2af3-4d7e-ba6f-76d70d22cf66">Ford announced</a> that it would adopt Tesla’s plug design, known as the North American Charging Standard, and that its customers would gain access to 12,000 Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada. Soon,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/30/electrify-america-nacs/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/30/electrify-america-nacs/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="12" mrfobservableid="502bffde-c7db-4271-bdc6-bf79959aa81d"> the floodgates opened</a>, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/gm-follows-fords-lead-and-adopts-tesla-chargers/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/gm-follows-fords-lead-and-adopts-tesla-chargers/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="13" mrfobservableid="f859d554-bd9d-4773-b321-a11ab2d5b628"> GM</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/25/rivian-adopts-tesla-charging-standard-cruise-adds-android-and-ford-lands-a-9-2b-loan/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/25/rivian-adopts-tesla-charging-standard-cruise-adds-android-and-ford-lands-a-9-2b-loan/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="14" mrfobservableid="bc447511-dab2-4c65-8087-ebed72605acd"> Rivian</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/27/volvo-becomes-latest-automaker-to-adopt-tesla-ev-charging-standard/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/27/volvo-becomes-latest-automaker-to-adopt-tesla-ev-charging-standard/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="15" mrfobservableid="ec4079b4-b096-42ba-92c9-72491fe44d76"> Volvo</a> and others followed suit.

                                        <p>As cars and trucks get smarter and more connected, the humble lights that have controlled the flow of traffic for more than a century could also be on the cusp of a major transformation.</p><p>Researchers are exploring ways to use features in modern cars, such as GPS, to make traffic safer and more efficient. Eventually, the upgrades could do away entirely with the red, yellow and green lights of today, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hoboken-zero-traffic-deaths-daylighting-pedestrian-safety-007dec67706c1c09129da1436a3d9762">ceding control to driverless cars</a></span>.</p><p>Henry Liu, a civil engineering professor who is leading a study through the University of Michigan, said the rollout of a new traffic signal system could be a lot closer than people realize.</p><p>“The pace of artificial intelligence progress is very fast, and I think it’s coming,” he said.</p><p>Traffic lights haven’t changed much in the U.S. over the years. Cleveland debuted what is considered the first “municipal traffic control system” in 1914, historian Megan Kate Nelson <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/brief-history-stoplight-180968734/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote for Smithsonian Magazine</a></span>. Powered by the electricity from the city’s trolley line, engineer James Hodge’s invention featured two lights: red and green, the colors long used by railroads. A police officer sitting in a booth on the sidewalk had to flip a switch to change the signal.</p>
    

<p>A few years later, Detroit police officer William Potts is credited with adding the yellow light, though as a city employee he couldn’t patent it. By 1930, Nelson wrote, all major American cities and many smaller ones had at least one <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/blind-pedestrians-safer-crosswalks-signals-chicago-61d62685127d3e2228e91860e2c998b2">electrical traffic signal</a></span>.</p>



<p>The advent of connected and automated vehicles, though, has presented a world of new possibilities for traffic signals.</p>
    
<p>Among those reimagining traffic flows is a team at North Carolina State University led by Ali Hajbabaie, an associate engineering professor. Rather than doing away with today’s traffic signals, Hajbabaie suggests adding a fourth light, perhaps a white one, to indicate when there are enough autonomous vehicles on the road to take charge and lead the way.</p>
    

<p>“When we get to the intersection, we stop if it’s red and we go if it’s green,” said Hajbabaie, whose team used model cars small enough to hold. “But if the white light is active, you just follow the vehicle in front of you.”</p><p>Although Hajbabaie’s research refers to a “white phase” and possibly even a white light, the specific color isn’t important, he said. Current lights could even suffice, say, by modifying them to flash red and green simultaneously to signal that driverless cars are in charge. The key would be making sure that it’s universally adopted like the current signals are.</p><p>Using such an approach would be years away, as it would require 40% to 50% of vehicles on the road to be self-driving in order to work, Hajbabaie acknowledged.</p><p>Waymo spokesperson Sandy Karp pointed out that the self-driving car subsidiary of Google’s parent company launched a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/waymo-google-robotaxis-driverless-los-angeles-expansion-6f06b65b5ad14f3f19609190c64d131f">fully autonomous ride-sharing service</a></span> in Los Angeles and Austin, Texas, even without the addition of a fourth traffic light.</p><p>“While it is good at this early stage of AV development that people are thinking creatively about how to facilitate the safe deployment of safe AVs, policymakers and infrastructure owners should be careful about jumping too soon on AV-specific investments that may turn out to be premature or even unnecessary,” Karp said in an email to The Associated Press.</p>
    

<p>University of Michigan researchers have taken a different approach. They conducted a pilot program in the Detroit suburb of Birmingham using insights from the speed and location data found in General Motors vehicles to alter the timing of that city’s traffic lights. The researchers recently landed a U.S. Department of Transportation grant under the bipartisan infrastructure law to test how to make the changes in real time.</p><p>Because the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45427-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michigan research</a></span> deals with vehicles that have drivers, not fully autonomous ones, it could be much closer to wider implementation than what Hajbabaie is seeking.</p><p>Liu, who has been leading the Michigan research, said even with as little as 6% of the vehicles on Birmingham’s streets connected to the GM system, they provide enough data to adjust the timing of the traffic lights to smooth the flow.</p>
    

<p>The 34 traffic signals in Birmingham were chosen because, like more than half of the signals nationwide, they’re set to a fixed-time schedule without any cameras or sensors to monitor congestion. Liu said although there are higher-tech solutions to monitoring traffic, they require cities to make complex and expensive upgrades.</p><p>“The beauty of this is you don’t have to do anything to the infrastructure,” Liu said. “The data is not coming from the infrastructure. It’s coming from the car companies.”</p><p>Danielle Deneau, director of traffic safety at the Road Commission in Oakland County, Michigan, said the initial data in Birmingham only adjusted the timing of green lights by a few seconds, but it was still enough to reduce congestion. Even bigger changes could be in store under the new grant-funded research, which would automate the traffic lights in a yet-to-be announced location in the county.</p>

"We have nurses now who have never seen paper charts. I started with paper charts, but those have been long gone."</p><p>"Do you even teach nurses how to file paper records anymore?" TMJ4's Mariam Mackar asked.</p><p>"We teach them how to chart very well, but no, we do not teach them how to paper and pencil chart anymore."</p><p>Now, health professionals across the board at Ascension hospitals are forced to learn how to.</p><p>"In the old days we had papers that said 'prep notes', 'lab reports'—those don’t exist anymore," Litwack explained.</p><figure class="Figure" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

<p>The Dean told TMJ4 that the multi-day computer system failure has majorly impacted how doctors and nurses operate.</p><p>"It really has brought healthcare systems to a standstill. We don't have mechanisms in place to deal with this. We don't know how to contact patients if you can’t look up phone numbers, we can’t order prescriptions, we can’t look at lab tests."</p><p>Litwack explains the situation is the equivalent of having to re-learn your day-to-day operations.</p><p>And though schools don't teach students how to paper chart anymore, the rising frequency of cyber-attacks on healthcare giants means crisis management might make its way to the curriculum.</p><p>"I think we have to start bringing it up. We have to bring it up with our nursing staff, we bring it up with physical therapy," Litwack said.</p><p>There's no telling how long before this Ascension outage is fixed.</p><hr>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Target has launched a new "woke" holiday merchandise collection, including products like "tuck-friendly" swimsuits and rainbow-themed items.</li>
<li>The collection will be available in only "select stores", with the company citing consumer feedback and historical sales performance to determine which stores will carry the products.</li>
<li>This move comes after Target faced backlash last year for its LGBTQ+ products, including products that some consumers found offensive or inappropriate.</li>
<li>Target had previously planned to stock its Pride collection in all of its 2,000 US stores, but due to the backlash, the company will now only stock the products in about half of its stores.</li>
<li>The decision to limit the availability of the Pride collection comes after the company faced criticism for promoting LGBT+ politics and products, with some groups calling for a boycott of Target.</li>

<p><span>For six decades, Jim Simons was Stony Brook University’s most vocal champion. His teaching, research, academic and volunteer leadership, and philanthropy have forever transformed the university and his generosity of spirit was matched only by his probing intelligence and profound optimism for the future. Whether as chair of the Department of Mathematics or his leadership on the Stony Brook Foundation Board of Trustees, Jim always saw Stony Brook’s potential. He looked beyond what </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> and saw what </span><i><span>could</span></i><span> be — and he helped bring that future to life.  </span></p>
<p><span>“Jim was a remarkable friend and advocate, both to Stony Brook and to me personally. I am honored to have known him,” said Stony Brook University President Maurie McInnis. “Stony Brook is incredibly fortunate to have been a part of his life and to have shared in his generosity, brilliance, humor, and unending curiosity about the world around him. The University is infinitely better because of Jim, from the students he taught to the research he led, the faculty he supported, and the programs he helped build</span><i><span>.”</span></i></p>
<p><b>An Enduring Impact</b></p>
<p><span>When Stony Brook President John Toll hired Jim to lead the Department of Mathematics in 1968, he could not have foreseen the magnitude of his decision. As the youngest chair in the history of the university, Jim joked that he was given the opportunity because he was the only person who would accept the challenge. Jim’s stereotypical humor aside, he brought his curiosity and intellect to bear on the role and built one of the nation’s top math departments during his 10-year tenure as chair.</span></p>
<p><span> Jim unassumingly credited his success to the team he recruited: “I was able to hire some great people…and we really built up an outstanding department. And that was fun.” </span></p>

Yang.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>One of his most prized relationships was with his colleague in the Department of Physics, Nobel Prize winner C.N. Yang and founding director of the eponymous Institute for Theoretical Physics on Stony Brook’s campus. Their many conversations inspired Jim’s deep interest in the intersection of geometry and physics, ultimately leading to the establishment of the renowned Simons Center for Geometry and Physics (SCGP). </span></p>
<p><span>“From Archimedes to Newton to Einstein, much of the most profound work in physics has been deeply intertwined with the geometric side of mathematics,” said Jim upon the 2008 announcement of the gift that would fund the SCGP. “Since then, in particular with the advent of such areas as quantum field theory and string theory, developments in geometry and physics have become if anything more interrelated. The new Center will give many of the world’s best mathematicians and physicists the opportunity to work and interact in an environment and an architecture carefully designed to enhance progress. We believe there is a chance that work accomplished at the Center will significantly change and deepen our understanding of the physical universe and of its basic mathematical structure.”</span></p>
<p><span>Since then, the SCGP has evolved into an internationally renowned think tank whose permanent members have been elected as Fellows of the Royal Society, the American Mathematical Society, the Japanese National Academy of Sciences, as well as received the Fields Medal, Shaw Prize, Packard Fellowship, Clay Research Award and  Dannie Heineman Prize as well as many other awards. </span></p>

<p><span>Beyond his academic leadership, Jim helped inspire the next generation of volunteer leaders through his participation in and stewardship of the Stony Brook Foundation Board of Trustees. </span></p>
<p><span>“One of the great privileges of my life has been to know and work with Jim Simons for the past three decades,” said Richard Gelfond ’76, Stony Brook Foundation Board of Trustees Chair. “His service on the Board strengthened all of us. He had a way of immediately getting to the fundamental issues and asking the right questions. His unique wit, incredible intellect and philanthropy, particularly toward Stony Brook, will always be remembered. I will miss him mightily.”</span></p>
<p><b>Philanthropy on an Astonishing Scale</b></p>
<p><span>Jim’s influence at Stony Brook extends far beyond his intellectual contributions. He met his wife Marilyn through Stony Brook, and together they created an extraordinary legacy of impactful philanthropy for the university that has </span><span>surpassed $1 billion. As if their own remarkable contributions weren’t enough, the Simons directly inspired more than 2,100 people to contribute an additional $230 million in philanthropy for scholarships, faculty support, and the university’s endowment.</span></p>
<p><span>Through Jim and Marilyn’s foresight, strategic counsel, and investment, they have been instrumental in making Stony Brook a highly ranked national research university and an unmatched agent of progress and social mobility.</span></p>
<p><span>Examples of some of Jim and Marilyn’s substantial investments include:</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><b>Simons Center for Geometry and Physics (SCGP)</b>,<span> which opened at Stony Brook University in 2010 thanks to Jim and Marilyn’s philanthropic support and Jim’s belief that progress in mathematics and theoretical physics can be made when researchers come together in an environment that encourages the sharing of ideas, bridging divides and increasing innovation. </span></p>
<p><span>In addition to the center, the Simons established the </span><b>Simons Math and Physics Operating Funds</b><span> to ensure that Stony Brook’s Mathematics and Physics departments consistently rank among the top in the nation.</span></p>

<p><span>The Simons also played a significant role in elevating what is now the renowned</span><b> Renaissance School of Medicine</b>. <span>Through a matching challenge gift announced in 2011, Jim and Marilyn transformed research across several areas of the medical and life sciences. Ultimately, their matching gift and the philanthropy it inspired provided critical funding for research excellence in the School of Medicine as well as other parts of the university, faculty hires through new endowed professorships, and recruitment of top-level graduate and undergraduate students. As a result of this historic investment, Stony Brook was able to build the Center for Medical and Research Translation (MART). </span></p>
<p><span>Announced in late 2020, the </span><b>Presidential Innovation and Excellence Fund</b><span> has enabled Stony Brook to attract preeminent scholars, pursue cutting-edge research, and win leadership of the Center for Climate Solutions on Governors Island through the New York Climate Exchange.The Simons Foundation provided seed money for the fund, with a matching challenge that attracted additional philanthropy from other generous donors. This fund makes it possible for Stony Brook to invest in current strengths and pursue big and bold opportunities that address the world’s most critical challenges of the future.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">“Jim was among the finest people I’ve ever known,” said Samuel L. Stanley, Jr., MD. “His magnificent mind was enhanced by his vision and optimism. The result was an incomparable leader and philanthropist who has helped provide Stony Brook with infinite possibilities and the capacity to reach unparalleled heights in the areas of research, education and discovery. ”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Jim was not only mathematically brilliant but also a visionary advisor about what Stony Brook could — and did — become,” Shirley Strum Kenny said. “Stony Brook would not be Stony Brook without Jim’s vision and commitment.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The satisfaction of seeing Stony Brook thrive fueled their generosity, as Jim reflected: “Stony Brook gave me a chance to lead —and so it has been deeply rewarding to watch the University grow and flourish even more.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Jim Simons leaves a tremendous and incomparable legacy at Stony Brook University,” reflected President McInnis. “His inquisitiveness, vision, caring, and extraordinary philanthropy have made an indelible and irreplaceable impact on every corner of the University. Through his generosity, his intellect, and his leadership he will continue to enrich lives and advance science and knowledge at Stony Brook for generations to come.”</p>

<p>A new study revealed both Gen Z and millennials are fearful of financial insecurity and homelessness in the coming years.</p>



<p>The study <a href="https://www.acorns.com/learn/acorns/money-matters-report-2024/">from Acorns</a> showed that 29% of Gen Z and 32% of Millennials shared this fear. The study began back in February with nearly 5,000 participants over the age of 18.</p>



<p>For just over a week, respondents from Gen X, boomers, and the Silent Generation were asked about their finances, leading to findings that a sizeable amount of Gen Z and millennials living in financial fear.</p>



<p>Additionally, the survey revealed both Gen Z and millennials obsess over money, capping between 28% and 33%.</p>



<p>The survey also showed each group to be more worried about homelessness, versus their boomer counterparts.</p>



<p>“Everyday Americans are so concerned about their finances that nearly 1 in 4 worry about experiencing homelessness,” <a href="https://www.acorns.com/learn/acorns/money-matters-report-2024/">the study said.</a> “Only 35% of Americans think they will be more financially secure next year than they are now.” </p>





<p>These findings come from two generations who’ve experienced a recession, a global pandemic, and an increase in inflation.</p>



<p>The latest consumer reports <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-plunges/index.html">revealed</a> Americans haven’t felt this bad about the economy since last fall, leading to the broader issue of the rising inflation costs.</p>



<p>The Fed is expecting inflation to rise to 3.5%, an increase from the central bank’s 2% target.</p>



<p>More and more Angelenos in this category are moving away from the city. Los Angeles saw 40% of millennials move to smaller cities, <a href="https://blog.hireahelper.com/2024-study-half-as-many-millennials-move-as-a-decade-ago-where-are-they-going/">according to a Hire A Helper study.</a> Roughly 16% of the generation still live at home with their parents.</p>





<p>One of the Acorns study’s notable findings was that Americans’ top three financial concerns were the <a href="https://blog.hireahelper.com/2024-study-half-as-many-millennials-move-as-a-decade-ago-where-are-they-going/">cost of living, inflation, and debt.</a></p>



<p>With the <a href="https://www.rentcafe.com/cost-of-living-calculator/us/ca/los-angeles/">high cost of living</a> and <a href="https://calbudgetcenter.org/resources/californias-workers-are-increasingly-locked-out-of-the-states-prosperity/">stagnant wages,</a> many Americans, including Angelenos, struggle to afford an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/24/many-americans-cannot-pay-for-an-unexpected-1000-expense-heres-why.html">unexpected expense of $1,000.</a></p>
