<p>China and the European Union will consult on the latter's investigation into Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) after preliminary tariffs are announced.</p>
<p>On June 22, China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao was invited to hold a video talk with Valdis Dombrovskis, executive vice president of the European Commission.</p>

<p>The two sides agreed to initiate consultations on the EU's anti-subsidy investigation case against China's EVs, according to a brief statement on China's Ministry of Commerce <a href="http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/article/xwfb/xwbldhd/202406/20240603518157.shtml">website</a>.</p>
<p>On June 12, the European Commission pre-disclosed the <a href="https://cnevpost.com/2024/06/12/eu-to-impose-additional-tariffs-on-chinese-evs/">level of provisional anti-subsidy duties</a> to be imposed on imports of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from China.</p>
<p>If discussions with the Chinese authorities do not lead to an effective solution, these provisional anti-subsidy duties will be introduced from July 4, according to the European Commission's statement at the time.</p>
<p>The final measures should be implemented within four months of the imposition of the provisional duties, according to the European Commission's statement.</p>
<p>Following the release of the EU's statement, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce said that China is highly concerned and strongly dissatisfied, and that China's industry is deeply disappointed and resolutely opposed to this.</p>
<p>China urges the EU to immediately correct its wrong practices and properly handle economic and trade frictions through dialog and consultation, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The EU originally imposed a 10 percent tariff on BEVs imported from China, and in the newly announced provisional tariffs, different car companies face different rates.</p>
<p><a href="https://cnevpost.com/byd/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="">BYD</a>, Geely and SAIC, which were sampled and cooperated with the investigation, will be subject to additional tariffs of 17.4 percent, 20 percent and 38.1 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Other Chinese BEV producers that cooperated in the investigation but have not been sampled will pay a weighted average duty of 21 percent, with <a href="https://cnevpost.com/nio/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="">Nio</a> (NYSE: NIO) and <a href="https://cnevpost.com/xpeng/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="">Xpeng</a> (NYSE: XPEV) falling into this category.</p>
<p>All other BEV producers in China which did not cooperate in the investigation would be subject to 38.1 percent residual duty.</p>

    <div><p>Mustafa Tovi is riding the high of a good week. Though he says he doesn’t easily get emotional, Tovi recalls folding when he got a call from <a href="https://fortune.com/company/walmart/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/walmart/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Walmart</a>. </p><div class="paywall">



<p>On Father’s Day, Tovi shared some tears with his family when they learned he was about to be promoted to the position of emerging market manager at the company he had spent decades at. </p>



<p>“It’s a dream come true,” Tovi, 45, told <em>Fortune</em>, recalling that he started off as a part-time employee making $8 hourly. </p>



<p>Tovi remembers the exact date he applied to his first job at Walmart: July 15, 1999. Joining the retail company at his wife’s encouragement (who worked there as well), he got the job offer the same day he applied. “I was on top of the world,” he said, noting the rate was a lot of money for him at the time, and better than what other retailers were offering.</p>



<p>Tovi soon rose the ranks, becoming a deployment manager only 90 days later, overseeing projects until he became an assistant manager, and then a co-manager, and finally a store manager. He said he met people who took interest in him, taught him, and led him to new opportunities “and that’s what keeps me around,” he says. Tovi has been a store manager for 16 years now, marking his 25th anniversary at Walmart just this year. </p><p></p>



<p>Now, Tovi makes six figures. He says his base salary is now $168,000, up from $143,000 in 2023. And he has the potential to make even more under Walmart’s new pay policy. </p>



<p>This winter, Walmart increased managers’ <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/employment/walmart-manager-salaries#:~:text=As%20of%20early%202024%2C%20Walmart,range%20was%20%2465%2C000%20to%20%24170%2C000.)" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.thestreet.com/employment/walmart-manager-salaries#:~:text=As%20of%20early%202024%2C%20Walmart,range%20was%20%2465%2C000%20to%20%24170%2C000.)" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">base pay</a> and introduced <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/03/what-walmarts-new-focus-on-employee-stock-means-for-american-wealth.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/03/what-walmarts-new-focus-on-employee-stock-means-for-american-wealth.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">stock plans</a> such as a grant for managers that reaches up to $20,000. While Tovi made around $326,000 last year (factoring in a bonus of $183,000), he stands to make up to $524,000 now— according to Anne Hatfield, a spokesperson from Walmart. That includes a potential $336,000 bonus (up to 200% of his base income if he meets his goals) and the new stock investments. </p>



<p>While the targets are not public and Hatfield says it’s “too early to know how many [managers] will hit” them, they say Walmart is “rewarding store managers for growing their businesses. As their store’s profit grows, so does their annual bonus.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Battling a reputation for poor pay</h2>



<p>For years, Walmart has been trying to shake its <a href="https://www.corp-research.org/wal-mart" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.corp-research.org/wal-mart" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">reputation</a> of poor conditions and pay, especially for hourly employees. America’s largest private employer has long paid many workers so little that they qualify for government assistance: A 2020 Government Accountability Office <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/d2145.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.gao.gov/assets/d2145.pdf" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">report</a> named Walmart the top employer of Medicaid enrollees in three states and the top employer for SNAP recipients in five. Despite the company’s billion-dollar valuation, many Walmart workers have yet to have their share. </p>



<p>“Walmart started paying more not in response to the tight job market, but in response to competition from its fellow retailers and also because it knew it wasn’t paying enough,” journalist Charles Fishman told ABC News in 2019. “Those wages, and that plan, is serving Walmart well as the competition tightens up,” explained the author of <em>The Wal-Mart Effect.</em></p><p></p>



<p>And those policies mean Walmart has been shedding employees, especially managers. Management rank cuts led to a ripple effect of more work for those who stayed on, anonymous employees told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-30/walmart-store-manager-salaries-reach-500-000" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-30/walmart-store-manager-salaries-reach-500-000" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>, </em>and old systems and the onset of COVID-19 made things even worse.  </p>



<p>It appears the pandemic pushed some of the power into workers’ hands, forcing larger retail or fast-food companies to begin to pay fair wages or even competitive ones in light of staffing shortages. As conditions worsened in fields often marked by minimum wages, turnover spiked to especially high levels especially in the hospitality and restaurant industries. </p>



<p>The impact lingers, as chains from <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/18/raising-canes-managers-salary-six-figures-fast-food/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/18/raising-canes-managers-salary-six-figures-fast-food/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Raising Cane’s</a> to <a href="https://fortune.com/company/chipotle-mexican-grill/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/chipotle-mexican-grill/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Chipotle</a> roll-out six figure salaries. These giants are looking to address their retention rate, remain competitive with other chains, and comply with increased pressure from local groups petitioning for workers to receive a living wage during a time of high inflation (e.g. California’s $20 minimum hourly wage <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91072945/californias-new-20-fast-food-worker-minimum-wage-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.fastcompany.com/91072945/californias-new-20-fast-food-worker-minimum-wage-everything-you-need-to-know" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">law</a>). Paying well, unsurprisingly, has an impact on loyalty. <em>Bloomberg</em> reports the annual attrition rate for Walmart managers has decreased by 2% in just one year to 21%, citing Revelio data. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>When Tovi started at Walmart, he and his wife were looking to start a family, achieve a level of financial stability to embark on said milestone, and buy a house. Fast forward some decades: “I can say we have three beautiful kids today, we own a beautiful home in Plano, Texas,” Tovi says. The couple has invested money in a variety of ways, including real estate, having leased out several properties.</p>



<p>Fleeing his homeland in Kurdistan to Turkey for a couple years before immigrating to America in 1991, Tovi says he was “given the opportunity to live the American dream.” </p><p></p>



<p>“I thank God every day, I thank Walmart every day because of Walmart, the reason why I have what I have today,” he says. Belief in the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90863050/ghosted-by-the-american-dream-younger-generations-are-collectively-sobering-to-the-idea-of-the-american-dream-but-what-is-the-alternative" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.fastcompany.com/90863050/ghosted-by-the-american-dream-younger-generations-are-collectively-sobering-to-the-idea-of-the-american-dream-but-what-is-the-alternative" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">American Dream</a> seems to have dwindled of late, especially for younger generations who struggle to build wealth and afford housing amidst the high cost of living and student loans. While Tovi doesn’t have a college degree, he says he encourages others to get one. Either way, there’s been some wins in the blue-collar world, as workers at <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/08/ups-drivers-170000-union-agreement-teamsters-middle-class-bidenomics/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/08/08/ups-drivers-170000-union-agreement-teamsters-middle-class-bidenomics/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">UPS</a> won six figures with the strength of a collective union and pension. </p>



<p>Retail workers are potentially poised for a long-awaited win. Though, it seems like not all employees at Walmart are not as set up for success, as a change or flattening in pay structures <a href="http://reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/walmart-cuts-starting-pay-some-new-hires-wsj-2023-09-07/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to http://reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/walmart-cuts-starting-pay-some-new-hires-wsj-2023-09-07/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">last year</a> meant some entry-level employees made less than they would have previously. Spokesperson Hatfield says that Walmart recently <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/06/05/the-investment-continues-walmart-launches-associate-bonuses-new-opportunities" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/06/05/the-investment-continues-walmart-launches-associate-bonuses-new-opportunities" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">announced</a> a new bonus program for associates as well as a new training program to become technicians. “We’ve raised frontline wages approximately 30% over the past five years, bringing our U.S. average hourly wage to close to $18,” she says. Still, that’s often not enough to scrape by in this economy, as <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/walmart-minimum-wage-20-an-hour-still-broke-rick-wartzman-author/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cbsnews.com/news/walmart-minimum-wage-20-an-hour-still-broke-rick-wartzman-author/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">the Fight for $15 campaign</a> notes; that group and others now say a $20 minimum wage nationally is a necessity. </p>



<p>That being said, Tovi says it’s his goal to help spread opportunity to others as well and speaks of opportunities for similar career trajectories, noting that in just his building alone, four associates were promoted to managers within the past four months.</p>



<p>Just as others saw potential in Tovi, he finds joy and purpose and does the same for others. He knew he found his path when he became a manager as his passion was “giving back to the associates.” He thinks of the success of one of the people he supervises, named Miranda, fondly—specifically, when she learned she had her own opportunity to lead and become a store manager. </p>



<p>“That moment really, really satisfied me because we knew the hard work, the time that we put in and the bond that we have built,” he said, noting he and Miranda speak multiple times a day.</p><p></p>



<p>For now, Tovi is tackling his new job title and looking to thrive in that role. His next dream is to become a regional vice president and “become the best I can be to help others.” </p>



<p>He drives home that his story isn’t singular. “I want to have an opportunity to be where I’m at,” he says. “With hard work and dedication anyone can do it.”</p></div></div>

Living in a place prone to hurricanes, wildfires or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/flooding-sea-level-rise-gulf-coast/?itid=lk_inline_manual_48" target="_blank">floods</a> raises the risk of your car being damaged or destroyed in a disaster.

When unexpectedly large numbers of people file claims in the wake of a disaster — which is happening more often as climate change scrambles weather patterns and fuels new extremes — insurers<b> </b>will raise rates to recoup those losses.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RSKSMDOFTFEGRP4BNWMF4FXI34" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">“Since there’s no real end in sight to what extreme weather is going to look like, there’s no prediction of when [increasing insurance rates] will slow down,” Martin said.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><h3 data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="VMJGOZ342ZBW3FJLPQSDQFEJ7I" data-apitype="header" class=" pb-sm pt-lgmod" id="VMJGOZ342ZBW3FJLPQSDQFEJ7I"><p>Consequences for global trade</p></h3></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KKSMTQ6OPVDYTGCVGQS3VTGOYU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">A crucial part of the world’s vast trade system relies on a smooth route through the Panama Canal. A streamlined system of locks and elevators keeps the waterway moving, and with it, cargo ships full of cars, grains, coal and more. Normally, about 1,000 ships pass through each month toting over 40 million tons of goods, or 5 percent of global maritime trade volumes, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/11/15/climate-change-is-disrupting-global-trade" target="_blank">according to</a> the IMF.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QUKGB6WAP5BAROLCUIK33Y2ROA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">But the 50-mile strip has faced the worst drought since completion 110 years ago. Low water levels at Gatún Lake, which makes passage through the canal possible, prompted authorities to significantly restrict the number of ships starting last fall.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6L5EOSN4PRBQDMNLPEEWZXXBU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Typically, around 35 or 40 ships might pass through the canal each day. But the first few months of 2024 saw that number drop to the high teens or low 20s. Daily passage has recovered to roughly 30 ships.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JPAXSG4RQNBHVMG77PAG7CTI3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Those figures have big implications for the volume of goods moving through the canal. Last summer, roughly 1.4 million metric tons passed through each day. That number steadily fell by early 2024 to below 1 million, although it has mostly recovered since.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EQMF5DPLURGHDCLGDES6MA7EAI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Supply chains are complicated, so it’s near impossible to tease out the implications of reduced canal traffic on prices. Even climate change’s fingerprints are hard to pinpoint: A recent analysis from researchers in Panama and Europe found that high demand from expanding cities and the drying effects of a recent El Niño weather pattern<a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/low-water-levels-in-panama-canal-due-to-increasing-demand-exacerbated-by-el-nino-event/" target="_blank"> were likely bigger drivers</a>.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZO2RG5UUBNA2PFZ4AL2RDXZ4BA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">But Ayman Omar, a professor at American University, said the situation in Panama is emblematic of the kinds of crises that will increasingly hit supply chains as the planet warms and disasters intensify. Any event — hurricane, flood, heat — might have only a marginal effect on the cost of a car hauled on a container ship. But multiple events happen at the same time, “we are not set up right now to be able to take all of those hits,” Omar said.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CBCVC24IGBERDNGIVIWIBYOYXY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">The PortWatch tracker came to be because climate shocks are only becoming more frequent, said Michele Ruta, an economist and trade expert at the IMF. He pointed to a seminal 2010 study tracking the effects of delay times on trade: Researchers found that every day of delay cut trade by more than 1 percent.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O2G4UANCNJD6DF3UEBTMTH65W4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">“Everything adds on — the implications on the macro side, inflation,” Ruta said.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HWMWNGMMINETXHBGELJWKBJGMA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">In Panama, some shippers have paid <a href="https://www.rivieramm.com/news-content-hub/news-content-hub/record-us4m-panama-canal-transit-fee-gas-carriers-going-the-long-way-round-78501" target="_blank">multimillion-dollar fees </a>for dwindling numbers of transit slots through the canal.

<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p>“This dynamic of stores turning profitable faster and faster has enabled Zepto to grow rapidly while simultaneously achieving near EBITDA positivity at a company level,” Palicha, cofounder and CEO of Zepto, said in a statement. “We plan to continue operating with fiscal discipline as we scale from 350 stores to 700 stores by reinvesting capital generated from mature stores back into the business.”</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>

<p>As of May, Zepto said it’s on track to deliver over $1 billion of GMV in the current fiscal year ending March 2025, with about 75% of its warehouse outlets already making an operating profit. The stores now take six months to become profitable as compared to 23 months previously, it added.</p>

<p>Palicha—who together with Vohra was featured on Forbes’ 30 Under 30 Asia list in 2022—said the company “will be ready to go public relatively soon” if the momentum continues.</p>
<p>In its latest funding round announced on Friday, Zepto raised $665 million from new investors including private equity firm Avenir, venture capital firm Lightspeed, and Avra, a new fund started by former Y Combinator Continuity head Anu Hariharan. Existing investors including Glade Brook Capital Partners, Nexus, and StepStone Group also contributed in the round, the Indian unicorn said in the statement. The round comes just nine months after the company raised $235 million in December at a $1.4 billion valuation.</p>

<p>“Zepto is redefining e-commerce in India, with uniquely strong product- market fit and world-class execution and innovation,” Paul Hudson, chief investment officer of Glade Brook, said in the statement.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Microsoft's new productivity tool, Microsoft Copilot, allows users to attend meetings virtually through AI bot stand-ins, but many office workers are skeptical about the value of this feature.</li>
<li>Critics argue that AI bot stand-ins will lead to burnout, overwork, and underpay for human employees, as well as the potential for untimely death from overwork.</li>
<li>Microsoft Copilot, introduced in November 2023, is one of many productivity tools aimed at alleviating the frustration of attending meetings. It promises to help users summarize a missed meeting nearly 4x faster than non-Copilot users.</li>
<li>According to a Microsoft blog post from September 2022, Microsoft Teams users have tripled the time they spend in meetings since 2020, with rates of overlapping Teams meetings increasing to 46%.</li>
<li>The proliferation of AI bot stand-ins like Microsoft Copilot reflects the rapid growth of meetings and the growing frustration of meeting attendees, with tech companies introducing various productivity tools to address these issues.</li>

<p>In the ad, a user brags: “Can I be in three meetings at once?” “Watch me,” complete with a frowning woman at a computer. Actual office workers were not sold on the function.</p>



<p>“I’m not an expert on Microsoft Copilot, but what feature specifically is enabling this to work?” one tech worker said in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8LRVL-tFRl/?igsh=MXdxa3VzcnZxNXc3NA%3D%3D" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8LRVL-tFRl/?igsh=MXdxa3VzcnZxNXc3NA%3D%3D" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8LRVL-tFRl/?igsh=MXdxa3VzcnZxNXc3NA%3D%3D" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Instagram video</a> reacting to the ad. “This is implying they got the AI sitting in the meeting for her, but I haven’t heard about that feature.”</p>



<p>“They are marketing this like crazy and I’m like how on earth is it going to be productive if like a third of the meeting attendees are just these AI stand ins,” another user commented. “Most meetings could be a well written email.”</p>



<p>“Copilot, enabling burnout, overwork, underpay and untimely death of people,” another said.</p><p></p>



<p>Copilot, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-a-whole-new-way-to-work/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-a-whole-new-way-to-work/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">introduced for Microsoft365</a> in November 2023, is one of many productivity tools introduced by tech companies <a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/ai-meetings-work-feedback-bots-bc380d72" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/ai-meetings-work-feedback-bots-bc380d72" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">promising AI bot stand-ins</a> to take notes and summarize telecall meetings. They’re a result of the rapid proliferation of meetings—and the growing frustration of the people having to attend them.</p>



<p>Since 2020, Microsoft Teams users have tripled the time they spend in meetings, according to a September 2022 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work-is-just-work" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work-is-just-work" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Microsoft blog post</a>, with the rates of overlapping Teams meetings increasing to 46%. A Microsoft spokesperson told <em>Fortune, </em>“Copilot can help users summarize a missed meeting nearly 4x faster than non-Copilot users,” citing internal <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/copilots-earliest-users-teach-us-about-generative-ai-at-work" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/copilots-earliest-users-teach-us-about-generative-ai-at-work" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">research</a> from the company. </p>



<p>But the anonymous angry comments regarding the program have validity, according to Jeanine Turner, professor of management and director of the communication, culture and technology program at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. Microsoft even admitted it: There are too many meetings. And rather than solving this problem through apps and tools, Turner said, Microsoft Copilot is at best a treatment to a symptom of a systemic issue—and at worst, enables a massive workplace culture flaw.</p>



<p>“Microsoft Copilot is solving a micro-problem that emerged as a result of all of these other factors that are creating so many meetings,” she told <em>Fortune</em>. “You can see how that doesn’t really solve the overall systemic problem with too many meetings. It just allows people to go to more meetings. Because three—why stop at three?”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why you can’t trust your digital twin</strong></h2>



<p>Tech companies are already starting to push the boundaries of what AI is capable of in meetings. <a href="https://fortune.com/company/zoom/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/zoom/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Zoom</a> founder and CEO Eric Yuan is hoping to create an AI avatar, or “<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/zoom-founder-eric-yuan-digital-ai-twins-attend-meetings-for-you/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/zoom-founder-eric-yuan-digital-ai-twins-attend-meetings-for-you/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">digital twin</a>,” to attend meetings on behalf of employees. The feature would eventually be able to respond to most emails and answer calls, Yuan said.</p><p></p>



<p>“You and I can have more time to have more in-person interactions, but maybe not for work,” Eric Yuan told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24168733/zoom-ceo-ai-clones-digital-twins-videoconferencing-decoder-interview" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24168733/zoom-ceo-ai-clones-digital-twins-videoconferencing-decoder-interview" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT"><em>The Verge</em></a> earlier this month. “Why not spend more time with your family? Why not focus on some more creative things, giving you back your time, giving back to the community and society to help others, right?”</p>



<p>But Turner argued these AI bots are enabling attendees to zone out: “No one has ever wanted to be in a meeting,” she said. With more excuses to not pay attention, there’s “more and more of a disconnect between this relationship between people and what they’re talking about.”</p>



<p>From a managerial perspective, zoned-out meeting attendees not only miss out on spontaneous watercooler interactions that promote <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90609140/stop-with-the-zoom-happy-hours-workers-really-hate-them-says-this-study" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.fastcompany.com/90609140/stop-with-the-zoom-happy-hours-workers-really-hate-them-says-this-study" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">workplace bonding</a>, but also the magic of riffing off employees to unravel a challenging problem and create unique solutions.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“A lot of the serendipitous task-like conversation is not happening,” she said.</p>



<p><a href="https://fortune.com/company/overstock-com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/overstock-com/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Beyond</a> the interpersonal disconnect is the potential for a logistical nightmare, Turner said. Sure, your AI double may be taking thorough notes, but now you, the employee or a manager has to actually go through all those notes. Without having attended the meeting in person, they also have no idea which bullet points on that meeting summary are the most important. What comes next in this confusion spiral—recruiting AI tools to decipher which parts of the AI-generated notes summary are most important?</p><p></p>



<p>“Now we’re getting more and more disconnected from our work,” Turner said. “They are really just perpetuating the madness,” she added.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Too many meetings</strong></h2>



<p>Not only are AI bots potentially harmful to workplace connection, they also perpetuate the pandemic-era problem of overly abundant meetings that remain deeply ingrained in workplace culture post-pandemic. Turning to Zoom and other digital productivity tools in March 2020 was a split-second decision for many managers made out of necessity, but it’s not a necessity now.</p>



<p>“We had 48 hours, basically…[to] figure out how to address the fact that we couldn’t be in person anymore,” Turner said. “We solved that—in a time of global crisis—with Band-Aid solutions.”</p>



<p>These temporary solutions have become problems in their own right: Not only did the onslaught of remote meetings balloon—to the tune of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8165498/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8165498/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">300 million daily Zoom users</a> by April 2020—but those meetings are not guaranteed to be a source of productivity. About 30% of employees <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/12/18/stressed-out-employees-multitasking-survive-virtual-meetings-bosses-hate-careers-work-gleb-tsipursky/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/12/18/stressed-out-employees-multitasking-survive-virtual-meetings-bosses-hate-careers-work-gleb-tsipursky/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">complete unrelated work tasks</a> during Zoom meetings, like responding to emails or editing a document. Retailer Asos <a href="https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/20/online-only-retailer-asos-detrimental-virtual-meetings-back-to-office-150-million-loss/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/20/online-only-retailer-asos-detrimental-virtual-meetings-back-to-office-150-million-loss/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">blamed its virtual meetings</a> on the company’s sluggish post-COVID recovery, it told employees in an internal correspondence this week.</p>



<p>Meetings have lost their potency and power, Turner argued, because they are happening with frequency—but not urgency.</p><p></p>



<p>“We’re using them as a mechanism for kicking the can down the road, when we really should have been thinking, What is it we’re doing that requires a meeting?” she said.</p>



<p>Copilot’s promise of <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/19/microsoft-copilot-ai-assistant-teams-meetings/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/10/19/microsoft-copilot-ai-assistant-teams-meetings/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">relieving workers of mundane tasks</a> may fall short of solving workplaces’ meeting crisis, but it can still provide useful tools, Turner said: For one, it likely takes better notes than employees, and for workers with different learning and communication styles, such as conflict-averse people, those thorough notes can be a way to follow-up with a manager or co-worker about a particular issue.</p>



<p>The systemic problems caused by so many meetings means that programs like Copilot aren’t inherently harmful to workplace culture,Turner suggested, but they require intention to make them truly effective. This is an uphill battle: Managers don’t have a track record of intentionally scheduling meetings over Zoom, so why would they start being intentional in figuring out how to introduce shortcut technologies like AI bots?</p>



<p>“It absolutely can be [an efficient] time-solver,” Turner said. “It’s just that once again, we have to be thoughtful and careful of how it’s used.”</p></div></div>

            Manchester Airport, one of the UK’s busiest airports, has been hit by a power cut, causing delays and disruption for its passengers.

            A “significant number of flights” operating from the airport in northern England have been impacted by a “major” power cut in the area, the airport said in a statement on Sunday.

It's also believed that Kaspersky's software lets bad actors install <a href="https://cyberguy.com/apps/worst-malware-security-privacy-breaches-2023/" rel="nofollow"><u>malicious software</u></a> and withhold critical updates.</p><p class="speakable"><a href="https://cyberguy.com/newsletter/" rel="nofollow"><strong><u>GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT’S NEWSLETTER – THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE</u></strong></a></p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Kaspersky conference room (Kaspersky)</span> </p></div></div></div><h2><strong>Why is the US banning Kaspersky?</strong></h2><p>Kaspersky is getting banned in the U.S. after the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) conducted a review of the company’s cybersecurity and anti-virus transactions. BIS notes that the company poses "unacceptable risks to the United States' national security and the security and safety of its people." The main concerns are Kaspersky's connections to Russia, the potential security weaknesses in Kaspersky's products, and the chance that Russia could exploit these weaknesses.</p><p>In an announcement, BIS specifically listed five risks Kaspersky poses to national security. Kaspersky's ties to Russia are a major concern. BIS states that Russia is a foreign adversary that poses ongoing threats to the United States. According to the agency, Kaspersky is under the jurisdiction and control of the Russian government, allowing it access to sensitive information from U.S. customers.</p><p>Other reasons given for the Kaspersky ban include the software's ability to install malware. "Kaspersky software allows for the capability and opportunity to install malicious software and withhold critical updates," says BIS. "The manipulation of Kaspersky software, including in U.S. critical infrastructure, can result in data theft, espionage, and system malfunctions. The products also threaten economic security and public health in the U.S., potentially resulting in injuries or loss of life."</p><p>Kaspersky’s ban in the U.S. shouldn’t come as a surprise since the firm has been on the government’s radar for quite some time. In 2017, the U.S. banned the use of the Moscow-based cybersecurity firm's products across all government agencies.</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Illustration of a bad actor on a computer (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson)</span> </p></div></div></div><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/att-data-leak-from-73-million-customers-what-you-need-to-do-next/" rel="nofollow"><strong><u>AT&amp;T DATA LEAK FROM 73 MILLION CUSTOMERS – WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NEXT</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>Kaspersky’s response to the ban</strong></h2><p>Kaspersky denied Friday that it is a security threat, saying the government had based its decision on the "geopolitical climate and theoretical concerns" rather than independently verifying if there was a risk. The company says it cannot obtain sensitive data on Americans and that its operations and employees in Russia can only access aggregate or statistical data not attributable to a specific person.</p><p>Below is part of the company’s official statement. The full statement can be read on Kaspersky’s website.</p><p>"For over 26 years, Kaspersky has succeeded in its mission of building a safer future by protecting over a billion devices. Kaspersky provides industry-leading products and services to customers around the world to protect them from all types of cyber threats, and has repeatedly demonstrated its independence from any government. Additionally, Kaspersky has implemented significant transparency measures that are unmatched by any of its cybersecurity industry peers to demonstrate its enduring commitment to integrity and trustworthiness. The Department of Commerce’s decision unfairly ignores the evidence."</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>A child working on a computer (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson)</span> </p></div></div></div><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/pharma-giants-data-breach-exposes-patients-sensitive-information/" rel="nofollow"><strong><u>PHARMA GIANT’S DATA BREACH EXPOSES PATIENTS’ SENSITIVE INFORMATION</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>What does this ban mean for you?</strong></h2><p>The Kaspersky ban essentially means you will not be able to purchase its software products, and if you already have one, it will stop working soon. Starting July 20, Kaspersky and any of its partners will not be able to sell or license cybersecurity or antivirus software in the U.S. Resellers who already have the products in stock will be able to sell them, but only until Sept. 29.</p><p>It’s worth noting that while BIS has banned most Kaspersky products, some have been exempted. These include Kaspersky Threat Intelligence products and services, Kaspersky Security Training products and services, and Kaspersky consulting and advisory services.</p><p>Existing Kaspersky customers have until Sept. 29 to find an alternative, as the company will no longer be able to provide antivirus signature updates after this date.</p><h2><strong>Which antivirus should you choose now that Kaspersky is banned?</strong></h2><p>Kaspersky's antivirus was widely used, but now that it has been banned, it’s important to look for alternatives. An antivirus is the best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware, which may gain access to your private information. It can also alert you to phishing emails or ransomware scams. <a href="https://cyberguy.com/security/best-antivirus-protection/" rel="nofollow"><strong><u>Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android &amp; iOS devices</u></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/frontier-fallout-as-750k-customers-data-exposed-in-ransomhub-cyberattack/" rel="nofollow"><strong><u>FRONTIER FALLOUT AS 750K CUSTOMERS' DATA EXPOSED IN RANSOMHUB CYBERATTACK </u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>Kurt’s key takeaway</strong></h2><p>The U.S. government raised serious national security concerns regarding Kaspersky's ties to the Russian government. If true, a ban is absolutely necessary. However, Kaspersky maintains it's a private company with no ties to Moscow. It remains unclear whether these claims are credible. One thing's for sure: Kaspersky's absence would leave a significant gap in the cybersecurity market, creating a prime opportunity for competitors to step up.</p><p>Do you believe the concerns about Kaspersky's ties to Russia and potential threats to national security are justified?

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>Extreme heat coupled with strained infrastructure, malfunctions and mechanical problems on Amtrak and New Jersey Transit brought agony and massive delays for tens of thousands of commuters throughout the Northeast this week.</p><p>Rail service between New Jersey and New York’s Penn Station was suspended Thursday before the evening commute and again on Friday morning, with <a href="https://twitter.com/NJTRANSIT/status/1804118525545504831" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New Jersey Transit citing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="10" data-v9y="0">New Jersey Transit citing</a> “AMTRAK overhead wire issues.”</p><p>While the root cause of the disruptions is still being investigated, they hit during some of the hottest days of the year so far, lengthening commutes amid an early-summer heat wave.</p><p>“Unfortunately, a unique combination of events recently caused major delays in the New York area, affecting travel along a significant section of the Northeast Corridor,” Amtrak President Roger Harris said in a statement Friday.</p><p>Harris added that on Thursday, a circuit breaker that powers the trains “experienced a catastrophic failure on one of the hottest days of the year and a serious brush fire also came close to our tracks.”</p><p>He said Amtrak is also working with New Jersey Transit “to understand and address recent disruptions associated with NJT trains operating on Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor infrastructure, which appears unique to the equipment and area.”</p><p>Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains share one century-old tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey. It is the only passenger rail connection between Manhattan and the rest of the Northeast Corridor, which runs from Washington, D.C., to Boston.</p><h2>Extreme heat straining infrastructure</h2><p>While no single cause has been identified for this week’s transit disruptions, rail experts noted that extreme heat has the potential to strain infrastructure.</p><p>Many trains use one long, welded piece of metal called a “continuous weld” to function, and when temperatures rise, it expands, creating stress and forcing the rail to buckle, said Curtis Morgan, the freight and trade division head and a senior research scientist at the Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute.</p><p>“It can cause a derailment,” he said. “Because of the additional stress on the rail, the trains are ordered to go at a slower speed.”</p><p>This week, <a href="https://x.com/AmtrakNECAlerts/status/1803843788428722305" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amtrak warned;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="11" data-v9y="0">Amtrak warned</a> that high temperatures throughout the region forced some trains to move at slower speeds, resulting in hourlong delays.</p><p>Most Amtrak trains operate between 125 and 155 mph, but when temperatures near triple digits, trains are slowed to between 80 and 100 mph, said <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.amtrak.com/gerhard-williams__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!s9NFrYwq-qgWVEwthPg4XqKcatT_SJaoBDsnxcfWx4IdO6OsyO8enc5KmanmUc1-yafZrsXZqCkL9WmRxUQ3vXMaTA$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gerhard Williams, executive vice president of service delivery and operations at Amtrak;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="12" data-v9y="0">Gerhard Williams, executive vice president of service delivery and operations at Amtrak</a>, adding that the extreme heat played a small role in train disruptions this week.</p><p>New York City is under a heat advisory until Sunday night, with the heat index at times reaching near triple digits, according to the <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.75095500000003&amp;lon=-73.99810999999994" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Weather Service;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="13" data-v9y="0">National Weather Service</a>.</p><p>Clinton J. Andrews, the director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University and an expert in engineering, urban planning and climate change mitigation, said the summer months will add pressure to rail infrastructure.</p><p>“Summer heat, like any extreme weather, tests our infrastructure systems, as well as our bodies. In the case of mass transit, especially fixed-rail transit, there are particular concerns,” Andrews said. “The first is that both the tracks, which are made of steel, and the catenary wires, which provide power to electric trains, tend to expand during a heat wave.”</p><p>Most of this week’s delays and cancellations in the New York City metropolitan area were caused by power and overhead wire issues, a malfunctioning circuit breaker and a disabled train at Penn Station, transit officials said.</p><p>Mona Hemmati, a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University who specializes in climate physics, said the public can expect future delays and cancellations in mass transit based on extreme weather caused by climate change.</p><p>“It’s important to understand that high temperatures increase the risk of derailment. You have to consider the impact of high temperatures on steel, catenary wires and so on,” she said, referring to wires that provide power to electric trains.</p><p>“We are seeing more heat waves because of climate change, rising temperatures and the warming atmosphere.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>China spent $230.8 billion on electric car development</strong>: Over more than a decade, China has supported its electric car industry with government funding, which represents 18.8% of total electric car sales between 2009 and 2023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EU and US impose tariffs on Chinese electric cars</strong>: The European Union has announced plans to impose tariffs on imports of Chinese electric cars due to the use of subsidies in their production, while the US has raised duties on imports of Chinese electric vehicles to 100%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>China's support for electric cars has been comprehensive</strong>: Beijing's support for electric cars has included non-monetary policies that favored domestic automakers over foreign ones, making it more attractive for companies to invest in the Chinese market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Western automakers and governments have been slow to act</strong>: According to Scott Kennedy, chairman of Chinese business and economics at CSIS, Western automakers and governments have not been aggressive enough in developing their own electric car industries, unlike China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The ratio of government spending to EV sales has declined</strong>: While government support for electric cars was substantial in the early years, the ratio of such spending to EV sales has declined from over 40% before 2017 to just above 11% in 2023, indicating a shift away from subsidies towards more sustainable market-driven growth.</p>

<p>At the moment, we’re seeing flight attendants at most major US airlines trying to ratify new contracts (except at Delta, where flight attendants aren’t unionized). Flight attendants largely haven’t had pay increases since before the pandemic, and are looking for significant raises, to reflect the inflation we’ve seen in recent years.</p>



<p>Back in April, Southwest flight attendants <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/news/southwest-airlines-flight-attendant-contract/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became the first to ratify a new contract</a>, and it’s probably the richest flight attendant contract we’ve ever seen, in terms of wage increases, retroactive pay, and more.</p>



<p>There’s now a positive update for another US airline, as Alaska flight attendants now have a tentative agreement on a new contract, which should help with labor relations at the Seattle-based oneworld carrier.</p>




<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alaska-flight-attendants-reach-new-tentative-agreement"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="alaska_flight_attendants_reach_new_tentative_agreement" ez-toc-data-id="#alaska_flight_attendants_reach_new_tentative_agreement"></span>Alaska flight attendants reach new tentative agreement<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents Alaska’s flight attendants, has just announced that it has reached a tentative agreement with Alaska management for a “record contract.”</p>







<p>The union describes this tentative agreement as having been reached with the help of the National Mediation Board (NMB). Over the past week, negotiations took place in Washington, with AFA International President Sara Nelson and AFA General Counsel in attendance, along with Alaska Chief Operating Officer Constance von Muehlen.</p>



<p>Exact details of the contract aren’t yet being released. The union states that in the coming days, both parties will “work to clean up the contract language to present the full text of the TA to the Master Executive Council.” The Master Executive Council will then vote to release the agreement for a full membership ratification vote. </p>





<p>Back in February 2024, Alaska flight attendants voted to authorize a strike, with 99.48% of participants voting in favor of a strike (and 93.47% of flight attendants participating in the vote). So it’s good to see that there’s finally some common ground between management and the union.</p>



<p>However, I wouldn’t assume it’s a given that the membership will necessarily ratify the new contract. For example, Southwest flight attendants rejected the first tentative agreement they were presented by the union during their negotiations, and only ratified the second agreement, after additional improvements.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AS-FA.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-322800"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Alaska flight attendants have been fighting for a new contract</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-i-m-curious-how-lucrative-this-contract-is"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="im_curious_how_lucrative_this_contract_is" ez-toc-data-id="#im_curious_how_lucrative_this_contract_is"></span>I’m curious how lucrative this contract is<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>It’s interesting how the union is referring to the tentative agreement as a “record contract.” Is that suggesting that this is the most lucrative contract that has been negotiated in the entire industry so far, or just a record for the airline (which seems like it would be a given)?</p>



<p>The reason I ask is because historically Alaska hasn’t exactly had the best pay in the industry. The airline has paid much better than ultra low cost carriers, but not consistently to the same level as carriers like Southwest.</p>



<p>Southwest flight attendants have ratified a new contract whereby they get immediate 22% pay increases, and 3% pay increases in each of 2025, 2026, and 2027. On top of that, they received retro pay, which comes out to around $18K per flight attendant. Does that mean Alaska flight attendants are getting contracts that are even more lucrative?</p>



<p>With a second carrier now nearing a new contract, this should also <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/news/american-flight-attendants-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help American flight attendants</a> with getting a new contract, as American has had the most hostile negotiations on a new contract.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Alaska-737-MAX-8-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-284781"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">I’m curious how lucrative this new contract is</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bottom-line"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="bottom_line" ez-toc-data-id="#bottom_line"></span>Bottom line<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The union representing Alaska flight attendants has announced that a tentative agreement has been reached for a new “record contract.” The details are expected to be released in the coming days, so it’ll be interesting to see the details.</p>



<p>It’s great news that flight attendants at a second US airline are nearing a new contract, as it should help with this cycle of negotiations, providing stability to passengers (though perhaps a little less stability to the bottom line of airlines). </p>



<p><strong>What do you make of Alaska flight attendants getting a tentative agreement on a new contract?</strong></p>

<li>
<p><strong>Heat waves kill more people than other weather disasters</strong>: According to the National Weather Service, heat waves are responsible for more deaths than hurricanes, floods, tornados, and winter storms combined. This is because the human body can't easily withstand prolonged high temperatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Portable air conditioners can be a good alternative</strong>: Whole house air conditioners are important during heat waves, but not all homes have them. Portable air conditioners are a good option for those who don't have whole house AC or need extra cooling in specific areas of their home.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Focus on home insulation and air conditioning during heat waves</strong>: Ceiling fans are not effective in keeping homes cool during extreme heat, especially when addressing health issues. Instead, focus on home insulation and air conditioning to keep your home cool and healthy during heat waves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional tips for preparing for heat waves</strong>: In addition to using portable air conditioners and monitoring temperature, other tips for preparing for heat waves include staying indoors, keeping the air conditioner set to a healthy level, staying hydrated, and using cool water to alleviate symptoms.

But for smart homes and home security, there are additional steps you can take to prepare for an awful heat wave and keep loved ones protected. Start with these tips.</p><h2>1. Use a portable air conditioner and monitor room temperature carefully</h2><p>Whole house air conditioners remain very important in heat waves, especially when combined with other cooling methods. But not all homes have whole house AC, and in severe heat waves they may not be enough. Another option is a smart portable air conditioner that you can plug in and move from room to room, depending on where you're spending time.</p><p>Take a look at <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/best-portable-ac-units/" rel="follow" target="_self">our list of the top portable air conditioners</a>, and you'll find models with remotes, voice assistant support, timers, dehumidifier functions and much more.

It's important to focus more on home insulation and air conditioning.</p><p>In many homes, some rooms can get much hotter than others, which doesn't really help central thermostats do their job. Consider home monitoring devices that can sense temperature, like <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/security/arlo-home-security-system-review-a-flexible-system-for-an-affordable-price/" rel="follow" target="_self">these all-in-one Arlo security sensors</a> we tested.

It's a good idea to keep several properly sized filters nearby so you can switch them out a couple of times a year, or when you really need efficient airflow. </p><p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class=""></p><p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class=""></p><p>If you have time, you should also schedule a maintenance visit from a professional HVAC contractor. Among other things, they can test the refrigerant levels in your AC system. Refrigerant can leak out over time and make your air conditioning less efficient. Making sure you have the proper levels is important ahead of a hot period.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="/home/energy-and-utilities/hvac-maintenance-guide-what-to-diy-and-when-to-call-a-pro/" rel="follow" class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"><span>HVAC Maintenance Guide: What to DIY and When to Call a Pro</span></a></span></p><figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"> <figcaption><span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"><p>Kangaroo includes a climate sensor, aka leak detector, in its expanded eight-piece home monitoring kit.</p></span> <span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall">Kangaroo</span></figcaption></figure><h2>4. Install leak detectors and monitor for leaks</h2><p>Home leaks are often associated with freezing temperatures when pipes crack in the dead of winter. But heat waves can cause an opposite, yet similar, problem: Pipes can expand and damage their valves and other components, which also leads to leaks. Also, AC units can go into overdrive and may leak more than usual in your basement or garage. </p><p>Most home security systems, <a href="https://goabode.com/product/water-leak-sensor/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="c-regularLink">like Abode</a>, offer leak detector add-ons that you can place in susceptible areas to get alerts or alarms when water on the floor is detected. You can also find <span class="c-shortcodeCommerceLink"><a href="https://www.eufy.com/products/t89200d1?variant=42863746252986" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="">standalone units from Eufy</a></span> and other brands.</p><h2>5. Keep your outdoor home devices out of direct sunlight</h2><p>Shade is your friend when placing outdoor electrics like <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/security/best-home-security-camera/" rel="follow" target="_self">home security cameras</a> or outside sensors -- <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/yard-and-outdoors/i-deployed-a-fleet-of-lawn-robots-to-save-me-time/" rel="follow" target="_self">even robot lawnmowers</a>. High temps can wreak havoc on batteries, make sensitive electronics overheat and may even cause plastics to melt. </p><p>So when the temperature start shooting up, bring your electronics inside or into the shade until the hot spell is over. And please <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/security/places-you-should-never-put-a-home-security-camera/" target="_self" rel="follow">watch where you install your home cameras</a>.</p><p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class=""></p><p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class=""></p><figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"> <figcaption><span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"><p>Cutting down on drafts helps keep the cool air inside.</p></span> <span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall">BanksPhotos via Getty</span></figcaption></figure><h2>6. Check and replace your weather stripping</h2><p>Weather stripping refers to those small strips of felt and rubber at the edges of windows and doors. They play a vital role in home insulation: When they wear down or get ripped off, the gaps notoriously cause drafts. That's unpleasant in wintertime, but during a heat wave it can sap all the cool air that your AC has created, keeping your home from cooling down fully and increasing the risk of heat-related health problems. </p><p>Prep for heat waves by checking weatherstripping and blocking any drafts from worn materials. You can <span class="c-shortcodeCommerceLink"><a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Weather-Stripping/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=495372&amp;tag=cnet-buy-button-20&amp;ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C-%7Cdtp%7Ccn" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" section="transformed-regular-link" class="">find weather stripping yourself</a></span> for a DIY project, but it's important to get the right kind to match your doors and windows. </p><h2>7. Find cooler alternatives for cooking</h2><p>Cooking and baking produce a lot of heat in the kitchen, so you may want to reduce those activities during a heat wave. That's why we have an entire <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/how-to-keep-your-kitchen-cool-during-a-heatwave/" rel="follow" target="_self">guide on how to keep your kitchen cool when temperatures rise</a>, including prepping meals beforehand or cooking late in the evening.

Search for electronics to unplug and stop using</h2><p>Large electronics can produce a lot of background heat even when they're in standby mode. When the heat gets really bad, try unplugging larger electronics entirely. That can include A/V receivers, game consoles, desktop computers and televisions -- depending on what you plan to use that day.</p><p>On that note, refrain from running heat-producing appliances <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/best-dishwasher/" rel="follow" target="_self">like dishwashers</a> and dryers, or at least wait until nighttime when temperature drops. </p><p><strong>Read more</strong>: <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="/tech/mobile/heat-wave-keep-your-phone-from-overheating-in-record-temps/" rel="follow" class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"><span>Heat Wave: Keep Your Phone From Overheating in Record Temps</span></a></span></p><h2>9. Replace your lighting with smart lights</h2><p>There's one other surprising part of the home that produces a lot of heat -- your incandescent lights, which are terribly inefficient at using energy (touch one to find out). Newer LEDs (light-emitting diodes) found in smart lights create almost no heat and tend to last much longer. </p><p>The key is finding high-quality, affordable smart lights, which is why you should head over to our list of <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/best-smart-lights/" rel="follow" target="_self">the best smart lights available</a>.

Create easy access to emergency medical services</h2><p>If it looks like someone is suffering from heatstroke or a similar condition, it's important to get medical attention immediately to help them out. Signs include lots of sweating accompanied by headache, nausea and disorientation. If someone shows problems like these, get them in a cool spot and contact emergency services. You can also bathe their feet in cool water to help them get relief.</p><p>Some home security plans can make this easier.

Many struggled to get jobs, particularly following the Great Recession, when the nation’s unemployment rate hovered around 10 percent for over a year. Their wages took a massive hit, too. On average, millennials lost <a href="https://kevinrinz.github.io/recession.pdf" target="_blank">about 13 percent </a>of their earnings between 2007 and 2017, according to economist Kevin Rinz.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KW3UZDWKEJC75AJUSDTHFTP7HY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">By contrast, the recovery since the pandemic has been swift and broad. Unemployment was<b> </b>under 4 percent for the longest stretch in 50 years until May, and younger workers in particular have seen some of the largest pay hikes. Wages for 16-to-24-year-olds have risen 8.6 percent in the past year, compared with an overall gain of 5.2 percent, according to <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker" target="_blank">the Atlanta Fed</a>.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SPEZXSB5CRB7BIKEBOYZLQGS2I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Still, rising prices are dealing an outsize blow to Gen Z.

<ol>
<li>Tesla shareholders have voted to reinstate Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which was originally approved in 2018 and was previously voided by a Delaware judge.</li>
<li>The legal team representing shareholder Richard Tornetta, who sued to invalidate Musk's pay package, argues that the shareholders' vote has no legal effect and that Tesla must appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court to reverse the January ruling.</li>
<li>The Delaware judge who issued the ruling, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, has yet to determine the legal fees that Tesla must pay Tornetta's attorneys for winning the case.</li>
<li>Tornetta's attorneys are seeking 29 million shares of Tesla stock, worth over $5 billion, as the legal fee, which is still pending.</li>
<li>The fate of Musk's compensation plan remains on hold pending the resolution of the lawsuit, and Tesla's stock price was affected, with shares rising 0.79% to $183.01 on Friday.</li>

It also indicated it plans to file a motion to reverse the January ruling that should result in it winning the case.</p><p>The company argued that because the pay package was reviewed by an independent board member and reapproved by shareholders, it resolved the judge's finding that Musk dominated the negotiations due to his personal relationships with some board members and that the board didn't adequately disclose information about the compensation plan.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/elon-musk-had-nvidia-send-ai-chips-intended-tesla-x-xai-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ELON MUSK HAD NVIDIA SEND AI CHIPS INTENDED FOR TESLA TO X AND XAI: REPORT</strong></a></p><div class="inline image-ct"> <div class="caption"><p><span>Opponents of Musk's pay plan argue the shareholder vote has no legal significance.</span><span> (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images / Getty Images)</span></p></div></div><p><br>Tornetta's legal team rejected that approach, arguing that the board process for proposing the ratification vote was flawed and that the shareholder vote was coerced by Musk's threats to potentially shift his focus on <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> investment away from Tesla without more control.<br></p><p>Musk's pay package, which consists of performance-based targets that trigger stock option awards that he must hold for a period of five years before exercising, was valued at $56 billion at the time the last milestone was achieved, according to Tesla. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</strong></a></p><p>The value of the package fluctuates with changes in Tesla's stock price and is worth about $48 billion based on Friday's share price of $182.19.</p><p>Reuters contributed to this report.</p></div> </div>
