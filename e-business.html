And while all the focus was on the $71,995 Wagoneer S, the automaker had one more thing to show off: an off-road-capable Trailhawk concept of the same EV, sitting pretty on 31.5-inch tires. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">The forest green SUV sports several features that distinguish it from the standard Wagoneer S, including an intimidating laser-cut roof rack, 3D-printed tow hooks, lifted suspension, wheel caps, and a host of other goodies for gearheads and boulder lovers alike. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component clear-both block md:float-left md:mr-30 md:w-[320px] lg:-ml-100"><div class="duet--article--article-pullquote mb-20"><p class="mb-10 h-[22px] w-[65px] bg-franklin"></p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup relative bg-repeating-lines-dark bg-[length:1px_1.2em] pb-8 font-polysans text-28 font-medium leading-120 tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20  dark:bg-repeating-lines-light dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple">Sitting pretty on 31.5-inch tires</p></div></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Trailhawk is the trim name usually applied to Jeep’s most rugged off-road vehicles, complete with more durable equipment and materials. In addition, Trailhawk vehicles are often trail rated, meaning they’ve passed a battery of tests for maneuverability, articulation, and ground clearance. And with the Wagoneer S Trailhawk concept, Jeep is signaling its interest in extending those capabilities to its nascent battery-electric segment. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">The Trailhawk concept boasts a lot of the same features as the Wagoneer S — while taking them a step further. In addition to those all-terrain 31.5-inch tires, the concept sits on a lifted suspension for better ground clearance. Tow hooks are embedded in the front and rear of the vehicle, and functional air extractors are intended for high-pressure environments. The hood decal is anti-glare, the badging is flush with the vehicle, and the panoramic sunroof is dual panel for letting in fresh air — or trail dust, as it were. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Jeep’s five driver modes for the Wagoneer S gain a sixth mode for the Trailhawk concept: Rock. The mode selector is emergency red in the center console for ease of switching. And the steering wheel is octagonal-shaped, with special grips at the 9 and 3 o’clock positions for those especially hairy moments. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Electric off-roading isn’t exactly a new thing. Ford, Chevy, GMC, and Rivian all market their electric trucks as just as capable on gravel as they are on pavement. And the annual King of the Hammers off-roading competition features a segment just for battery-powered rock crawlers. But Jeep is a brand that prides itself on its overpowered dirt spewers, so introducing a plug-in version would make total sense. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">The company isn’t committing to putting the Trailhawk concept into production, but during today’s event, executives hinted heavily that the off-roader would indeed eventually become a real EV. Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa said that the Wagoneer S would feature several trims, with the fully loaded Launch Edition coming first. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white"><em>Photography by Andrew J.

            Boeing executives presented sweeping changes to the company’s production process and safety systems in a three-hour meeting with the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday. The plan is meant to reassure the public, airline customers and regulators that the troubled company’s planes are safe to fly.

<li><strong>Earnings per share</strong>: Gap's earnings per share were 41 cents, exceeding the expected 14 cents.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong>: Gap's revenue was $3.39 billion, exceeding the expected $3.29 billion.</li>
<li><strong>Guidance raised</strong>: Due to the strong Q1 results, Gap raised its full-year guidance, expecting net sales to be up "slightly" compared to previous guidance of flat. The company also raised its expectations for operating income growth.</li>
<li><strong>CEO's turnaround strategy</strong>: CEO Richard Dickson, a marketing guru, has been working to revitalize the company's portfolio of brands through branding and storytelling. His strategy appears to be taking hold, with the company reporting positive comparable sales at all four brands for the first time in many years.</li>

In fact, we were sort of looking for when they had and it was difficult to find,” CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in an interview.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>“We’re feeling very confident about our quarter and it has given us the confidence to raise our guidance for full year 2024, both the outlook for revenue and operating margin. … It continues, if you will, to really demonstrate our confidence that our priorities are really taking shape,” he added. “The culture is being energized and we’re delivering what we said we were going to deliver to our shareholders.” </p><p>Gap is now expecting net sales to be up “slightly,” compared to its previous forecast of flat. The company is expecting gross margins to grow by at least 1.5 percentage points, compared to earlier guidance of at least a half a percent.</p><p>The biggest change to Gap’s forecast is in its operating income outlook. It now expects operating income to be in the mid-40% growth range, compared to previous guidance of low-to-mid teens growth. </p><p>Dickson, who took the helm of Gap in late August, is a marketing guru who has been working to reinvigorate the company’s portfolio of brands. His work has focused on brand storytelling and positioning names like Gap and Old Navy back into the center of culture.</p><p>Some of that has already started to show up. </p><p>Earlier this month, actress Da’Vine Joy Randolph wore a denim ball gown designed by Gap’s new creative director, Zac Posen, to the Met Gala in Manhattan. A few weeks later, actor Anne Hathaway sported a white Gap shirt dress to a Bulgari party that had also been designed by Posen. </p><p>“We were so excited to see [Hathaway’s dress] in the marketplace and also dropped to consumers so that they had an opportunity to buy it,” said Dickson. “We continue to believe again, that the better storytelling through marketing and innovative media is resonating.” </p><p>He told CNBC the quarter’s success was driven “by consistency and financial and operational rigor,” adding the company’s average selling prices are back to pre-pandemic levels thanks to leaner inventory levels that are leading to better sell throughs. But with better designs and marketing, consumers are just buying more, too. </p><p>Here’s a breakdown of how each of Gap’s banners performed during the quarter, compared with Wall Street estimates compiled by FactSet, which revised its estimates after Gap’s report: </p><ul><li><strong>Old Navy:</strong> Net sales of $1.9 billion were up 5% compared to last year while comparable sales were up 3%, ahead of the 2.3% uptick expected according to the revised FactSet estimate. Dickson said the brand saw its “highest quarterly comp in three years” -- a major win for Gap’s most important brand by revenue. He noted there was strength in the women’s business and “positive results in active” – a “key category” for the company. </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Banana Republic:</strong> Sales of $440 million rose 2% compared to last year. Comparable sales were up 1%, well ahead of the 4% decline expected, according to the revised FactSet estimate. The growth also comes on top of an 8% decline in the year-ago period.   </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Athleta:</strong> Sales of $329 million climbed 2% compared to last year. Comparable sales were up 5% after being down a staggering 13% in the year-ago period. Analysts didn’t have expectations for Athleta’s comparable sales.  </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Gap:</strong> Sales of $689 million were flat compared to last year. Comparable sales were up 3%, ahead of an expected 2% gain, according to the revised FactSet estimate. “Gap’s performance was primarily driven by strong marketing and product execution centered around its Linen Moves campaign,” the company said.</li></ul></div></div>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Medical supply company Medline Industries is recalling some 1.5 million portable adult bed rails across the U.S. and Canada, following two reports of entrapment deaths associated with the products.</p><p>The recall impacts two models of Medline’s “Bed Assist Bars.” According to a Thursday <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2024/Medline-Industries-Recalls-1-5-Million-Adult-Portable-Bed-Rails-Due-to-Serious-Entrapment-and-Asphyxia-Hazards-Two-Deaths-Reported" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a></span> from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, users of these bed rails can become entrapped within the bed rail itself or between the product and the side of a mattress when it’s attached to a bed. </p><p>This poses “a serious entrapment hazard and risk of death by asphyxiation,” the CPSC notes.</p><p>To date, the commission added, Medline has received two reports of entrapment deaths associated with the recalled Bed Assist Bars in the U.S — involving a 76-year-old woman who died in an Iowa senior nursing facility in 2019, and a 87-year-old woman who died at a South Carolina residential care facility in 2023.</p>
    

<p>One additional injury in the U.S. has also been reported, according a Health Canada <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://recalls-rappels.canada.ca/en/alert-recall/medline-adult-portable-bed-rails-recalled-due-entrapment-hazard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a></span>. No injuries or incidents in Canada were reported to Medline as of Monday, Health Canada said.</p>



<p>Medline said in a statement that it understands “that in the instances of reported entrapment deaths associated with the bed assist bars, the bed rails were not securely attached to the bed and the users became entrapped between the rail and mattress.”</p><p>The company based in Northfield, Illinois, said it encourages all customers to read warnings and instructions of its products. Still, it said it’s important for impacted customers to participate in this recall — noting that it had worked closely with the CPSC and “fully supports the agency’s commitment to consumer safety.”</p>
    
<p>Medline sold about 1.5 million of the now-recalled Bed Assist Bars from July 2009 through March 2024 in the U.S. — through its own websites and major retailers online, including Amazon and Walmart. They cost between $32 and $64. More than 5,500 were additionally sold in Canada between February 2013 and March 2024.</p><p>The recalled bed rails, which were manufactured in China, can be identified by two model numbers: MDS6800BA and MDS6800BAH. </p><p>The CPSC and Health Canada urges consumers in possession of these products to stop using them immediately — and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://recalls.medline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact Medline</a></span> to request a refund.</p>

<ol>
<li>The software firm VMX has missed its quarterly revenue prediction, leading to concerns about a possible trend in the software industry.</li>
<li>The concept of "software apocalypse" is gaining attention on Wall Street, with many software stocks experiencing declines, bucking the conventional wisdom that software as a service (SaaS) would be a reliable and recurring revenue source.</li>
<li>However, not all software companies are faring poorly. Snowflake, Confluent, and Data Dog, for instance, have given better outlooks for the second half of the year, which presents an interesting dynamic.</li>
<li>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) applications is being touted as a game-changer, but it also poses challenges for software companies. For instance, a salesforce that relies on subscription-based models may struggle if workforce efficiency gains from AI reduce the need for as many users.</li>
<li>The article concludes that the software industry is still in the early stages of the AI technology cycle, with much upside and potential as the technology fully rolls out.</li>

Dell’s stock has more than tripled over the past 12 months as investors have viewed the hardware maker as a beneficiary of demand for artificial intelligence. Large corporations increasingly need high-powered servers to train and run demanding generative AI tasks, which are sold by Dell and few other companies.</p><p>“Results weren’t bad, but expectations were very high, and the numbers weren’t strong enough to spur further near-term upside,” wrote analysts at Vital Knowledge.</p><p>For its better-known business of selling personal computers, Dell reported $12 billion in revenue, little changed from the same period a year earlier. Sales of business PCs increased 3% to $10.2 billion, surprising analysts who expected a 2% drop.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>The PC market had seen a historic decline over the last two years after many consumers, businesses and schools purchased laptops in the early months of the pandemic. In the first quarter, shipments picked up 1.5% — the first increase since the end of 2021 — industry analyst IDC said in April.</p><p>PC-makers have been hopeful those numbers signaled the end of the slump and that growth would accelerate in 2024 with the launch of machines equipped with a new version of Microsoft Corp.’s Windows software as well as hardware equipped with chips to handle artificial intelligence tools.</p><p>Dell’s primary PC competitor, HP Inc., reported signs of a recovering computer market Wednesday, sending its shares up 17% on Thursday. Like Dell, HP reported a bump in sales among its business customers rather than consumers.</p><p>Total sales at Dell’s infrastructure unit, which includes servers and networking and storage equipment, jumped 22% to $9.2 billion.</p><p>(Updates with outlook in the fifth paragraph.)</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

<li>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and 22 other Democratic senators have written to the Justice Department, urging them to investigate allegations of collusion between the oil industry and OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) to raise oil prices.</li>
<li>The letter comes after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) blocked former Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield from serving on ExxonMobil's board, citing allegations that he attempted to collude with OPEC to raise oil prices.</li>
<li>The Democratic senators claim that such collusion has artificially inflated prices of gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, and jet fuel, harming American households and businesses.</li>
<li>The senators are urging the Justice Department to investigate the oil industry, hold accountable those responsible, and end any illegal activities that may have increased energy costs.</li>
<li>The allegations against Sheffield, which were revealed in May, involved his coordination with U.S. shale producers to lower output and raise energy prices by aligning oil production with OPEC+ in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico.</li>

McDonald’s said the average U.S. Big Mac was $4.39 in 2019 and now costs $5.29, a 20.5% increase.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“For a brand that proudly serves nearly 90% of the U.S. population every year, we feel a responsibility to make sure the real facts are available,” Erlinger said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Erlinger acknowledged that he and many franchisees were frustrated by a post on X last summer about a Big Mac meal in Connecticut that cost $18, calling the price “an exception.” He noted that franchisees own and operate 95% of U.S. McDonald’s locations and set their own pricing but “work hard to minimize the impact of price increases.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The average U.S. price of a Big Mac meal, which includes a sandwich, fries and a drink, currently is $9.29.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Still, the Chicago burger giant said the cost of some items have seen bigger price jumps than the Big Mac.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tesla has issued a strongly worded letter to investors, criticizing proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis for recommending that shareholders reject Elon Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package.</li>
<li>The letter, titled "What Glass Lewis Got Wrong About Tesla", accuses the firm of biased analysis, using faulty logic, and relying on speculation and hypotheticals.</li>
<li>The compensation package, valued at up to $56 billion, was originally approved by shareholders in 2018 but was later blocked by a Delaware judge due to concerns over its size and Musk's ties to the board.</li>
<li>The package is up for vote again at the upcoming shareholder meeting on June 13, and Glass Lewis is advising shareholders to reject it.</li>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy grew at a sluggish 1.3% annual pace from January through March, the weakest quarterly rate since the spring of 2022, the government said Thursday in a downgrade from its previous estimate. Consumer spending rose but at a slower pace than previously thought, a sign that high interest rates and lingering inflation are pressuring household budgets. </p><p>The Commerce Department had previously estimated that the nation’s gross domestic product — the total output of goods and services — expanded at a 1.6% rate last quarter. </p><p>The first quarter’s GDP growth marked a sharp slowdown from the vigorous 3.4% rate in the final three months of 2023.</p>
    
<p>But last quarter’s pullback was due mainly to two factors — a surge in imports and a reduction in business inventories — that tend to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Thursday’s report showed that imports subtracted more than 1 percentage point from last quarter’s growth. A reduction in business inventories took off nearly half a percentage point.</p>
    

<p>By contrast, consumer spending, which fuels about 70% of economic growth, rose at a 2% annual rate, down from 2.5% in the first estimate and from 3%-plus rates in the previous two quarters. Spending on goods such as appliances and furniture fell at a 1.9% annual pace, the biggest such quarterly drop since 2021. </p>



<p>Still, services spending rose at a healthy 3.9% clip, the most since mid-2021. And an uptick in business investment, led by housing, software and research and development, added more than 1 percentage point to first-quarter annual growth.</p><div class="AudioEnhancement" data-separate-event="audioModule" data-separate-value="AP AUDIO: US economic growth last quarter is revised down from 1.6% rate to 1.3%, but consumers kept spending" data-module="" data-gtm-region="AP AUDIO: US economic growth last quarter is revised down from 1.6% rate to 1.3%, but consumers kept spending" data-align-center="" data-module-number="3" data-main-module-number="3">

<p>A measure of inflation in the January-March GDP report was revised slightly down from the government’s original estimate. But price pressures still picked up in the first quarter. Consumer prices rose at a 3.3% annual pace, up from 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the most in a year. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core inflation rose at a 3.6% clip, up from 2% in each of the previous two quarters.</p>
    

<p>The U.S. economy — the world’s largest — has shown surprising durability since the Federal Reserve started jacking up interest rates more than two years ago in its drive to tame the worst outbreak of inflation in four decades. The much higher borrowing costs that resulted were expected to trigger a recession. But the economy has kept growing, and employers have kept hiring.</p><p>Still, the higher rates appear to be weighing on the economy.</p><p>“The impact of the Fed’s tight interest rate policy is clearly visible in the first quarter GDP report,’' said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica, pointing in particular to a sharp drop in purchases of long-lasting manufactured goods.</p><p>A number of signs have suggested that the economy may be weakening.

After having lifted its benchmark rate to a two-decade high last year, the Fed had signaled that it planned to cut rates three times in 2024. But the central bank has repeatedly pushed back the start of the rate cuts.</p><p>Most Wall Street traders don’t expect the first rate reduction until November, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The rate cuts have been pushed back because inflation, after falling steadily in late 2022 and most of 2023, remains stuck above the Fed’s 2% target level.</p><p>“The outlook going forward is uncertain,″ said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. ”A delay in Fed rate cuts to counter sticky inflation could be headwinds for consumption and the growth trajectory over coming quarters.″ </p>
    

<p>Thursday’s report was the second of three government estimates of first-quarter GDP growth. The Commerce Department will issue its first estimate of the current quarter’s economic performance on July 25. A forecasting tool issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests that economic growth is on track to accelerate to a 3.5% annual rate from April through June.</p>

In the complaint, the Labor Department alleged that all three companies jointly employed the child. </p><p>The move comes after federal investigators found a 13-year-old girl working up to 50 to 60 hours a week on a SMART assembly line in Luverne, Alabama, operating machines that turned sheet metal into auto body parts, the Labor Department said. The child worked at the facility, which provides parts to Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, over a period of six to seven months, and "instead of attending middle school, she worked on an assembly line making parts," the legal document stated. </p>    
  <p>"A 13-year-old working on an assembly line in the United States of America shocks the conscience," Jessica Looman, the DOL's wage and hour division administrator, said in a statement. </p><p>The Korean automaker is liable for repeated child labor violations at SMART Alabama, one of its subsidiaries, between July 11, 2021, through Feb. 1, 2022, according to the department. The child was allegedly dispatched to work at the component parts provider by Best Practice, it said.</p>

"We worked over many months to thoroughly investigate this issue and took immediate and extensive remedial measures. We presented all of this information to the U.S. Department of Labor in an effort to resolve the matter, even while detailing the reasons why no legal basis existed to impose liability under the circumstances."</p>

    </p>
<p>"Unfortunately, the Labor Department is seeking to apply an unprecedented legal theory that would unfairly hold Hyundai accountable for the actions of its suppliers and set a concerning precedent for other automotive companies and manufacturers," the company added.</p><p>Hyundai said its suppliers immediately ended their relationships with the staffing agencies named in the complaint, conducted a review of its U.S. supplier network and imposed tougher workplace standards. In addition, the company said it is now requiring its suppliers in Alabama to conduct independently verified audits of their operations to ensure they comply with labor laws. </p><p>The case marks the first time the Labor Department has sued a major company for allegedly violating child labor law at a subcontractor, and stems from a government probe and separate Reuters report that unveiled widespread and illegal use of migrant child laborers at suppliers of Hyundai in Alabama. </p><p>Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-immigration-hyundai/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> in 2022 that children as young as 12 were working for a Hyundai subsidiary and in other parts suppliers for the company in the Southern state. </p><p>The wire service reported on underaged workers at Smart after the brief disappearance in February 2022 of a Guatemalan migrant child from her family's home in Alabama. The 13-year-old girl and two brothers, 12 and 15, worked at the plant in 2022 and were not going to school, sources told Reuters at the time. </p><p>The Labor Department in fiscal 2023 investigated 955 cases with child labor violations involving 5,792 kids nationwide, including 502 employed in violation of hazardous occupation standards. </p><p>Some minors have suffered serious and fatal injuries on the job, including 16-year-old Michael Schuls, who died after getting <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/child-labor-laws-wisconsin-sawmill-florence-hardwoods/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">pulled into machinery at a Wisconsin sawmill last summer.</a></span> Another 16-year-old worker also perished last summer after <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/child-labor-marc-jac-poultry-teenager-death/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">getting caught in a machine at a poultry plant in Mississippi</a></span>. </p>

<ol>
<li>Walgreens is cutting prices across the board, including on over 1,500 items online and in-store, to attract back inflation-weary shoppers.</li>
<li>The price reductions include discounts on snacks, toiletries, and even Squishmallows, with examples including a $13.49 vitamin jar now selling for $11.99 and a 16-inch Squishmallow plush now selling for $20.</li>
<li>Walgreens is joining other retailers, such as Target, Walmart, and Amazon, in slashing prices on thousands of household goods to boost consumer spending.</li>
<li>The retailer's CEO, Tracey D. Brown, cited the financial struggles of customers as a reason for the price cuts, stating that Walgreens is committed to helping customers by lowering prices on additional items.</li>
<li>The price cuts are part of a broader trend among retailers to lower prices and lure customers back into stores and online, as high prices have forced Americans to choose between wants and needs amidst inflation and economic uncertainty.</li>

For kids, the price of a 16-inch Squishmallow plush has gone from $24.99 to $20.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"Walgreens understands our customers are under financial strain and struggle to purchase everyday essentials," said Tracey D. Brown, Walgreens' retail president and chief customer officer, in a release. "We continue to be committed to our customers by lowering prices on over a thousand additional items, something we've been doing since October of 2023."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Walgreens Boots Alliance's (WBA) most recent earnings report, released in March, revealed that the retailers' second-quarter sales beat expectations, but lowered its full-year earnings outlook because of a "challenging retail environment in the US."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Shares are down 40% year to date and its next earnings report isn't expected until June. Meanwhile, a host of other retailers report earnings Thursday, including Dollar General and Costco.</p><h3 class="vPZug oPAle xcLAU bunQU uhXXI PjNjV lNbol LBPRq">Shoppers' savings</h3><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">A number of big retailers are lowering prices as they strive to pull consumers into stores and online to spend more freely on both essential purchases such as food and more discretionary purchases like new clothes, decorative items for the home, arts and crafts or hobby kits.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Retailers are feeling jittery after they hiked up prices as inflation spiked in recent years. But now, households aren't shopping like they used to, and high prices are forcing Americans to choose between wants and needs. In the game of chicken between stores and shoppers, it's the stores that finally appear to be yielding.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">That presents an ongoing challenge for the whole American economy, of which about two-thirds comes from consumer spending.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Shoppers have pulled back for a year now as costs have risen 20% to 30% higher than they were three years ago and as incomes failed to keep up, said Sarah Wyeth, managing director, retail and consumer with S&amp;P Global Ratings.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">This is making consumers across income levels look for deals. "There's just less dollars for consumers to spend," Wyeth said. The challenge for retailers now is to shake consumers out of that frugal mindset, she added.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN"><em>The-CNN-Wire  &amp;  2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
