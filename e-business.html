    <div><p>The Federal Reserve has talked financial markets into creating an easier environment, which paradoxically makes lowering rates a more difficult task for the central bank, a top economist said.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>The Bloomberg US Financial Conditions Index indicates that the availability and cost of credit across money, bond, and equity markets are significantly more favorable today than when the Fed began raising rates in March 2022, according to Apollo Chief Economist Torsten Sløk.</p>



<p>That’s due to the central bank’s pivot in November, when Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that inflation was cooling enough to halt rate hikes and start thinking about when rate cuts could begin. </p>



<p>Wall Street interpreted the comments, incorrectly as it turned out, to mean easing would be imminent and that as many as six cuts would happen in 2024, sparking a massive stock market rally.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.apolloacademy.com/the-fed-cut-reflexivity-paradox/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.apolloacademy.com/the-fed-cut-reflexivity-paradox/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.apolloacademy.com/the-fed-cut-reflexivity-paradox/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">blog post</a> on Wednesday, Sløk estimated that the S&amp;P 500 stock index has added $9 trillion in market cap since then and compared it to the $19 trillion in consumer spending last year.</p><p></p>



<p>“In other words, in a few months, the household sector has experienced a windfall gain corresponding to about 50% of last year’s consumer spending!” he wrote.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the federal government has been spending trillions of dollars on infrastructure, green-energy initiatives, and semiconductor production capacity. </p>



<p>As a result, the economy has remained strong as this fiscal stimulus continues to fuel growth while easier financial conditions offset Fed rate hikes, Sløk noted. </p>



<p>In fact, the economy was so strong earlier this year that inflation readings came in above forecasts and showed signs of reaccelerating. That forced Powell to warn that rates could stay high for “<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/17/jerome-powell-inflation-economy-interest-rates-higher-longer/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/17/jerome-powell-inflation-economy-interest-rates-higher-longer/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/04/17/jerome-powell-inflation-economy-interest-rates-higher-longer/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">as long as needed</a>” because inflation appeared to be taking longer than anticipated to reach the Fed’s 2% target.</p>



<p>Still, he later acknowledged that <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/01/jerome-powell-stagflation-1970s-inflation-economic-growth-interest-rates/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/01/jerome-powell-stagflation-1970s-inflation-economic-growth-interest-rates/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/01/jerome-powell-stagflation-1970s-inflation-economic-growth-interest-rates/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">further rate increases were unlikely</a> and reaffirmed that the Fed’s next move—whenever that will be—is likely a rate cut. </p><p></p>



<p>And that’s precisely the mistake Powell is making, in Sløk’s view. </p>



<p>“Looking ahead, with the stock market hitting fresh all-time highs and fiscal policy still supportive, the expectation in markets should be that the economy will continue to accelerate over the coming quarters,” he wrote. “You can call this the Fed Cut Reflexivity Paradox: The more the Fed insists that the next move in interest rates is a cut, the more financial conditions will ease, making it more difficult for the Fed to cut.”</p>



<p>To be sure, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/economy-gdp-growth-high-interest-rates-1-6/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/economy-gdp-growth-high-interest-rates-1-6/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/economy-gdp-growth-high-interest-rates-1-6/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">GDP growth slowed</a> in the first quarter from the fourth quarter, and was revised down to an annualized rate of 1.3% from a prior reading of 1.6%. The latest report also showed that fiscal stimulus was having a smaller effect. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>But consumer spending on services remained strong, and more recent data on jobless claims showed the labor market continues to hold up.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-economy-inflation-minutes-interest-rates/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-economy-inflation-minutes-interest-rates/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-economy-inflation-minutes-interest-rates/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">minutes from the Fed’s last policy meeting</a> revealed that the economy’s resilience in the face of rates at 23-year highs had prompted some officials to wonder whether all their tightening was exerting enough pressure on growth. High interest rates “may be having smaller effects than in the past,” the minutes said.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

<li><strong>Long-term commitment</strong>: The company's commitment to keep the price of the hot dog combo at $1.50 is a long-term one, with no plans to change it, despite rising costs and inflation.</li>

<p>The legendary wiener, along with Costco’s nearly-as-famous $5 rotisserie chicken, are “foundational” to the warehouse chain’s success, Richard Galanti, who recently stepped down as chief financial officer, told <em>Fortune’s </em>Phil Wahba in a <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/costco-retail-walmart-wholesale-membership-management/?asdafs" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/costco-retail-walmart-wholesale-membership-management/?asdafs" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">recent deep dive</a> into the warehouse club’s stunning success. </p>



<p>Previously, Galanti told the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>the $1.50 price was “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-1-50-costco-hot-dog-combo-that-defies-inflation-11657753870" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-1-50-costco-hot-dog-combo-that-defies-inflation-11657753870" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">sacrosanct</a>,” and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/26/costco-cfo-says-hot-dog-and-soda-combo-price-is-forever.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/26/costco-cfo-says-hot-dog-and-soda-combo-price-is-forever.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">declared</a> to investors that the dogs’ price point would stay fixed “forever.” </p>



<p>Galanti’s successor as CFO, Gary Millerchip, this week reiterated that commitment. “I also want to confirm the $1.50 hot dog price is safe,” Millerchip told CNN reporter Nathaniel Meyersohn, according to an <a href="https://x.com/nmeyersohn/status/1796297084691431661" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/nmeyersohn/status/1796297084691431661" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">X</a> post.</p>



<p>In fact, Costco will overhaul its entire hot-dog supply chain before it will raise the price of the dog. When Costco introduced the $1.50 combo in 1985, it sourced its kosher beef dogs from Hebrew National. But by 2009, costs had gone up so much that the warehouse club brought production in-house. It built a <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/547020/costco-150-hot-dog-soda-combo-enigma" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/547020/costco-150-hot-dog-soda-combo-enigma" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">plant outside Los Angeles</a> to produce Signature Kirkland hot dogs (not kosher), and later expanded production to add a second plant in the Chicago area. </p><p></p>



<p>Same thing with the soda part of the combo: When Costco’s contract with <a href="https://fortune.com/company/coca-cola/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/coca-cola/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">Coca-Cola</a> was up for renewal a decade ago, the retailer instead switched to Pepsi to <a href="https://www.bevnet.com/news/2013/pepsicos-in-the-club-store-that-is-capturing-costco-food-service-account/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bevnet.com/news/2013/pepsicos-in-the-club-store-that-is-capturing-costco-food-service-account/" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">save on prices</a>. To avoid San Francisco’s tax on sugary drinks, Costco chose to serve only die<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Sugary-Drinks-Tax-San-Francisco-Costco-diet-sodas-12841671.php" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Sugary-Drinks-Tax-San-Francisco-Costco-diet-sodas-12841671.php" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">t sodas or unsweetened tea</a> in its food courts.</p>



<p>That commitment to a rock-bottom price stretches all the way back to the warehouse club’s founder, Jim Sinegal. </p>



<p>As Sinegal’s successor and onetime CEO Craig Jelinek explained back in 2018, he once suggested to Sinegal that the price of the money-losing dogs should be raised.</p>



<p>“I came to [Sinegal] once and I said, ‘Jim, we can’t sell this hot dog for a buck fifty. We are losing our rear ends,’” Jelinek <a href="https://www.425business.com/news/costco-ceo-craig-jelinek-on-shareholders-costco-com-and-hot-dogs/article_5ff4b632-1f75-5e98-b9ff-6e02d676668b.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.425business.com/news/costco-ceo-craig-jelinek-on-shareholders-costco-com-and-hot-dogs/article_5ff4b632-1f75-5e98-b9ff-6e02d676668b.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">recalled</a> at a business event near Seattle.</p>



<p>Sinegal’s response: “If you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out,” Jelinek continued.</p><p></p>



<p>“That’s all I really needed,” he said. Bringing production in-house, he added, eventually enabled the store to turn a profit on the popular menu item even at a $1.50 price tag. Today, Costco sells nearly 200 million hot dogs a year from its food courts, <em>Fortune</em>’s Wahba reports. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The importance of low prices</strong></h2>



<p>But why is it so critical to keep the price frozen at $1.50—what one online user <a href="https://x.com/fermiparasocks/status/1796392640109576477" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/fermiparasocks/status/1796392640109576477" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">dubbed</a> “the most stable commodity on earth”? After all, Costco has raised plenty of other prices throughout its stores, and periodically adjusts its membership fee upward.</p>



<p>As Galanti <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/costco-retail-walmart-wholesale-membership-management/?asdafs" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/costco-retail-walmart-wholesale-membership-management/?asdafs" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">explained</a> to <em>Fortune</em>, the price is there to send a message. A $5 chicken and $1.50 dog “signal that Costco is holding the line on low prices.” </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>It’s the same message as sent by Costco’s heavily discounted TV and appliances, strategically stocked by the members’ entrance, as new CEO Ron Vachris told <em>Fortune. </em>“You come in and say, ‘Wait, I can recoup my $60 membership with one item?’ ” he said.</p>



<p>That strategic bolstering of Costco’s reputation helps engender huge loyalty among its 120 million-plus members, and keeps them coming back, retail consultant Kathy Gersch told <em>Fortune</em>. “People tell themselves, ‘Costco has done the research for me, and they know this is the best one,’ ” she notes.</p><p></p>



<p>It’s one of the reasons that more than 90% of Cosctco’s members renew their membership every year. And, regardless of how much merchandise Costco sells or what it costs, it’s that membership that truly pays the bills.</p>



<p>“The most important item we sell is the membership card,” Vachris told <em>Fortune. </em>“Everything we do supports that transaction.”</p>



<p>As Wahba reports, the $60 annual membership fee (or $120 for additional perks) made up two-thirds of Costco’s profit in any given year, and in several recent years, the retailer would have posted a net loss were it not for membership fees. </p>



<p>The hot dog’s iconic status means its price is now Costco lore. And the longer the price stays put, the harder it will be to raise it. </p>



<p>“It’s the mindset,” former CEO Jelinek said. “When you think of Costco, you think of the $1.50 hot dog.”</p></div></div>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>Ethan Gaskill, a 29-year-old content creator, begins everyday the same way: “When I wake up in the morning—most people get on their phone and start checking Instagram—I check <a href="https://fortune.com/company/facebook/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Facebook;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="13" data-v9y="0">Facebook</a> Marketplace.”</p><p>With his Los Angeles home furnished almost exclusively with second-hand items and a TikTok with over 220,000 followers interested in his thrifty hauls, Gaskill trusts the shopping platform to be a reliable source for hidden gems: a thousand-dollar <a href="https://store.hermanmiller.com/lighting-ceiling-lights-pendants/nelson-bell-bubble-pendant/2196757.html?lang=en_US" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Herman Miller light and pendant;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="0">Herman Miller light and pendant</a> he nabbed for $400; a $5,000 bed from the same designer he bought for 20% of the original price; and, a Founders mid-century dresser worth $4,000 that Gaskill got for $800.</p><p>https://www.tiktok.com/@ethancgaskill/video/7373705691070090539</p><p>“It gives an opportunity for people to possibly bring in really rare items or just one-of-a-kind items into their home that otherwise they wouldn't have had if they couldn't make it out to a flea market or estate sale,” Gaskill told <em>Fortune</em>.</p><p>Facebook Marketplace has not only become a trusted source for LA’s second-hand scene. It’s made itself a real contender to go toe-to-toe with well-established e-commerce sites. Facebook has grown to <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2023-Results-Initiates-Quarterly-Dividend/default.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:3.07 billion monthly active users;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="0">3.07 billion monthly active users</a> (MAUs) as of the end of 2023, a 3% year-over-year increase. Of those, up to 40%, or 1.2 billion, are active users shopping on Marketplace, according to a March <a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/facebook-marketplace-statistics/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:report from Capital One Shopping;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0">report from Capital One Shopping</a>.</p><p>Meta’s online second-hand market is already challenging the sector’s goliaths. Marketplace eclipsed Craigslist’s MAUs years ago, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying in 2018 that there were <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/29/how-facebook-marketplace-replaced-craigslist-in-2020.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:800 million Marketplace MAUs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="0">800 million Marketplace MAUs</a>, compared to the 55 million visitors on Craigslist in 2017. In contrast, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amazon;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="0">Amazon</a> had 310 million monthly users in 2023, <a href="https://techreport.com/statistics/software-web/amazon-statistics/#:~:text=Amazon%20has%20310%20million%20active%20users%20in%202023.&amp;text=As%20of%202023%2C%20Amazon%20is,from%20the%20region%20in%202022." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per Tech Report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0">per Tech Report</a>, about one-fourth of Marketplace’s MAUs. Marketplace is the second most popular site for second-hand purchases behind Ebay, according to a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1271820/second-hand-online-platforms-united-states/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2022 Statista report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="0">2022 Statista report</a>.</p><p>“This is a growth area,” Charles Lindsey, associate professor of marketing at University at Buffalo School of Management, told <em>Fortune</em>. “It wouldn't surprise me if in three years, five years, it actually overtakes Ebay.”</p><p>Amazon and Ebay did not respond to <em>Fortune</em>’s request for comment.</p><h2><strong>From online garage sale to e-commerce giant</strong></h2><p>Marketplace’s astronomical growth is in large part because the platform is simply easy to use and already linked to a site where so many people are pre-existing members, Lindsey argued.</p><p>“There's a trust factor because it's associated with Facebook,” he said. “It has an easy-to-use interface. It's integrated with Facebook Messenger, so it's easy to kind of go back and forth.”</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Launched in 2016, Marketplace was originally a way to facilitate sales among neighbors, with most users offering up a used item for sale at a reasonable price, and buyers picking up the item and coordinating with the seller over Facebook Messenger about collection and payment. But Marketplace grew into a formidable e-commerce platform, with one-in-three U.S. Facebook users on the platform <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/10/marketplace-turns-two/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:by 2018;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="0">by 2018</a>. Through the pandemic, Marketplace exploded thanks to increased reliance on e-commerce and supply chain and shipping delays that inconvenienced traditional shopping.</p><p>“We’re seeing everyone from artisans hand making goods, to wood workers to car sellers thrive,” Deb Liu, founder and then-Marketplace vice president, <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/facebook-marketplace-pandemic-growth/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told Modern Retail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="0">told <em>Modern Retail</em></a> in 2021.</p><p>By then, Marketplace had become a boon not only for thrifty shoppers, but small businesses looking for unique sales avenues. Springfield, Missouri-based Beautiful Fight Woodworking generated $168,000 of its $266,000 revenue in 2020 exclusively through Marketplace sales.</p><p>To be sure, the platform isn’t without significant problems, particularly as scammers and bot accounts have proliferated the site, giving well-intentioned buyers a tough time. One South Carolina user claimed in February he was <a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/crime/sc-man-scammed-selling-car/275-d8d22c6c-d980-4573-b53a-2c56dca86330" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scammed out of $18,000;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="0">scammed out of $18,000</a> after putting his 2016 Audi up for sale on Marketplace. A 2022 <a href="https://www.thinkmoney.co.uk/blog/the-facebook-marketplace-scams-you-didnt-know-about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:thinkmonkey survey of 1,000 Brits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="0">thinkmonkey survey of 1,000 Brits</a> found that one in six had been scammed on the platform.</p><p>“What happens offline often makes its way into online environments, and that unfortunately includes scams," Ryan Daniels, a Meta spokesperson, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/zelle-scammers-are-ruining-facebook-marketplace/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told Wired;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="0">told <em>Wired</em></a>. Meta said it works “aggressively to quickly identify, disable, and ban scams and accounts associated with them.”</p><h2><strong>Gen Z’s new favorite social media</strong></h2><p>Through its ascension, Marketplace has won over a generation of young people who had largely <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/08/facebook-fights-for-relevance-gen-z-turns-away-old-people-mark-zuckerberg/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:turned away from Facebook;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="0">turned away from Facebook</a>.</p><p>“I look at it like it's like a social media app,” Dre Vez, a 25-year-old content creator, told <em>Fortune</em>.</p><p>Vez spends about six to 12 hours a day on Marketplace, where he makes a living “trolling” sellers by asking them over voice memos to test the product, before uploading the interactions to TikTok for his 755,000 followers.</p><p>He finds Marketplace not just fodder for entertaining videos but also as a real social media tool for Gen Z and millennials because it's fast-paced and highly stimulating.</p><p>“It's the ability to have several interactions in a short duration of time, where I could go on Facebook marketplace, and I could search up for a bike, and I could reach out to seven to 10 different people and have all these conversations going on at the same time,” he said.</p><p>Even on days when he can’t find a good deal, Vez finds some laughs on the site. Sellers have gotten away with listing used toe nail clippers, toilet brushes, plungers—even a Dorito in the shape of a face going for $10,000, he recalled.</p><p>Meta has taken notice of its enthusiastic young users. While Facebook’s popularity among teens <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/08/10/teens-social-media-and-technology-2022/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:has dwindled;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="0">has dwindled</a> in the wake of TikTok’s rise, Facebook now has over 40 million daily young adult users aged 18 to 29 in the U.S. and Canada, a three-year high, with one in four using Marketplace, Meta told <em>Fortune</em>.</p><p>To second-hand connoisseur Gaskill, who checks Marketplace five to 10 times a day, the platform is compelling to young people because it appeals to their desire for independence, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/learning/what-students-are-saying-about-gen-zs-values-thrift-shopping-and-beloved-family-members.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:save money;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="0">save money</a>, and <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/09/research-consumers-sustainability-demands-are-rising" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protect the environment;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="30" data-v9y="0">protect the environment</a> against the strains of mass production and freight.</p><p>“Just given the circumstances with the economy, but also just the mindset of like Gen Z, they love uniqueness, and they love self expression,” he said. “But they also really like finding things for a good price.”</p><h2><strong>Finding room to grow</strong></h2><p>But just because Meta boasts a growing fandom for its Marketplace platform doesn’t mean its a lucrative arm of the company. Meta did not respond to <em>Fortune</em>’s request for comment on how it makes money through Marketplace, but marketing professor Lindsey suggests the company benefits from seller transaction fees, as well as more eyes on the website’s advertisements.</p><p>“Just overall, the more likely someone uses Facebook Marketplace, probably the more likely they also log into Facebook so many times per month,” he said. “Then Facebook capitalizes on that by being able to have companies pay for advertising that then hits my feed, hits your feed.”</p><p>The EU’s European Commission alleged in December 2022 that Facebook and Marketplace tie together and use data in a way that infringe on the EU’s competition rules, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680124000012/meta-20231231.htm#ibbcdb9a98fd34a92b3add929872a8009_1844" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:December 2023 SEC filing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="31" data-v9y="0">December 2023 SEC filing</a>.</p><p>Marketplace is, in part, an important facet of Facebook’s financial puzzle because its locally based exchanges are low-expense, according to Sucharita Kodali, retail industry analyst for market research firm Forrester—especially, compared to Ebay, which requires a massive international infrastructure.</p><p>“It's an enormous transaction volume,” she told Fortune. “With that transaction volume comes a kind of a necessary investment in a lot of automation, customer service, seller management, seller tools, etc.”</p><p>While Facebook Marketplace doesn’t need an elaborate system to manage local transactions, it also means it’s likely not making as much money as its e-commerce competition. In fact, Kodali went so far as to call Marketplace an “anti-commerce” platform because it has so many “buy nothing” groups and peer-to-peer exchanges. She took a similar stance as Lindsey, arguing the financial merit of the platform is to help better target ads for active users.</p><p>“It's not really about, like, ‘Let's make money off of the volume of posts that we see on the marketplace section,’” she said.</p><p>Marketplace’s virtual garage sale vibes and community feel of the platform may not be raking in billions of dollars for Meta, but they’re exactly what keeps users coming back to the site.</p><p>“You never know when that next amazing thing is gonna pop up,” Gaskill said. “That's the fun of it. That's kind of what keeps it addicting.”</p><p>This story was originally featured on <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-marketplace-ecommerce-amazon-gen-z/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="32" data-v9y="0">Fortune.com</a></p></div></div>

<li>President Joe Biden has vetoed H.J.Res. 109, a congressional resolution that aimed to overturn the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approach to banks and crypto.</li>
<li>The resolution targeted the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which requires banks to treat customers' crypto assets as liabilities, making it expensive for banks to handle crypto transactions.</li>

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">President Joe Biden has vetoed H.J.Res. 109, a congressional resolution that would have overturned the Securities and Exchange Commission’s current approach to banks and crypto.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Specifically, the resolution targeted the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which presents guidance around how banks can handle customers’ crypto assets — in effect, they must treat those assets as liabilities. Banking groups have criticized this approach as making it prohibitively expensive for them to handle crypto, while regulators argue it’s necessary to protect investors, particularly after the collapse of high-profile crypto companies like FTX.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“SAB 121 reflects considered technical SEC staff views regarding the accounting obligations of certain firms that safeguard crypto-assets,” Biden said in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/05/31/a-message-to-the-house-of-representatives-on-the-presidents-veto-of-h-j-res-109/">a statement</a>. “By virtue of invoking the Congressional Review Act, this Republican-led resolution would inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to set forth appropriate guardrails and address future issues.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Biden went on to say his administration “will not support measures that jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors.”</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">H.J.Res. 109 was passed with mostly Republican support — but 21 Democrats supported the resolution in the House, and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was among the Democrats who supported it in the Senate.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The president had <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SAP-HJRes109.pdf">previously indicated his intention</a> to veto the resolution, while Representative Mike Flood (the Republican congressman who sponsored H.J.Res. 109 in the House) <a href="https://flood.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-flood-applauds-senate-passage-sab-121-repeal">argued</a> Biden should reconsider given the “overwhelming opposition to SAB 121.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Organizations opposing SAB 121 include the American Bankers Association and other financial industry lobbying groups, as well as the crypto industry advocacy group <a href="https://www.standwithcrypto.org/bills/hjres109-118-US">Stand With Crypto</a>.</p>
<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">
</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“SAB 121 effectively precludes regulated banking organizations from offering digital asset custody at scale since it treats the assets as if they are owned rather than simply custodied by a banking organization,” the ABA and other industry groups said in <a href="https://www.aba.com/advocacy/policy-analysis/letter-to-president-biden-sab-121">an open letter to President Biden</a>.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The White House’s announcement left the door open to further negotiations around crypto regulation.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“My Administration is eager to work with the Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities, which will promote the responsible development of digital assets and payment innovation and help reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system,” Biden said.</p>

As of Friday's close, the company was worth about $2.7 trillion.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/28/kindig-nvidia-is-heading-towards-a-10-trillion-market-cap.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interview Tuesday on CNBC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0">interview Tuesday on CNBC</a>, she pointed out Nvidia is fueling the AI infrastructure as its chips are in high demand for data centers that train large language models and later this year will release its Blackwell chips, which are expected to outperform the earlier Hopper chips.</p><p>In addition to hardware, Nvidia's software also gives it an advantage, while the automotive sector will deliver a further boost to the company, Kindig noted.</p><p>"So we have a lot coming," she said. "This is very, very early for Nvidia, and there's a few layers."</p><p>While rivals like <a href="https://fortune.com/company/advanced-micro-devices/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:AMD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="0">AMD</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/intel/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Intel;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="0">Intel</a> have made their own bullish forecasts on the AI market, Kindig said Nvidia will grab the "lion's share," adding that other tech giants developing chips in-house typically do it to optimize their own applications and won't commercialize the chips the way Nvidia does.</p><p>On the software side, she pointed to Nvidia's CUDA platform, comparing it to Apple's iOS operating system, which helped make the iPhone dominant.</p><p>"The same thing is happening with Nvidia, which is that the CUDA platform is what software engineers, AI engineers are learning in order to program GPUs," Kindig said. "So that helps lock them in. So that combination, right now, I'm calling an impenetrable moat."</p><p>She has doubled down on a previous forecast for a $10 trillion valuation that she issued earlier this year, when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-NemmDDCrk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:she told RealVision;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0">she told RealVision</a> that Nvidia would reach that milestone by 2030.</p><p>Since then, Nvidia has reported <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-earnings-stock-split-jensen-huang-blackwell-ai/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiscal first-quarter earnings;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="0">fiscal first-quarter earnings</a> that topped Wall Street estimates and showed the race toward AI remained robust.</p><p>“The industry is going through a major change,” CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call last month. “The next industrial revolution has begun. Companies and countries are partnering with Nvidia to shift the trillion-dollar installed base of data centers to accelerate computing and build a new type of data center, AI factories, to produce a new commodity, artificial intelligence.”</p><p>This story was originally featured on <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/nvidia-stock-outlook-market-cap-10-trillion-cuda-software-impenetrable-moat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="0">Fortune.com</a></p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Lawsuit filed against Poppi</strong>: A class-action lawsuit was filed against Poppi, a popular prebiotic soda, alleging that the drink is not as "gut healthy" as advertised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of prebiotic fiber</strong>: The lawsuit claims that Poppi contains only 2 grams of prebiotic fiber, which is too low to cause meaningful gut health benefits. To achieve health benefits, a consumer would need to drink more than 4 Poppi sodas a day, which has its own negative effects due to the high sugar content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Marketing deception</strong>: The lawsuit alleges that Poppi's marketing claims are false and that consumers were misled into paying a "substantial price premium" for the soda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Concerns over agave inulin</strong>: The lawsuit also cites studies showing that excessive consumption of agave inulin, the prebiotic found in Poppi, can have adverse health effects, including negatively impacting health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lawsuit filed by San Francisco woman</strong>: The lawsuit was filed by Kristin Cobbs of San Francisco on behalf of herself and "similarly situated" consumers of Poppi against the parent company, VNGR Beverage LLC.</p>

<ol>
<li>The FDA has approved Moderna's mRNA-1345, also known as mRESVIA, a vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for adults aged 60 and older, to protect against lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV infection.</li>
<li>mRESVIA is the second approved mRNA product from Moderna, and it is the only RSV vaccine available in a single-dose pre-filled syringe designed to ease administration and reduce administrative errors.</li>

(NASDAQ:MRNA) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved mRESVIA (mRNA-1345), an mRNA respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, to protect adults aged 60 years and older from lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV infection. The approval was granted under a breakthrough therapy designation and marks the second approved mRNA product from Moderna.</p><p>"The FDA approval of our second product, mRESVIA, builds on the strength and versatility of our mRNA platform," said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. "mRESVIA protects older adults from the severe outcomes of RSV infection, and it is the only RSV vaccine available in a pre-filled syringe designed to maximize ease of administration, saving vaccinators' time and reducing the risk of administrative errors. This approval is also the first time an mRNA vaccine has been approved for a disease other than COVID-19. With mRESVIA, we continue to deliver for patients by addressing global public health threats related to infectious diseases."</p><p>RSV is a highly contagious seasonal respiratory virus and a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections and pneumonia that causes a particularly large burden of disease in infants and older adults. Each year in the U.S., approximately 60,000-160,000 older adults are hospitalized and 6,000-10,000 die due to RSV infection.[1]</p><p>The FDA's approval of mRESVIA is based on positive data from the Phase 3 clinical trial ConquerRSV, a global study conducted in approximately 37,000 adults ages 60 years or older in 22 countries. The primary analysis with 3.7 months of median follow-up found a vaccine efficacy against RSV lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) of 83.7% (95.88% CI 66.0%, 92.2%). These results were published in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://pr.report/7cxpHdZt"><i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i></a>. A follow-up analysis of the primary endpoint was performed during FDA review, including cases that started before the primary analysis cut-off date but were not confirmed until afterward. The results were consistent with the primary analysis [VE 78.7% (CI 62.9%, 87.8%)] and were included in the U.S. package insert. An additional longer-term analysis showed continued protection against RSV LRTD over 8.6 months median follow-up.</p><p>No serious safety concerns were identified in the Phase 3 trial. The most commonly reported solicited adverse reactions were injection site pain, fatigue, headache, myalgia and arthralgia.</p><p>Moderna expects to have mRESVIA available for eligible populations in the U.S. by the 2024/2025 respiratory virus season.</p><p>Moderna has filed for mRNA-1345 approval with regulators in multiple markets around the world.</p><p><strong>About mRESVIA<sup>®</sup> (Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine)</strong></p><p>mRESVIA<sup>®</sup>is an RSV vaccine that consists of an mRNA sequence encoding a stabilized prefusion F glycoprotein. The F glycoprotein is expressed on the surface of the virus and is required for infection by helping the virus to enter host cells. The prefusion conformation of the F protein is a significant target of potent neutralizing antibodies and is highly conserved across both RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes. The vaccine uses the same lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.</p><p><strong>About Moderna</strong></p><p>Moderna is a leader in the creation of the field of mRNA medicine. Through the advancement of mRNA technology, Moderna is reimagining how medicines are made and transforming how we treat and prevent disease for everyone. By working at the intersection of science, technology and health for more than a decade, the company has developed medicines at unprecedented speed and efficiency, including one of the earliest and most effective COVID-19 vaccines.</p><p>Moderna's mRNA platform has enabled the development of therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases and autoimmune diseases.

<ol>
<li>Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Technologies, saw his net worth drop by $11.7 billion to $107.1 billion on Friday, after the company's shares fell 18% in New York, the most on record.</li>
<li>The decline in share price was despite Dell Technologies reporting its first quarterly revenue increase in two years, as investors were disappointed by the company's AI server business.</li>
<li>Dell's fortune comes from his stake in both Dell Technologies and Broadcom, which also slid in value on Friday.</li>
<li>Michael Dell, 59, is the chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies and ranks 13th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, having joined the group of individuals with fortunes exceeding $100 billion in early March.</li>
<li>The surge in demand for equipment assisting artificial intelligence computing has driven a blistering rally in AI-related stocks, with tech billionaires such as Jensen Huang, co-founder of Nvidia, also seeing their wealth skyrocket.</li>

<p>Dell’s net worth dropped $11.7 billion to $107.1 billion on Friday as shares of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/dell-technologies/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/dell-technologies/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">Dell</a> Technologies Inc. fell 18% in New York — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-30/dell-s-3-8-billion-ai-server-backlog-fails-to-impress-investors" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-30/dell-s-3-8-billion-ai-server-backlog-fails-to-impress-investors" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">the most on record</a>.

<p>Almost half of Dell’s fortune comes from the Texas-based computer maker, which he started 40 years ago while a student at the University of Texas.

The stock has tripled in the past 12 months.</p>

<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has reiterated his “Overweight” rating and $310 per share price target for electric vehicle maker Tesla (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASDAQ:TSLA</a>). In his comments, the analyst discussed Tesla’s upcoming 2024 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, as well as the potential results of the vote surrounding Elon Musk’s 2018 compensation plan. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, Elon Musk’s 2018 CEO Performance Award was rescinded by a Delaware Judge, which resulted in Tesla asking its shareholders to ratify the 2018 compensation plan at the 2024 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting. The company has been putting in a lot of effort to encourage shareholders to vote for the ratification of Musk’s pay plan, as well as Tesla’s redomestication to Texas. </p>



 



 




<p>The Morgan Stanley analyst, for his part, noted that Elon Musk likely needs Tesla now more than ever amidst the <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-must-find-ways-to-reward-musk-jefferies/">emerging AI industry</a>. Jonas also noted that TSLA stock would likely see volatility due to the shareholder vote surrounding Musk’s 2018 CEO Performance Award. </p>



<p>“We’ve encouraged investors to pay close attention to the June 13th shareholder vote due to its significance to the long-term strategic direction of the company. We believe that CEO Elon Musk needs Tesla now more than ever, as Al is a capital game – the broader collection of Elon Musk’s businesses may collectively invest many tens of billions of dollars in Al infrastructure in coming years, and cost of capital is deterministic for Al supremacy. </p>



<p>The Morgan Stanley analyst noted that based on an <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-shareholders-urged-vote-for-ratification-musk-2018-pay-plan/">investor survey</a> that it conducted, it appears that TSLA shareholders will vote in favor of Musk’s compensation plan. Following is a summary of the results of Morgan Stanley’s survey, which was gathered from 109 respondents. </p>



 



<p>“The majority of respondents (57%) expect Elon’s compensation package to be approved, outnumbering respondents who do not expect approval (23%) by more than 2:1. If Elon’s comp package is approved, majority (68%) expect Tesla stock price to react positively over the next three trading days (24% expect TSLA shares up 6-10%+, 44% expect TSLA shares up 3-5%, outnumbering those who expect the stock to be down upon approval by almost 6x.</p>



<p>“ If Elon’s comp package is approved, 20% expect a neutral stock price reaction (+/- 2%) over the subsequent three trading days, whereas if the comp package is not approved, only 7% expect a neutral stock price reaction. In the event that the package is not approved, the vast majority (81%) of respondents expect the stock price to be down, and 54% expect the stock to be down significantly (-6-10% or more),” the analyst wrote. </p>

<ol>
<li>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby believes that United has joined Delta in creating a premium product in a commodity business, and therefore has an advantage over other airlines, including American Airlines.</li>
<li>Kirby implied that American Airlines may have to reduce capacity at its hubs in order to recover from a recent downward revision of its second-quarter guidance.</li>
<li>Kirby stated that airlines that lose money on certain routes will ultimately need to stop flying those routes, and he believes that United is uniquely profitable across all of its hubs.</li>
<li>Kirby attributed American Airlines' reduced guidance to a "forecast issue, not weakness," and said that a failed distribution initiative had only a small impact.</li>
<li>Kirby emphasized United's superiority over American in terms of profitability and appeal to premium passengers, using the example of seatback entertainment, which he claimed United has adopted more effectively.</li>

    <div><div class="article-body fs-article fs-responsive-text current-article"><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-0" role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion class="expandable" current="-1"><p class="color-body light-text" aria-expanded="false">United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby celebrates expansion of Denver flight training center in February. <span class="plus" data-ga-track="caption expand">... [+]</span><span class="expanded-caption"> (Photo by Hyoung Chang)</span></p></fbs-accordion><small>Denver Post via Getty Images</small></figcaption></figure>
<p>At an investor conference Wednesday, the focus was on American Airlines CEO Robert Isom, who had to explain just-released disappointing second quarter guidance, the departure of a top executive and the failure of an effort to limit corporate travel agency access to low fares.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p class="article_paragraph_2"></p>
<p>The presentation that followed Isom’s was by United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby. It didn’t get as much attention.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p>That’s understandable. Kirby said, as he has said for months, that United now competes with Delta to be the leading U.S. airline. “There are two airlines that are probably going to be close to 100% percent of airline profitability this year,” he said.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>
<p>But this time, American’s unfortunate week seemed to underscore Kirby’s thesis that United has joined Delta in creating a premium product in a commodity business. Kirby implied that one outcome could be that American may have to pull back capacity at some of its hubs. In fact, in Chicago, American has already downsized since the pandemic.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p>

<p>“Airlines can't fly places that they lose money,” Kirby said. “I look at everyone that's not Delta or United, and they have large chunks of their route network that lose money. I know where; I know how much; they can do the same for us. We make money in all seven of our hubs. We're pretty unique at that.”</p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"><p id="article-0-inread"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>For other unnamed airlines, he said, “There is a mathematical and economic inevitability that they're ultimately going to stop flying in places that lose money.”</p>
<p>Kirby didn’t focus on American’s reduced guidance, which he attributed to “just a forecast issue, not weakness.” As for the failed distribution initiative, he said, the impact was small. “If you looked at the margin gap between Delta and United on the one hand and American on the other, it's a single-digit percentage of that,” he said.</p>

<p>More importantly, he said, United has permanently moved ahead of American in profitability and appeal to premium passengers. He used the example of seatback entertainment.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, Kirby said, “I was president of American, and we were putting seatback entertainment system on every one of our airplanes. Everyone in American thought that was a stupid idea. The day after I left, they reversed it and they spent money to take it off the airplanes because it would reduce weight and save fuel burn. We put it on at United. We're putting it on every single airplane.”</p>






<p>Kirby flew to the conference on a United aircraft. “As I always do when I fly on one, I walk from back to front,” he said. “Two thirds of the customers on the airplane are watching movies.” When customers are pleased with the movies, he said, they rank United higher in other areas including flight attendants and gate agents. They even rank their TSA experience higher.</p>

<p>Current aircraft shortages are a blessing in disguise for most airlines, Kirby said, because new airplanes would mean new routes, some likely ill-advised. “A lot of airlines that are unable to get aircraft right now, it's the best thing going for them. They need more loss-making routes like they need another hole in the head.”</p>
<p>Eventually, those carriers will have to cut their money-losers. “I don't know what the catalyst is going to be,” Kirby said. “I don't really get it but people think about ‘strategic flying.’” he said. “They fly, but eventually economic reality triumphs over hope, and that's what's going to drive the change.” He apparently used “strategic flying” to mean routes airlines think they ought to fly, even if passengers don’t share the commitment.</p>
<p>At this point in Kirby’s presentation, Bernstein analyst David Vernon observed, “If an airline's flying out of Chicago and losing money today, they could eventually get the product right and get the equipment right and maybe improve that.”</p>
<p>Since before the pandemic began in 2020, American executives have said on nearly every earnings call that the airline wants to boost capacity in Charlotte and Dallas, where the carrier makes money. They rarely mention Chicago.</p>
<p>United is poised to push above pre-pandemic traffic levels of traffic at O’Hare this summer, while American is far below its pre-pandemic level, <em>Crain’s Chicago Business</em> recently reported, citing data from Cirium. In July, United’s ORD July seat capacity will be about 3% above July 2019 levels, while American capacity will be 17% lower.</p>
<p>During the week ending Friday, American shares fell 17%, while United shares rose 2% and Delta shares fell 1%. Year-to-date, American shares are down 14%, United shares are up 30% and Delta shares are up 26%.</p>

<p><span>An analysis for <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/category/ethereum-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum [ETH]</a> price prediction showed that ETH has trended within a horizontal channel since it closed above $3650 on 20th May. </span></p>
<p><span>A horizontal channel is formed when the price of an asset consolidates within a range for some time. This happens when there is a relative balance between buying and selling pressures, which prevents the asset’s price from trending strongly in either direction.</span></p>
<p><span>The upper line of this channel forms resistance, while the lower line forms support. For ETH, it has formed resistance at $3962, while it finds support at $3638.</span></p>

<h2><b>Ethereum price prediction shows bulls are here</b></h2>
<p><span>Readings observed from ETH’s key momentum indicators confirmed that the market has been marked by equal amounts of buying and selling activity in the past few days. </span></p>
<p><span>Although still positioned above the 50-neutral spot, ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) have been “flat” in the past few days.</span></p>
<p><span> These momentum indicators are said to be flat when they trend in a seemingly straight line, with no significant swings up or down.</span></p>
<p><span>When they trend in this manner, it suggests that neither strong buying nor strong selling pressure exists. Traders interpret it to mean that there is no clear signal for a breakout upward or downward.</span></p>
<p><span>As of this writing, ETH’s RSI was 64.92, while its MFI was 63.74. </span></p>
<p><span>Further, the coin’s declining Average True Range (ATR) confirmed the price consolidation. This indicator measures market volatility by calculating the average range between high and low prices over a specified number of periods. </span></p>

<p><span>When the indicator falls, it suggests lower market volatility and hints that the asset’s price is trending within a range without significant upward or downward movements.</span></p>
<h2><b>Futures traders are unmoved</b></h2>
<p><span>Despite ETH’s sideways price movements in the past few days, its futures market activity has continued to grow. Since 20 May, the coin’s futures open interest has increased by 42%. </span></p>

<p><span>When an asset’s futures open interest surges like this, more traders are entering the market to open new trading positions.  At press time, ETH’s futures open interest was $16.45, per </span><a href="https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/ETH" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span>Coinglass’</span></a><span> data.</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding whether these traders are opening short or long positions, ETH’s positive funding rate across cryptocurrency exchanges has remained positive. This shows that there has been more demand for long than short positions. </span></p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>In 2020 and 2021, CD interest rates were historically low, ranging from 1% to less than 1% for terms ranging from 6 months to 5 years.</li>
<li>The low interest rates made CDs a poor choice for growing and protecting money.</li>
<li>As the economy evolved and inflation increased, the federal funds rate also increased, causing CD interest rates to rise.</li>
<li>If you had opened a CD account in June, you could now earn higher returns on your deposit.</li>
<li>The article concludes that a CD account opened in June could offer big benefits for savers, implying that the current CD interest rates may be more attractive than in the past.</li>

Here's why:</p><h3><strong>You'll gain long-term protection in a volatile climate</strong></h3><p>Amid geopolitical uncertainty overseas and a contentious presidential election season in the U.S., the economy and broader rate climate are particularly unpredictable right now. Combined with cooled but stubborn inflation and interest rates at their highest point in decades, now is arguably the time to be conservative with your money by protecting it as best you can. </p><p>A 1-year CD can help. You'll lock in your CD with a high rate right now and that rate will remain the same through next June, at which point you can better gauge the status of the economy and wider rate climate. </p>

And that's exactly what you'll get with a CD. Look to other account types for confirmation. Not only do traditional savings accounts have low rates, but those rates are variable and subject to change as the rate climate evolves. <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/high-yield-savings-account/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">High-yield savings accounts</a></span>, at the same time, have <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-todays-savings-interest-rates/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">rates</a></span> almost as high as the best CDs, but those rates are also <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fixed-vs-variable-interest-rate-which-is-better-for-your-savings-now/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">variable</a></span> and will rise or fall based on the Fed's actions (or lack thereof). </p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'>
    </p>
<p>But CDs are predictable – you'll know exactly what to expect when the CD <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-to-do-when-your-cd-matures-according-to-experts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">matures</a></span>. That will allow for better budgeting and an easier path toward meeting your financial goals, both of which are hard to come by with other financial products right now. </p><h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>June 2024 is not June 2020 or June 2021. No matter which CD term you choose or the amount you deposit, these accounts are generally favorable for savers right now. That said, it can be particularly advantageous to open a 1-year CD this June. By doing so you'll gain long-term protection in an unpredictable climate, you'll have the ability to earn hundreds or even thousands of dollars in interest and you'll tack on some predictability to your finances. Just make sure that you deposit an amount that you're comfortable parting with for the next 12 months or you could risk having to pay a substantial early withdrawal penalty to regain access.</p><p>Have more questions? <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-1-year-cd-this-june&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-1-year-cd-this-june%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=843fa6c4-8ccb-482e-a92d-e6351a4ca1c6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more about your CD options here</a>. </p>

<li><strong>Japan intervenes in foreign exchange market</strong>: Japan's government has intervened in the foreign exchange market for the first time since 2022, spending 9.7885 trillion yen ($62.25 billion) between April 26 and May 29 to stabilize the value of the yen.</li>
<li><strong>Yen plunged to 34-year low</strong>: The yen had plunged to a 34-year low against the US dollar in April, with the exchange rate reaching 160.03. This was the weakest level since 1980.</li>
<li><strong>Sharp rebound in yen</strong>: After the intervention, the yen has experienced a sharp rebound, strengthening to 156 levels and further increasing by more than 2% in the days following.</li>
<li><strong>Speculation of intervention</strong>: Earlier, analysts at Bank of America Global Research estimated that the size of the potential intervention could have been between 5 trillion yen and 6 trillion yen, based on Bank of Japan data.</li>
<li><strong>Yen under pressure</strong>: The yen has been under sustained pressure since the Bank of Japan ended its monetary policy of negative interest rates in March, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market.</li>

            Cracker Barrel CEO Julie Felss Masino recently gave a devastatingly frank assessment of the brand: “We’re just not as relevant as we once were.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwu20hiz00023b6ja5oaqlej@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Masino, who became CEO in July, laid out the diagnosis — and the remedies — in a May presentation to analysts. And it raises questions for those accustomed to the brand’s biscuits and gravy, wooden tables and chairs, brain puzzler games and front porch rocking chairs.
    </p>

            “The way we communicate, the things on the menu, the way the stores look and feel … all of these things came up time and time again in our research as opportunities for us to really regain relevancy,” she said.

            The revamped Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (the brand’s full name) could include remodeled restaurants with bookcases instead of lattice dividers and brand new banquette seating. New Cracker Barrels might be smaller restaurants altogether, with menus that include new items like green chili cornbread and banana pudding. Customers may see brighter interiors with simpler decor, a move away from the typical cozy clutter.

            Why would Cracker Barrel, so desperate for relevancy, lean into a tactic typically used to attract senior citizens? Partially because many people are eating early these days. And partially because it’s looking for a quick fix.
    </p>



  

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwu20hj5000a3b6jsokfoled@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Cracker Barrel, which first opened in 1969, has long billed itself as a roadside place where weary travelers can stop for a hearty meal in a homey dining room, and also pick from a large selection of knick knacks at its country store. That pitch, which has in the past largely appealed to Baby Boomers, hasn’t resonated very well since the pandemic.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwu20hj5000b3b6j3d7hu02e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Last year, when other diners returned to restaurants after the early pandemic years, Cracker Barrel’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/21/business/olive-garden-cracker-barrel-older-customers/index.html">older clientele remained cautious</a>, visiting the chain less often. Now, its retail stores are taking a hit as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/05/business/retailers-cutting-prices/index.html">consumers pull back on spending</a>. Those same dynamics are playing out in its restaurants.
    </p>

            In the three months ended on April 26, Cracker Barrel’s total revenue fell 1.9% compared to the year before, the company reported Thursday. Retail sales at stores open at least 18 months fell 3.8%, while restaurant sales fell 1.5%.
    </p>

            Wall Street has not been impressed: The company’s stock has declined nearly 37% this year, and has plunged about 70% over the past five years. The Tennessee-based chain owns its roughly 660 locations, which can be found throughout the country.

            These new early-bird deals, which launched in February, are available Monday through Friday from 4 to 6 pm. They start at $8.99 and include reduced portions of Cracker Barrel’s signature country comfort food, like meatloaf and chicken.<strong> </strong>

            Masino didn’t explicitly mention the specials during the discussion about the long-term strategy for Cracker Barrel. But she did point to the offering during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. It “is a big piece of our overall pricing strategy,” Masino said.
    </p>

            In some ways, an early bird special is a perfect solution — it may appeal to both Covid-cautious seniors on a budget and younger consumers who are eating earlier.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwu20hj5000e3b6jlpn0o9tt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “Six o’clock is the new eight o’clock,” said Lisa W. Miller, a consumer strategist who has consulted for large restaurant chains through her company, Lisa W. Miller &amp; Associates. “That four to six time period … can attract a younger family, as well.” The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/early-bird-dinner-matinee-broadway-4b822052" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal declared over the summer</a> that “America is becoming a nation of early birds.” And in recent years, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/06/business/covid-crushed-24-hour-diners-theyre-slowly-coming-back/index.html">late night dining options</a> have dwindled.

            Fewer people visited Cracker Barrel before 9 AM and after 6 PM in the first quarter this year compared to that period in 2019, according to data from Placer.ai, which uses location data from mobile devices to estimate visits to specific restaurants and retail locations. Instead, the chain has “seen an increase in late morning and lunch visits,” said RJ Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai. It’s also seen an increase in the late afternoon, but a smaller one. The discrepancy “may explain the emphasis on early-bird specials,” he said.
    </p>

            Enticing younger consumers during that earlier period will depend somewhat on how the company advertises the deal, noted Miller. “It’s all going to depend … on the creative executions — how are they going after it?”
    </p>

            Masino said Thursday that Cracker Barrel was so eager to rush out the promotion that it only recently started advertising the special.

            But breaking the association between early dinners and senior citizens will be hard, said John A. Gordon, founder and CEO of Pacific Management Consulting Group, a restaurant consultancy.

            “It’s so well known in this country that seniors go out to eat earlier,” he said. “Although that’s changing … it is  burned into people’s psyche, that that is designated for seniors.”

            To compete in this environment, Cracker Barrel realizes<strong> </strong>it has to offer some type of deal. It seems to have decided that early dinners are the way to go.
