That's up from $14,428 in 2020, the personal finance website said. Those costs are rising for several reasons, including rising <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/real-estate-home-equity-10-states-with-biggest-gains/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">home values</a></span>, rising costs from construction companies hired to build properties, and rising homeowners insurance rates as a result of <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/storms-homeowners-insurance-oklahoma-texas-tornado/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">climate-related natural disasters</a></span>, Bankrate said. </p><p>"These numbers show that the costs of owning a home are at the same level as buying a used car every year," Bankrate analyst Jeff Ostrowski said in a statement Monday. "Homeownership is an important wealth-builder for many Americans, but it ain't cheap," he added. </p>    
  <p>Homeownership is becoming such a financial burden that an April <a href="https://investors.redfin.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1077/redfin-survey-half-of-u-s-homeowners-and-renters-struggle" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">survey</a> from Redfin found that some homeowners have had to skip meals, take a second job or sell their belongings to keep up with their mortgage.

Separately, Barofsky said he opened an unrelated investigation in April into a regional director after receiving allegations of potential embezzlement.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"With more than three months having passed since the inception of the monitor’s investigation, and only a small fraction of the requested documents produced, the monitor’s assessment is that the union’s delay of relevant documents is obstructing and interfering with his access to information needed for his investigative work, and, if left unaddressed, is an apparent violation of the consent decree," Barofsky wrote.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The investigation does not appear to involve criminal allegations. However, Barofsky has the ability to bring charges seeking to discipline, remove, suspend, expel and fine UAW officers and members.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"At this stage, it is important to emphasize that the allegations are just allegations," Barofsky wrote. "They prove nothing in themselves, and nothing in this report should be construed as reaching any conclusion about possible charges, if any, for suspected misconduct."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The court filing marks continued fallout from a high-profile scandal that ended with the UAW being subjected to years of federal oversight in 2020 and sent more than a dozen people to prison. That includes Fiat Chrysler Automobiles executives and two former UAW presidents, Gary Jones and Dennis Williams. UAW labor leaders were convicted of a pattern of corruption that included breaking federal labor laws, stealing union funds and receiving bribes, kickbacks and illegal benefits from contractors and auto executives.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Taking our union in a new direction means sometimes you have to rock the boat, and that upsets some people who want to keep the status quo, but our membership expects better and deserves better than the old business as usual," Fain said in a statement.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We encourage the monitor to investigate whatever claims are brought to their office, because we know what they’ll find: a UAW leadership committed to serving the membership, and running a democratic union. We’re staying focused on winning record contracts, growing our union, and fighting for economic and social justice on and off the job.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Mock declined comment on the monitor's investigation and findings.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“If the government takes over the union, Shawn Fain will quickly become one of the most despised leaders by the rank-and-file,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Barofsky has support from the Justice Department. Prosecutors told him the union’s position is making it difficult, if not impossible, for the monitor to remove fraud, corruption and illegality from within the UAW, he wrote.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Notably, the union’s secretary-treasurer has also disavowed the union’s current position as non-cooperative and inconsistent with her own direction to union staff to fully cooperate,” Barofsky wrote.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The monitor wrote that he has tried for months to gather information to conduct a full investigation “but the union has effectively slow-rolled the monitor’s access to requested documents.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Union leaders have produced a “very small” portion of documents, about 2,600 out of more than 116,000 records, Barofsky wrote. And most of those records were shared after receiving a draft last week of the scathing report filed in court Monday.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“There has been a similar lack of production for the monitor’s embezzlement investigation into one of the union’s regional directors,” Barofsky wrote. There are no additional details about the alleged embezzlement.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Barofsky describes a shift in the level of cooperation from UAW leaders. As recently as December, before the investigation started, Fain told underlings to answer questions from the monitor “without hesitation” and vowed to share information.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That stance, however, has changed, Barofsky wrote: “The union’s arguments for delaying, and potentially denying, the monitor’s access to documents marks a shift in its position on cooperation."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Allegations about UAW leaders not cooperating are unsurprising, Gordon said: “Fain is one of those guys who will fight anybody in the room. That’s sort of Shawn Fain’s approach to life.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“I’m not sure how angry members will be about not cooperating unless not cooperating results in the government taking over the union, but if there is talk of corruption still going on, Fain might be a one-termer,” Gordon added.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In his campaign and administration, Fain has emphasized how directly elected leadership would clean out the union. He’s emphasized transparency in decisions to make public offers from the Detroit Three automakers during last fall’s contract negotiations.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Fain has been unusually transparent to date,” said Harley Shaiken, a University of California-Berkeley professor who specializes in labor and the global economy. “There’s a spirit that is unmistakable in the union about involving the members in what the union is doing. The monitor clearly has concerns, but he’s not making public what those concerns are in any detail.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Still, the report indicates there is a problem within the union regarding how it's managing its internal operations and ensuring it responds to these kinds of requests in a timely manner, said Marick Masters, professor emeritus of management at Wayne State University.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It's a bad look," he said. "It suggests a general management problem, which is understandable given the newness of officials and the volume they've had to deal with, the monitor and his policy recommendations, and the promises they’ve made of transparency. With all the activities they've been involved in — the strike, the contracts outside of the Big 3 and the organizing efforts — it may be too much for them to handle."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">After securing recording contracts with the Detroit Three automakers, the UAW announced a $40 million organizing campaign at non-union automotive and battery plants. Workers at a Volkswagen AG plant in Tennessee voted to organize with the UAW, but Mercedes-Benz Group employees in Alabama rejected a unionization election last month.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It will be red flags," said Masters regarding how prospective UAW members could look at the situation. "They’ll say they don’t seem to have their act together. There’s concern whether they can process their business properly."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Barofsky also revealed disciplinary steps taken against several high-ranking officials linked to Williams and the UAW’s past. That includes Amy Loasching, former administrative assistant to Williams. The monitor concluded that Loasching participated in an embezzlement scheme involving top UAW officials.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/presto/2019/08/28/PDTN/d58dba66-0215-4299-847a-4dcb7a577419-Amy-Loasching.jpg?crop=301,355,x53,y16&amp;width=300&amp;height=354&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Amy Loasching was the top aide of retired UAW President Dennis Williams."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Amy Loasching was the top aide of retired UAW President Dennis Williams.

Barofsky tried to question Loasching. Instead, she resigned, leading the monitor to expel her from the union June 6.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/presto/2019/08/28/PDTN/f0d6e99d-4919-4698-99c9-c138742bb1f1-Raid.JPG?width=660&amp;height=461&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/presto/2019/08/28/PDTN/f0d6e99d-4919-4698-99c9-c138742bb1f1-Raid.JPG?width=1320&amp;height=922&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="FBI investigators leave the home of UAW President Gary Jones during a search on Wednesday in Canton."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="FBI investigators leave the home of UAW President Gary Jones during a search on Wednesday in Canton." data-c-credit="Max Ortiz, The Detroit News"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Loasching has been under scrutiny since FBI agents raided her home in Wisconsin in August 2019. The search was part of a nationwide series of raids targeting UAW officials and included searches at the homes of Jones and Williams and the union’s Black Lake resort in northern Michigan.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Loasching was never charged with a crime.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The report comes after Fain last month removed UAW Vice President Rich Boyer as head of the Stellantis Department. Fain issued a memorandum asserting the action was because of a “dereliction of duty” by Boyer in connection with certain collective bargaining issues, according to the monitor’s report. Boyer said it was about the refusal to remove a staff member.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"There’s concern whether the union is effectively representing the workers in terms of the action taken with Boyer at Stellantis," Masters said. "With the allegation of embezzlement by a regional director, they're suggesting improper financial management. All those things just resurrect the residue of the scandal that the UAW was involved in."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In February, the International Executive Board removed Mock from overseeing several departments, including the union's Women’s Department and the Technical, Office, &amp; Professional (TOP) Department.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Mock allegedly “improperly denied” reimbursement requests, organizing effort expenditures and strike-related costs, according to the Unite All Workers for Democracy Caucus, which had endorsed Mock in the 2023 election and said it was citing from a report by the UAW’s compliance director. Additionally, it alleged Mock withheld approval of routine expenditures in an attempt to get IEB votes.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Mock defended her actions in a statement, stating she was adhering to the policies of her role.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><em>rsnell@detroitnews.com</em></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><em>@robertsnellnews</em></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><em>bnoble@detroitnews.com</em></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><em>@BreanaCNoble</em></p></div></div>

<p>The scandal took a $15.6 billion bite out of the company’s market cap as its shares fell by more than 5.4% last week, CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/10/shares-of-toyota-mazda-honda-suzuki-fall-after-safety-scandal.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/10/shares-of-toyota-mazda-honda-suzuki-fall-after-safety-scandal.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">reported</a>. Toyota’s Nasdaq-listed shares were up about 1% as of Monday afternoon. </p>



<p>Through an internal investigation prompted by a regulator mandate, Toyota found it had not performed safety tests as certification required in five cases related to vehicles including the Crown, Corolla, and the Yaris Cross. In one case involving the <a href="https://fortune.com/company/lgi-homes/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/lgi-homes/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Lexus</a> RX, the company had submitted falsified data to meet safety standards and submitted it for certification.</p>



<p>Although the company maintained the vehicles affected by the scandal were safe to drive, Toyota’s chairman Akio Toyoda <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/40932340.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/40932340.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">apologized</a> in a press conference last week.</p>



<p>“As the person responsible for the Toyota Group, I would like to extend my sincere apologies to our customers, car enthusiasts, and all stakeholders for this issue,” he said. </p><p></p>



<p>Toyota said it would suspend production of three models—the Corolla Fielder, Corolla Axio, and Yaris Cross—based on the findings from its investigation.

Mazda, which is Japan’s second-largest automaker, suspended production of the Roadster RF and Mazda 2, while company shares sank more than 7% last week, resulting in a $500 million hit to its market cap, CNBC reported.</p>



<p>The safety scandal involving several Japanese automakers risks damaging the stellar reputation that companies such as Toyota and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/nissan-motor/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/nissan-motor/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Nissan</a> have cultivated, especially in North America, the companies’ biggest market. </p>



<p>Japan’s transport ministry earlier this year ordered 90 car manufacturers to reexamine how they test their vehicles after a Toyota affiliate was found to have falsified data related to safety for decades.</p></div></div></div>

                                        <p>Bill Gates and his energy company are starting construction at their Wyoming site for a next-generation nuclear power plant he believes will “revolutionize” how power is generated.</p><p></p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-technology-business-wyoming-bill-gates-19a36eb0bd65e0999d26c0cc122f6158">Gates was in the tiny community of Kemmerer</a></span> Monday to break ground on the project. The co-founder of Microsoft is chairman of TerraPower. The company applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in March for a construction permit <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-politics-utilities-nuclear-power-climate-and-environment-23357f4087988a9d21fe714e5660838b">for an advanced nuclear reactor</a></span> that uses sodium, not water, for cooling. If approved, it would operate as a commercial nuclear power plant. </p><p></p><p>The site is adjacent to PacifiCorp’s Naughton Power Plant, which will stop burning coal in 2026 and natural gas a decade later, the utility said. Nuclear reactors <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-technology-business-nuclear-power-environment-and-nature-cfb21ab68a9e7005cc08873f2a5a7031">operate without emitting planet-warming greenhouse gases</a></span>. PacifiCorp plans to get carbon-free power from the reactor and says it is weighing how much nuclear to include in its long-range planning.</p>
    

<p></p><p>The work begun Monday is aimed at having the site ready so TerraPower can build the reactor as quickly as possible if its permit is approved. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/fast-neutron-reactors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia is at the forefront</a></span> for developing sodium-cooled reactors. </p>



<p></p><p>Gates told the audience at the groundbreaking that they were “standing on what will soon be the bedrock of America’s energy future.” </p><p></p><p>“This is a big step toward safe, abundant, zero-carbon energy,” Gates said. “And it’s important for the future of this country that projects like this succeed.” </p>
    
<p></p><p>Advanced reactors typically use a coolant other than water and operate at lower pressures and higher temperatures. Such technology has been around for decades, but the United States has continued to build large, conventional water-cooled reactors as commercial power plants. The Wyoming project is the first time in about four decades that a company has tried to get an advanced reactor up and running as a commercial power plant in the United States, according to the NRC. </p>
    

<p></p><p>It’s time to move to advanced nuclear technology that uses the latest computer modeling and physics for a simpler plant design that’s cheaper, even safer and more efficient, said Chris Levesque, the company’s president and chief executive officer. </p><p></p><p>TerraPower’s Natrium reactor demonstration project is a sodium-cooled fast reactor design with a molten salt energy storage system.</p><p></p><p>“The industry’s character hasn’t been to innovate. It’s kind of been to repeat past performance, you know, not to move forward with new technology. And that was good for reliability,” Levesque said in an interview. “But the electricity demands we’re seeing in the coming decades, and also to correct the cost issues with today’s nuclear and nuclear energy, we at TerraPower and our founders really felt it’s time to innovate.” </p><p></p><p>A Georgia utility just finished <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-nuclear-plant-energy-secretary-granholm-05a6e2444a8b5a9e9c7c61b111b87192">the first two scratch-built American reactors</a></span> in a generation at a cost of nearly $35 billion. The price tag for the expansion of Plant Vogtle from two of the traditional large reactors to four includes $11 billion in cost overruns. </p><p></p><p>The TerraPower project is expected to cost up to $4 billion, half of it from the U.S. Department of Energy. Levesque said that figure includes first-of-its-kind costs for designing and licensing the reactor, so future ones would cost significantly less.</p>
    

<p></p><p>Most advanced nuclear reactors under development in the U.S. rely on a type of fuel — known as high-assay low-enriched uranium — that’s enriched to a higher percentage of the isotope uranium-235 than the fuel used by conventional reactors. TerraPower delayed its launch date in Wyoming by two years to 2030 because Russia is the only commercial supplier of the fuel, and it’s working with other companies to develop alternate supplies. The U.S. Energy Department is working on <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/us-department-energy-haleu-consortium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developing it domestically</a></span>.</p><p></p><p>Edwin Lyman co-authored an article in Science on Thursday that raises concerns that this fuel could be used for nuclear weapons. Lyman, the director of nuclear power safety with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the risk posed by HALEU today is small because there isn’t that much of it around the world. But that will change if advanced reactor projects, which require much larger quantities, move forward, he added. Lyman said he wants to raise awareness of the danger in the hope that the international community will strengthen security around the fuel.</p>
    

<p></p><p>NRC spokesperson Scott Burnell said the agency is confident its current requirements will maintain both security and public safety of any reactors that are built and their fuel. </p><p></p><p>Gates co-founded TerraPower in 2008 as a way for the private sector to propel advanced nuclear energy forward to provide safe, abundant, carbon-free energy. </p><p></p><p>The company’s 345-megawatt reactor could generate up to 500 megawatts at its peak, enough for up to 400,000 homes. TerraPower said its first few reactors will focus on supplying electricity. But it envisions future reactors could be built near industrial plants to supply high heat. </p>
    

<p></p><p>Nearly all industrial processes requiring high heat currently get it from burning fossil fuels. Heat from advanced reactors could be used to produce hydrogen, petrochemicals, ammonia and fertilizer, said John Kotek at the Nuclear Energy Institute.</p><p></p><p>It’s significant that Gates, a technological innovator and climate champion, is betting on nuclear power to help address the climate crisis, added Kotek, the industry group’s senior vice president for policy. </p><p></p><p>“I think this has helped open people’s eyes to the role that nuclear power does play today and can play in the future in addressing carbon emissions,” he said. “There’s tremendous momentum building for new nuclear in the U.S. and the potential use of a far wider range of nuclear energy technology than we’ve seen in decades.”</p><p></p><h2>___</h2><p></p><p>The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

            Elliott Investment Management announced Monday it has taken a $1.9 billion stake in Southwest Airlines and said there needs to be new leadership at the Dallas-based carrier.

            The letter pointed out that Southwest’s share price is down more than 50% from early 2021 and now trades at a price lower than its pre-pandemic price in 2020.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>A group of lawyers who successfully argued against Elon Musk's payout in a Delaware court earlier this year are seeking $5.6 billion in stock-based legal fees, which is 17 times larger than the biggest fee in Delaware history.</li>
<li>The lawyers are seeking the massive fee for achieving a massive benefit to Tesla, according to their court filing, which claims the team's work led to a major change in the company's compensation package.</li>
<li>Tesla shareholders will vote on Musk's payout later this week, but the opposing lawyers must wait until a hearing on July 8 for the Delaware Court of Chancery to approve or deny their requested fees.</li>
<li>Musk himself has expressed strong opposition to the lawyers' fee proposal, calling it a "criminal" move and implying that the lawyers did more harm than good to the company.</li>
<li>The lawyers seeking the $5.6 billion in fees represented plaintiff Richard Tornetta, a Tesla shareholder who filed a suit in 2018 protesting Musk's compensation package, which was earlier approved by the SEC.</li>

<p>But there’s another group that stands to land a record windfall: The <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/31/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package-delaware-court/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/01/31/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package-delaware-court/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">legal team that successfully argued against Musk’s payout in a Delaware court earlier this year</a> is seeking a whopping $5.6 billion in stock-based legal fees—<a href="https://www.law360.com/pulse/modern-lawyer/articles/1845677/tesla-rips-unprecedented-5-6b-fee-bid-in-musk-pay-fight" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.law360.com/pulse/modern-lawyer/articles/1845677/tesla-rips-unprecedented-5-6b-fee-bid-in-musk-pay-fight" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">17 times as large as the biggest fee in Delaware history</a>.</p>



<p>“We recognize that the requested fee is unprecedented … The size of the requested award is great because the value of the benefit to Tesla that Plaintiff’s Counsel achieved was massive,” <a href="https://static.blbglaw.com/docs/March%201%2C%202024%20-%20Fee%20Brief%20as%20filed_Tesla.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://static.blbglaw.com/docs/March%201%2C%202024%20-%20Fee%20Brief%20as%20filed_Tesla.pdf" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">the plaintiff’s legal team wrote in a court filing</a>. “We are prepared to ‘eat our cooking.’”</p>



<p>Tesla shareholders will give Musk an answer later this week, but <a href="https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=364630" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=364630" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">the opposing lawyers will have to wait until a hearing scheduled for July 8</a> for the Delaware Court of Chancery to approve or deny the fees they’re seeking.</p>



<p>Musk himself has voiced strong opposition to the lawyers’ fee proposal. “The lawyers who did nothing but damage Tesla want $6 billion. Criminal,” Musk previously wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1763773501616328775" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1763773501616328775" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">post on his personal X account</a>.</p><p></p>



<p>The lawyers seeking the $5.6 billion in fees represented plaintiff Richard Tornetta, a Tesla shareholder who <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2024-march/del-court-chancery-orders-rescission-musks-tesla-compensation-plan/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2024-march/del-court-chancery-orders-rescission-musks-tesla-compensation-plan/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">filed a suit in 2018 protesting Musk’s compensation package</a>, which had earlier received the approval of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312518035345/d524719ddef14a.htm#:~:text=In%202012%2C%20Tesla's%20Board%20approved,execute%2010%20key%20operational%20goals." target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312518035345/d524719ddef14a.htm#:~:text=In%202012%2C%20Tesla's%20Board%20approved,execute%2010%20key%20operational%20goals." rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Tesla’s board and 70% of the company’s shareholders</a>.</p>



<p>It was structured so that Musk would unlock certain stock awards if he guided the company to various milestones based on metrics like market capitalization. Under Musk’s leadership, Tesla blew past those milestones faster than anyone expected, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/tesla-shareholders-to-approve-ceo-elon-musk-compensation-package-robyn-denholm-cathie-woods/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/tesla-shareholders-to-approve-ceo-elon-musk-compensation-package-robyn-denholm-cathie-woods/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">hitting $1 trillion in market cap by 2021</a>. (It’s since retreated, to just over $551 billion today.) </p>



<p>But Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick sided with Tornetta earlier this year, concluding that Musk’s pay package was an “unfathomable sum” and the process to approve it was “deeply flawed,” in part because the Tesla board contains many of Musk’s close friends and colleagues.</p>



<p>Tesla shareholders will decide whether to reverse the Delaware court decision this Thursday. But regardless of the outcome, the plaintiff’s lawyers won the case, and they’re demanding their pound of flesh. While extremely high in dollar terms, the fee the lawyers are requesting is well below what other litigators have been awarded in percentage terms—just 10% of the $56 billion they saved Tesla shareholders by voiding Musk’s payout.</p>



<p>Last year, the Delaware Court of Chancery awarded lawyers <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/top-us-business-court-bolsters-reputation-with-big-lawyer-fees" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/top-us-business-court-bolsters-reputation-with-big-lawyer-fees" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/top-us-business-court-bolsters-reputation-with-big-lawyer-fees" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">27% of the $1 billion settlement</a> from an M&amp;A case involving <a href="https://fortune.com/company/dell-technologies/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/dell-technologies/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Dell</a>, and in 2011 lawyers netted <a href="https://www.jonesday.com/en/insights/2012/09/delaware-supreme-court-affirms-$2-billion-damages-award-for-controlling-stockholder-transaction-found-to-be-unfair" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.jonesday.com/en/insights/2012/09/delaware-supreme-court-affirms-$2-billion-damages-award-for-controlling-stockholder-transaction-found-to-be-unfair" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">15% of the $2 billion in damages</a> stemming from a case involving mining company Southern Peru Copper Corp.</p><p></p>



<p>Delaware courts reward lawyers who pursue complex cases into the late stages of litigation and get “real results,” Delaware Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster said in approving the Dell litigators’ fee application.</p>



<p>But even though the percentage might be relatively modest, the monumental scale of the ruling makes the lawyers’ fee application extraordinary.</p>



<p>“The dollar amount requested in the fee petition is unusual,” <a href="https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=364630" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=364630" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">McCormick conceded in a court filing</a>.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>Even if Tesla shareholders vote to reinstate Musk’s pay package, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/10/tesla-investors-vote-elon-musk-56-billion-payday-delaware-texas/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/10/tesla-investors-vote-elon-musk-56-billion-payday-delaware-texas/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">there’s no guarantee he would actually get the money</a>. Corporate law isn’t clear on whether a shareholder vote is sufficient to overturn a legal ruling, and Musk could be required to go back to court to get final approval for the money. If shareholders don’t vote in his favor, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/elon-musk-pay-package-more-than-any-ceo-ever/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/elon-musk-pay-package-more-than-any-ceo-ever/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">analysts have speculated Musk could stop paying as much attention to Tesla and spend more of his time focusing on his other companies.</a></p>



<p>“Elon is not a typical executive, and Tesla is not a typical company,” <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/elon-musk-pay-package-more-than-any-ceo-ever/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/elon-musk-pay-package-more-than-any-ceo-ever/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm said</a>. “So the typical way in which companies compensate key executives is not going to drive results for Tesla. Motivating someone like Elon requires something different.”</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

	Yet another name has surfaced in the <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/paramount/" id="auto-tag_paramount" data-tag="paramount">Paramount</a> Global scrum as former entertainment executive and beverage billionaire <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/edgar-bronfman-jr/" id="auto-tag_edgar-bronfman-jr" data-tag="edgar-bronfman-jr">Edgar Bronfman Jr.</a> is eyeing control of the company in a deal scenario with multiple moving pieces, even as <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/shari-redstone/" id="auto-tag_shari-redstone" data-tag="shari-redstone">Shari Redstone</a>‘s camp remains deep in talks with <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/skydance/" id="auto-tag_skydance" data-tag="skydance">Skydance</a>.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Takeover speculation has engulfed Paramount since last October and Skydance surfaced shortly after, so it’s been a long slog. In May, Par’s CEO departed. In June, four board members stepped down.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Bronfman is the latest potential buyer to emerge for Redstone’s controlling stake in Paramount, backed by Bain Capital. Deadline has confirmed his interest, which comes as producer <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/steven-paul/" id="auto-tag_steven-paul" data-tag="steven-paul">Steven Paul</a> has assembled a group of deep-pocketed investors for a deal. Both are looking at an acquisition of Redstone’s family holding company NAI, which owns about 80% of <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/paramount-global/" id="auto-tag_paramount-global" data-tag="paramount-global">Paramount Global</a>‘s Class A voting stock, meaning a change in ownership of a public company, not a merger.

	</p>
<p></p>






<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Meanwhile, Redstone and NAI intensified talks with <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/david-ellison/" id="auto-tag_david-ellison" data-tag="david-ellison">David Ellison</a>‘s Skydance over the weekend on what would be a much more complex deal. Two steps would see Skydance — backed by Oracle’s Larry Ellison and Gerry Cardinale’s RedBird Capital — acquire control of Paramount from Redstone, and then merge Skydance with Paramount in an all-stock transaction. That second part would dilute existing shareholders, most of whom hold Class B non-voting stock. Those investors have been furious and threatened to sue, which pushed Skydance to sweeten the pot for them in two revised offers; the latest included buying out about half of the outstanding B shares at a premium. To find the cash to do that, Skydance trimmed the payout to Redstone for NAI to about $2.25 billion.

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	The offers from Bronfman and Paul for Redstone’s stake in Paramount are said to be higher. </p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Family-owned businesses especially in media often have two classes of stock to ensure control. The idea is that shareholders know that when they invest. So they may have less standing to sue in a change of control situation. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Bronfman’s family acquired Seagram in the 1920s and built it into an industry leader. With Edgar Jr. at the helm, Seagram acquired Universal in 1995 and he became a big player in Hollywood. He sold the company to Vivendi (and the liquor business separately) and was executive chair of Vivendi Universal for a time, eventually stepping down. He later acquired Warner Music Group, in 2004 and ran it until the sale to Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries in 2011.

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	“Bronfman is very real. He can come up with the money,” said a well-positioned source of the former Universal owner’s eleventh-hour entry. “But it won’t stop the lawsuits.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	One Wall Streeter noted that Redstone’s father Sumner Redstone was notoriously litigious and finds ironic the potential legal battles looming over the sale of Paramount, whatever happens. Determining who will bear the cost of eventual litigation is one of the points under discussion with Skydance as talks move ahead. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Paul, founder of Crystal Sky Entertainment and a handful of sister companies, is friendly with Redstone and has some ties to Paramount. It’s not clear who all his partners are in a potential deal but news reports have mentioned John Paul DeJoria, co-founder of Paul Mitchell hair care and Patrón Spirits, and Norwegian American investor Philip Odegarde. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Deadline hears that Sony is continuing due diligence, although partner Apollo has been very quiet. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Paramount shares have been volatile over nine months of deal speculation. They began to slip last week after the Skydance deal got a stamp of approval from the board committee and went to Redstone, with no announcement forthcoming. The stock is trading off about 1% today at $11.93 — well below a 52-week high near $18. </p>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Stellantis-owned Chrysler is recalling more than 211,000 SUVs and pickup trucks in the U.S., due to a software malfunction that could disable the cars’ electronic stability control systems.</p><p>The recall covers certain model year 2022 Dodge Durango, Ram 2500 and Ram 3500 vehicles. According to documents published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, these cars may experience a malfunction in their anti-lock braking control module — which could cause stability control, a key safety feature, to fail and increase the risk of crash as a result.</p><p>As a remedy, dealers will update the anti-lock braking control module software for free. Notification letters to dealers and owners are set to be mailed out July 26, the NHTSA notes. </p><p>It’s unclear if the update will be available for all impact owners before then. Stellantis advises customers with questions or concerns to contact their dealers or Chrysler’s recall assistance center.</p>
    <p class="SovrnAd Advertisement " data-module="" data-class="sovrn-story-feed" data-delayadinsertion=""></p>

<p>In a statement, a Stellantis spokesperson noted a “routine review of customer feedback” led to a company investigation that discovered the software problem impacting certain vehicles. To date, Chrysler is unware of any related injuries or accidents — but “urges customers to follow the instructions on their recall notices,” the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler expects a total of 211,581 vehicles — produced in select periods ranging between April 2021 and December 2022 — have this defect in the U.S. That includes 524 Ram 3500s, 157,890 Ram 2500s and 53,167 Dodge Durangos, per <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=24V415000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the NHTSA report</a></span>.</p>
    
<p>Some “similar vehicles” not included in this recall were produced before or after suspected periods impacted and/or have different anti-lock braking control module software, the report notes. Drivers can confirm if their specific vehicle is included in this recall and find more information using the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwyJqzBhBaEiwAWDRJVEDs7cAt7zzPeggxPvnvsepoHpJblza8bMeNrRIFSOm_4LK3w4r4wRoCKl8QAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHSTA site</a></span> and/or <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.chrysler.com/iq/en/shopping-tools/check-recall.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrysler’s recall lookup</a></span>.</p><p>Beyond the U.S., an estimated 17,462 vehicles will be subject to recall in Canada, in addition to 2,313 in Mexico another 5,023 in certain markets outside North America, Stellantis’ spokesperson said.</p>
