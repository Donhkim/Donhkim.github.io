    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The bond market has been in a prolonged decline, with the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index down about 50% from its record high in July 2020, due to the Federal Reserve's rate hikes to combat inflation.</li>
<li>Despite this, some top fixed-income investors believe this is the best time in a generation to get into bonds, citing attractive yields and relatively moderate volatility.</li>
<li>CIO Anders Persson of Nuveen and Rick Rieder, Global CIO of Fixed Income at BlackRock, argue that the rate hikes have "put the fixed back into fixed income," making it possible to create a portfolio with a near 7% yield with moderate volatility.</li>
<li>The bond investors are bullish on the prospects of bond prices rallying when the Fed starts cutting rates later this year or next, offering a mix of steady income and price appreciation.</li>
<li>However, not everyone shares the optimism, with Bill Gross, co-founder of PIMCO and known as the "bond king," cautioning that without rate cuts, bond investors will only be "clipping coupons" or collecting interest income without seeing any capital appreciation.</li>

<p>After keeping interest rates near zero for almost a decade after the Great Financial Crisis and again during the COVID era, the Federal Reserve began aggressive rate hikes to fight inflation in March 2022. That led to a <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/01/12/investing-was-universally-horrible-in-2022-but-there-are-5-things-we-can-learn-from-a-truly-awful-year/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20stock%20market%20fell,bonds%20crashed%20more%20than%2030%25." target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/01/12/investing-was-universally-horrible-in-2022-but-there-are-5-things-we-can-learn-from-a-truly-awful-year/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20stock%20market%20fell,bonds%20crashed%20more%20than%2030%25." class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">painful fixed-income bear market</a> due to the inverse relationship between bond prices and yields (which move with the Fed funds rate). </p>



<p>It’s now been 46 months since the bond market last reached a record high, and the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index is down roughly 50% from that July 2020 peak. But with bonds finally offering solid yields, some of the world’s top fixed-income investors believe this is the best time in a generation to get into bonds.</p>



<p>“The entry point is just very, very attractive,” Anders Persson, CIO of fixed income at the global asset manager Nuveen, told <em>Fortune</em> in a recent interview. “I mean, basically, yields, as you know well, are the most attractive that we’ve seen in 15 plus years.”</p>



<p>As Rick Rieder, global CIO of fixed income and head of the asset allocation team at <a href="https://fortune.com/company/blackrock/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/blackrock/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">BlackRock</a>, noted, the Fed’s rate hikes have essentially “put the fixed back into fixed income.”</p><p></p>



<p>“You can create a portfolio with a close to 7% yield with volatility that’s pretty moderate. It’s been decades since you’ve been able to do that,” he told <em>Fortune</em> last month.</p>



<p>After investors lock in those yields, bond prices could also rally when the Fed starts cutting rates later this year or next. It’s a golden opportunity for a mix of steady income and price appreciation, according to these bond market gurus.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why the bond investors are bullish</h2>



<p>Persson and Rieder—who are collectively responsible for roughly $2.8 trillion in assets, or about 23 times more than the value of every NBA team put together—are bullish on bonds even as PIMCO co-founder and “bond king” Bill Gross has cautioned that without rate cuts to boost prices, bond market investors will merely be “<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bond-king-bill-gross-says-112000079.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bond-king-bill-gross-says-112000079.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">clipping coupons</a>,” or collecting interest income from yields. </p>



<p>Those coupons are quite juicy in many sub sectors. </p>



<p>“When you’re looking at 6% or so for broader fixed income, 7% for preferred, 8% for high yield, and almost 10% for senior loans, those entry levels are really, really attractive from a historic basis,” Nuveen’s Persson emphasized.</p><p></p>



<p>He added that, historically, there’s a high correlation between future total returns for fixed-income investors and how high yields were when they began investing. To that point, NYU Stern’s <a href="https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">annual return chart</a> shows that bonds tend to outperform after peaks in the Fed’s hiking cycles (i.e. when yields are high). </p>



<p>Corporate bonds, for example, offered 15%-plus returns to investors for five straight years after then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker famously raised interest rates to a peak of 19% in 1981 to fight runaway inflation. And they outperformed stocks three out of five of those years as well.</p>



<p>Rieder also said there’s serious price appreciation potential in bonds because rate cuts are likely on the way once data eventually confirms the Fed has defeated inflation.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>Persson, who is forecasting one or two rate cuts this year, said that if the economy starts to crack, the Fed will have to cut aggressively. “And then you get the total return aspect, or the capital appreciation side, of that investment,” he told <em>Fortune</em>, adding that “in most scenarios, you’re seeing a pretty healthy return potential here over the next 12 months.”</p>



<p>There is also evidence that bonds could still outperform even if interest rates stay where they are, with the Fed maintaining its current wait-and-see mode for longer than expected. In a <a href="https://www.lpl.com/newsroom/read/weekly-market-commentary-still-waiting-on-fed-to-be-done-raising-rates.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.lpl.com/newsroom/read/weekly-market-commentary-still-waiting-on-fed-to-be-done-raising-rates.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">note to clients</a> last summer, LPL Financial’s chief fixed income strategist, Lawrence Gillum, noted that the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index has performed well during periods when the Fed has paused its rate hikes historically.</p><p></p>



<p>“Since 1984, core bonds were able to generate average 6-month and 1-year returns of 8% and 13%, respectively, after the Fed stopped raising rates. Moreover, all periods generated positive returns over the 6-month, 1-year, and 3-year horizons,” he wrote.</p>



<p>For Rieder, that’s one reason why the current environment, where the Fed is stuck in a holding pattern, is a Goldilocks zone for fixed income investors. “You have this incredible gift, because inflation is staying where it is, we’re getting to buy credit assets cheaper than we should be,” he explained. </p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The EU's proposal to impose a 50% tax on Chinese electric cars will likely backfire, as China will retaliate with tariffs on European goods, potentially targeting high-end luxury vehicles.</li>
<li>China's response will likely be swift and severe, as they have a robust trade policy and are quick to defend their industries. This could result in a trade war, with significant economic pain for European manufacturers.</li>
<li>The EU's tariff policy will likely lead to a loss of competitiveness for European manufacturers, as they will be unable to compete in the global market outside of the EU. This could result in stagnation and a lack of innovation in the industry.</li>
<li>The protectionist policy will benefit European manufacturers in the short term, but will ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers and a decrease in the quality of electric vehicles.</li>
<li>The EU's proposed policy is likely to benefit only a small number of domestic manufacturers, while harming the global competitiveness of the industry as a whole.</li>

    <p>We can argue about whether the Chinese cars are subsidised by the state or are simply manufactured more efficiently by companies that have brilliantly mastered the technology in a very short space of time (the truth is probably somewhere between the two).</p><p>And yet leaving that aside, one point is certain: it will stall their advance. It is hard to compete when you face a 50pc tax on each car you sell.</p><p>The trouble is <a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/06/13/why-brussels-war-chinese-electric-car-hurt-bmw-tesla/">the policy is going to backfire spectacularly on the EU</a> and of course on the UK if we are foolish enough to impose similar levies. There are three reasons for that.</p><p>First, anyone who thinks the Chinese will simply shrug their shoulders is simply kidding themselves. It will inevitably mean retaliation. There are already reports that China will respond with tariffs on large-engine imports from the EU, specifically targeting the high-end, luxury vehicles that sell best in that country.</p><p>Given that the EU exports €18bn of vehicles to China every year, and has even more money tied up in local joint-venture operations, that is going to be very painful for European manufacturers.</p><p>Tariffs may well be targeted at other EU goods as well. It is not as if China does not have a robust trade policy or that it is ever slow to defend its industries. In the wake of the announcement, €4.5bn was <a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/06/14/germany-battles-block-eu-clampdown-chinese-evs/">wiped off the value of the major German auto manufacturers</a> as investors braced themselves for the inevitable response.</p><p>With grim inevitability, the EU’s giants will end up paying a high price and will end up locked out of what will soon be the world’s largest market. It is hard to see that as a great victory for anyone.</p><p>Next, the European manufacturers will inevitably grow flabby behind tariff walls. We have a long history of trade wars, tariffs and protectionism to teach us that the result is always the same. The protected industry does not have to compete anymore, it doesn’t bother to innovate and it simply puts up prices to milk easy profits out of customers who no longer have the choice of going elsewhere.</p><p>EVs are still a new technology, and there need to be huge improvements in driving range, battery life, vehicle weight and most of all price if they are to become the standard way of getting around.</p><p>That is only going to happen with ferocious competition between lots of different companies. Once a cosy cartel is established, they will just stagnate. The result? Even if they are protected at home, the European manufacturers will be steadily less competitive on the global market where they can’t hide behind tariff walls.</p>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>Thanks to social media, the bar for big life events—like getting married or welcoming a baby —is higher than ever.</p><p>Desires for picture-perfect weddings, bachelor and bachelorette parties, or baby showers have led to skyrocketing costs and increased stress around planning for new parents or engaged couples. But now, guests are feeling the pressure as well.</p><p>Recently, brides, grooms, and expectant parents have gotten more particular about what they’d like for their guests to wear and the gifts they’d be happy to receive, and they’re becoming increasingly more demanding of their expectations on their special day.</p><p>Taking things a step further, some are also publicly shaming their guests on forums like TikTok and Reddit.</p><h2>Sending back ‘disrespectful’ $100 Venmo</h2><p>One bride berated a guest for sending her $100 on Venmo a few days after the wedding, saying it felt a “bit disrespectful,” according to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingshaming/comments/1d5pmql/bride_returns_wedding_gift_and_sends_this_text/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reddit thread;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="12" data-v9y="0">Reddit thread</a>, which also said the guest had been late to the wedding. Out of disappointment, the bride sent back the money, saying she had expected more. In a similar fashion, another bride took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingshaming/comments/16ph1l7/going_viral_for_shaming_guests_gifts/?rdt=56447" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reddit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="13" data-v9y="0">Reddit</a> after sending an email to eight of her wedding guests, who had given the couple just one combined $50 gift.</p><p>Guests are pushing back on the higher expectations too, leading to tensions. One bride asked her guests to dress in fantasy- and renaissance-themed clothing for her wedding and took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1bjtitp/aita_for_giving_my_wedding_guests_a_dress_code/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reddit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="0">Reddit</a> to ask users if she was in the wrong for doing so. She and her partner had met at a renaissance fair and wanted that to be part of their wedding, so they included an addendum to their invitation detailing the types of clothing they wanted people to wear. This included “photos, descriptions, [and] budget categories,” which upset many of her guests.</p><p>“I reached out to them after their names were mentioned and they said I am ruining what is supposed to be [a] happy day by demanding people dress up like idiots,” the bride wrote in the post. “They said everyone should be allowed to dress in what makes them feel comfortable and I am being very controlling.”</p><p>Another couple got backlash for including a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13248835/wedding-registry-qr-code-grooms-venmo-couple.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:QR code to the groom’s Venmo account;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="0">QR code to the groom’s Venmo account</a> in their wedding invitations, while another bride and groom got roasted on social media for including a <a href="https://www.ladbible.com/community/weird/wedding-guests-15-strict-rules-reddit-233675-20240508" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:14-point list of rules;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0">14-point list of rules</a> for their wedding day with their invites. Plus, mothers-to-be have also started publicly shaming their friends and family for not buying gifts from their baby shower registries.</p><p>“When people don't buy from your registry, you can't return them for credit for other things that you need on your registry,” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nottiffanynoelco/video/7187589126772804910?_t=8nAlIz1bzKQ&amp;_r=1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one TikTok user complained;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="0">one TikTok user complained</a>. “If you are attending a baby shower in the future, just buy from a registry.” Several recently wedded couples have also taken to social media with similar complaints about guests buying gifts that weren’t on their registry.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>All of these occurrences—and many more—have sparked debate about proper etiquette for events. <em>Fortune</em> spoke to wedding planners and etiquette experts to find out whether their requests are warranted and the proper way for guests to react to seemingly controlling requests.</p><h2>The rules of the registry</h2><p>Wedding registries have evolved, particularly in the past 10 years, <a href="https://robertsandcoevents.com/about#:~:text=Richmond%20Planner%20Bryce%20Carson%20heads,weddings%20all%20throughout%20the%20US." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bryce Carson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0">Bryce Carson</a>, events director with <a href="https://robertsandcoevents.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Roberts &amp; Co. Events;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="0">Roberts &amp; Co. Events</a>, tells <em>Fortune. </em>Gone are the days of the traditional gift registry where couples request fine china and random kitchen utensils; in are cash-focused gifts such as honeymoon funds and <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/03/housing-market-affordability-couples-want-down-payment-cash-for-wedding-gift/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:first-home funds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="0">first-home funds</a>. Indeed, cash is the most popular gift that to-be-weds register for, with 74% of registry creators including cash on their wish list, according to The Knot’s 2023 <a href="https://www.theknot.com/content/new-wedding-registry-trends" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Registry Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="0">Registry Study</a>.</p><p>“This is definitely because couples are getting married a little bit older in life. They’re already combining their homes,” Carson says. “They do not need two sets of everything, so we see it less as a cash grab and more as an opportunity for couples to make their transition into married life as easy as possible.”</p><p>Now that wedding registries are largely online, it’s also made it easier to split large-ticket items among several guests instead of relying on a rich aunt or uncle to buy the high-end cookware or outdoor grill the couple has been wanting. And while wedding registries have changed, it’s no excuse to buy rogue gifts that aren’t on the requested list, Carson says.</p><p>“The etiquette has been and always will be that you need to purchase off the registry as a guest,” he says. “You do not know what they have in their home or combined homes. The registry is there to help guide you and prevent any duplicates or prevent them from getting something that they do not need.”</p><p>If the registry has few options left by the time a guest gets around to purchasing a gift, one thing that guests can do to stay within their budget is to include a nice card and gift card to the store where the couple is registered, <a href="https://lisalafferty.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Lafferty;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="0">Lisa Lafferty</a>, a luxury wedding planner, tells <em>Fortune</em>.</p><p>“This way, the couple can choose something they genuinely need or want,” Lafferty says.</p><p>At the end of the day, experts agree that the bride and groom should be grateful and express gratitude for any gifts they receive—even if they weren’t on their registry.</p><p>“A gift is a present given without payment,” <a href="https://lisagrotts.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Mirza Grotts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="0">Lisa Mirza Grotts</a>, a certified etiquette expert with 25 years of experience, tells <em>Fortune</em>. “If brides and grooms are taking this inconsiderate approach to friends and family, the shift is in sharp contrast to the reason for a wedding celebration: love, community, [and] commitment.”</p><p>Wedding guests also sometimes struggle to know the proper etiquette for gift-giving if they’re invited to multiple events such as a bridal shower or bachelor/bachelorette party. This may hurt your wallet, but those in the wedding party or people invited to multiple pre-wedding events are expected to purchase gifts for each one.</p><p>“While some couples may take into account the expenses that wedding party members incur for dresses, grooming, and other preparations, it can still be seen as thoughtful and courteous to give a small gift for both occasions,” Lafferty says. “This gesture acknowledges the couple's generosity and contributes to the spirit of the events.”</p><p>In terms of the average cost incurred by guests to attend a wedding, including travel expenses, attire, gifts, and other expenses such as childcare, Carson says to expect to spend at least four figures—and to spend at least the value of the wedding meal on a gift. Today, most wedding meals cost three figures per guest, Carson says.</p><h2>What not to wear</h2><p>While it’s long been customary for brides and grooms to request either cocktail or formal wear at a wedding, more couples have started asking guests to dress to a theme or color scheme. This trend has led to backlash from both wedding-goers who think the requests are unreasonable—and from couples who aren’t happy with guests who don’t adhere to their rules.</p><p>“This is definitely a trend that the internet is pushing more and more towards as couples are trying to look at their an event as a fashion event and as something that they want photographed” for social media, Carson says.</p><p>However, brides and grooms need to recognize that guests will “go rogue” and wear things outside of the guidelines “because it’s already a hefty cost to attend a wedding in this day and age,” he adds. “Asking for an extra outfit is definitely a big ask,” Carson says.</p><p>On the other hand, some couples argue that a dress code can actually be helpful for wedding guests.</p><p>“By creating guidelines for registries and dress codes, the couple is attempting to alleviate this burden, allowing guests to focus more on having fun and less on pre-wedding stress,” <a href="https://www.theknot.com/content/author/hannah-nowack#:~:text=Hannah%20is%20the%20Senior%20Weddings,Knot%20Magazine%20and%20TheKnot.com." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hannah Nowack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="0">Hannah Nowack</a>, senior editor at <a href="https://www.theknot.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Knot;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="0">The Knot</a>, a wedding vendor marketplace, tells <em>Fortune</em>.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Federal Reserve has held interest rates at a 23-year high, and experts predict that rates will remain higher for longer in 2024.</li>
<li>Higher interest rates are beneficial for short-term savers, allowing them to earn higher yields on savings accounts, money markets, and CDs, which are outpacing the rate of inflation.</li>
<li>The current rate environment is particularly advantageous for retirees and those nearing retirement, as they can take advantage of low-risk, fixed-income investments such as Treasury securities and CDs to stockpile cash for living expenses.</li>
<li>Experts recommend that retirees consider shaving some of the profits from their equity holdings in retirement and non-retirement accounts to build up low-risk savings.</li>
<li>The elevated interest rates should remain above the inflation rate for at least the next year, making them a great place for emergency funds or short-term savings goals.</li>

<li><strong>Fed may cut interest rates in December</strong>: Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari predicts a "reasonable prediction" that the Fed will cut interest rates once this year, likely in December.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation still a concern</strong>: Kashkari emphasizes that the Fed needs to see more evidence of inflation coming down to its 2% target before taking action, citing the current 2.7% annual inflation rate.</li>
<li><strong>Job market performance</strong>: Kashkari notes that the US job market has performed well despite interest rate hikes, but expects more cooling ahead to achieve a balanced economy.</li>
<li><strong>No rate cut expected soon</strong>: Kashkari does not personally expect a rate cut, and suggests that the Fed will wait until more data is available on inflation and the economy before making a decision.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation target takes priority</strong>: Kashkari emphasizes that bringing inflation back down to target is the best way to help the housing market, rather than cutting interest rates to stimulate home ownership.</li>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>By Ann Saphir</p><p>(Reuters) -Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari on Sunday said it's a "reasonable prediction" that the U.S. central bank will cut interest rates once this year, waiting until December to do it.</p><p>"We need to see more evidence to convince us that inflation is well on our way back down to 2%," Kashkari said in an interview with CBS' "Face the Nation" program.</p><p>The Fed last week held its benchmark policy rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range, where it has been since last July, to keep continued pressure on the economy so as to cool inflation. It also published projections that showed the median forecast from all 19 U.S. central bankers was for a single interest rate cut this year.</p><p>"We're in a very good position right now to take our time, get more inflation data, get more data on the economy, on the labor market, before we have to make any decisions," Kashkari said. "We're in a strong position, but if you just said there's going to be one cut, which is what the median indicated, that would likely be toward the end of the year."</p><p>Kashkari, who has been more cautious about the possibility of easing monetary policy than many of his colleagues, did not say how many rate cuts he personally expects.</p><p>He said he has been surprised by how well the U.S. job market has performed even as the Fed raised borrowing costs aggressively in 2022 and 2023, but that he expects more cooling ahead.</p><p>"I hope it's modest cooling, and then we can get back down to more of a balanced economy," he said.</p><p>Inflation by the Fed's targeted measure, the year-over-year change in the personal consumption expenditures price index, registered 2.7% in April. The Fed has a 2% target.</p><p>The unemployment rate in May ticked up to 4%, the highest since just before the Fed launched its rate hiking campaign in March 2022 but still below what most of its policymakers see as sustainable.</p><p>Asked about the barrier high borrowing costs pose for people trying to buy a home, Kashkari said the best thing the Fed can do for the housing market is to bring inflation back down to target.</p><p>"If we simply cut interest rates to try to support home ownership right now, that would probably push up the price of houses, and it actually wouldn't lead to any better affordability," he said.</p><p>"The best thing we can do is do our job - get inflation back down to our target - and then, hopefully, the supply side of the economy can step in to build the homes that Americans need."</p><p>(Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Paul Simao)</p></div></div>

<li><strong>Incident on Southwest Airlines flight</strong>: A Southwest Airlines plane, a Boeing 737 Max 8, experienced a rare mid-air phenomenon known as a "Dutch roll" during a flight from Phoenix to Oakland, California, on May 25.</li>
<li><strong>Description of a Dutch roll</strong>: A Dutch roll is a type of oscillation that creates a "coupled" motion, producing a figure-8 effect, with the plane simultaneously swaying from side to side and rocking up and down.</li>
<li><strong>Investigations underway</strong>: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating the incident, which caused "substantial" damage to the tail section of the plane.</li>
<li><strong>Flight details</strong>: The plane was flying at an altitude of 34,000 feet when the incident occurred, and the flight crew members reported the unusual motion to the authorities.</li>
<li><strong>Uncommon event</strong>: A Dutch roll is an extremely rare event in aviation, and its occurrence has been linked to a specific aerodynamic phenomenon that is not yet fully understood.</li>

<p>The notion was hardly far-fetched. Over the course of two weeks, Gill had been posting images of a massive stake in GameStop and its call options in a portfolio that peaked at more than $550 million on June 6. Though he’s added even more stock since then, the dollar value of his holdings has dropped along with the company’s shares.</p>



<p>With the stock little changed since the early days of its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-13/gamestop-surges-as-roaring-kitty-return-adds-fuel-to-rally" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-13/gamestop-surges-as-roaring-kitty-return-adds-fuel-to-rally" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">latest mania</a>, a new kind of anxiety is building among Wall Street and retail traders alike.</p>



<p>The original 2021 GameStop rally shook the idea of short-selling to its core — eroding the appeal of betting against a floundering company when you can wind up feeling the wrath of Redditors. This time around, the existential question is about what counts as market manipulation. </p>



<p>Does posting a <a href="https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1789807772542067105" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1789807772542067105" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">meme</a>, potentially delivering an instant profit, violate the spirit of free and fair markets? Has the David versus Goliath nature of meme stocks shifted? What if Roaring Kitty <em>is </em>the Goliath? And how exactly did he build a position bigger than <a href="https://fortune.com/company/charles-schwab/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/charles-schwab/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Charles Schwab</a> Corp.’s?</p><p></p>



<p>“The original meme stock craze was us versus them, with ‘them’ being the guys who would short-sell millennials’ favorite companies like GameStop,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “But I’m not sure who ‘them’ is anymore.” </p>



<p>Gill didn’t reply to a request for comment. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Losing Charm</h3>



<p>The populist ringleader of a short squeeze that shook Wall Street in the original 2021 meme-stock rally, Gill is losing his folksy charm, at least for some followers. Trading firms and even some former fans are eying Gill with more suspicion, as Redditors pose questions like: “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1crttc4/how_is_roaring_kitty_coming_back_not_a_basic_pump/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1crttc4/how_is_roaring_kitty_coming_back_not_a_basic_pump/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">How is Roaring Kitty coming back not a basic pump and dump scheme</a>?”</p>



<p>By Thursday, Gill’s brokerage account snapshots suggested he’d unwound an earlier position of 120,000 call options and added more GameStop, upping his portfolio to about 9 million shares of the video game retailer, worth more than $262 million. (Gill’s final post of 2021 showed he had 200,000 shares worth more than $30 million; GameStop did a four-for-one stock split in July 2022.)</p>



<p>As Gill’s actions sent the price soaring again, GameStop seized on the volatility to sell more than $2 billion worth of stock. </p><p></p>



<p>All told, anyone who bought shares over the past month and held was about as likely to lose money as profit. To some, one major difference is hedge funds and other sophisticated investors have adapted from three years ago and are likely to come out ahead — at the expense of Gill’s retail-trading fans. </p>



<p>“Some of the quantitative managers have models to look at the trends in price and those models are extremely quick to get out of the stock if they see significant downside volatility,” said Don Steinbrugge, chief executive officer of Agecroft Partners, which helps hedge funds raise money. “At some point retail investors are going to wise up and realize there’s a lot of danger.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Manipulation Concerns</h3>



<p>The episode brought to the fore questions of what constitutes market manipulation. The Wall Street Journal reported Morgan Stanley-owned brokerage E*Trade was considering barring Gill from its platform over such concerns, after previously banning other popular personalities like Dave Portnoy, the Barstool Sports founder who streams as Davey Day Trader and said he got kicked off of the brokerage.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>A spokesman for E*Trade declined to comment.</p>



<p>What’s singular about Gill’s case is that market manipulation typically involves pushing a price higher to profit off the stock movement, said Craig Marcus, a partner and co-chair of the capital markets group at law firm Ropes &amp; Gray. If Gill’s snapshots are real, that hasn’t obviously been the case, he said. </p><p></p>



<p>“You can disagree with his thesis about the value of the stock, but if all he’s doing is executing on his thesis and not doing manipulative things to profit,” it’s difficult to prove ill intent, Marcus said in an interview.</p>



<p>To be sure, Gill was accused of using his clout to manipulate prices even three years ago when he first arrived on the public stage. In 2021, a lawsuit against Gill and MassMutual alleged he was manipulating markets with his outsize influence on certain stocks. </p>

<p>“Three years ago this was funny,” said Peter Atwater, an adjunct professor of economics at William &amp; Mary. “People have become more bothered by this than amused by it, and that to me is an indication that it is unlikely that this behavior will be allowed to continue.”</p>



<p>When Gill scheduled a highly anticipated return to <a href="https://fortune.com/company/youtube/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/youtube/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">YouTube</a> on June 6 without details of what he’d talk about, the stock shot up nearly 50%, adding $16 billion to its market value in a matter of hours. </p><p></p>



<p>In the livestream, which garnered hundreds of thousands of viewers, Gill vamped for about an hour against the backdrop of GameStop’s violently fluctuating share price. He seemed to sense the possibility he’d draw more scrutiny from fans, regulators and trading professionals. </p>



<p>“Do I have to be careful what I say here?” he asked.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

<p>(<a href="http://kron4.com">KRON</a>) — Bay Area housing affordability has always been a central topic when discussing the hurdles of living in the area. The recently released 2024 <a href="http://demographia.com/dhi.pdf">Demographia International Housing Affordability Report</a> potentially confirms that sentiment with an interesting set of numbers. </p>



<p>According to the Chapman University-led report, San Jose was the least affordable major US housing market in 2023 and the fifth least affordable housing market worldwide. Not only does the South Bay city top the nation, but San Francisco also ranks as the third least affordable nationwide after Los Angeles in second place. </p>





<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top 10 ‘impossibly unaffordable’ cities worldwide:</h2>



<ol>
<li>Hong Kong</li>



<li>Sydney, Australia</li>



<li>Vancouver, Canada</li>



<li>San Jose, California</li>



<li>Los Angeles, California </li>



<li>Honolulu, Hawaii</li>



<li>Melbourne, Australia </li>



<li>San Francisco, California</li>



<li>Adelaide, Australia</li>



<li>San Diego, California </li>
</ol>



<p>In the U.S. alone, San Jose is five times less affordable than Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the country’s most affordable city for housing. San Jose aside, four of the five least affordable markets nationwide were in California, the study stated. The only non-California city in the top five nationwide was Honolulu, Hawaii.  </p>

<p>Other “severely unaffordable” markets in California include Sacramento and Fresno, according to the study.</p>



<p>Researchers believe much of the recent surge in unaffordability is closely linked to the pandemic. According to the study, the rates of remote workers in the United States have nearly quadrupled since 2019, claiming that “nearly two-thirds of the US house price increase in the demand shock could be attributed to the shift to remote work.”</p>



<p>This has led many city residents to move to more calm, suburban areas. “The result was a demand shock that drove house prices up substantially, as households moved to obtain more space, within houses and in yards or gardens,” the study states. </p>





<p>The study states that the increase in remote work has also led to an “unprecedented decline” in car ownership compared to pre-pandemic levels. </p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wells Fargo is reportedly losing $10 million per month on the Bilt credit card</strong>: The article cites a Wall Street Journal report that Wells Fargo is losing this amount on the partnership, which is a significant financial burden.</li>
<li><strong>Wells Fargo partnered with Bilt to expand its credit card business</strong>: The bank's new CEO in 2022 prioritized expanding the credit card business, and Bilt was seen as a way to generate buzz and attract younger customers.</li>
<li><strong>Bilt allows users to earn points for paying rent at no cost</strong>: The innovative feature of the Bilt Mastercard is that users can earn points for paying rent, even if their landlord doesn't accept credit cards.</li>
<li><strong>Wells Fargo's motivations for partnering with Bilt were likely to attract new customers</strong>: The bank's executives believed that the Bilt partnership would attract younger customers who would eventually seek out Wells Fargo for mortgages.</li>
<li><strong>Wells Fargo has since pulled back from the mortgage business</strong>: Despite the bank's original hopes, the Bilt partnership has not yielded the desired results, and Wells Fargo has since shifted its focus away from mortgages.</li>

<p>In the miles &amp; points world, we’re almost all <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/reviews/credit-cards/bilt-mastercard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">familiar with the Bilt Mastercard</a> (issued in partnership with Wells Fargo), which is <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/guides/bilt-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most innovative products</a> that we’ve seen launch in recent years. Bilt Rewards <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/guides/bilt-rewards-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a transferable points currency</a>, and the Bilt Mastercard is one of the most lucrative no annual fee cards out there.</p>



<p>The coolest aspect of the Bilt Mastecard is that you can <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/guides/pay-rent-bilt-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earn points for paying rent at no cost</a>, even when your landlord doesn’t accept credit cards. This is awesome, since rent is one of the biggest expenses for many people.</p>



<p>I’ve long wondered about the economics of Bilt. I mean, it’s great for consumers, but who exactly is funding all these rewards? As is the case with many startups, I’ve assumed that the priority is showing growth, and that profitability will come later (maybe). However, there’s a bit more to this, as it seems that Bilt isn’t even the party incurring many of the losses.</p>



<p>If you’ve been curious about how the economics of Bilt work, we now have some insights…</p>




<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wells-fargo-reportedly-losing-10-million-per-month-on-bilt"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="wells_fargo_reportedly_losing_10_million_per_month_on_bilt" ez-toc-data-id="#wells_fargo_reportedly_losing_10_million_per_month_on_bilt"></span>Wells Fargo reportedly losing $10 million per month on Bilt<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.qksrv.net/links/7718223/type/am/sid/DLA/https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/wells-fargo-credit-card-rent-rewards-8e380852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a> has the scoop on how Wells Fargo reportedly made a very bad bet with Bilt, and is losing $10 million every month on the partnership. </p>



<p>For some background, back in 2022, Wells Fargo got a new CEO, and one of his priorities was expanding the credit card business. At the same time, Bilt was launching, and was looking for a bank to partner with, since it couldn’t lend or underwrite on its own. Chase reportedly wasn’t interested, but Wells Fargo was.</p>



<p>Wells Fago executives felt that they needed a credit card win, and figured that a Bilt partnership would generate buzz and attract younger customers. It was also thought that these young customers who are renting would then come to Wells Fargo for mortgages, but that’s a business that the company has since pulled back from.</p>



<p>What reportedly happened is that Wells Fargo made internal projections on key revenue drivers with the partnership, and they ended up being completely wrong. </p>



<p>As a result, Wells Fargo has reportedly been trying to renegotiate its contract with Bilt in recent month, stating that the current consumer behavior doesn’t provide a path to profitability. Wells Fargo has also told Bilt that it doesn’t intend to renew the contract the two companies have in 2029, unless economics change.</p>



<p>Here’s how the current economics reportedly work:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wells Fargo pays Bilt a 0.8% fee on all rent transactions, even though Wells Fargo isn’t collecting any interchange fees from landlords (Wells Fargo is paying Bilt since Bilt issues rewards to members for these transactions)</li>



<li>Wells Fargo pays Bilt $200 each time that a new card account is issued, which is similar to what you’ll find for co-brand agreements with airlines and hotels</li>



<li>Wells Fargo had projected that around 65% of purchase volume on the Bilt Mastercard would be non-rent expenses, generating interchange fee revenue; the reality is inverted</li>



<li>Wells Fargo projected that around 50-75% of purchases charged to the card would carry over month-to-month, generating interest charges, while the reality is instead 15-25%</li>
</ul>



<p>As a result of this, Wells Fargo has stopped bidding on new co-branded credit card programs, and is instead focused on launching credit cards that don’t include partners. Wells Fargo has reportedly even taken some of its Bilt marketing materials out of bank branches.</p>



<p>In the interest of presenting both sides, a Bilt spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal that the reporting “is an inaccurate representation” of the partnership, and that the company is “committed to a long term partnership with Wells Fargo that benefits all parties.” No further details were provided.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-i-can-t-say-this-is-terribly-surprising"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="i_cant_say_this_is_terribly_surprising" ez-toc-data-id="#i_cant_say_this_is_terribly_surprising"></span>I can’t say this is terribly surprising<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>Bilt is now valued at $3.1 billion, and 34-year-old founder Ankur Jain has become a billionaire thanks to it. Former American Express CEO Ken Chenault is even on Bilt’s board, and has personally invested at least $20 million in the company.</p>



<p>Look, all along I’ve said that Bilt is fantastic for consumers, and in many ways, it’s too good to be true. Who doesn’t want to earn points for rent without paying a fee? They say “there’s no such thing as a free lunch,” but… that’s basically a free lunch!</p>



<p>There was an interesting CNBC interview earlier this year with both Jain and Chenault, where some interesting questions were asked about the economics of the company. The interview didn’t exactly clarify a whole lot about who pays for what, but I guess now we know.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<lite-youtube videoid="zPKGu13oK9s"><button type="button" class="lyt-playbtn"><span class="lyt-visually-hidden"></span></button><button type="button" class="lty-playbtn"><span class="lyt-visually-hidden">Play</span></button></lite-youtube>
</p></figure>



<p>Bilt has fewer revenue streams than other kinds of cards, and a lot more expenses:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Bilt Mastercard has no annual fee, and a lot of card issuers make money through annual fees</li>



<li>The Bilt Mastercard gives out rewards for paying rent, without getting any revenue from it (well, more accurately, Bilt is getting some revenue from Wells Fargo, but it basically only covers the cost of issuing rewards)</li>



<li>Many of the people with the Bilt Mastercard are savvy miles &amp; points consumers, who don’t carry balances, so the revenue there isn’t as high as Wells Fargo had projected</li>
</ul>



<p>Essentially it seems that Bilt has an amazing arrangement with Wells Fargo, as clearly Wells Fargo was expecting completely different consumer behavior. I also can’t help but wonder what Wells Fargo was basing its projections on, as expecting 50-75% of purchases to generate interest charges seems highly optimistic.</p>



<p>Of course it’s normal for it to take some time before a card portfolio becomes profitable, so it’s not surprising that money would be lost early on in terms of acquisition costs, etc.</p>



<p>But there’s one thing here that’s very hard to overcome. Wells Fargo was hoping that around 65% of purchase volume would be non-rent expenses, but instead it’s the inverse, so somewhere around 35%. That’s a major issue, since that’s a portion of revenue on which Wells Fargo takes a loss. Add in the lack of people carrying balances, and one has to wonder where the upside is for Wells Fargo.</p>



<p>So what can be done so that a higher percentage of the purchase volume is non-rent expenses, and/or so that people carry balances? That’s not so easy…</p>



<p>Obviously Bilt has been able to show amazing growth, and for good reason, because the product is very lucrative for consumers. Actually making this sustainably profitable for all parties is a challenge, though.</p>



<p>I know that part of Bilt’s business model is also getting the big rental companies in the United States onto its platform. While that might help Bilt’s bottom line, it doesn’t help the bottom line of the bank that’s underwriting all of this.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cathay-Pacific-777-First-Class-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-200681"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">How can these rewards be funded sustainably?</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bottom-line"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="bottom_line" ez-toc-data-id="#bottom_line"></span>Bottom line<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The Bilt Mastercard is issued in partnership with Wells Fargo, and is an incredibly lucrative product that awards points for rent, without any sort of fees. I’ve recommended that anyone who is eligible pick up this product, given that you’re basically getting something for nothing.</p>



<p>If you’ve been curious about who is paying for these rewards though, now we know, at least according to sources quoted by The Wall Street Journal. The economics of the Bilt partnership haven’t worked out the way that Wells Fargo had hoped, as a majority of purchase volume is for rent, where consumers are earning something for nothing. On top of that, not many consumers are carrying balances.</p>



<p>I’m curious to see how this evolves. Will Bilt and Wells Fargo be able to renegotiate their contract, or how does this play out in 2029?</p>
