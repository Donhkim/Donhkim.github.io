    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Neiman Marcus' humble beginnings</strong>: The company was founded in 1907 by Carrie Marcus Neiman, her husband Al Neiman, and her brother Herbert Marcus in downtown Dallas, Texas. It was an instant success, catering to Dallasites who wanted more than just ordering goods from the Sears Roebuck catalog.</li>
<li><strong>Innovative leadership</strong>: Stanley Marcus joined the family business 18 years later and used lessons from his aunt Carrie to create a worldwide luxury retailing mecca. He successfully navigated the company through three ownership changes and bankruptcy.</li>
<li><strong>Current controversy</strong>: The proposed purchase of Neiman Marcus' parent company by the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue for $2.65 billion has created high anxiety in Dallas' fashion community, with concerns that the brand may be tarnished and the city will lose cultural cachet.</li>
<li><strong>End of an era</strong>: The deal will mark the end of more than 115 years of Neiman Marcus being run from Dallas, with the company being a global luxury leader for most of that time.</li>
<li><strong>Worries about the brand's future</strong>: Fans of the iconic brand are worried that the sale may lead to changes that compromise Neiman Marcus' reputation and Dallas' cultural identity.</li>

press release </a>Thursday detailing the proposed transaction, saying it will create Saks Global, “a combination of world-class luxury retail and real estate assets, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks OFF 5TH, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, each of which will continue operations under their respective brands.”</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Accent on “brands.”</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">That’s what concerns Neiman’s loyalists.</p><h2 class="body-text-header">Just another brand?</h2><p class="body-text-paragraph">Will Neiman Marcus become just another brand in HBC’s luxury lineup?</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">While the news release makes the case for why Neiman Marcus’ purchase makes economic sense, it also indicates a pecking order: “Saks Fifth Avenue is the leading name in luxury shopping.”</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">That’s certainly debatable, said Maria Halkias, <i>The Dallas Morning News</i>’ longtime retail reporter, who retired last month.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">“Richard Baker, CEO of HBC, has lusted over Neiman Marcus for years,” said Halkias, who closely covered luxury retailing for 31 years.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">The crux of the matter, she said, is whether HBC can put these fierce competitors under one corporate umbrella and keep their stores relevant at a time when luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Hermès continue to take an exponentially larger share of the market with their own stores and e-commerce.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Most worrisome is consumers might see a deterioration of the personalized service that sets Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman apart from their new owner, she said.</p><figure><img loading="lazy"

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Sahm Rule, a economic indicator created by economist Claudia Sahm, suggests that a recession may be starting when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate rises by at least a half-percentage point from its low during the previous 12 months.</li>
<li>According to the latest unemployment figures, the gap between the jobless rate and its low point over the past 12 months has expanded to 0.43 in June, the highest level since March 2021.</li>
<li>The Sahm Rule has signaled every recession since 1970, and Claudia Sahm has warned that a rising unemployment rate can set off a negative feedback loop that leads to a recession.</li>
<li>However, Sahm has also cautioned that the pandemic may have caused disruptions in the economy and labor market that affect the accuracy of indicators like the Sahm Rule.</li>
<li>The expert believes that once the feedback loop starts, it is usually self-reinforcing and accelerates, leading to a recession, but notes that the current situation may be different due to the post-pandemic economic landscape.</li>

<p>While unemployment is still historically low, its rate of increase could be a sign of deteriorating economic conditions. That’s where the so-called <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/what-is-sahm-rule-unemployment-predictor-recession/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/what-is-sahm-rule-unemployment-predictor-recession/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/what-is-sahm-rule-unemployment-predictor-recession/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sahm Rule</a> comes in.</p>



<p>It says that when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate rises by at least a half-percentage point from its low during the previous 12 months, then a recession has started. This rule would have signaled every recession since 1970.</p>



<p>Based on the latest unemployment figures from the Labor Department’s monthly report on Friday, the gap between the two has <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmacro&amp;stream=business" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmacro&amp;stream=business" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmacro&amp;stream=business" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">expanded to 0.43</a> in June from 0.37 in May.</p>



<p>It’s now at the highest level since March 2021, when the economy was still recovering from the pandemic-induced crash. </p><p></p>



<p>The creator of the rule, Claudia Sahm, was an economist at the Federal Reserve and is now chief economist at New Century Advisors. She has previously explained that even from low levels a rising unemployment rate can set off a negative feedback loop that leads to a recession. </p>



<p>“When workers lose paychecks, they cut back on spending, and as businesses lose customers, they need fewer workers, and so on,” she wrote in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-07/one-highly-accurate-recession-indicator-could-be-wrong-this-time" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-07/one-highly-accurate-recession-indicator-could-be-wrong-this-time" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-07/one-highly-accurate-recession-indicator-could-be-wrong-this-time" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Bloomberg opinion column</a> in November, adding that once this feedback loop starts, it is usually self-reinforcing and accelerates.</p>



<p>But she also said the pandemic may have caused so many disruptions in the economy and the labor market that indicators like the Sahm Rule that are based on unemployment may not be as accurate right now.</p>



<p>A few weeks ago, however, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/economist-sahm-who-devised-recession-rule-says-the-fed-is-playing-with-fire-.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/economist-sahm-who-devised-recession-rule-says-the-fed-is-playing-with-fire-.html" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/economist-sahm-who-devised-recession-rule-says-the-fed-is-playing-with-fire-.html" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sahm told CNBC</a> that the Federal Reserve risks sending the economy into a recession by continuing to hold off on rate cuts.</p>



<p>“My baseline is not recession,” she said on June 18. “But it’s a real risk, and I do not understand why the Fed is pushing that risk. I’m not sure what they’re waiting for.”</p><p></p>



<p>That came days after the Fed’s June policy meeting when central bankers kept rates steady after holding them at 5.25%-5.5%—the highest since 2001—since July 2023. </p>



<p>The Fed meets again at the end of this month and is expected to remain on hold, but odds are rising that a cut could happen in September.</p>

<p>"The U.S. national debt is rising by $1 trillion every 100 days," Michael Hartnett, chief strategist of Bank of America, wrote in a note to clients <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/01/the-us-national-debt-is-rising-by-1-trillion-about-every-100-days.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/01/the-us-national-debt-is-rising-by-1-trillion-about-every-100-days.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/01/the-us-national-debt-is-rising-by-1-trillion-about-every-100-days.html" aria-label="seen">seen</a> by <em>CNBC</em>, adding it's "little wonder ‘debt debasement’ trades closing in on all-time highs."</p>
<p>Hartnett predicted the newly created spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have taken Wall Street by storm over the last month are on course for a "blowout year," in part because of the collapse of the U.S. dollar.</p>

    </div><div class="content article-descr news-text">
    <div><p>In late May, JP Morgan’s Marko Kolanovic defended his stubborn, negative stance on the U.S. stocks, asserting that the S&amp;P 500 was substantially overvalued, and predicted that the big cap index would end the year at 4200, down 24% from its level at the time. By then, Kolanovic was the last bearish market strategist at a major Wall Street bank; all the others, even the previously dour ones, were predicting more gains by year end on the view that the fabulous resurgence that started in early 2023 would just keep rolling.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>Kolanovic had also been wrong in 2022 when he foresaw great things for equities, and the markets tanked. It appears that missing by a wide margin on back-to-back forecasts, over two-and-a-half years, cost him his job. But does his analysis of the market’s fundamentals was wrong? Not at all.</p>



<p>In fact, the circumstances surrounding his departure carry two lessons. First, extremely short-term calls on the direction of equities are worthless. Second, history shows that episodes of inflated prices can go on a long time—but that the gravitational forces that govern earnings growth and PE multiples over extended periods always eventually take hold, and carry the day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Despite the great bull run and the exit of skeptics like Kolanovic who so far got it wrong, equities do look dangerously pricey</strong></h2>



<p>In his most recent report, Kolanovic stated that stock prices were simply incorporating much higher earnings growth than he deemed reasonable. It’s a good argument. For Q1 of this year, S&amp;P 500 net profits, based on the last four quarters, stood at $192. That’s 38% higher than the pre-pandemic record of $140 set at the close of 2019. The famous CAPE model developed by Yale economist and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller strongly implies that the $192 number is unsustainable, and that a “baseline” for earnings is more like $155.</p>



<p>The rub: Even though profits hover at extremely lofty levels, what investors are paying for each dollar of those possible unrepeatable earnings is also immense. The S&amp;P’s current multiple stands at 28.9. Except during the Great Financial Crisis when profits collapsed, that’s the highest PE for any quarter since the tech bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. And over the past 36 years, the S&amp;P’s PE has only been that high for just five months, all during this century’s most notorious craze.</p><p></p>



<p>That episode is a reminder that prices can break free of anything justified by the basics for years, so while that’s happening, predictions of an imminent fall are always wrong—until they’re finally and inevitably right. Put simply, though the outcome’s predictable, the timing is anything but. By June of 2017, the Shiller model was flashing red, indicating that that the S&amp;P had swung into the super-rich zone. Yet through August of 2000, a stretch of over three years, the index gained another 79%, rising from 847 to 1517. By February of 2003, the S&amp;P made a virtual round trip to 841, and didn’t breach 1500 once again until a decade later.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Adjust the numbers according to basic market math, and they’re at least as scary as those the JP Morgan bear advanced</h2>



<p>Let’s say that the market PE trends downward from its current level of nearly 29, to 22, still elevated by historical standards. That shift would lower the index 25% from where it stands now, about the correction Kolanovic predicted. Or, it’s highly possible that EPS will trend downwards and settle at the $155, adjusted for inflation, that looks justifiable from the Shiller data. It already appears that the gigantic profits booked in the post-COVID recovery aren’t durable; the 500’s EPS has gone flat, and dropped in real terms, since Q4 of 2021. If profits drop to the $150-160 range, after accounting for inflation, even at a big PE of 27, the S&amp;P’s 25% too pricey at its record of 5567 at the close on July 5th.</p>



<p>Keep mind that low interest rates should be great for stocks because they raise the present value of future earnings, and higher real yields are a downer since they reduce what that stream’s worth today. Well, “real yields” have jumped from negative to over 2% while the S&amp;P’s soared. The combination of historically high PEs, probably inflated earnings, and real rates that just went from extremely favorable to normal, aren’t a  combination that should breed confidence that stocks will keep climbing. They’re more like the cocktail for a tough hangover.</p>



<p>Once again, the bulls could be right for awhile. But for a much longer period, the science tells us that when you’re starting at these big prices, you’ll get pocket poor returns over the next seven or even five years. A bet for where we’ll be this time next year is no better than a guess. But the more the market booms, the more it sows the seeds of its own demise.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get global CEO perspectives on the biggest stories in business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p>.</p></div></div>

    <div><p>Get ready for a bonanza of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve that starts in a few months and extends all the way into next summer, according to analysts at Citi Research.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>In a note on Friday, the bank cited fresh signs of a slowing economy for its view that the Fed will trim rates by 25 basis points eight times, starting in September and extending to July 2025.</p>



<p>That will lower the benchmark rate by a whopping 200 basis points, or from 5.25%-5.5% now to 3.25%-3.5%, where they will remain for the rest of 2025, the note said.</p>



<p>The economy has cooled off from its “heady” pace in 2023 with inflation resuming its slowdown after some unexpected stickiness, said Citi analysts led by chief U.S. economist Andrew Hollenhorst. </p>



<p>But the Institute for Supply Management’s service-sector gauge, which abruptly reversed into negative territory, and the monthly jobs report, which showed unemployment rising to 4.1%, have raised the risk of a sharper weakening of economic activity and a faster pace of rate cuts, they added.</p><p></p>



<p>The data along with dovish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday suggest the first rate cut will very likely come in September. </p>



<p>“A continued softening of activity will provoke cuts at each of the subsequent seven Fed meetings, in our base case,” Citi predicted.</p>



<p>The note also pointed to other signs of weakness in the jobs report. While the headline payroll gain of 206,000 appears solid, prior months were revised down. And June saw a decline of 49,000 temporary services jobs, with Citi calling it “the type of decline that is typically seen around recessions as employers begin reducing labor with the least strongly attached workers.”</p>



<p>Payroll data are also likely skewed to the upside, leaving the unemployment rate, which is derived from a separate survey, as the more important metric, it said. And on that front, Citi pointed to the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/recession-indicator-economic-outlook-sahm-rule-unemployment-rate-june-jobs-report/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/recession-indicator-economic-outlook-sahm-rule-unemployment-rate-june-jobs-report/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/recession-indicator-economic-outlook-sahm-rule-unemployment-rate-june-jobs-report/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">“Sahm Rule” recession indicator</a> and said it could be triggered in August if unemployment continues to rise at its current pace.</p>



<p>Hollenhorst has been a relative contrarian this year by maintaining a dimmer view on the economy, even as the Wall Street consensus shifted to a soft landing.</p><p></p>



<p>In May, he doubled down on his warning that the U.S. is <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/05/economic-outlook-hard-landing-recession-fed-rate-cuts-forecast-citi/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/05/economic-outlook-hard-landing-recession-fed-rate-cuts-forecast-citi/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/05/economic-outlook-hard-landing-recession-fed-rate-cuts-forecast-citi/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">headed for a hard landing</a> and that Fed rate cuts wouldn’t be enough to prevent it. That followed a similar forecast in February, even amid blowout jobs reports.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-07-03/bloomberg-surveillance-07-04-2024&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCxOzGspWHAxWgmI4IHd3VC4YQtwJ6BAgOEAI&amp;usg=AOvVaw3vANgZLjaSZwx1yIMvCBjw" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-07-03/bloomberg-surveillance-07-04-2024&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCxOzGspWHAxWgmI4IHd3VC4YQtwJ6BAgOEAI&amp;usg=AOvVaw3vANgZLjaSZwx1yIMvCBjw" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-07-03/bloomberg-surveillance-07-04-2024&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCxOzGspWHAxWgmI4IHd3VC4YQtwJ6BAgOEAI&amp;usg=AOvVaw3vANgZLjaSZwx1yIMvCBjw" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Bloomberg TV on Wednesday</a>, Hollenhorst noted that a sharp recession would likely produce enough political consensus for more government spending to stimulate the economy, overcoming concerns about the massive deficit. But a more mild recession may not result in such a consensus, he added.</p>



<p>He also pointed out that just as Fed rate hikes slowed the economy less than anticipated, rate cuts have not stimulate as much. In addition, 10-year bond yields, which serve as benchmarks for a wide range of borrowing costs, are already below 2-year yields, leaving less room for further downside, especially as rising deficits and inflation add upward pressure. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“Most economic activity is going to be more responsive to a 5-year yield, the 10-year yield. It’s not really about the overnight policy rate,” Hollenhorst explained. “So there really are questions about how much can you transmit that stimulative effect of lower policy rates.” </p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get global CEO perspectives on the biggest stories in business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p>.</p></div></div>

That compares with just under 15% at the end of March.</p><p>Those contrarian bets now threaten to saddle the hedge funds behind them with losses. Tesla’s latest vehicle-sales results, published on July 2, revealed second-quarter deliveries figures that beat average analyst estimates, even though sales were down. Investors pounced on the news, driving the company’s shares to a six-month high. Since the beginning of June, Tesla’s share price has now soared about 40%.</p><p>Tesla is likely to see its profit margins improve, helped by lower production and raw material costs, according to Morningstar Inc.’s Seth Goldstein, one of the top three analysts covering the stock in a Bloomberg ranking that tracks price recommendations.</p><p>The company will likely “return to profit growth” next year, he said in a note to clients. But how Tesla handles the market’s intensifying focus on affordable EVs will be key, he added.</p><p>The development feeds into an ongoing sense of uncertainty around how to treat the wider EV market, amid a sea of conflicting dynamics. The industry — a key plank in the global race to reach net zero emissions by 2050 — benefits from generous tax credits. Yet it’s also contending with significant hurdles in the form of tariff wars and even identity politics, with some consumers rejecting EVs as a form of “woke” transport.</p><p>In the US, Donald Trump has said that if he becomes president again after November’s election, he’ll undo existing laws supporting battery-powered vehicles, calling them “crazy.” That said, Trump is a “huge fan” of Tesla’s Cybertruck, according to Elon Musk, the EV giant’s chief executive officer.</p><figure class="caas-figure"></figure><p>Meanwhile, the list of internal disruptions at Tesla is long. In April, Musk told staff to brace for major job cuts, with sales roles among those affected. And the Cybertruck, Tesla’s first new consumer model in years, has been slow to ramp up.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="19"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>For that reason, some hedge fund managers have decided the stock is off bounds altogether. Tesla is “very difficult for us to position,” said Fabio Pecce, chief investment officer at Ambienta where he oversees $700 million, including managing the Ambienta x Alpha hedge fund.</p><p>Basically, it’s not clear whether investors are dealing with “a top company with a great management team” or whether it’s “a challenged franchise with deficient corporate governance,” he said.</p><p>However, “if Trump wins, it is truly going to be very positive” for Tesla, though “obviously not amazing for EVs and renewables in general,” he said. That’s because Trump is expected to impose “massive tariffs towards the Chinese players,” which would be “beneficial” to Tesla, Pecce said.</p><p>Investors ended 2023 declaring they’d likely retreat further from green stocks in general, and EVs specifically, according to a Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey. Almost two-thirds of the 620 respondents said they planned to stay away from the EV sector, with close to 60% expecting the iShares Global Clean Energy exchange-traded fund to extend its slide in 2024. The ETF has lost 13% so far this year after sinking more than 20% in 2023.</p><figure class="caas-figure"></figure><p>The Bloomberg Electric Vehicles Price Return Index, whose members include BYD Co., Tesla and Rivian (<a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RIVN" data-ylk="slk:RIVN;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="20">RIVN</a>) Automotive Inc., is down about 22% so far in 2024. At the same time, the metals and minerals needed to produce batteries are at the mercy of wildly volatile commodities markets, with speculators regularly trying to make a quick buck on shifts in supply and demand. Price volatility means some battery manufacturers are having to adjust to a market in which their profit margins have been getting badly squeezed.</p><p>Against that backdrop, more traditional automakers are finding themselves under pressure from shareholders to slow down their capital expenditure on EVs, with recent examples including Porsche AG. Polestar Automotive Holding UK Plc (<a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY" data-ylk="slk:PSNY;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="21">PSNY</a>), a high-end EV manufacturer, has lost almost 95% of its value since being spun out of Volvo Car AB two years ago. Fisker Inc., another luxury EV maker, saw its value wiped out starting last year and has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</p><p>Soren Aandahl, founder and CIO of Texas-based Blue Orca Capital, said “valuations in the EV space are so beat up” that he’s now avoiding shorting the sector. It’s no longer an obvious contrarian bet, because those tend to do best if investors enter “when things are a little bit higher,” he said. But at this point, “a lot of the air’s already come out of the balloon.”</p><p>But Eirik Hogner, deputy portfolio manager at $2.7 billion hedge fund Clean Energy Transition, suggests there may be more pain to come for the wider EV industry. There are still “way too many” startups that remain “sub-scale” and with gross margins that are simply “too low,” he said. As a result, the supply-demand dynamic of the EV market “is still very negative.”</p><p>“Ultimately, I think you need to see more bankruptcies” before the market starts to look healthier, Hogner said.</p><p>—With assistance from Craig Trudell.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

                        </div><p>Food and Drug Administration officials said dozens of people have been made ill, including one person in Maryland, after consuming Diamond Shruumz — a microdosing candy and gummy brand.</p>

<p>Officials <a href="https://wtop.com/national/2024/07/diamond-shruumz-microdosing-candies-may-be-linked-to-a-death-and-nearly-50-illnesses-fda-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began an initial investigation on June 7</a>, after receiving eight reports of illness connected with the brand’s chocolate bars. Those cases grew to include one unidentified Marylander by June 18, more than a week before the Santa Ana, California-based Prophet Premium Blends, issued a recall for the product.</p>

<p>“As of July 1, 2024, a total of 48 illnesses have been reported from 24 states,” <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-chocolate-bars-cones-gummies-june-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FDA said in a July 2 update.</a></p>

<p>Agency officials said that recalled products were sold online and in person at location across the U.S., including retails stores, smoke/vape shops and stores that sell hemp-derived products like CBD or delta-8 THC.</p>

<p>The ingredient muscimol, which is found in some types of mushrooms, is believed to be linked with symptoms such as seizures, agitation, involuntary muscle contractions, loss of consciousness, confusion, sleepiness, nausea and vomiting, abnormal heart rates, and hyper/hypotension, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/prophet-premium-blends-recalls-diamond-shruumz-products-because-possible-health-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by people who got sick</a>.</p>

<p>FDA investigators said they believe that a death may be related to consumption of one of the products, but the FDA has yet to confirm the details of that report.</p>

<p>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, FDA and America’s Poison Center investigators continue to look into the reports, and encourage anyone with symptoms to reach out to their health provider or the Health Resources &amp; Services Administration Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p>
