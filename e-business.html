                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Ever get your McDonald’s order mixed up at an AI-powered drive-thru? The experiment behind the fast food giant’s current automated order taker will soon be coming to a close.</p><p>McDonald’s confirmed Monday that it decided to end a global partnership with IBM, which has been testing this artificial intelligence technology at select McDonald’s drive-thrus since 2021.</p><p>That doesn’t mean you’ll never encounter some sort of chatbot while picking up fries on your car ride home again. While the IBM partnership for McDonald’s current automated order taker test is winding down, the Chicago-based company suggested that it wasn’t ruling other any other potential AI drive-thru plans down the road — pointing to “an opportunity to explore voice ordering solutions more broadly.”</p><p>“Our work with IBM has given us the confidence that a voice ordering solution for drive-thru will be part of our restaurants’ future,” McDonald’s said in a prepared statement this week — adding that it would continue evaluations to “make an informed decision on a future voice ordering solution by the end of the year.”</p>
    

<p>Numerous fast food chains have begun exploring the implementation of AI across operations over recent years, with many pointing to possibilities of maximizing speed and cutting costs.</p><p>In the U.S., Wendy’s partnered with Google Cloud to develop “Wendy’s FreshAI” chatbot. White Castle teamed up with SoundHound AI with a goal of bringing voice-powered AI technology to more than 100 restaurants by the end of 2024. And a handful of Panera, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-health-coronavirus-pandemic-d935b29f631f1ae36e964d23881f77bd">Arby’s</a></span> and Popeyes locations have brought OpenCity’s “Tori” voice assistant to their order lanes.</p>
    
<p>Beyond America, Popeyes U.K. also launched its first AI-powered drive-thru (dubbed “Al”) last month, after the company said a pilot program reported 97% accuracy.</p>



<p>Success for AI-powered drive-thrus has been mixed. McDonald’s automated order taker with IBM received scores of complaints in recent years, for example — with many taking to social media to document the chatbot misunderstanding their orders.</p>
    

<p>One 2023 <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@typical_redhead_/video/7192248491853303086" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a></span>, for example, appears to show the drive-thru assistant place order after order of McDonald’s chicken nuggets on one car’s tab, despite the customers asking it to stop while laughing. Additional posts show an array of other mishaps — such as it adding strange extras, like ice cream <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lunchboxbites/video/7200085255595003182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with ketchup and butter</a></span>, or picking up orders <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@resinsbiren/video/7198528478533258542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from other nearby cars</a></span>.</p><p>Unnamed sources familiar with the technology <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/mcdonalds-to-end-ibm-ai-drive-thru-test.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told CNBC</a></span> that the technology has had difficulty interpreting different accents and dialects, among other challenges affecting order accuracy. </p><p>McDonald’s declined to comment about the automated order taker’s accuracy. In an initial statement, IBM said that “this technology is proven to have some of the most comprehensive capabilities in the industry, fast and accurate in some of the most demanding conditions,” but did not immediately respond to a request for further comment about specifics of potential challenges.</p><p>The Armonk, New York-based tech company also said that it is currently “in discussions and pilots” with several other quick-serve restaurant clients interested in the automated order taker.</p>
    

<p>According to trade publication <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/mcdonalds-ending-its-drive-thru-ai-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Restaurant Business</a></span> and CNBC, which obtained a memo sent to franchisees last week, the automated order technology will be shut off in McDonald’s locations testing it “no later than July 26, 2024.”</p><p>Both IBM and McDonald’s maintained that, while their AI drive-thru partnership was ending, the two would continue their relationship on other projects. McDonalds said that it still plans to use many of IBM’s products across its global system.</p><p>In December, McDonald’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mcdonalds-restaurants-fast-food-617fb9859fc67e3a8ab4c1440f0ce434">launched a multi-year partnership</a></span> with Google Cloud. In addition to moving restaurant computations from servers into the cloud, the partnership is also set to apply generative AI “across a number of key business priorities” in restaurants around the world.</p>

The agency also asked retailers — including Amazon, Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and combination Family Dollar/Dollar Tree stores — that carried WanaBana products to voluntarily pull the products from their shelves. But, according to the FDA’s latest updates, Dollar Tree, Inc. (which owns both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree stores), “failed to adequately remove recalled WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree pouches from its store shelves,” the agency said. "On December 18, 20 and 21, 2023, FDA again held calls with Dollar Tree to relay our concerns that your stores continued to have adulterated products on store shelves," the letter reads as the last update.</p><p>The FDA states that to date, Dollar Tree has not provided the agency "with any information demonstrating that long-term, sustainable corrections have been implemented" throughout their organization to prevent adulterated food from making it to shelves.</p><p>Dollar Tree has since hired a new management team and continues to work to step up its compliance and safety programs, the company told Yahoo Life in a statement.

<p>The recent buying spree has been years in the making for Berkshire, which worked with Occidental to finance an acquisition in 2019 and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/19/warren-buffett-gets-permission-to-buy-up-to-half-of-occidental-petroleum-boosting-the-shares.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/19/warren-buffett-gets-permission-to-buy-up-to-half-of-occidental-petroleum-boosting-the-shares.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">received</a> regulatory approval to purchase up to 50% of Occidental back in August 2022, when it held around 20%. At the time, financial experts predicted an acquisition was likely, although Buffett <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/06/warren-buffett-says-berkshire-hathaway-wont-take-full-control-of-occidental-petroleum.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/06/warren-buffett-says-berkshire-hathaway-wont-take-full-control-of-occidental-petroleum.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">told</a> Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in May 2023 that it wasn’t going to take control. “We wouldn’t know what to do with it,” he said.</p>



<p>While Berkshire hasn’t fully swallowed the oil and gas giant yet, it has scooped up around 7.3 million shares, with the stock price rising from under $60 on June 5—the first day of the nine purchase days—to around $61.20 the time of publication. In a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/warren-buffett-buys-occidental-shares-for-9-straight-days-pushes-his-stake-to-nearly-29percent.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/warren-buffett-buys-occidental-shares-for-9-straight-days-pushes-his-stake-to-nearly-29percent.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">previous interview</a> with CNBC, Buffett said that he became interested in Occidental after reading a transcript of the company’s earnings call. “I read every word, and this is exactly what I would be doing,” he said.</p>



<p>The reasons for Berkshire’s interest are not obvious aside from its existing relationship with Occidental. “That’s been a question people have been asking for quite some time,” said Leo Mariani, a senior energy analyst for brokerage firm Roth Capital. “I’m not sure anybody has a perfect answer.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"></p></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">‘They have a history there’</h2>



<p>Occidental may not seem like a natural target for Berkshire, which is famed for its massive positions in buzzier stocks like <a href="https://fortune.com/company/apple/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/apple/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Apple</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/coca-cola/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/coca-cola/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Coca-Cola</a>. Occidental, however, is far from its only holding in the energy sector, as it owns about 7% of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/chevron/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/chevron/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Chevron</a>, though the investment giant <a href="https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/stocks-warren-buffett-just-bought" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/stocks-warren-buffett-just-bought" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">cut back</a> its stake earlier this year. Berkshire has also been <a href="https://fortune.com/asia/2024/06/18/byds-shares-early-backer-warren-buffett-paused-selling-shares/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/asia/2024/06/18/byds-shares-early-backer-warren-buffett-paused-selling-shares/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">reducing</a> its stake in the Chinese electric vehicle company <a href="https://fortune.com/company/byd-2/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/byd-2/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">BYD</a>, holding around 7% of the manufacturer and selling around 1% of the total outstanding shares since October.</p><p></p>



<p>Greggory Warren, a senior stock analyst for Morningstar covering Berkshire Hathaway, said that Buffett’s recent buying spree of Occidental is likely not a reflection of a broader strategy toward the energy sector, and that the company has been wary of BYD over concerns with the Chinese market.</p>



<p>Founded in 1920 and later headed by the legendary businessman Armand Hammer, Occidental expanded operations around the world, from Venezuela to the North Sea. Occidental’s current CEO is Vicki Hollub, who took over in 2016, <a href="https://fortune.com/2017/06/08/occidental-petroleum-ceo-vicki-hollub/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2017/06/08/occidental-petroleum-ceo-vicki-hollub/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">becoming</a> the first woman to lead a major American oil company. Her early years were marked by a collapse in crude prices, and Hollub was forced to cut costs and exit from noncore regions in the Middle East and North Africa. In Buffett’s interview with CNBC, he said that Hollub is “running the company the right way.”</p>



<p>Berkshire Hathaway’s relationship with Occidental <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1S61I3/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1S61I3/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">began</a> in 2019, when it committed $10 billion to the firm’s cash-and-stock bid for rival petroleum company Anadarko, and received the right to buy Occidental shares. Three years later, Berkshire Hathaway won regulatory approval to buy up to 50% of the company.</p>



<p>Mariani speculated that Berkshire Hathaway wants more oil exposure and went with a company it knew. “I’m just going to chalk it up to the fact that they have a history there for a number of years and are familiar with the company,” Mariani told <em>Fortune.</em></p>



<p>He added that Occidental’s differentiation from other oil and gas companies comes from its investment in carbon capture, or removing carbon dioxide from the environment, and specifically <a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsdirect-air-capture" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsdirect-air-capture" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">direct air capture</a>. While Mariani said that decarbonization is a costly process that will likely lose money for the next handful of years, Occidental could find a customer base with companies such as airlines that are trying to be “corporate citizens.”</p><p></p>



<p>Warren, the Morningstar analyst, said Occidental’s appeal is instead driven by Buffett’s desire to diversify his portfolio, and the fact that Berkshire Hathaway already has regulatory approval to scoop up more shares in Occidental. "The stuff that Berkshire buys in scale like this is more a function of what they can buy as opposed to huge preferences one way or another,” he told <em>Fortune.</em> “Their opportunity set is somewhat limited by the size of their portfolio.”</p>



<p>Despite Buffett’s interest in Occidental, its outlook isn’t entirely rosy. In early May, Morningstar <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/occidental-earnings-crownrock-transaction-should-still-close-not-until-third-quarter" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/occidental-earnings-crownrock-transaction-should-still-close-not-until-third-quarter" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">published</a> a research note lowering its fair value estimate of Occidental’s stock by 7% to $53 per share, reflecting lower oil prices. The analysts also cited the slow progress of Occidental’s planned <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/occidental-says-crownrock-deal-could-close-by-august-2024-05-08/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/occidental-says-crownrock-deal-could-close-by-august-2024-05-08/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">acquisition</a> of shale oil producer CrownRock, which it hopes to complete by August.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the Fortune Next to Lead newsletter to get weekly strategies on how to make it to the corner office. </p><a href="https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up for free</a><p> before it launches on June 24, 2024.</p></div></div>

<p><span>"Subway's all-new Dippers embody the changes Subway has made over the past few years by elevating our food and guest experience to better meet the needs of today's diner—balancing their love for the iconic footlong alongside our commitment to convenience, crave and value," Doug Fry, president of Subway North America, said in a statement. "Our guests devoured nearly 30 million Sidekicks since their debut in January and they will find all 33 flavor combinations of Dippers for $3 to be equally irresistible."</span></p>

<ol>
<li>Microsoft has launched its first crop of AI-powered PCs, called Co-Pilot PCs, which are designed to use the device rather than search the internet.</li>
<li>Microsoft expects to ship 50 million Co-Pilot PCs this year, which is a tiny fraction of the 242 million PCs shipped in 2023.</li>
<li>The Co-Pilot PCs will run a feature called Recall, which takes screenshots of the user's PC to create a searchable database of their history, but this feature has been temporarily removed due to privacy concerns.</li>
<li>The launch of Co-Pilot PCs comes ahead of Apple's expected announcement of its own AI features, which will be integrated into its devices.</li>
<li>The article raises questions about whether the benefits of AI-powered devices will be noticeable to users and whether they will be willing to upgrade their devices to take advantage of these features.</li>

    THE PUNCH WITH ITS FIRST CROP OF AI CO PILOTS, AND THE PC GOING  ON SALE TODAY. STEVE KOVACH JOINS US WITH MORE  ON THE AI RACE. >> THIS IS A BIG ONE. WE KNOW ABOUT THE AI APPS AND  SOFTWARE AFTER WEEKS OF  ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE BIGGEST  COMPANIES IN THE GAME, BUT  STARTING TODAY MICROSOFT IS  KICKING OFF THE ARTIFICIAL  INTELLIGENCE HARDWARE RACE  LAUNCHING A DOZEN MODELS OF AI  COMPUTERS MONTHS BEFORE APPLE  SWITCHES ON ALL THE AI FEATURES  YOU HEARD ABOUT LAST WEEK. BY THE WAY, PART OF THE PC PUSH  SAYING THE LATEST DEVICES  OUTPERFORM THE MAC, AND THEY  CALL IT CO-PILOT PLUS PCs, WHICH IS A CLEVER WAY OF SAYING THEY  ARE DESIGNED TO USE THE DEVICE  RATHER THAN THE SUBURB NET. THIS IS COMING FROM DIFFERENT  BRANDS, MICROSOFT, OF COURSE,  AND SAMSUNG, HP, DELL AND NOVO  AND OTHERS YOU ARE FAMILIAR  WITH. MICROSOFT SAID IT EXPECTED 50  MILLION CO-PILOT PCs WILL SHIP  THIS YEAR, AND 242 MILLION PCs  WERE SHIPPED IN 2023, SO THE AI  PCs WILL BE A TINY FRACTION OF  NEW COMPUTERS. WHAT CAN YOU EVEN DO ON A  CO-PILOT PC? THEY RUN A VERSION AI FEATURE  CALLED RECALL, BECAUSE OF  PRIVACY CONCERNS. RECALL TAKES SCREEN SHOTS EVERY  FEW SECONDS FROM YOUR PC TO  CREATE A SEARCHABLE DATABASE OF  YOUR HISTORY. WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG  THERE? SO THEY YANKED THAT FEATURE FOR  NOW. THESE PCs, THOUGH, STILL GOING  TO LAUNCH AHEAD OF APPLE, BUT  MISSING THAT KEY AI FEATURE. BY THE WAY, STILL NOT CLEAR IF  AI PCs, OR PHONES, IS ENOUGH TO  SPUR UPGRADES. SAME STORY WITH APPLE AND WHAT  IT ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK. >> YOU NEED TO GO FASTER WITH  ALL OF THIS STUFF, I THINK. >> WHAT DO YOU MEAN? >> I DON'T KNOW, I WANT IT NOW! >> YOU'RE BUYING ONE? >> NO, BUT I DROVE BY THE  MICROSOFT STORE ON THE WAY HERE. >> SO YOU'RE NOT BUYING ONE? >> NO. I DON'T NEED A COMPUTER RIGHT  NOW. >> YOU DON'T NEED AI? >> AN APPLE PHONE --  >> THAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING  ABOUT THE APPLE THING, THEY'RE  GOING WAY OLD SCHOOL, AND  THEY'RE DOING THAT PLANNED ON
U OPULSCENCE, THEY'RE DOING THAT. THE REAL QUESTIONS IS, ARE THESE FUTURES GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE  PEOPLE SAY, HMM, I DIDN'T NEED A PC THIS YEAR, BUT NOW I DO. >> MY INSTANT BIAS IS I DON'T  WANT TO BEBETA TERRSTER. >> BY THE WAY, THIS IS BETA, AND THAT RECALL FEATURE IS A TEST  FEATURE. SO YOU WILL BE BETA TESTER. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT. THIS IS MICROSOFT AND APPLE ARE  SAYING IT'S NOT GOING TO BE  PERFECT. IT WILL BE A WHILE BEFORE IT ALL SHAKES UP. >> AND ONE THING WHEN I SAY,  WOW, AI IS GREAT. >> RIGHT NOW, THE ANSWER IS NOT  TODAY. >> SHOULD I ASK YOU AI --  >> IT WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,  I'M SURE. DON'T ASK SIRI, WHO KNOWS WHAT  IT WILL TELL YOU. >> I FEEL BAD, I'VE BEEN SAYING  SUCH BAD THINGS ABOUT SIRI,  LATELY. >> IT'S WELL DESERVED. >> I KNOW. THEY'RE TRYING. >> THEY'RE TRYING.

    <div><p class="preview">Two years ago, Steve German was optimistic.</p><p class="preview">He'd done well for himself as a trial lawyer in Phoenix, suing insurance companies on behalf of workers who were denied benefits. And he'd just launched a venture with the Miami investment firm 777 Partners that he hoped would revolutionize the legal business.</p><p class="preview">Arizona had recently begun permitting nonlawyers to invest in law firms, which is banned in nearly every other state. German seemed poised to ride the wave of deregulation and build what he'd later describe as "generational wealth."</p><div class="premium-content"><p class="premium">State bar associations have long restricted lawyers from selling stakes in their firms to outside investors, out of a desire to protect consumers from bad advice, to keep financiers from distorting firms' ethical obligations to their clients — and to keep profits in the hands of lawyers. That meant that firms basically had to eat what they killed: Any investments in marketing, technology, or building cases had to come from client fees or the firm's cut of jury awards and settlements.</p><p class="premium">Allowing private-equity riches to pour into law firms looked like it could be a game changer. When he spoke with Business Insider <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-benefit-from-arizona-law-firm-ownership-structure-2022-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">in 2022</a>, German excitedly described how he might use 777's money to take lower fees and allow clients to designate charities they'd like to benefit. He was making connections with referral sources and said he'd hired BerlinRosen, one of the better-known public-relations firms that work with plaintiffs' lawyers.</p><p class="premium">"It was something that was revolutionary in many ways, and it was something I saw as a way to do good," German said. The firm, called Scout Law Group, was one of the first such firms — known as an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-benefit-from-arizona-law-firm-ownership-structure-2022-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">alternative business structure</a> — to be approved by state regulators.</p><p class="premium">"The ABS program reminds me of when Uber first came to town and everyone was like, 'Oh, my god, that's crazy,'" Andy Kvesic, who serves on the state committee that approves ABS applications, said.</p><p class="premium">German's optimism was short-lived. Before 2022 came to an end, his relationship with 777 had begun to sour amid disputes over funding. Now, German has become a vocal critic of Arizona's hands-off approach to regulating these new entities.</p><p class="premium">German said 777 didn't supply money on the terms or timeline it promised and planned. While he got some funding and was able to build a portfolio of about 300 to 400 cases, German said the millions that his partner had promised never flowed in. He had to whip out his own checkbook to pay vendors and employees, he said in a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24752517-german-v-scout-law-group-and-777-partners-et-al" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">lawsuit filed in April</a> alleging fraud, breach of contract, and unpaid wages. It's one of several lawsuits involving 777, which, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/30/2023/feds-probe-sports-investor-777-over-money-flows" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">Semafor,</a> has also been under Justice Department scrutiny.</p><p class="premium">777 has not yet filed an answer to German's complaint. The firm did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p class="premium">He first decided to resign from Scout last summer, a few months after the firm and its leaders filed licensing paperwork with state regulators that he said he now believed was incomplete. But he told BI that after he forwarded his "break-up letter" to state regulators, he came to regret the decision; it touched off a bar investigation and resulted, for a period, in the suspension of Scout's license. He ended up rescinding the resignation and sticking around until 777 picked a new compliance lawyer in December, he said.</p><p class="premium">After all that, he expected that the firm and its new leaders' license application would be closely scrutinized. He said the steady drumbeat of negative reporting made it clear that 777 hadn't been up front about the controversies it was involved in.</p><p class="premium">But, he said, the committee that reviews ABS applications renewed Scout's license with barely any discussion. German also sits on the committee, and he was recused from the decision. But he said that and subsequent board decisions, like giving a pass to a lawyer who failed to mention that he'd been suspended in another state, unsettled him.</p><p class="premium">"What we're doing is sending the wrong message," he said. "What we're saying is, don't disclose your bad stuff."</p><h2 id="36d168a2-3b57-4875-b8ab-b0c81b9db7d8" data-toc-id="36d168a2-3b57-4875-b8ab-b0c81b9db7d8" class="premium">Regulators approved 777 Partners despite litigation, DOJ probe</h2><p class="premium">German isn't the first business partner to sue 777 Partners, and he may not be the last. After the firm began investing in soccer clubs, Brazil's news outlet O Globo reported that one of its owners, Josh Wander, was on probation until 2018 for a cocaine-related charge. (At the time, 777 called it "ancient history.") The firm's reliance on insurance premiums, which are normally invested conservatively to ensure future claims can be paid, to fund its risky bets in sports teams and other speculative investments was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/15/2023/mystery-investor-777-partners-bought-european-sports-teams-with-insurance-customers-cash" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">unearthed</a> by Semafor, and insurance regulators and business partners have been asking questions and filing lawsuits.</p><p class="premium">But German said on some level, it's about more than money. Revelations about 777's other business lines — for instance, its work with online payday lenders that charge sky-high interest rates and pay Native American tribes to use their sovereign immunity as a legal shield — repulsed him when he learned about them in July after reading about the firm in the soccer publication Josimar, he said.</p><p class="premium">Asked how he didn't know about the controversies until 2023, German said he'd asked Steven Pasko, one of 777's principals, whether the firm was the subject of any lawsuits while he was filling out ABS licensing paperwork, and he had denied it. He said he still didn't know how the controversies didn't come to the attention of ABS committee staff.</p><p class="premium">"These people are the exact opposite of who should be approved," he said. "We're supposed to be looking out for the public interest, and we're letting in guys who are sued for RICO?"</p><p class="premium">The ABS committee's minutes <a target="_blank" href="https://www.azcourts.gov/Portals/26/ABS%20Regular%20Minutes.pdf" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">show</a> that Scout's renewal application passed 5-1, with two recusals and two absences. According to the committee's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.azcourts.gov/Portals/26/ABS%20Committee%20Annual%20Report%20to%20Supreme%20Court%20for%202023%20-%20FINAL.pdf" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">most recent annual report</a>, 25 new entities got a green light last year; one application was denied. The number of complaints jumped from zero in 2022 to 24 in 2023, though no discipline was imposed on any of the four entities that were the subject of complaints.</p><p class="premium">Lynda Shely, an Arizona legal-ethics lawyer who is also a member of the committee, said she would not comment specifically on German's dispute with 777 and Scout, which she has advised. She was also recused from the vote on Scout's renewal application. But she pushed back on the idea that Arizona was being too permissive, saying many applications didn't even make it to a vote because of the heavy scrutiny applied by committee staff. Funding and marketing firms were cutting deals with law firms in nonpublic arrangements for years before Arizona changed its rules, she added.</p><p class="premium">"There's a whole lot of disclosure that occurs through our model," she said. "There's more transparency about the relationship with an ABS."</p><p class="premium">As BI reported in 2022, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-benefit-from-arizona-law-firm-ownership-structure-2022-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Arizona's ABS structure</a> has unleashed a wave of experimentation. In some entities, lawyers and accountants are working side by side to serve clients better, and in others, technologists are helping traditional law firms work more efficiently, with the potential to share in the upside. Advocates see it as a way for lawyers to sell packages of valuable services, instead of selling billable hours.</p><p class="premium">But one of the most common uses of an ABS has been for personal-injury and mass-tort attorneys to team up with funders and marketers more directly than is possible under legal-ethics rules in other states.</p><p class="premium">Defenders of traditional law-firm structures say lawyers take an oath to do what's best for their clients. They argue that involving outside funders in firm management creates a risk that profits come first and clients come second.</p><p class="premium">But some advocates for systems like Arizona's say those risks can be managed by requiring lawyers to have the final say, keeping a close eye on the new firms, and taking complaints seriously. They say there's nothing wrong with lawyers using outside money to reach more injured clients, who may not know where to turn when facing medical bills from car wrecks and dangerous drugs.</p><p class="premium">"So far, it is a success," Shely said. As with any new initiative, she said, it "will have growing pains and need to adjust and tweak things as we go."</p><p class="premium">For much of 2023, German said, he expressed his discontent with 777's leadership, including its then-general counsel, Ed Gehres, and its chief financial officer, Damien Alfalla. He said he had conversations with other investors about buying 777's stake in Scout, but the talks ultimately went nowhere.

<ol>
<li>Bank of America Securities research analyst John Murphy is warning that traditional Detroit automakers - General Motors, Ford Motor, and Stellantis - should exit the Chinese market "as soon as they possibly can".</li>
<li>The warning comes amid unprecedented competition in China, the world's largest auto market, and as the country significantly increases vehicle production for Chinese consumers as well as for global exports.</li>
<li>Murphy is advising the automakers to focus on their core products and more profitable regions, rather than trying to compete in the highly competitive Chinese market.</li>
<li>Murphy has previously asked General Motors about exiting the Chinese market, indicating that he has been critical of the automaker's presence in the market for some time.</li>
<li>The analyst believes that the "D3" automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis) need to prioritize their core products and more profitable regions, rather than trying to compete in the highly competitive Chinese market.</li>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Apple is discontinuing its buy now, pay later service known as <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/apple-pay-digital-payments-visa-mastercard-affirm-d8e85a7d30c02523998dfbdd6f0b0497">Apple Pay Later</a></span> barely a year after its initial launch in the U.S., and will rely on companies who already dominate the industry like Affirm and Klarna. </p><p>It’s an acknowledgement from a company known for <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/apple-artificial-intelligence-siri-iphone-software-conference-4217d67977f95ead880835a71ecce098">producing hit products</a></span> that building a financial services business from scratch as Apple has been doing for several years is difficult and highly competitive. </p><p>Apple Pay Later launched with fanfare in March 2023 as a way for iPhone customers to split purchases of up to $1,000 into four equal payments with no fees or interest. The service was Apple’s answer to the growing popularity of buy now, pay later services globally, and considered a sizeable threat to companies like Klarna, Affirm and others. </p><p>But Apple Pay Later was only available where Apple Pay was accepted whereas the other buy now, pay later companies had deeply integrated themselves into millions of merchant websites.</p>
    

<p>In an acknowledgement of how popular buy now, pay later services had become, Apple said at its <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/apple-artificial-intelligence-siri-iphone-software-conference-4217d67977f95ead880835a71ecce098">developer’s conference this month</a></span> that it would start allowing banks to offer buy now, pay later plans to their customers through Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. Affirm would be integrated directly into Apple Wallet, and Apple customers would be able to open an Affirm account directly. </p>



<p>“With the introduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will no longer offer Apple Pay Later in the U.S.,” Apple said late Monday. “Our focus continues to be on providing our users with access to easy, secure and private payment options with Apple Pay, and this solution will enable us to bring flexible payments to more users, in more places across the globe, in collaboration with Apple Pay enabled banks and lenders.”</p>
    
<p>Apple executives as recently as this month had indicated that the company still had plans for Apple Pay Later despite announcing plans to integrate Affirm directly into Apple Wallet. </p>
    

<p>Apple Pay Later was unique because Apple needed to create its own bank to offer the loans. The Apple Card is issued by Goldman Sachs, which means Goldman ultimately decides who gets approved and what spending limits are for each customer. </p><p>Apple has discontinued any new Apple Pay Later loans, but customers who have existing Apple Pay Later loans will be able to manage them inside Apple Pay. </p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	The new <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/netflix-houses/" id="auto-tag_netflix-houses" data-tag="netflix-houses">Netflix Houses</a> will feature shopping outlets, eateries and experiential activities, building  on previous Netflix live experiences for <em>Bridgerton</em>, <em>Money Heist</em>, <em>Stranger Things</em>, <em>Squid Game</em>, and Netflix Bites, according to the company.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	“At Netflix House, you can enjoy regularly updated immersive experiences, indulge in retail therapy, and get a taste — literally — of your favorite Netflix series and films through unique food and drink offerings,” says Marian Lee, Netflix’s Chief Marketing Officer. “We’ve launched more than 50 experiences in 25 cities, and Netflix House represents the next generation of our distinctive offerings. The venues will bring our beloved stories to life in new, ever-changing, and unexpected ways.”

	</p>

<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Both locations will occupy former department stores at Galleria Dallas and King of Prussia Mall, each spanning footprints of more than 100,000 square feet. Outside of the venues will be sculptures and a mural mash-up of characters from popular Netflix titles. 

</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	“Imagine waltzing with your partner to an orchestral cover of a Taylor Swift song on a replica of the <em>Bridgerton</em> set –– and then walking around the corner to compete in the Glass Bridge challenge from <em>Squid Game</em>,” the company said. Visitors then can grab some food at a nearby restaurant “inspired by Netflix shows from around the world,” then head to shop where you can buy that <em>Stranger Things’</em> Hellfire Club T-shirt you’ve always wanted.”</p>

Tackling this problem is a key focus for Katie Rae, CEO and managing partner of The Engine Ventures, which makes early-stage investments in startups focused on sustainability, health and infrastructure. The tools we have today, she said, can’t fix the world’s environmental problems.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p class="article_paragraph_2"></p>
<p>“When you get right down to brass tacks, no one believes that we will reach our climate goal without developing new technology,” she told <em>Forbes</em>.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p><fbs-ad position="top" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-top"><p id="article-0-top"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>Today, The Engine Ventures announced a third fund of $398 million, its largest to date and nearly twice the $250 million fund <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/10/27/mit-enlists-harvard-to-launch-250-million-venture-fund-the-engine/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/10/27/mit-enlists-harvard-to-launch-250-million-venture-fund-the-engine/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/10/27/mit-enlists-harvard-to-launch-250-million-venture-fund-the-engine/" aria-label="it raised in 2020">it raised in 2020</a>. This raise brings the firm to over $1 billion in assets under management. The Engine has invested in over 50 companies to date, which have collectively raised over $5 billion in investment and have over 3,100 employees.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>
<p>The new fund will give Rae’s firm more flexibility in the size of the checks it writes for seed and series A rounds. “It means that you can really develop these companies into the B and C rounds where you definitively de-risk the technology and begin to scale,” she said.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p>
<p>The Engine was first created in 2016 as a spinout from MIT, with Rae as the founding CEO. The idea was to create a venture firm and accelerator for early-stage startups developing complex technology in climate tech, advanced computing and infrastructure systems as well as biotechnology. It has since built a 150,000 square-foot facility in Cambridge near the MIT campus that provides laboratory space, manufacturing technology and more for the accelerator.</p><blockquote class="embed-base quote-embed embed-9 bg-accent color-base font-accent font-size text-align"><p>“There’s a bipartisan understanding that we have to have a manufacturing base.”
</p><footer class="text-align">The Engine Ventures CEO Katie Rae</footer></blockquote>

<p class="article_paragraph_7"></p><p>In 2023, the firm split the accelerator and venture firm into two different companies. Rae, became CEO of The Engine Ventures, while still remaining on the board of The Engine accelerator. <a href="https://engineventures.com/reports/2023-tough-tech-landscape" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://engineventures.com/reports/2023-tough-tech-landscape" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://engineventures.com/reports/2023-tough-tech-landscape" aria-label="A report">A report</a> co-produced by The Engine and Pitchbook found that its investment market areas saw 21% compounded annual growth in financing between 2016 and 2023, compared to a 6% average for other sectors, though in 2023 they saw the same funding drop-off that other venture investment areas did.</p>
<p>A big driver of this growth, Rae said, has been a “major policy shift” by the federal government to bolster infrastructure and climate technology with measures like the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, which put more government funds behind these sectors and incentivize the private sector to do the same. “There’s a bipartisan understanding that we have to have a manufacturing base,” she said. “The capital stack is much stronger than it was 7 years ago.”</p>
<p>When it comes to climate tech, The Engine Ventures has a broad portfolio. It’s invested in Commonwealth Fusion, which is developing nuclear fusion technology. It’s also backed Form Energy, which is building iron-based batteries for the electrical grid, and VEIR, which is making superconducting wires that can transmit more electricity than copper.</p>
<p>The current AI boom–and the energy-hungry chips it depends on–is an area where Rae sees an opportunity to develop new classes of chipswith lower environmental and financial costs. There’s Celestial AI, for example, which is building chips based on energy-efficient light rather than electricity. It’s also invested in companies pushing the boundaries of quantum computing and other new hardware. “Power and climate and compute all go together,” she said.</p>
<p>Despite the breadth of its investments, Rae sees them all as being interconnected. Her portfolio company Vaxess, for example, is developing vaccine patches that don’t require refrigeration, improving both accessibility and sustainability. The lessons from the firm’s first two funds, Rae said, encourage taking even bigger swings at hard tech problems with its third. “Let's keep going and let's go even bigger because the potential capital returns and the impact returns are enormous,” she said.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-1"><p id="article-0-topx-1"></p></fbs-ad>

                    <p>Thank you for your introduction, Adam, and thank you for the invitation to speak here today. It is great to come to Peterson to discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy, which is my topic this afternoon.<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"></a></p>

<p>As I stand here today, inflation remains too high, but I am encouraged by the overall progress and trajectory. Recent data on the economy and inflation also give me cautious optimism that we are on track and making continued headway toward the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) inflation goal of 2 percent. That progress may have paused in the first three months of the year, but information since then on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation points to renewed progress.</p>

<p>Over the last year through April, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was 2.7 percent, down from 7.1 percent at its peak in 2022. Core PCE inflation—which excludes the volatile food and energy categories—was 2.8 percent through April, down from its peak of 5.6 percent. Based on consumer and producer price inflation for May released last week, I estimate that 12-month PCE inflation in May was a bit lower than in April. I was encouraged by some of the details of the recent reports, particularly the continued improvement in market-based services inflation, which is based on observation of actual market prices rather than imputed values. That's important because market-based prices are likely to be a better indication of the overall trend for core services inflation than nonmarket prices.</p>

<p>Housing services inflation, meanwhile, continues to be persistent. Market rents for new tenant leases have already cooled significantly, but further progress in overall housing services inflation will rely on the ongoing pass-through of the previous market rents deceleration to the rents of existing tenants with expiring leases.</p>

<p>So inflation is still too high, and further progress is likely to be gradual. However, there are several reasons why I remain optimistic that improving supply and cooling demand will support continued disinflation.</p>

<p>The first reason I am optimistic about further progress on inflation has to do with declining price increases and even declining prices as consumers become more price sensitive. I think of this from several, related angles—I will mention a few.</p>

<p>As I have discussed in previous speeches, reduced frequency of price adjustments helps moderate prices. And the frequency with which firms adjust prices, which accelerated to less than every five months in early 2022, moved closer to every seven months as of the end of 2023.<a href="#fn2" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"></a> Price adjustment frequency picked up some early this year, along with the temporary firming of inflation, but the general trend has been consistent with ongoing disinflation.</p>

<p>An additional basis for price-setting optimism is the fact that longer-run inflation expectations have remained well anchored. Research by the Richmond Fed has found that price-setting decisions by firms are related to their own expectations about the path of overall inflation, so anchored inflation expectations among firms are likely to result in price setting consistent with those lower price expectations.<a href="#fn3" title="footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="f3"></a></p>

<p>In addition, there may still be room for markups of prices over labor costs to continue falling. While markups are famously difficult to measure, rough, simple estimates of markups of prices over labor costs have fallen back from high levels but still remain above their pre-pandemic trend, especially in the goods sector.<a href="#fn4" title="footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="f4"></a> A return of markups to this trend could help ongoing progress toward 2 percent inflation.</p>

<p>A final factor for optimism about positive price-setting developments is the range of anecdotes from firms themselves. The most recent edition of the Fed's Beige Book suggests firms are increasingly attentive to consumers pushing back against additional price increases and that these businesses expect to increase prices only moderately in the near term. Beyond the Beige Book, I have gleaned from recent earnings reports by publicly traded companies that lower-income consumers are pulling back from their purchasing and that firms are responding by moderating price increases or, in some cases, actually cutting prices. What I have heard in my own conversations with business contacts is that consumers are "trading down" to lower-cost products and that firms are responding with more discounting. And some large retailers have publicly spoken about cutting prices in the face of resistant consumers. These various indicators—markups, price adjustment frequency, inflation expectations, and anecdotes from a range of sources—suggest that, on balance, price-setting behavior is likely to continue to move closer to consistency with the FOMC's inflation target.</p>

<p>A second reason for my optimism about continued disinflation is slower growth in the costs faced by businesses. Among those, nominal wages are a big part of total costs in the services sector. Nominal wage growth has continued to trend down, consistent with a labor market where supply and demand are coming into better balance. Of course, as a general matter, I want to see Americans experiencing strong wage growth, but for that wage growth to be sustainable, it must be consistent with our inflation target. Notably, as inflation has come down, real wages have been rising and now exceed pre-pandemic levels, which means that the purchasing power of workers has also been increasing. But at the same time, we have seen slowing growth in nominal labor costs. For example, the 12-month increase in average hourly earnings has been running just above 4 percent over the past couple of months after peaking at around 6 percent in 2022 and falling more or less steadily since then. The latest readings compare with an average of around 3 percent a year before the pandemic, when inflation was running below our 2 percent goal. Wage moderation is especially evident in some service sectors for which labor is a large share of costs. If this moderation in wage growth continues, it will soon be at levels consistent with price stability. And I note that the market-based services inflation measure I mentioned earlier tends to move closely with wage growth.</p>

<p>Other developments in labor markets also point toward continued resilience, but there are signs of gradual cooling and continued wage moderation. Gains in payrolls averaged 218,000 over the past two months, which is a solid pace. But most other indicators point to a slow but steady easing of the labor market, supported by cooling demand for hiring as well as strong supply.</p>

<p>In terms of demand, both the job openings rate and the hiring rate have come down from their highs of late 2021 and early 2022. The job opening rate is not far above its pre-pandemic range, and the hiring rate is below pre-pandemic. Surveys of business hiring intentions likewise suggest cooler demand for workers. On the supply side, we have seen notable growth in labor supply over the past year. Labor force participation among prime-age women, in particular, reached another all-time record in May. And the strong inflows of immigrants I have discussed in previous speeches have continued this year, which points to continued labor supply growth as recent immigrants gradually make their way into the labor market.</p>

<p>With cooling demand and solid supply, measures of labor market tightness have continued to ease. The unemployment rate has been gradually rising and reached 4 percent in May, still very low in historical terms and the 30th straight month at 4 percent or lower. Another indicator of labor market tightness, the ratio of job vacancies to the number of people counted as looking for work, crossed an important threshold in April. After rising as high as 2 vacancies for each person seeking a job during the pandemic, that ratio fell to 1.2, which was the level before the pandemic. Another indicator of labor market tightness, the rate of people voluntarily quitting their jobs, is actually below the pre-pandemic level. The average duration for job vacancies is down, and it is becoming easier for employers to fill jobs. We policymakers like to make our judgments based on a preponderance of the data, and a preponderance of the labor market data indicates that labor market supply and demand are coming into better balance.</p>

<p>A third reason for my optimism about achieving 2 percent inflation is that I am also cautiously optimistic about productivity growth, which is a source of supply expansion that is likely to put downward pressure on inflation without slower economic growth. One factor is the remarkable rise in the rate of new business creation, which started early in the pandemic and has continued, more or less, even through last month.<a href="#fn5" title="footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a><a name="f5"></a> Economic research finds that while many new and young firms struggle to survive, a small subset of new firms are highly productive and grow rapidly, eventually making significant contributions to aggregate productivity.<a href="#fn6" title="footnote 6"><sup>6</sup></a><a name="f6"></a> And the pandemic-era business creation surge has been particularly strong in high-tech sectors, such as computer systems design and research and development services.<a href="#fn7" title="footnote 7"><sup>7</sup></a><a name="f7"></a> Some recent history favors a payoff to productivity growth from this surge in entrepreneurship. Before the jump in productivity growth in the late 1990s through the early 2000s, there was a similar wave of strong business entries in high-tech industries.<a href="#fn8" title="footnote 8"><sup>8</sup></a><a name="f8"></a> I suspect that most of the productivity benefits of the recent entry surge are still ahead of us.</p>

<p>Another basis for productivity optimism is the prospect for widespread implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in its various forms. To be sure, there is tremendous uncertainty around the future path of AI and its effects on the economy, and we must all think carefully about how it may affect workers and the kinds of tasks they perform. But AI technology has the potential to make workers and firms more productive—effectively boosting aggregate supply. Of course, many technologies can take a long time to show through to aggregate productivity. The spread of electrification more than a century ago required complementary assets like power lines and appliances to be created and installed. But I suspect that AI may diffuse more quickly, in part because many of the complementary assets needed for the initial spread of AI—such as computers, networks, and the like—are already in place, even while there is still an enormous amount of additional hardware buildout still ahead of us. And survey data from the Census Bureau suggest that firms in many sectors are already employing AI.<a href="#fn9" title="footnote 9"><sup>9</sup></a><a name="f9"></a> Only time will tell, of course, but the prospect of higher productivity growth raises the possibility that inflation can fall without a significant slowdown in economic activity and employment.</p>

<p>My fourth and final reason for optimism on inflation is that I believe the current stance of monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to help cool the economy and bring inflation back toward 2 percent without a sharp contraction in economic activity or a significant deterioration of the labor market. Interest rates remain elevated relative to a year ago, and certainly relative to two or three years ago, and are restricting economic activity. Of course, some aspects of financial conditions, such as house prices and, especially, stock prices, remain robust; and credit is still generally available, though high interest rates make borrowing expensive. These factors likely have some distributional implications: Higher-income people with large stock portfolios may not feel that conditions are so restrictive, while lower earners who need to borrow to buy a house or a car do not need to be told that finances are tight.</p>

<p>But the overall restrictiveness of financial conditions is apparent in interest rate–sensitive sectors. For example, the level of residential investment in the first quarter—though showing some modest improvement relative to last year's pace—was still roughly 15 percent below its peak in 2021. Business investment in equipment contracted a bit in 2023 and showed only tepid growth in the first quarter of this year. And while consumption growth has been resilient over the past couple of years, fueled in part by excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and solid real wages that now exceed pre-pandemic levels, it slowed noticeably in the first quarter, especially for spending on goods. Indeed, high interest rates have left a mark on consumer assessments of buying conditions for motor vehicles and other large durable goods, which often have to be financed.<a href="#fn10" title="footnote 10"><sup>10</sup></a><a name="f10"></a></p>

<p>The effects of restrictive financial conditions are also evident in labor markets. As I discussed earlier, the labor market has cooled gradually, and, looking ahead, I expect some cooling of economic activity to continue. But I am watching closely for any signs of labor market deterioration that may take hold, as the FOMC also pays attention to the other side of our mandate.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my optimism about the economic outlook, I am mindful of a number of risks to both sides of the dual mandate. On the inflation side, the resurgence of import prices at the beginning of the year is concerning, even if import prices came down some last month, and could anticipate greater pressure on goods prices in the coming months. Goods prices have been a key source of disinflation over the past year or so, as supply chains have healed. While supply chains appear to have been fairly resilient to a series of shocks since the end of last year—including attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and low water levels in the Panama Canal—geopolitical developments in Ukraine and the Middle East still could lead to a sharp rise in global energy and food prices and disrupt global supply chains. Another risk I am focused on is that a further cooling of the U.S. economy could lead to a sharp deterioration in labor market conditions. Output growth appears to have slowed in the first half of this year, and while consumer spending still grew in the first quarter, the May retail sales report we received this morning may be another signal that the long-expected deceleration in consumer spending may finally be upon us. After a considerable decline in job vacancies, firms facing decreasing demand might increasingly resort to laying off workers. Lastly, I also see risks to the global economy that could spill back to the U.S. economy. While growth in some countries—notably in Europe—appears to be picking up from a soft patch last year, that pickup remains tentative. And the latest data from China suggest that economic momentum there has slowed considerably amid a continuing real estate crisis.</p>

<p>Let me now turn to the implications of my economic outlook for monetary policy. While I remain cautiously optimistic that inflation is coming down, it is still too high, and it is moving down only slowly. I believe that policy has more work to do, which is why I supported the FOMC's decision last week to keep the federal funds rate in a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. We need to see more progress toward 2 percent inflation before I will have confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward that objective. For the reasons I have outlined today, I believe economic conditions are moving in the right direction. If the economy evolves as I am expecting, it will likely become appropriate to begin easing policy sometime later this year. But, as always, my judgment will be guided by the data.</p>

<p>Let me conclude by acknowledging that the surge in inflation over the past few years means that prices are now significantly higher than they were just a few years ago, even as the rate of price increases has slowed dramatically since mid-2022. While I am heartened by data showing that nominal wages are now growing at a faster rate than prices, I know many Americans are still struggling with high costs. I also know that many Americans are facing high borrowing costs. That's why I will be watching the data carefully in the months ahead to ensure that we are on track to achieve both sides of our dual mandate.</p>

For example, the ratio of the producer price index (PPI) for final demand goods to the employment cost index for private goods industries rose roughly 20 percent from the end of 2020 to the middle of 2022. In services, this ratio rose roughly 5 percent. The ratios for both sectors have come down from their peak levels but were still above their end-2020 levels as of the first quarter of this year—and they had been on downward trends before the pandemic. Similar analysis using PCE prices instead of PPI yields a qualitatively similar result for goods industries, though, in services, the PCE price-to-wage ratio has been roughly flat. <a href="#f4">Return to text</a></p>

    <div><section class="content__body"><p>A former CNBC analyst who ended up on the FBI's Most Wanted list for white-collar crimes was arrested over the weekend after being charged with defrauding investors, federal prosecutors announced Monday.   </p><p>James Arthur McDonald, 52, of California, was a frequent guest on CNBC and the CEO and chief investment officer of the companies Hercules Investments LLC and Index Strategy Advisors Inc. </p><p>According to an indictment from a federal grand jury, McDonald allegedly lost tens of millions of dollars of Hercules client money after adopting a risky short position that "effectively bet against the health of the United States economy in the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election" in late 2020, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/former-financial-tv-news-analyst-turned-fugitive-arrested-federal-indictment-charging" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Justice Department officials said in a news release</a>. The predicted market decline did not happen, causing clients to lose between $30 and $40 million. </p>    
  <p>McDonald's compensation from Hercules Investments was primarily based on a percentage of assets he was managing, prosecutors said, meaning that the company's losses in the light of McDonald's short positions "significantly decreased the fees" he was able to collect. </p><p>In early 2021, McDonald allegedly solicited millions of dollars in funds from investors as part of a capital raise for Hercules Investments. He allegedly misrepresented how the funds would be used, telling investors he would launch a mutual fund, and failed to disclose the investment company's losses the previous year. </p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/18/0136eabc-bac6-4163-831f-e2403e376001/thumbnail/620x726/661f1ccbd260b842187c6458e69881af/screen-shot-2024-06-18-at-2-38-33-pm.png?v=5842509bb796a146f9b20d3e8b03dac6#" alt="screen-shot-2024-06-18-at-2-38-33-pm.png " srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/18/0136eabc-bac6-4163-831f-e2403e376001/thumbnail/620x726/661f1ccbd260b842187c6458e69881af/screen-shot-2024-06-18-at-2-38-33-pm.png?v=5842509bb796a146f9b20d3e8b03dac6 1x"></span>

McDonald spent $174,610 of that at a Porsche dealership; more than $100,000 was transferred to the landlord of a home McDonald was renting; and nearly another $7,000 was spent on a website selling designer menswear, prosecutors said. </p>

<p>McDonald also allegedly falsely represented clients to Index Strategy Advisors, and sent clients there false account statements that misrepresented how much money was in their accounts. </p><p>McDonald became a fugitive in late 2021 when he failed to appear before the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, prosecutors said. McDonald had been called before the commission to testify in response to allegations he had defrauded investors. </p><p>In September 2022, the SEC filed a civil complaint charging McDonald and Hercules Investments with violating federal securities law. The filing found that McDonald was liable for $3,810,346 in net profits gained because of alleged misconduct. A <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wcc/james-arthur-mcdonald-jr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">federal arrest warrant was filed then</a>, but McDonald remained on the run. </p><p>McDonald allegedly told one person he planned to "vanish," according to court documents, and closed out his phone and email accounts.</p>

<p>In January 2023, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles returned an indictment charging him with one count of securities fraud, one count of wire fraud, three counts of investment adviser fraud, and two counts of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from unlawful activity. </p><p>Over the weekend, he was arrested by the FBI at a home in Port Orchard, Washington. </p><p>McDonald made his first appearance in the United States District Court in Tacoma, Washington, but will be brought to Los Angeles to face federal charges in the coming weeks. </p><p>If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for each count of securities fraud and wire fraud, up to 10 years on the monetary transactions derived from unlawful activity count, and up to another five years for the count of investment advisor fraud. </p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shares of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (DJT) fell nearly 10% on Tuesday, continuing a decline that started after the conviction of former President Donald Trump, who is the majority shareholder of the company.</li>
<li>The stock closed at $31.31 on Tuesday on higher-than-average trading volume of 7.52 million shares.</li>
<li>The decline in stock price comes as investors may be exercising stock warrants, which were set to expire on June 18. The company recently announced that the SEC had declared its registration effective, making warrants eligible for cash exercise.</li>
<li>The company also amended its registration statement to warn investors that it has limited ability to prevent Donald Trump from using other social media platforms besides Truth Social.</li>
<li>The stock has fallen about 40% since May 30, when Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>NJ Transit rail services into and out of Penn Station in New York have resumed after a brief suspension due to Amtrak overhead wire issues and a disabled train.</li>
<li>Commuters can expect up to 45-minute delays due to the earlier suspension and are being advised to use alternative transportation such as buses and PATH trains, with rail tickets being cross-honored.</li>
<li>This is not the first time NJ Transit has been affected by Amtrak overhead wire issues, with a similar incident occurring in May that resulted in delays and cancellations of over 160 trains.</li>
<li>In response to the May incident, Governor Phil Murphy wrote a letter to Amtrak expressing his concerns about the impact of these issues on New Jersey residents, citing how they "disrupt the quality of life" for those who rely on the service.</li>
<li>Additionally, commuters in New Jersey are facing a 15% fare hike beginning on July 1, which may add to the stress and inconvenience caused by the rail disruptions.</li>
