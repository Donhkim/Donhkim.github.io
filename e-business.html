    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The US May jobs report showed a significant increase in jobs, with a 272,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls, but a loss of 408,000 jobs according to the household survey.</li>
<li>The difference between the two surveys lies in the methodology: the payroll establishment survey collects data from larger companies, while the household survey collects data from individuals and families.</li>
<li>The household survey has traditionally been more accurate in measuring small businesses and has shown a much slower rate of job growth over the past year, with only a 31,000 increase in jobs.</li>
<li>Key labor market indicators, such as the employment-to-population ratio, have declined, with the ratio falling to 60.1% in May. The labor force also shrunk by 250,000, and the unemployment rate rose to 4%.</li>
<li>The article suggests that the employment-population ratio is a better indicator of labor market strength than traditional measures, and notes that the ratio is lower than its historical peak of 64.6% in May 2000, indicating that more people should be working.</li>

<li><strong>FDA expands approval of GSK's RSV vaccine</strong>: The Food and Drug Administration has expanded the approval of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, known as Arexvy, to protect adults aged 50-59 who are at increased risk of severe illness from the virus.</li>
<li><strong>New population protected</strong>: With this expansion, the vaccine is now the first cleared by the FDA to protect this age group from RSV, in addition to the previously approved elderly population (60+ years old).</li>
<li><strong>High-risk population</strong>: Adults aged 50-59 with underlying chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and congestive heart failure are at high risk of severe illness from RSV, with approximately 13 million Americans in this age group at risk.</li>
<li><strong>Simple administration</strong>: GSK's shot provides simplicity for pharmacists and healthcare professionals, as it can be administered to a wider population, making it a convenient option for healthcare providers.</li>
<li><strong>RSV a significant public health concern</strong>: RSV causes thousands of hospitalizations and deaths among seniors each year, and can also cause severe illness in adults 50 and up, or even younger individuals, with underlying chronic conditions.</li>

Side effects included fatigue, headache and muscle pain, among others, which were mostly mild to moderate in severity. </p><p>A single dose of GSK’s shot was only slightly less effective in adults 60 and up after two seasons of the virus, showing <a href="https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-shares-positive-data-for-arexvy-its-respiratory-syncytial-virus-older-adult-vaccine-indicating-protection-over-two-rsv-seasons/" target="_blank">67.2% efficacy</a> against lower respiratory tract illness. Dormitzer said the company will test the vaccine’s efficacy over three RSV seasons to see if it can provide even longer protection. </p><p>GSK is also studying Arexvy in other patient groups to expand the shot’s reach in the future. The company is expected to announce trial data later in 2024 on two separate patient groups: people ages 18 to 59 who are at increased risk of severe RSV, and adults with weakened immune systems.</p><p>Dormitzer added that the company is also expanding the shot’s reach in other countries. Regulatory agencies in Europe, Japan and other areas are currently reviewing GSK’s application to expand Arexvy’s approval to high-risk adults ages 50 to 59. </p><p>GSK’s shot is approved in nearly 50 countries, a spokesperson for the company told CNBC.  </p></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

Synapse fired the last of its employees on May 24.</p><p>Still, some customers whose funds were held at banks in what’s called demand deposit accounts have already begun getting access to accounts, she said.</p><p>But users whose funds were pooled in a communal way known as for benefit of, or FBO, accounts, will have a harder time getting their money. A full reconciliation will take weeks more to complete, she said.</p><p>In her report, McWilliams presented several options for Judge Martin Barash to consider at a Friday hearing that will allow at least some FBO customers to regain access to their funds.</p><p>The options include paying some customers out fully, while delaying payments to others, depending on whether the individual FBO accounts have been reconciled.

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — New vehicles sold in the U.S. will have to average about 38 miles per gallon of gasoline in 2031 in real-world driving, up from about 29 mpg this year, under new federal rules unveiled Friday by the Biden administration.</p><p>The final rule will increase fuel economy by 2% per year for model years 2027 to 2031 for passenger cars, while SUVs and other light trucks will increase by 2% per year for model years 2029 to 2031, according to requirements released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p><p>The final figures are below a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vehicle-fuel-economy-requirement-nhtsa-epa-85e4c3b7bbba9a9a9b7e5b117fe099bd">proposal released last year</a></span>. Administration officials said the less stringent requirements will allow the auto industry flexibility to focus on electric vehicles, adding that higher gas-mileage requirements would have imposed significant costs on consumers without sufficient fuel savings to offset them.</p>
    

<p>President Joe Biden has set a goal that <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-business-climate-and-environment-f145b24414ff245f491fd68257b3db60">half all of new vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2030</a></span> are electric, part of his push to fight climate change. Gasoline-powered vehicles make up the largest single source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>The 50% sales figure would be a huge increase over current EV sales, which accounted for 7.6% of new vehicle sales last year.</p>



<p>Even as he promotes EVs, Biden needs cooperation from the auto industry and political support from auto workers, a key political voting bloc, as the Democratic president seeks reelection in November. The United Auto Workers union has endorsed Biden but has said it wants to make sure the transition to electric vehicles does not cause job losses and that the industry pays top wages to workers who build EVs and batteries.</p>
    
<p>Biden’s likely opponent, former President Donald Trump, and other Republicans have <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-china-electric-vehicles-tax-credit-31e0eca67c6a3ae9ca5a773a1ade9447">denounced Biden’s push for EVs as unfair for consumers</a></span> and an example of government overreach.</p><p>The new standards will save almost 70 billion gallons of gasoline through 2050, preventing more than 710 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by midcentury, the Biden administration said.</p>
    

<p>“Not only will these new standards save Americans money at the pump every time they fill up, they will also decrease harmful pollution and make America less reliant on foreign oil,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. “These standards will save car owners more than $600 in gasoline costs over the lifetime of their vehicle.”</p><p>The highway safety agency said it has sought to line up its regulations so they match new <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/epa-electric-vehicles-emissions-limits-climate-biden-e6d581324af51294048df24269b5d20a">Environmental Protection Agency rules that tighten standards for tailpipe emissions</a></span>. But if there are discrepancies, automakers likely will have to follow the most stringent regulation.</p><p>In the byzantine world of government regulation, both agencies essentially are responsible for setting fuel economy requirements since the fastest way to reduce greenhouse emissions is to burn less gasoline.</p><p>Fuel economy figures used by The Associated Press reflect real-world driving conditions that include factors such as wind resistance, hills and use of air-conditioning. Because of those factors, the real-world numbers are lower than mileage figures put forward by NHTSA.</p>
    

<p>New passenger cars would have to average nearly 49 miles per gallon in 2031 under the new rule, up from about 36.5 miles per gallon this year.</p><p>“These new fuel economy standards will save our nation billions of dollars, help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and make our air cleaner for everyone,’' said NHTSA Deputy Administrator Sophie Shulman.</p><p>John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a leading industry group, said the Biden administration “appears to have landed on a CAFE rule that works with the other recent federal tailpipe rules.’' Bozzella was using an acronym for the fuel standards, which are officially known as the corporate average fuel economy rules.</p><p>Dan Becker at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, slammed the new rules as inadequate.</p><p>The highway safety agency is supposed to set strong standards for gas-powered vehicles, he said, “but instead it sat on its tailpipes, leaving automakers free to make cars, SUVs and pickups that will guzzle and pollute for decades to come and keep America stuck on oil.’'</p>
    

<p>The administration “caved to automaker pressure, with a weak rule requiring only a 2% improvement’’ per year in fuel economy, Becker said, adding that the rule falls short of the agency’s own requirement to set fuel-economy standards at the maximum technologically feasible level.</p><p>Bozzella, the industry official, said the government soon might need to reconsider whether the fuel-economy standards are needed “in a world rapidly moving toward electrification” of the vehicle fleet.</p><p>The mileage standards are “a relic of the 1970s,″ Bozzella said, “a policy to promote energy conservation and energy independence by making internal combustion vehicles more efficient. But those vehicles are already very efficient. And EVs don’t combust anything. They don’t even have a tailpipe.″</p>
    

<p>Chris Harto, senior policy analyst for Consumer Reports, said the NHTSA rules were not strong enough to pressure automakers to ensure new vehicles are as efficient as possible.</p><p>“Today the administration is merely checking the box on the legal requirement’’ to set fuel-economy standards, he said, adding that NHTSA is hamstrung by statutory limitations that prevent it from explicitly considering EVs in setting mileage standards. </p><p>“It’s likely that this important consumer protection program will become increasingly irrelevant as EV sales continue to grow,’' Harto said.</p>

<p>After the market’s close, Nvidia’s 10-for-1 stock split, which was announced in May during the company’s most recent <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-earnings-stock-split-jensen-huang-blackwell-ai/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-earnings-stock-split-jensen-huang-blackwell-ai/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">earnings call</a>, went into effect. But it will do little to change the company’s <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-stock-apples-3-trillion-valuation/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-stock-apples-3-trillion-valuation/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">$3 trillion valuation</a> or its underlying fundamentals, which so far, have investors licking their chops. </p>



<p>“You and I know that a stock split is just cosmetic, at least it is for existing shareholders,” says Paul Meeks, a veteran tech investor and business school professor at military college The Citadel. “With their investor relations routine, Nvidia is well aware they have to keep on throwing a few bones out there” to investors.</p>



<p>Few other companies have embodied the new corporate hierarchy pecking order ushered in by the proliferation of AI quite like Nvidia has. The company’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-05/a-year-and-2-trillion-later-nvidia-stock-remains-irresistible" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-05/a-year-and-2-trillion-later-nvidia-stock-remains-irresistible" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">stock</a> rose 3,174% over the last five years and 218% in just the last year. During its epic run, Nvidia’s <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/nvidia-stock-outlook-market-cap-10-trillion-cuda-software-impenetrable-moat/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/nvidia-stock-outlook-market-cap-10-trillion-cuda-software-impenetrable-moat/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">market cap soared</a> past the likes of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Alphabet</a>. Before the 10-for-1 split, the stock was at a stratospheric $1,209. </p>



<p>That price was likely too high for most investors, certainly the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/24/nvidia-stock-split-10-for-1-nvda-share-outlook-beating-sp500/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/24/nvidia-stock-split-10-for-1-nvda-share-outlook-beating-sp500/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">retail investors</a> the split was meant to attract, according to Humayun Sheikh, CEO of startup Fetch.ai, which provides developer tools specifically for AI. “The stock split enhances Nvidia’s appeal by making shares more affordable, thus broadening its investor base,” he said. </p><p></p>



<p>Sheikh too sees the move, at least partially, about investors’ perceptions, saying it was likely “influenced by optics” and could accelerate market cap gains. </p>



<p>Nvidia’s position as the firm that has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nvidia-artificial-intelligence-chips-stock-market-value-f1d89b8ec62f3a8556e332a46c39507c" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://apnews.com/article/nvidia-artificial-intelligence-chips-stock-market-value-f1d89b8ec62f3a8556e332a46c39507c" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">cornered the market</a> on providing AI developers all the chips and computing power they need isn’t changing because of the stock split. In the first quarter, Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/technology/nvidia-quarterly-earnings-results.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/technology/nvidia-quarterly-earnings-results.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">sales rose 262%</a> annually to $26 billion, outperforming Wall Street’s already lofty expectations. </p>



<p>Nvidia’s stock rally also serves as a hint at what the AI boom could still have in store. </p>



<p>“Nvidia’s change in price over the last year is telling us something about the market, namely, that perhaps AI is the new general purpose technology, like the internet or electricity, which will have massive productivity implications across the economy, and therefore AI companies will benefit greatly,” said NYU business school professor Vasant Dhar. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What could potentially go wrong with Nvidia’s stock split? </strong></h3>



<p>Still, investors are considering a few scenarios in which things might go south for them after the stock split, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidias-business-is-booming-heres-what-could-slow-it-down-fd5ffa14" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidias-business-is-booming-heres-what-could-slow-it-down-fd5ffa14" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">even</a> as they admit the odds are slim.</p><p></p>



<p>For Meeks, the only thing that could halt Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-can-rally-30percent-thanks-to-lead-in-ai-chips-bank-of-america-says-.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-can-rally-30percent-thanks-to-lead-in-ai-chips-bank-of-america-says-.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">march to the top</a> is an economy-wide slowdown, which he considers unlikely because he expects the U.S. will avoid a recession and that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in early 2025. In fact, he’s already thinking about Nvidia’s performance should the economy improve. </p>



<p>“It’d be hard for these stocks to lose their gains if all of a sudden we go from wind in our face with high rates to wind at our back with low rates,” Meeks said. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Sheikh said the retail investors the split was meant to attract are another possible, but unlikely, concern. Individually, retail investors may hold small amounts of Nvidia stock. But collectively, they can make up a significant portion of shares. So any shocks to the system or unexpected changes in their views on the company can still have a notable effect. One need look no further than <a href="https://fortune.com/company/gamestop/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/gamestop/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">GameStop</a> to understand the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-03/roaring-kitty-reddit-post-could-spell-485-million-paper-fortune" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-03/roaring-kitty-reddit-post-could-spell-485-million-paper-fortune" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">outsize influence</a> retail investors can have on the market. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>Reducing the stock to one-tenth of its price could be a double edged sword. “This approach might appeal to Robinhood-type investors or meme stock enthusiasts,” Sheikh added. “However, if the narrative turns against Nvidia and speculative traders start selling off, it could impact the price negatively.” </p>



<p>But even if that unwelcome scenario were to happen it wouldn’t change all the market trends propping up the chipmaker. </p><p></p>



<p>“Nvidia already had a huge run up in price, so any tailwind from a stock split will be miniscule in comparison to the ‘fundamental’ reasons for its performance,” Dhar said.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the future of business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/eye-on-ai?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=eye_on_ai" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/eye-on-ai?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=eye_on_ai" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Antitrust lawsuit against Google</strong>: The Justice Department and eight states are suing Google over an alleged adtech monopoly, seeking to break up the company's dominance in the industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trial by jury</strong>: The government's lawyers had initially sought a trial by jury, which could lead to unpredictable outcomes, but the lawsuit will now be heard by a judge this fall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google's response</strong>: Google has filed a cashier's check for $2.3 million to cover triple the monetary damages requested by the government, plus interest, as a show of good faith and to avoid a jury trial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Settlement possibility</strong>: If the government is successful in its lawsuit, it could increase the likelihood of a settlement being reached between the parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact on Google</strong>: If the government succeeds in its lawsuit, it could lead to significant changes in Google's business practices and potentially even break up the company's dominance in the adtech industry.</p>

The current AI boom played a big role in the massive loss. Samsung has historically been the world leader in making high-bandwidth memory chips — the kind that are in demand right now to power next-gen generative AI features. However, last year’s decline was partly because Samsung wasn’t prepared for increased demand, allowing local rival <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-21/samsung-replaces-chip-division-chief-as-it-tries-to-catch-hynix">SK Hynix to take the top spot</a>.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">South Korea is no stranger to labor movements, but this strike is also significant simply <em>because</em> it’s Samsung. The company as a whole is responsible for <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1314374/south-korea-samsung-groups-revenue-as-a-share-of-gdp/">roughly 20 percent of South Korea’s GDP</a>. If Samsung sneezes, the whole country gets a cold. Furthermore, Samsung has a <a href="https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/899427">decadeslong history</a> of illegal union busting. In 2020, Lee Jae-yong — then heir, now executive chair of Samsung Electronics — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/business/samsung-lee-apology.html">issued an apology</a> and promised to end the company’s “no-union management” policies. How it handles the conflict going forward will be a direct test of that commitment.</p></div></div>

<p>PORTLAND, Ore. (<a href="https://www.koin.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.koin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KOIN</a>) – Costco Wholesale has issued a voluntary recall of its 32 oz. twin-pack package of Tillamook Colby Jack and Tillamook Monterey Jack slices after finding “a very small quantity of gray and black plastic pieces” in the Monterey Jack cheese.</p>





<p>“In an abundance of caution and as part of our commitment to product quality and safety at the highest levels, we are voluntarily taking action to remove this product from the marketplace,” the wholesale retailer said in a letter to customers. “If you still have this item, please refrain from consuming it and return the package to your local Costco for a full refund. If you have already consumed the product without issue, you do not need to take any action, as the likely presence of the foreign plastic material is very minimal.”</p>



<p>The impacted product has a “best if used by” date of Oct. 22, 2024 and was produced “only for locations in the Northwest region.”</p>



<p>Those with additional concerns may contact Tillamook directly.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bain Capital’s bid weighs in at $22.80 per share in cash, representing a 37% premium on PowerSchool’s May 7 closing share price of $16.64 — the date when rumors <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/acquisitions/2024/bain-capital-explores-6-billion-deal-for-powerschool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emerged</a> that Bain Capital was eyeing an acquisition. These rumors also surfaced as PowerSchool reported <a href="https://uk.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-powerschool-sees-16-yoy-revenue-growth-in-q1-2024-93CH-3484457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong Q1 2024 earnings</a>, with revenues up 16% year-on-year to $185 million, and analysts predicting the company would reach profitability this year.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">With take-private deals such as this, it’s all about spotting companies with potential and helping them reach that potential away from the pressures of the public markets. That is what Bain is doing here with its majority investment in PowerSchool.</p>

	
	

<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">
</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“As demand for K-12 educational technology grows, we believe there are significant opportunities to expand access to PowerSchool’s best-in-class product suite around the world,” Bain Capital partner Max de Groen said in a statement.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">There has been a spate of similar deals so far in 2024. Last month, U.K. private equity firm Permira <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/13/permira-is-taking-squarespace-private-in-6-6-billion-deal/">revealed it was doling out $6.9 billion</a> to take Squarespace private. Elsewhere, Thoma Bravo said it was taking cybersecurity company Darktrace private <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/26/thoma-bravo-to-take-uk-cybersecurity-company-darktrace-private-in-5b-deal/">in a $5 billion deal</a> and paying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/01/thoma-bravo-takes-critical-event-management-software-company-everbridge-private-in-1-5b-deal/">$1.8 billion</a> for critical event management software company Everbridge. Revenue optimization platform Model N <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/08/vista-equity-partners-to-take-revenue-optimization-platform-model-n-private-in-1-25b-deal/">is also being taken private</a> by Vista Equity Partners for $1.25 billion.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bain Capital said it expects to close the PowerSchool acquisition in the second half of 2024, subject to the usual regulatory and shareholder approvals. Existing investors Vista and Onex will retain minority investments in PowerSchool once the deal concludes.</p>

    <div><div class="ArticleBody-articleBody" id="RegularArticle-ArticleBody-5" data-module="ArticleBody"><span hidden="" aria-hidden="true" class="ArticleBody-extraData"><span hidden="" aria-hidden="true" class="ArticleBody-extraData"><span hidden="" aria-hidden="true" class="xyz-data">There’s no shortage of affection for Club holding Nvidia on Wall Street. But Broadcom , our other artificial intelligence chipmaker, has received its fair share of love in recent days, with analysts wisely making the case that there’s more upside to be had for the stock. Broadcom’s fast-growing AI exposure featured prominently in optimistic research sent to clients this week by analysts at Melius, Bernstein and JPMorgan. Broadcom sells both networking products that stitch together parts of the data centers where AI computing occurs and helps tech giants, like Club name Alphabet , design custom AI processors. JPMorgan upped its growth forecast for the custom AI chip market and said Broadcom’s dominance in the space is poised to continue. Also this week, Bernstein chip analysts sent a presentation to clients that outlined why Broadcom is one of their best ideas, citing its AI opportunity and attractive valuation, among other reasons. The party kicked off Monday, when Melius initiated coverage of Broadcom with a price target that implied around 40% upside, labeling it “one of the must-own AI stocks.” The Club agrees, which is why we added Broadcom to the portfolio in late August — some nine months ago. The attractiveness of its networking and custom chip operations has only strengthened since then, as the pace of investment in AI has remained fervent. Even though the stock has climbed around 60% since our initiation, its best days are ahead. Our current price target is $1,550 per share, with a 2 rating , meaning we’d be buyers on a pullback. About 78% of the Wall Street analysts covering Broadcom have a buy-equivalent rating on the stock, with an average price target of roughly $1,563, according to FactSet, representing more than 11% upside to Thursday’s close. AVGO YTD mountain Broadcom’s year-to-date stock performance. The latest upbeat batch of Wall Street commentary comes ahead of Broadcom’s fiscal 2024 second-quarter results after Wednesday’s market close. Investors will be intently focused on the growth of the company’s AI semiconductor revenue. Back in March, the company reported that line item quadrupled to $2.3 billion in its first quarter. At the time, management also hiked its full-year outlook for the business, saying it was poised to be roughly 35% of semiconductor revenue, or more than $10 billion. Previously, Broadcom forecasted it to be around 25% of chip sales. Broadcom is a sprawling enterprise, with an increasingly sizable software business – thanks in large part to last year’s VMWare acquisition – that complements its traditional hardware business. Significant parts of that hardware business, namely the parts serving legacy markets like broadband and wireless, have been under pressure in recent quarters. The growth of its AI revenues has allowed investors to look past the legacy struggles, with hopes that those lagging areas will eventually return to growth. AI operations at Broadcom fall into two main buckets. The first is networking, which covers a portfolio of products including Ethernet switches and adapters used in data centers to connect tons of high-performance servers together ensuring smooth and efficient data communication. Essentially, these networking chips help make up the plumbing of data centers. Large cloud-computing providers and companies that operate their own data centers are key customers of these networking products. The second line of Broadcom’s AI business is custom processors, where the company is best-known for co-designing Alphabet’s tensor processing units, or TPUs. Google-parent Alphabet and Broadcom have collaborated on the creation of the AI chips for years, with the sixth-generation TPU being announced last month . Broadcom recently won the contract to co-design the seventh iteration of the chip, which is targeted for production in 2026, JPMorgan told clients in this week’s note. More and more tech giants are looking to design in-house chips, and portfolio holding Meta Platforms is believed to be another customer of Broadcom’s custom silicon business, according to JPMorgan. Amazon and Microsoft also have custom chips, though both of those Club names are thought to utilize Marvell Technology ’s co-design services, according to the JPMorgan analysts. JPMorgan recently raised its outlook for the custom chip market to between $20 billion and $30 billion, with the high end of the range increased by $5 billion. The analysts see it growing at a 20% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR. Currently, Broadcom has an estimated 55% to 60% market share, with Marvell at roughly 13% to 15%, according to JPMorgan. While Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Club name Microsoft remain big buyers of so-called merchant silicon – these are processors from the likes of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices – custom AI chips are becoming an increasingly important part of their computing strategies, too. Such chips can be cheaper and designed to do certain tasks well. The AI chips made by market leader Nvidia and rival AMD are more general purpose. Put the networking and custom silicon pieces together, and there’s a lot to like about Broadcom’s standing in the field of AI tech stocks. We recognize Broadcom’s networking operations compete against Nvidia’s own business and the chips it helps tech giants develop also represent competition for the Jensen Huang-led firm. But given the size of the AI market, there is room for both as analysts at Melius argued this week. “Nvidia should be AVGO’s biggest rival in accelerators and networking … but we believe both can win,” the Melius analysts wrote. We share that view — and intend to stay invested accordingly. (Jim Cramer’s Charitable Trust is long NVDA, AVGO, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL and META. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

<p>Mike Lynch, founder and CEO of Autonomy, has been acquitted of criminal fraud and conspiracy charges arising from the 2011 sale of the British software company to Hewlett-Packard.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a federal court jury in San Francisco cleared Lynch of all 15 charges – 14 counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy. Co-defendant Stephen Chamberlain, formerly VP of finance at Autonomy, was also acquitted. A charge of securities fraud was tossed during the trial by the judge.</p>
<p>In 2018, the US Justice Department <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-autonomy-ceo-charged-wire-fraud">alleged</a> that Lynch and Chamberlain unlawfully ballooned Autonomy's value prior to its acquisition.</p>

    

<p>The Feds claimed the pair "artificially inflated Autonomy’s revenues by backdating written agreements to record revenue in prior periods" and made false statements to auditors and regulators, all leading to HP allegedly vastly overpaying for Autonomy.</p>

        


        

<p>Meanwhile, the now-former chief exec argued during his trial that he was just the tech and marketing guy, a smart and savvy entrepreneur rather than a master manipulator of finances, and that if there were any problems with Autonomy's numbers, the IT titan should have spotted and pulled those up during the takeover bid.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote">

<p>I am elated with today's verdict and grateful to the jury for their attention to the facts over the last ten weeks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lynch, who was <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/michael-richard-lynch-former-ceo-autonomy-corporation-makes-appearance-federal-court">extradited</a> from the UK to the US last year after lengthy legal resistance, has for years maintained his innocence, claiming that he was being made a scapegoat for the failed acquisition. Chamberlain also denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In a statement to <em>The Register</em>, Dr Lynch said, "I am elated with today's verdict and grateful to the jury for their attention to the facts over the last ten weeks. My deepest thanks go to my legal team for their tireless work on my behalf. I am looking forward to returning to the UK and getting back to what I love most: My family and innovating in my field."</p>
<p>HP paid $11 billion for Autonomy, an enterprise search firm, but within a year wrote down the deal <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/11/20/hp_alleges_autonomy_fraud/">by $8.8 billion</a>. Meg Whitman, CEO of HP at the time, said a senior executive on Lynch's team had made claims about accounting irregularities and that the American IT giant had referred the matter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the UK Serious Fraud Office.</p>

        

<p>Years of legal wrangling followed. HP shareholders <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/11/27/hp_sued_by_investor/">sued</a> in 2012. In 2015, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/03/31/hp_autonomy_lawsuits/">HP sued</a> Lynch and Sushovan Hussain, former Autonomy CFO, in the High Court of England and Wales. Lynch responded by filing a $150 million countersuit for defamation.</p>

<p>In 2022, HPE – which inherited the civil litigation after HP split into HPE and HP Inc – prevailed in that British civil case and is presently <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/12/hpe_autonomy_damages/">seeking $4 billion</a> in damages.</p>
<p>The UK's Serious Fraud Office opened an inquiry in 2013, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sfo.gov.uk/2015/01/19/hp-autonomy/">dropped it in 2015</a> to allow US authorities take over the case.</p>
<p>The Feds in 2017 indicted Hussain on fraud charges and secured a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-autonomy-cfo-convicted-wire-fraud">conviction in 2018</a>. He was <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-autonomy-cfo-sentenced-60-months-prison">sentenced</a> to five years in prison the following year and was released in January, 2024 having served his time.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote">

<p>The evidence presented at trial demonstrated conclusively that Mike Lynch is innocent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christopher Morvillo and Brian Heberlig, attorneys for Lynch, celebrated the jury's verdict in a statement.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled with the jury's verdict, which reflects a resounding rejection of the government's profound overreach in this case," said Morvillo and Heberlig.</p>
<p>"The evidence presented at trial demonstrated conclusively that Mike Lynch is innocent. This verdict closes the book on a relentless 13-year effort to pin HP's well-documented ineptitude on Dr Lynch. Thankfully, the truth has finally prevailed. We thank Dr Lynch for his trust throughout this ordeal and hope that he can now return home to England to resume his life and continue innovating."</p>

        

<p>“We’re grateful to the jury for carefully paying attention to the evidence and allowing Mr. Chamberlain to return home to his family,” added Gary Lincenberg, an attorney with Bird, Marella, Rhow, Lincenberg, Drooks &amp; Nessim, LLP, who represented Chamberlain, in an email to <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>The US Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ®</p>
