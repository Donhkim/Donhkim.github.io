                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-electric-vehicles-imports-3d1f4ef984b18bb6e86274e65bcfdf2e">slapped major new tariffs</a></span> on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminum and medical equipment on Tuesday, taking potshots at Donald Trump along the way as he embraced a strategy that’s increasing friction between the world’s two largest economies.</p><p>The Democratic president said that Chinese government subsidies ensure the nation’s companies don’t have to turn a profit, giving them an unfair advantage in global trade.</p><p>“American workers can outwork and outcompete anyone as long as the competition is fair,” Biden said in the White House Rose Garden. “But for too long, it hasn’t been fair. For years, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese companies ... it’s not competition, it’s cheating.”</p><p>The tariffs come in the middle of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024">a heated campaign</a></span> between <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden">Biden</a></span> and Trump, his Republican predecessor, to show who’s tougher on China. In a nod to the presidential campaign, Biden recognized lawmakers from Michigan in his remarks and spoke about workers in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all battleground states in November’s election.</p>
    

<p>Asked to respond to Trump’s comments that China was eating America’s lunch, Biden said of his rival, “He’s been feeding them a long time.” The Democrat said Trump had failed to crack down on Chinese trade abuses as he had pledged he would do during his presidency.</p>
    
<p>Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s press secretary, called the new tariffs a “weak and futile attempt” to distract from Biden’s own support for EVs in the United States, which Trump says will lead to layoffs at auto factories.</p><p>The Chinese government was quick to push back against the tariffs, saying they “will seriously affect the atmosphere of bilateral cooperation.” The foreign ministry used the word “bullying.”</p><p>The tariffs are unlikely to have a broad inflationary impact in the short term because of how they’re structured, some not to take effect until 2026, but there could be price increases in the meantime for EV batteries, solar and some other specific items.</p>
    

<p>Biden administration officials said they think the tariffs won’t escalate tensions with China, yet they expect China will explore ways to respond to the new taxes on its products. It’s uncertain what the long-term impact on prices could be if the tariffs contribute to a wider trade dispute.</p><p>The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminum and more. There are currently very few EVs from China in the U.S., but officials worry low-priced models made possible by Chinese government subsidies could soon start flooding the U.S. market.</p>



<p>Chinese firms can <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-byd-auto-seagull-auto-ev-cae20c92432b74e95c234d93ec1df400">sell EVs for as little as $12,000</a></span>. China’s solar cell plants and steel and aluminum mills have enough capacity to meet much of the world’s demand, with Chinese officials arguing their production keeps prices low and would aid a transition to the green economy. </p><p>China’s commerce ministry said in a statement that the tariffs were “typical political manipulation” as it expressed its “strong dissatisfaction” and pledged to “take resolute measures to defend its rights and interests.”</p>
    

<p>Under the findings of a four-year review on trade with China, the tax rate on imported Chinese EVs will rise to 102.5% this year, up from total levels of 27.5%. The review was undertaken under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the government to retaliate against trade practices deemed unfair or in violation of global standards.</p><p>Under the 301 guidelines, the tariff rate is to double to 50% on solar cell imports this year. Tariffs on certain Chinese steel and aluminum products will climb to 25% this year. Computer chip tariffs will double to 50% by 2025.</p><p>For lithium-ion EV batteries, tariffs will rise from 7.5% to 25% this year. But for non-EV batteries of the same type, the tariff increase will be implemented in 2026. There are also higher tariffs on ship-to-shore cranes, critical minerals and medical products.</p>
    

<p>The new tariffs, at least initially, are largely symbolic since they will apply to only about $18 billion in imports. A new analysis by Oxford Economics estimates the tariffs will have a barely noticeable impact on inflation by pushing up inflation by just 0.01%.</p><p>The Chinese EV maker BYD has explored the possibility of opening factories in Mexico for the Mexican market, possibly creating a way to ship goods into the United States. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said she was talking with industry and workers about the possibility and to “stay tuned.”</p><p>The auto industry is still trying to assess the impact of the tariffs. But at present, it appears they could be assessed on only two Chinese-made vehicles, the Polestar 2 luxury EV and potentially Volvo’s S90 luxury gas-electric hybrid midsize sedan.</p>
    

<p>“We’re still reviewing the tariffs to understand exactly what’s affected and how,” said Russell Datz, spokesman for Volvo, a Swedish brand now under China’s Geely group. A message was left seeking comment from Polestar, which also falls under Geely.</p><p>The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said the U.S. is trampling on the principles of a market economy and international economic and trade rules. </p><p>“It’s a naked act of bullying,” Wang said. </p><p>The Chinese economy has been slowed by the collapse of the country’s real estate market and past coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, prompting Chinese President Xi Jinping to try to jumpstart growth by ramping up production of EVs and other products, making more than the Chinese market can absorb.</p><p>This strategy further exacerbates tensions with a U.S. government that claims it’s determined to strengthen its own manufacturing to compete with China, yet avoid a larger conflict.</p><p>“China’s factory-led recovery and weak consumption growth, which are translating into excess capacity and an aggressive search for foreign markets, in tandem with the looming U.S. election season add up to a perfect recipe for escalating U.S. trade fractions with China,’’ said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University.</p><p>The Europeans are worried, too. The EU launched an investigation last fall into Chinese subsidies and could impose an import tax on Chinese EVs.</p><p>After Xi’s visit to France last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that government-subsidized Chinese EVs and steel “are flooding the European market” and said, “The world cannot absorb China’s surplus production.’’</p><p>Biden’s administration views China, with its subsidies of manufacturing, as trying to globally control the EV and clean-energy sectors, whereas the administration says its own industrial support is geared toward ensuring domestic supplies to help meet U.S. demand.</p><p>“We do not seek to have global domination of manufacturing in these sectors, but we believe because these are strategic industries and for the sake of resilience of our supply chains, that we want to make sure that we have healthy and active firms,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. </p><p>The tensions go far beyond a trade dispute to deeper questions about who leads the world economy as a seemingly indispensable nation. China’s policies could make the world more dependent on its factories, possibly giving it greater leverage in geopolitics. At the same time, the United States says it’s seeking for countries to operate by the same standards so competition can be fair.</p><p>China maintains the tariffs are in violation of the global trade rules the United States originally helped establish through the World Trade Organization. It accuses the U.S. of continuing to politicize trade issues and on Friday said the new tariffs compound the problems caused by tariffs the Trump administration previously put on Chinese goods, which Biden has kept.</p><p>Those issues are at the heart of November’s presidential election, with a bitterly divided electorate seemingly united by the idea of getting tough with China. Biden and Trump have overlapping but different strategies.</p><p>Biden sees targeted tariffs as needed to defend key industries and workers, while Trump has threatened broad 10% tariffs against all imports from rivals and allies alike.</p><p>Biden has staked his presidential legacy on the U.S. pulling ahead of China with its own government investments in factories to make EVs, computer chips and other advanced technologies.</p><p>Trump tells his supporters America is falling further behind China by not betting on oil to keep powering the economy, despite its climate change risks. The ex-president may believe tariffs can change Chinese behavior, but he believes the U.S. will be reliant on China for EV components and solar cells.</p><p>“Joe Biden’s economic plan is to make China rich and America poor,” he said at a rally this month in Wisconsin.</p><h2>__</h2><p>AP autos writer Tom Krisher contributed to this report from Detroit.</p>

The increase mostly stemmed from a jump in mortgage balances, which rose $190 billion from the previous quarter to $12.44 trillion at the end of March. </p><p>Auto loan balances rose slightly by $9 billion, continuing the upward climb seen since 2020, and now stand at $1.62 trillion. But credit card balances fell by $14 billion to $1.12 trillion – near a record high – as consumers worked to pay down their debt following the holiday shopping season. </p> <p><a href="https://foxbusiness.com/economy/americans-expect-high-inflation-stick-around-latest-ny-fed-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>AMERICANS EXPECT HIGH INFLATION TO STICK AROUND IN LATEST NY FED SURVEY</u></strong></a></p> <div class="inline image-ct"> <div class="caption"><p><span>A new Biden administration rule has created an $8 ceiling for credit card late fees.</span><span> (Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images / Getty Images)</span></p></div></div><p>The report also showed a notable increase in the number of borrowers who are struggling with credit card, student and auto loan payments. </p><p data-unit-credible=",," data-in-article="true" class="credible"></p><p>As of March, about 3.2% of outstanding debt was in some stage of delinquency, up from the 3.1% recorded the previous quarter but still down from the average 4.7% rate seen before the <a href="https://foxbusiness.com/category/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>COVID-19 pandemic</u></a> began. The transitions into delinquency, particularly serious delinquency in which a balance is more than 90 days overdue, rose across all debt types.</p><p>"In the first quarter of 2024, credit card and auto loan transition rates into serious delinquency continued to rise across all age groups," said Joelle Scally, regional economic principal within the Household and Public Policy Research Division at the New York Fed. "An increasing number of borrowers missed credit card payments, revealing worsening financial distress among some households."</p><p>Credit card delinquencies continued to rise from their pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter. In fact, the percentage of credit card balances in serious delinquency climbed to its highest level since 2012.</p><p><a href="https://foxbusiness.com/economy/small-businesses-are-racking-up-credit-card-debt-raising-some-concerns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SMALL BUSINESSES ARE RACKING UP CREDIT CARD DEBT, RAISING SOME CONCERNS</strong></a></p><p>The rise in debt is particularly concerning because <a href="https://foxbusiness.com/economy/fed-likely-trigger-recession-higher-interest-rates-research-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interest rates</a> are astronomically high right now. The average credit card annual percentage rate, or APR, is hovering around 20.66%, near a record high, according to a Bankrate database that dates back to 1985.

For instance, if you owe $5,000 in debt – which the average American does – current APR levels would mean it would take about 277 months and $7,723 in interest to pay off the debt making the minimum payments. </p><div class="inline image-ct"> <div class="caption"><p><span>If people are carrying debt to compensate for steeper prices, they could end up paying more for items in the long run.</span><span> (iStock / iStock)</span></p></div></div><p><a href="https://foxbusiness.onelink.me/Zkcx?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxbusinesssaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxbusiness.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</u></strong></a></p><p>The rise in balances comes after the <a href="https://foxbusiness.com/category/the-fed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Federal Reserve</u></a> raised interest rates to a 23-year high in a bid to crush inflation and cool the economy. </p><p>Although <a href="https://foxbusiness.com/economy/cpi-inflation-september-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>inflation has cooled</u></a> considerably in recent months, it remains up 3.5% compared with the same time one year ago, according to the most recent Labor Department data.</p><p>The inflation spike has created severe financial pressures for most U.S. households, which are forced to pay more for everyday necessities like food and rent.

On the important core measure that excludes food and energy, the respective projections are 0.3%, lower than March’s 0.4% gain, and 3.6%, which is down from 3.8%.</p><p>In remarks made Tuesday in Amsterdam, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/14/powell-says-inflation-has-been-higher-than-thought-and-expects-rates-to-hold-steady.html">Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed hope</a> that inflation would decelerate through the year but acknowledged the slow progress and provided further direction that rates aren’t likely to move anytime soon.</p><p>“I expect that inflation will move back down on a monthly basis to levels that were more like the lower readings we were having last year,” he told attendees at a banking conference. “I would say my confidence in that is not as high as it was, having seen these readings in the first three months of the year. So we’re just going to have to see where the inflation data fall out.”</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline0"></a>Wholesale gauge brings bad news</h2><div class="group"><p>Keeping with the higher-than-expected readings in the first quarter, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/14/ppi-report-wholesale-prices-rose-0point5percent-in-april-more-than-expected.html">producer price index rose 0.5%</a> in April, nearly double the expectation to kick off the second quarter on a sour note. The index, a proxy for wholesale prices, accelerated 2.2% on an annual basis, the highest reading in a year.</p><p>It also heightened the importance of Wednesday’s CPI release. The Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics will provide the data at 8:30 a.m. ET.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>“This will be the most important read of the month [excluding nonfarm payrolls] as inflation continues to defy expectations,” said Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America. Even if the report comes in around consensus expectations, it will be “inadequate progress for the Fed to consider a cut until September,” he added.</p><p>Indeed, financial markets have given up hope on an accommodative Fed, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/02/wall-street-is-confused-and-divided-over-how-many-times-the-fed-will-cut-rates-this-year.html">reducing expectations</a> from the start of the year of at least six rate cuts now down to two, with the first one unlikely to come before the September meeting.</p><p>Stocks, though, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/13/stock-market-today-live-updates.html">have been resilient</a> in the face of a tighter Fed, with the focus instead turning to solid corporate earnings and economic growth.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline1"></a>Focus on housing</h2><div class="group"><p>Wall Street will pore through the CPI report looking for signs of how much longer the elevated inflation conditions will continue. Sentiment surveys in recent days have shown that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/13/inflation-outlook-rises-fueled-by-expected-increases-for-housing-costs-new-york-fed-survey-shows.html">consumer expectations for inflation</a> have risen, which the Fed considers key in taming price pressures.</p><p>One crucial focus Wednesday will be on housing, as shelter-related costs comprise about one-third of the weighting in the CPI. Fed officials have been banking on easing pressures in the rental market as a sign that the strong disinflation present during 2023 would appear again this year, but have so far been thwarted.</p><p>“The slower it comes down, the longer the path towards the Fed’s inflation target,” said Erica Groshen, senior economist at Cornell’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations and a former senior official with both the BLS and New York Fed. “We’re not seeing any big shifts in the housing market that would make me think it’s just now going to act differently. Demographics are slow to change. So I don’t really see an explanation for housing to react very differently than it has in the past.”</p><p>The key component of shelter costs is called owners’ equivalent rent, a hypothetical measure of what owners think they can get to rent their homes. It rose 5.9% annually <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=EeZ4" target="_blank">in March</a>, down from a peak of above 8% in April 2023 but still well above a level consistent with 2% overall inflation.</p><p>While Fed officials had been willing to look through housing costs when considering policy, continued stickiness in prices could change that. Central bankers had even come up with a separate measure known as “super core” that looked at services costs excluding food, energy and housing services, but that may not be as relevant now.</p><p>“It’s very important for the Fed not to be behind the curve on this,” Groshen said. “So I think it will make the Fed more cautious about lowering rates. I don’t think this would be enough for them to raise rates, but it probably will feed caution on their part.”</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Don’t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO</h2></div></div></div></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

"We get different shades from the same spice by doing something to the spice." </b></p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">In other words, you can roast the spices or grind them into powders. The diversity of their flavours is mind-boggling. Indian spices enhance pickles and season meat. They flavour savouries and street food. Zesty spices energise local fruit drinks and add a tangy twist to fruits and salads.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Unsurprisingly, India has emerged as a global spice powerhouse. It exports more than 200 spices and value-added products to some 180 countries, worth $4bn (£.1bn), according to the Spices Board of India. The domestic market alone is worth a staggering $10bn, making it the world's largest consumer of spices.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">But now, concerns are emerging regarding the safety of these renowned spices. Last month, Singapore and Hong Kong halted sales of some spices produced by Indian companies MDH and Everest over suspected elevated levels of ethylene oxide, a cancer-causing pesticide. </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">That's not all. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is also investigating products from the two popular brands for potentially containing the pesticide, an FDA spokesperson told Reuters. An analysis done by the news agency of the US regulatory data found that since 2021, an<a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/before-global-scrutiny-indian-spice-maker-mdh-faced-many-us-rejections-2024-05-12/" class="sc-8fed6dee-0 gPEPzk"> average of 14.5% of US shipments of MDH spices were rejected</a> due to presence of bacteria. Both brands insist that their products are safe.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">The European Union (EU) has raised concerns of its own, discovering the same cancer-causing substance in <a target="_blank" href="https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2024.8753" class="sc-8fed6dee-0 gPEPzk">samples of chilli peppers and peppercorns from India</a>.

For one, both the brands are popular and trusted ones. Delhi-based MDH, an iconic 105-year-old family-run firm, offers a range of more than 60 blended and ground spices. The 57-year-old Everest Food Products, launched by a spice trader, claims to be India's "largest manufacturer of pure and blended spices", exporting to over 80 countries. Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, Bollywood superstars, have served as Everest's brand ambassadors.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">To be sure, this is not the first time Indian spices have been found to be contaminated. In 2014, Ipsita Mazumdar, a biochemistry expert, tested popular spice brands in Kolkata which made chilli, cumin, curry powder, and garam masala. She found lead in the food colouring used to give the spices vibrant orange or red hues. And more recently in April, food and drugs control authorities in Gujarat seized more than 60,000kg of adulterated spices - chilli powder, turmeric and coriander power and pickle masala. </p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 esMqKN"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-83607862-1 ijYvQn"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/13EFC/production/_133306618_mediaitem133306617.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/13EFC/production/_133306618_mediaitem133306617.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/13EFC/production/_133306618_mediaitem133306617.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/13EFC/production/_133306618_mediaitem133306617.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/13EFC/production/_133306618_mediaitem133306617.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/13EFC/production/_133306618_mediaitem133306617.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/13EFC/production/_133306618_mediaitem133306617.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/13EFC/production/_133306618_mediaitem133306617.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Reuters A view of the logo of MDH, an Indian spice manufacturing company, on a shop in the old quarters of Delhi, India, May 3, 2024." class="sc-83607862-0 jvrVsN"><span class="sc-83607862-2 jPBxZH">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 cvIHve"><figcaption class="sc-d523993f-0 ibDkCb">Delhi-based MDH, an iconic 105-year-old family-run firm, offers a range of more than 60 spices</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">So are Indian spices safe? The federal government has instructed all state governments to conduct quality tests. The Spices Board - which has five quality evaluation labs - has issued guidelines to exporters to check for use of ethylene oxide. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is also testing samples. </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">India's health ministry <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-adopts-stringent-norms-for-maximum-pesticide-residues-limit-in-food-items-government/article68142118.ece" class="sc-8fed6dee-0 gPEPzk">claims</a> the country has one of the world's strictest Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) standards, with pesticides' MRLs varying by food commodity and determined through rigorous risk assessments. But something is clearly amiss: in 2022, the FDA highlighted inadequate sanitary facilities, accommodation, and equipment cleanliness standards at a premier Indian spice plant.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">"India has been a spice exporter for centuries. But this image has been declining in the last few years, with the government's inadequate attention. We do not yet know at which stage the contamination is happening. Ethylene oxide is not used by farmers. It is most probably a post-harvest, post-processing residue," says Narasimha Reddy Donthi, an independent researcher and environmental justice activist.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">"It is not only the negative attention. Repeated cases of excessive residues can have a long-term effect. In the past, mango exports to the US suffered for years due to pesticide residues," Mr Reddy adds.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) believes the recent quality concerns could threaten half of India's spice exports due to "cascading regulatory actions in many countries".</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">If China questions the quality of Indian spices, over half of India's global exports could be affected, joining five other countries, the GTRI said in a recent report. "The situation could worsen if the EU, which regularly rejects Indian spice consignments over quality issues, follows suits." </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">For spice enthusiasts in the West, the origin of the spices in their food remains unclear.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">"I don't think most people are aware of where their spices come from. I certainly don't, and I use spices a lot! I live a few blocks from Chicago's main Indian shopping district, Devon Avenue, which is where I buy my spice. l assume they come from India but have never looked into this," Colleen Taylor Sen, an author specialising in Indian cuisine, told me.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">In the end, experts say, India must fundamentally overhaul its approach to food safety, prioritising transparency, stringent enforcement and clear communication to safeguard the integrity of its exports. </p></div></article></div>

The Olympics start in mid-July and Peacock plans to raise the price of all plans by $2 per month around the same time on July 18. The most basic Peacock package, Peacock Premium with ads, will jump to $8 per month, while the “mostly” ad-free Peacock Premium Plus will soon set customers back $14 per month.</p><p class="sc-166b7vj-0 eEDRKr js_ymal-below-post" data-vtas-click="inner:Recommendation:ymal-below-post"></p><p class="sc-7pt2sm-0 kGSzqB js_more-below-post" data-vtas-click="inner:Recommendation:more-below-post"></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">What kind of discount will Comcast customers see with StreamSaver? Again, we don’t know how much you’ll be able to save, and Roberts insists it will be a “vastly reduced price,” but we’re just cynical enough that we wouldn’t be surprised to see the “discount” exist as little more than the difference between the pre-July price for Peacock and the new price. We’ll simply have to wait and see.<br></p></div></div></div>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><figure class="caas-figure"></figure><p>Renewable energy stocks surged higher Tuesday after <strong>Plug Power</strong> <span class="ticker">(NASDAQ: PLUG)</span> announced receipt of <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/05/14/why-shares-of-plug-power-are-skyrocketing-today/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=aacda787-d4dc-4982-bfb0-e51a90cc874a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a $1.66 billion loan guarantee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0">a $1.66 billion loan guarantee</a> from the U.S. Department of Energy. Plug currently has two hydrogen fuel facilities producing at full capacity, with a third approaching that mark. Plug says the government assistance will help it to "finance the development, construction, and ownership of up to six green hydrogen production facilities" -- although it's not 100% clear whether it was including its first three facilities in this tally.</p><p>Either way, Plug's news inspired investors to snap up shares of similar <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/renewable-energy-stocks/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=aacda787-d4dc-4982-bfb0-e51a90cc874a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:green energy stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="0">green energy stocks</a> that might be able to attract some federal assistance of their own. As of 1 p.m. ET, shares of <strong>FuelCell Energy</strong> <span class="ticker">(NASDAQ: FCEL)</span> stock were up by an astounding 32.4%, and <strong>Bloom Energy</strong> <span class="ticker">(NYSE: BE)</span> gained 7.9%. <strong>Clean Energy Fuels</strong> <span class="ticker">(NASDAQ: CLNE)</span>, which provides renewable natural gas and filling stations for alternative-fuel heavy vehicles, was up by 10.5%.</p><h2>Plug's plans</h2><p>Plug hailed the Department of Energy award as "a major milestone in the U.S.'s commitment to advance the development of large-scale hydrogen production, processing, delivery, and storage," saying it "also underscores the application of green hydrogen to help meet decarbonization goals across multiple sectors of the economy."</p><p>This doesn't guarantee that other loan subsidies for its peers are in the offing. But it does suggest Plug's award is part of a larger policy that could benefit FuelCell, Bloom, and Clean Energy Fuels.</p><h2>Should you buy FuelCell, Bloom Energy, or Clean Energy Fuels?</h2><p>That being said, it's worth pointing out -- and repeating -- that despite nearly three decades of investing in fuel cell technology, Plug Power has never earned a profit from selling hydrogen fuel or hydrogen fuel cells.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bumble, a popular dating app company, ran a billboard ad campaign that was heavily criticized for shaming women who are not sexually active and mocking those who choose celibacy.</li>
<li>The ads featured messages such as "You know full well a vow of celibacy is not the answer" and "Thou shalt not give up on dating and become a nun," which were seen as disrespecting people's personal choices.</li>
<li>The company apologized for the ads, stating that they were an attempt to connect with a community frustrated by modern dating, but ended up having the opposite effect.</li>
<li>Bumble has since removed the ads and will be donating to organizations that support women, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline.</li>
<li>The company has pledged to partner with organizations that promote healthy relationships and individual choices, and will be contributing to causes that support women's rights and well-being.</li>

    <div><div class="ezrichtext-field"><p>HONG KONG -- Alibaba Group Holding's shares plunged over 8% during Tuesday morning trading in New York despite the Chinese e-commerce giant reporting that first-quarter sales beat expectations.</p><p>Alibaba turned in better-than-expected revenue for the January-March period, with a 7% increase on the year to 221.87 billion yuan ($30.6 billion).</p><p>But net income decreased 96% to 919 million yuan, due to a net loss on investments in listed companies. Alibaba's preferred measure of profit, non-GAAP profit, which excludes non-operational items, decreased 11%.</p><p>Alibaba also announced on Tuesday that the long-delayed conversion of its listing in Hong Kong to primary status will be completed by the end of August.</p><p>If converted, the company could be included in Hong Kong's Stock Connect scheme, which allows investors from mainland China to trade Hong Kong-listed stocks. Alibaba announced in July 2022 that it was applying for a primary listing in Hong Kong in addition to its New York listing but said four months later that the conversion would not be completed as originally scheduled.</p><p>Since the start of the year, Alibaba's shares have risen just 9%, while those of rival Tencent Holdings have climbed around 30%.</p><p>Alibaba announced plans last year to split the conglomerate into six main business units and pursue separate initial public offerings for most of them. However, one year on, none of these units has been listed and the plans for the first three businesses to go public have changed.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p><p>The company also underwent personnel overhauls, including the departure of former chief executive Daniel Zhang.</p><p>In the March quarter, Alibaba's primary source of revenue -- sales at online shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall Group, including retail and wholesale -- grew 4% on the year, driven by the 5% growth of customer management fees.</p><p>Total international commerce, including both retail and wholesale, recorded strong growth of 45% on the year, but the sector is still loss-making.</p><p>Alibaba this year launched its largest revamp in years to regain its top position in China's e-commerce sector, with Taobao and Tmall Group starting to offer more bargain goods with optimized delivery services. The platform also introduced a "refund only" policy as it faced fierce competition from bargain platform Pinduoduo and ByteDance's short-video platform Douyin.</p><p>"This quarter's results demonstrate that our strategies are working and we are returning to growth," Eddie Wu, CEO of Alibaba Group, said in a call with analysts Tuesday. "Our China and international commerce businesses realized double-digit year-over-year [gross merchandise value] growth through our focus on the customer experience."</p><p>But amid China's economic slump triggered by the property sector crisis, Chinese consumers have become more cautious in spending and tend to save more cash. With household deposits at a historical high, some Chinese banks are even rejecting large time deposits to shore up profitability.</p><p>"The Chinese consumer has the ability to spend, and we have seen consumers' willingness to spend within our platform," Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai said. "We're seeing some positive signals, but it is probably still too early to tell, because the macro environment is still broadly affected by the property sector downturn."</p><p>At the same time, with user growth in its e-commerce unit approaching a ceiling, Alibaba has been betting on growth in its cloud computing services and is striving to establish itself as a leader in artificial intelligence in China.</p><p>Though sales of cloud computing services increased by just 3% to 25.6 billion yuan on the year, Wu said AI-related revenue accelerated in the first quarter and recorded "triple-digit growth" year over year. He did not clarify how the company quantified the portion spurred by AI.</p><p>"Starting in 2024, we've seen a rapid increase in customer demand for AI," Wu said. "It has also stimulated growth and demand for traditional cloud computing needs including general computing storage and big data. Therefore, we are actively investing in our cloud computing product matrix, especially in AI infrastructure, to capture the monumental opportunities."</p><p>Amid disappointing revenues and the suspended or aborted plans to list its business segments including logistical arm Ciaoniao and its cloud business unit, Alibaba has stepped up its share repurchase program. In the fiscal year ended in March, the company spent a total of $12.5 billion on buybacks. It has $31.9 billion remaining in its share buyback budget, which is effective through March 2027.</p><p id="AdAsia"></p>
