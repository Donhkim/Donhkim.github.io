                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday sentenced former FTX executive Ryan Salame to more than seven years in prison, the first of the lieutenants of failed cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried to receive jail time for their roles in <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ftx-bankruptcy-binance-timeline-c519d50b9059aa8bff0ce8b6cd26c40e">the 2022 collapse</a></span> of the cryptocurrency exchange. </p><p>Salame, 30, was a high-ranking executive at FTX for most of the exchange’s existence and, up until its collapse, was the co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets. He pleaded guilty last year to illegally making unlawful U.S. campaign contributions and to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. </p><p>The sentence of 7 1/2 years in prison, plus three years of supervised release, was more than the five to seven years prosecutors had asked Judge Lewis A. Kaplan to impose on Salame in their pre-sentencing memo.</p><p>While Salame was a high-level executive at FTX, he was not a major part of the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-cryptocurrency-sentencing-sbf-d7bb1a5e94b4c22039d74dfeab1a2ff1">government’s case</a></span> against Bankman-Fried at his trial earlier this year and did not testify against him. In a bid for leniency, Salame said during the sentencing hearing that he cooperated and even provided documents that aided prosecutors in their cross examination of Bankman-Fried, as well as in his own prosecution.</p>
    

<p>Along with helping Bankman-Fried hide the holes in FTX’s balance sheet that ultimately led to the exchange’s failure, Salame was used as a conduit for Bankman-Fried to make illegal campaign contributions to help shape U.S. policy on cryptocurrencies. On the surface, Bankman-Fried mostly gave political contributions to Democrats and liberal-leaning causes, while Salame gave contributions to Republicans and right-leaning causes. </p>
    
<p>But ultimately the funds that Salame used for those contributions came from Bankman-Fried. </p>



<p>Kaplan said Salame “knew precisely what he was doing … and the whole idea was to hide it from the world. Astonishing!”</p><p>The judge also chastised Salame for pulling $5 million in cryptocurrencies out of FTX as the exchange was failing. </p>
    

<p>“You tried to withdraw tens of millions more,” Kaplan said. “It was me first. I’m getting in the lifeboat first. To heck with all those customers.”</p><p>Salame apologized to FTX customers and his family, saying that he and others had good intentions, though he added: “I fully understand that the means I sought to achieve these goals were illegal.”</p><p>Before he was sentenced, Salame gave brief remarks saying he was “beginning my path to redemption.”</p><p>“I accept what’s next,” he said.</p><p>Three other high-level executives at FTX are awaiting sentencing for their roles in the exchange’s collapse: Caroline Ellison, who was CEO of the FTX hedge fund Alameda Research, Gary Wang, the co-founder of FTX, and Nishad Singh, FTX’s head of engineering. All three cooperated with prosecutors and testified at trial against Bankman-Fried in exchange for potentially suspended prison sentences. </p><h2>_____</h2><p>Associated Press writer Larry Neumeister in New York contributed to this report.</p>

<p>“Over the past six months, we have worked extremely hard to develop a plan for a reorganized WeWork that is better capitalized, more operationally efficient, and positioned for continued investment in our products and services and a return to long-term growth,” WeWork CEO David Tolley said in a <a href="https://therealdeal.com/national/2024/04/29/wework-to-exit-bankruptcy-with-sale-to-yardi-debt-restructuring/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://therealdeal.com/national/2024/04/29/wework-to-exit-bankruptcy-with-sale-to-yardi-debt-restructuring/" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">statement to The Real Deal last month.</a></p>



<p>WeWork’s bankruptcy litigation had focused on getting money back to creditors and wiping out the billions of dollars of debt weighing down WeWork’s balance sheet.

<p>Neumann, who cofounded WeWork as a single co-working space in Manhattan in 2010, captivated Wall Street throughout the late 2010s: first as the charismatic leader behind the buzzy company and later as the reckless CEO who partied hard and splashed cash on private jets and multimillion-dollar mansions as WeWork spiraled. He ultimately lost the confidence of the company’s board, which <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/07/wework-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/07/wework-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">ousted him in 2019</a>, before the company fell into bankruptcy.</p>

<li>Amazon Fresh is reducing the costs of 4,000 weekly rotating grocery products by up to 30%, applying to both national and Amazon store brands.</li>
<li>The move is part of Amazon's effort to invest in competitive pricing and savings for its customers, both in-store and online.</li>

<p>The company’s Amazon Fresh subsidiary announced Thursday it will slash the costs of 4,000 weekly rotating grocery products by up to 30%. The discounts will apply to both national and Amazon’s store brands.</p>



<p>“Increasing our Weekly Deals across thousands of items and expanding the reach of Prime Savings at Amazon Fresh is just one way that we’re continuing to invest in competitive pricing and savings for all of our customers—both in-store and online,” Amazon Fresh worldwide vice president Claire Peters said in a statement.</p>



<p>Last week saw an onslaught of retailers offering discounts on essential items: Target made a similar promise as Amazon’s, saying it would <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/20/target-cutting-prices-5000-items/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/20/target-cutting-prices-5000-items/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">cut the prices of 5,000 items</a> including diapers and pet food. The retailer rolled out its “dealworthy” <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/16/walmart-target-budget-brand-dealworthy/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/16/walmart-target-budget-brand-dealworthy/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">discount brand</a> in February, introducing 400 household and essential products mostly under $10. Walmart also said it would lower costs of 7,000 items, a <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/walmart-target-mcdonalds-retailers-promsing-summer-price-cuts-food-inflation/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/walmart-target-mcdonalds-retailers-promsing-summer-price-cuts-food-inflation/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">45% increase</a> in price rollbacks. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/05/09/aldi-lowering-prices-summer-2024/73624638007/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/05/09/aldi-lowering-prices-summer-2024/73624638007/" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Aldi</a> and <a href="https://ir.kroger.com/news/news-details/2024/Kroger-Albertsons-Companies-and-CS-Wholesale-Grocers-LLC-Announce-an-Updated-and-Expanded-Divestiture-Plan/default.aspx#:~:text=Kroger%20committed%20to%20investing%20%24500,to%20lower%20prices%20since%202003." target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://ir.kroger.com/news/news-details/2024/Kroger-Albertsons-Companies-and-CS-Wholesale-Grocers-LLC-Announce-an-Updated-and-Expanded-Divestiture-Plan/default.aspx#:~:text=Kroger%20committed%20to%20investing%20%24500,to%20lower%20prices%20since%202003." rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Kroger</a> both made moves to lower grocery prices as well.</p>



<p>These price cuts come after <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/15/heres-the-inflation-breakdown-for-april-2024-in-one-chart.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/15/heres-the-inflation-breakdown-for-april-2024-in-one-chart.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">persistent inflation</a> raised the cost of groceries 1.1% year over year as of April. That’s down 0.1% from March and significantly less than the 4.1% year-over-year price increase for food from restaurants, leaving retailers with an opportunity to take advantage on consumers’ increased reliance on groceries. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“We’re going to lead on price, and we’re going to manage our [profit] margins, and we’re going to be the Walmart that we’ve always been,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told analysts this month.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Retailers feel the pressure</strong></h2>



<p>Big-box stores lowering prices wasn’t an altruistic move to throw customers a bone during tough times. Retailers have suffered from weak sales due to customers’ <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/walmart-target-earnings-consumers-struggling-inflation/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/walmart-target-earnings-consumers-struggling-inflation/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">struggle with high prices</a>. Target <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/target-tgt-q1-earnings-report-2024-dcaaf0d3" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/target-tgt-q1-earnings-report-2024-dcaaf0d3" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">reported</a> a 3.1% drop in net sales from a year ago and a 3.7% quarterly dip in comparable sales, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of declines. Though Walmart has continued to soar, it owes much of its <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/16/walmart-wealthy-shoppers-ecommerce-grocery-target-amazon-prime/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/16/walmart-wealthy-shoppers-ecommerce-grocery-target-amazon-prime/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">6% revenue growth</a> to its e-commerce successes and wealthy customer base, the latter of which makes up a growing chunk of its audience.</p>



<p>This trend has continued in fast food, with McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and Burger King all <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/burger-king-five-dollar-meal-mcdonalds/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cbsnews.com/news/burger-king-five-dollar-meal-mcdonalds/" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">announcing meal deals</a> following earnings reports that suggest customers are <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/fast-food-luxury-lendingtree-survey-mcdonalds-wendys-inflation/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/fast-food-luxury-lendingtree-survey-mcdonalds-wendys-inflation/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">losing their taste</a> for high-priced fast food, including $18 Big Mac meals and threats of surge pricing.</p>



<p>Moreover, retailers’ decision to hike prices in the first place can’t all be attributed to inflation, Lindsay Owens, executive director of economic policy group Groundwork Collaborative, argued. She <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/05/24/grocery-prices-falling/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/05/24/grocery-prices-falling/" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">told the <em>Washington Post</em></a> that companies actually increased their margins in times of increased operating costs. A <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/p162318supplychainreport2024.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/p162318supplychainreport2024.pdf" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">March 2024 Federal Trade Commission report</a> found retail revenue for food and beverages increased 7% above total costs in the first three quarters of 2023, indicating that grocery stores’ decision to raise prices wasn’t just a result of inflation, supply-chain disruptions, or the rising prices of commodities.</p>



<p>“What you see is that’s effectively made possible by companies who are passing along their rising costs in full but then going for more<em>,” </em>Owens said.</p></div></div>

Those components altogether equal a very large hardware data center segment, then we have software coming... and then the third one is automotive, so we have a lot coming. This is very, very early for Nvidia," Kindig <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/28/kindig-nvidia-is-heading-towards-a-10-trillion-market-cap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">told CNBC on Tuesday.</a></p><p>Kindig's long-term bullishness on Nvidia stems from the idea that the company has an "impenetrable moat" around its GPU business.</p><p>Kindig said that estimates for the AI data center market's total addressable market rising to $400 billion by 2027 and $1 trillion by 2030 will largely be captured by Nvidia, not its biggest competitors, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amd-stock?miRedirects=1&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">AMD</a> or <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/intc-stock?miRedirects=1&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Intel</a>. </p><p>"Nvidia will take the lion's share of that," Kindig said, and that's largely because of Nvidia's software offerings it is integrating into its hardware products.</p><p>"The CUDA software platform is what developers learn on. So, similar to iOS is really what locked people into the iPhone because developers were developing applications for the iPhone. The same thing is happening with Nvidia, which is that the CUDA platform is what AI engineers are learning in order to program GPUs, so that helps lock them in, and that combination, right now, I'm calling it an impenetrable moat," Kindig explained.</p><p>Finally, the custom silicon AI chips being developed internally at mega-cap tech companies like <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amzn-stock?miRedirects=1&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/googl-stock?miRedirects=1&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Alphabet</a> will never directly compete with Nvidia, according to Kindig. </p><p>"They're not going to commercialize and sell chips the way that Nvidia does, so Nvidia has an open runway there," Kindig said. </p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-nvidia-aws-ai-chip-dominance-gpu-trainium-inferentia-2024-5?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Business Insider reported</a> last week that Amazon has struggled in its attempt to make AI GPU chips that can compete with Nvidia's over the past four years.</p>

In the last three months of 2023, 3.8 million parents borrowed $112.2 billion in PLUS loans, <a href="https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/portfolio" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Department of Education data</a> showed. For 2024-25, those loans will be extremely expensive at a <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">more than three-decade high</a> <a href="https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/electronic-announcements/2024-05-14/interest-rates-direct-loans-first-disbursed-between-july-1-2024-and-june-30-2025" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">9.08% interest rate</a>, plus fees.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“It’s worth taking a look at how private loan options compare for the remainder of your education financing needs, particularly if you are considering taking out…PLUS loans,” said Brian Walsh, head of advice and planning at online bank SoFi.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">How much can you save with a private loan?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In some cases, a private loan could save you tens of thousands of dollars over the life of a 10-year loan, student loan experts said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>Learn more:</strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":body nav (pl)|e|auto spike click:6|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a" href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/personal-loans/best-personal-loans/">Best personal loans</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Thomas Graf, executive director at not-for-profit state lender <a href="https://www.mefa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority (MEFA)</a>, gives a comparison using last year’s rates for a 10-year $18,000 loan:</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">◾ A parent PLUS loan at the 2023-24 rate of 8.05% would mean a $228 monthly payment, or $27,423 for the life of the loan.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">◾ A MEFA loan at 6.47% means monthly payments of $204, or $24,493 total.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“You would have saved 10.7% over the life of the loan,” he said, and that’s not including the PLUS loan’s origination, or service, fee. Origination fees are subtracted from your disbursement, but you still pay interest on them. Last year, the fee was 4.228% of the loan.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Because of the origination fee, you may also have to borrow $18,000 plus the fee to actually get $18,000, Graf said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“When considering private versus federal PLUS loans, it is important to consider the cost of the origination fee in addition to interest rates,” Walsh said. “Even if federal rates are lower than private, sometimes with the addition of the origination fee, it will still cost you more over time.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Why are federal student loan rates so high?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Student loan rates are set yearly, based on the last 10-year Treasury auction in May.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The 10-year Treasury yield has trended higher over the past few years as inflation rose and the Federal Reserve aggressively increased its short-term, benchmark Fed funds rate to combat it. Both high inflation and higher short-term rates generally push up 10-year yields.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">What’s the downside to a private student loan?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">◾ The most oft-cited downsides include losing access to forgiveness and lower payments from an income-driven repayment plan.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">However, experts are quick to note that federal parent PLUS loans <a href="/story/news/education/2023/11/08/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-panel-who-qualifies/71490306007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">haven’t benefitted</a> much from either of those offerings. Some parents have even resigned themselves to <a href="/story/news/education/2023/12/03/parents-struggle-student-loan-debt/71680559007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">dying with that debt</a>. Private student loans can be transferred to a child to repay, but federal parent <a href="https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/can-i-transfer-plus-repayments-to-child" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">PLUS loans cannot</a>.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">◾ A private student loan may not get discharged in case of death or disability. Those are up to your lender. Private student loans can have more flexible terms and payment schedules, but you must ask and understand what they are.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">◾ Not everyone qualifies for a lower rate or even a private loan. “Private loan rates are dependent on the borrower’s credit profile and ability to repay, whereas federal loans are not,” Walsh said.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Should families skip all federal student loans then?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">No.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">You should always take subsidized, or needs-based, federal loans if you qualify.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“If you’re eligible for a subsidized loan, this means that you are only responsible for interest that accrues after graduating,” Walsh said. “It’s generally recommended to max out the amount of subsidized loans first before considering other loan types even with these higher interest rates.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When you start looking at unsubsidized loans, shop around. Non-needs-based loans “charge you an interest rate from the moment you take the loan out, even while you’re still in school,” he said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Looking for the best:</strong><a href="/money/blueprint/student-loans/best-private-student-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:31|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Best private student loans of May 2024</a></p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2023/11/20/USAT/71660560007-kimara-shields.JPG?width=300&amp;height=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Kimara Shields took out a parent PLUS loan so her daughter could go to college to become a teacher.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Consumer Confidence Index rises</strong>: The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index rose from 97.5 in April to 102 in May, exceeding economists' expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Optimism about labor market</strong>: Consumers' confidence in the labor market was a key factor in the rise in confidence, as Americans are more optimistic about job prospects.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation expectations increase</strong>: While inflation expectations rose slightly, consumers still expect high inflation, with an average 12-month inflation expectation of 5.4%.</li>
<li><strong>Highest confidence among younger and wealthier consumers</strong>: The report found that the youngest and wealthiest consumers (those under 35 and making over $100K) had the highest confidence in the economy.</li>
<li><strong>Consumers cite food and groceries as major concern</strong>: Prices for food and groceries were cited as having the greatest impact on consumers' views of the economy, reinforcing concerns about inflation and high living costs.</li>

U.S. same-store sales fell 3% and traffic dropped 7%. As a result, the company cut its 2024 forecast.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>CEO Laxman Narasimhan admitted Starbucks was seeing a more cautious consumer when it came to spending, but also mentioned the need to make improvements to stores as the company saw troubling trends. Starbucks reported rates of incomplete mobile app orders in the mid-teens and said occasional customers came in less.</p><p>Narasimhan, in prepared remarks to Wall Street analysts, cited some of the challenges that union workers have been highlighting in their bid for better working conditions.</p><p>“Specifically in our U.S. stores, we’re focused on creating a more stable environment for partners through investments in equipment innovation, process improvements, staffing, scheduling and waste reduction, all things our partners value and prioritize creating a more satisfying work environment in our stores while de-risking our business,” Narasimhan said on a call with analysts.</p><p>He added in an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” that throughput has improved, and said the company’s action plan will continue to build on that momentum with improvements to stores and better communication of value.</p><p>“We have improved speed of service quarter over quarter. If you look at the processes that we are rolling out, particularly around peak, what we are finding is that we have opportunities to improve that even further with changes in processes and tools that we provide to partners at peak,” Narasimhan said.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>For Workers United, the union behind the Starbucks organizing, his admission that more could be done was promising.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline0"></a>Staffing challenges</h2><div class="group"><p>The organizing efforts began nearly three years ago in Buffalo, New York, under then-CEO Kevin Johnson. At the time, Starbucks was a company long known for progressive benefits for workers.</p><p>But baristas, emboldened by the experience they had during the Covid-19 pandemic, pushed for changes in the company’s cafes. More than 430 unionized stores and two chief executives later, the two sides have made “significant progress” in contract bargaining, striking a more optimistic tone after a successful two-day session last month.</p><p>Starbucks and the union are meeting to continue working on the framework that will inform every single-store contract moving ahead.</p><p>“I do believe that we are seeing the company at this point acknowledge that there are issues, significant issues,” Michelle Eisen, a Workers United delegate and original member of the company’s first organized union in Buffalo, told CNBC ahead of negotiations.</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107406992" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">People picket outside of a Starbucks store in New York’s East Village on Nov. 16, 2023.</p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Spencer Platt | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>“We heard Narasimhan make that statement after the earnings call that they’re aware that stores have experienced staffing issues,” said Eisen, who has been with the company for more than a decade and is among 150 delegates attending in-person bargaining sessions with Starbucks on behalf of the union.</p><p>“I think this is a new world right now to be able to say that the CEO has stepped up and said, ‘Look, we’ve got some problems, we know we’ve got some problems, we want to work towards fixing those problems,’” Eisen said. “And as a worker at a unionized location, with proposals on the table to help solve these issues, that’s exactly what I want to hear.”</p><p>In internal surveys and in bargaining committee meetings, union-represented partners consistently rank “staffing and scheduling” as their highest priority issue. The vast majority of represented partners report frequently working short-staffed, and a simple majority of partners report that they are getting scheduled for fewer hours than they want or need.</p><p>The union has also pushed for better pay and benefits.</p><p>Starbucks says it has made significant progress over the past two years on staffing and scheduling. An advanced staffing model is able to take into account both historical trends of allocated hours per store, but also current trends, available product types and upcoming promotions, the company said. Starbucks says its data affirms partners now get more hours and that partner retention and sentiment have both increased across the U.S. as schedules become more stable and consistent.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline1"></a>Orders up</h2><div class="group"><p>Staffing improvements are likely to be even more important as Starbucks projects an increase in traffic and orders.</p><p>In July, Starbucks plans to open up its mobile order and pay app to nonrewards members in a bid to win back its occasional customer base. This will create the ability to target all customers with new products and promotions in an effort to grow traffic.</p><p>It is also due to introduce what it is calling the Siren System: new equipment and protocol to address customer ticket times. The Siren System includes a custom ice dispenser, milk-dispensing system and faster blenders to reduce steps for baristas and get drinks to customers faster. It will reach 1,000 stores in July.</p><p>“It’s a terrible feeling to be on that floor and to pull a sticker and to look at the time and then look up at the clock on the wall and realize, you’re already 8 minutes behind,” Eisen said of mobile orders.</p><p>“Eight minutes doesn’t sound like a lot. But when you’re producing 100 transactions per half hour … and you realize you’re probably backed up 20 drinks, it’s a bad feeling,” she said.</p><p>There has been another call for change at Starbucks stores that may carry weight at the negotiating table. Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz in a LinkedIn post after the company’s earnings report said management needs to spend more time with workers to understand ongoing challenges.</p><p>It was the third time he has publicly weighed in on Starbucks and its operations since leaving the company and its board last year. It was a notable shift in tone from when Schultz returned to the company in 2022 to respond to the union challenge, with a far more combative attitude.</p><p>Narasimhan was mentored by Schultz for six months before taking the helm at the company, and he spent time in stores with baristas, even earning his barista certification before becoming CEO in 2023.</p><p>“I have emphasized that the company’s fix needs to begin at home: U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company’s fall from grace,” Schultz said. “The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience, through the eyes of a merchant. The answer does not lie in data, but in the stores.”</p><p>At the time, the coffee giant said in response, “We always appreciate Howard’s perspective. The challenges and opportunities he highlights are ones we are focused on. And like Howard, we are confident in Starbucks’ long-term success.”</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Don’t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO</h2></div></div></div></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

<ol>
<li>Toner, a board member, accuses Altman of withholding information and misrepresenting facts to the board for years, including not disclosing his ownership of the OpenAI startup fund.</li>
<li>Toner alleges that Altman's deception made it impossible for the board to trust him, and that the board was already considering firing him in October.</li>
<li>Toner claims that Altman also provided inaccurate information about OpenAI's safety processes, making it difficult for the board to understand the company's risk management practices.</li>
<li>In October, other executives shared their own experiences with Altman, describing him as utilizing "psychological abuse" in their interactions. As a result, the board concluded that Altman was not the right person to lead the company towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).</li>
<li>Despite being ousted, Altman's stint was short-lived, as staff threatened to quit and speculation mounted that Microsoft would poach Altman's team and hire him directly. The board ultimately brought Altman back to the company, likely due to pressure from staff and the potential loss of talent.</li>

The board, she said, had a role to have independent oversight of OpenAI and "not just helping the CEO to raise more money."<br><br>But then, last October, the board had a number of conversations where two executives detailed their own experiences with Altman in which they used the phrase "psychological abuse," according to Toner. <br><br>She said the executives told the board they "didn't think he was the right person to lead the company to AGI, telling us they had no belief that he could or would change, no point in giving him feedback, no point in trying to work through these issues." <br><br>By the time the board realized Altman needed replacing, Toner says it was clear that Altman would "pull out all the stops" to block the board from going against him if he found out. She claims he "started lying to other board members in order to try and push me off the board."<br><br>She said, "We were very careful, very deliberate about who we told, which was essentially almost no one in advance, other than obviously our legal team and so that's kind of what took us to to November 17." </p><p class="premium">But Altman's ouster didn't last long.</p><p class="premium">As staff threatened to quit and speculation swirled that Microsoft may poach Altman's team from OpenAI and hire him directly, the company's board brought back Altman as CEO less than a week later.</p><p class="premium">Toner resigned from her role as an OpenAI board member less than two weeks after Altman returned as CEO. <br><br><em>Do you work for OpenAI?

While Chief Technology Officer Tetsuro Fujinuki confirmed the company was working on a great “Subaru-like” electric vehicle, he said the company wasn’t about to dump the engine altogether.</p>

        <p>DALLAS &amp; MIDLAND, Texas--(<span itemprop="provider publisher copyrightHolder" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" itemid="https://www.businesswire.com"><span itemprop="name"><a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" rel="nofollow" itemprop="url" href="https://www.businesswire.com/">BUSINESS WIRE</a></span></span>)--Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET) and WTG Midstream, LLC (WTG) announced today that the parties have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Energy Transfer will acquire WTG Midstream Holdings LLC in a transaction valued at approximately $3.25 billion from affiliates of Stonepeak, the Davis Estate and Diamondback Energy, Inc. Consideration for the transaction will be comprised of $2.45 billion in cash and approximately 50.8 million newly issued Energy Transfer common units. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.

</p><p>
<b>Complementary Gathering and Processing Assets</b>

</p><p>
WTG provides comprehensive midstream services including wellhead gathering, intra-basin transportation and processing services. The company’s 6,000-mile pipeline network serves significant operators in some of the most active areas of the Midland Basin including Martin, Howard, Upton, Reagan and Irion counties. WTG also operates eight processing plants with a total capacity of approximately 1.3 Bcf/d and is constructing two new plants with an additional capacity of approximately 0.4 Bcf/d. The first new plant is expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2024 and the second plant the third quarter of 2025.

</p><p>
WTG’s extensive system processes significant volumes from large cap investment grade producers with firm, long-term contracts and acreage dedications. The addition of WTG assets is expected to provide Energy Transfer with increased access to growing supplies of natural gas and NGL volumes enhancing the partnership’s Permian operations and downstream businesses.

</p><p>
The acquisition also includes a 20% interest in BANGL Pipeline, an approximately 425-mile NGL pipeline with an initial capacity of 125,000 Bbls/d (expandable up over 300,000 Bbls/d) connecting the Permian Basin to markets on the Texas Gulf Coast. Energy Transfer benefits from well positioned assets in the Permian which is the most active region in the U.S. and this acquisition is expected to provide future upside as the basin continues to develop on and around Energy Transfer’s infrastructure.

</p><p>
<b>Positive Financial Impact</b>

</p><p>
The transaction is expected to increasingly add incremental revenue from downstream NGL transportation and fractionation fees. Energy Transfer expects the WTG assets to add approximately $0.04 of Distributable Cash Flow (DCF) per common unit in 2025 growing to approximately $0.07 per common unit in 2027. WTG’s cash flows are supported by a high-quality customer base, predominately investment grade, with an average contract life of more than eight years.

</p><p>
<b>Advisors</b>

</p><p>
RBC Capital Markets is serving as financial advisor to Energy Transfer, and Vinson &amp; Elkins LLP is acting as Energy Transfer’s legal counsel on the transaction. Jefferies LLC is serving as financial advisor to WTG, and Sidley Austin LLP is acting as WTG’s legal counsel.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Grocery chain Giant has announced a ban on large bags in all of its Washington, D.C., stores to combat shoplifting and reduce crime. The ban went into effect on May 23 and applies to bags larger than 14" x 14" x 6".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ban is a response to the company's struggles with shoplifting, which have resulted in millions of dollars in losses per year. The company claims that shoplifting is UNSUSTAINABLE and is affecting its ability to run its stores safely and profitably.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Giant's anti-theft measures also include hiring more guards, reducing store hours, and locking down some items. The company sees the ban on large bags as one solution to the problem of shoplifting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new policy has drawn criticism from customers, including a mother who was turned away while carrying her baby bag. She feels that the ban is unfair and notes that thieves are the ones who are actually hurt by the restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The issue of shoplifting is not limited to Giant or Washington, D.C. The article notes that shoplifting is a widespread problem, and another European city is even equipping its retail workers with body cameras to combat the issue.</p>

Mainly, it's gained a reputation for <a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musks-grok-ai-accusations" class="underline hover:text-the-byte hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">edgy jokes</a> and<a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-ai-accuses-nba-player-criminal-vandalism" class="underline hover:text-the-byte hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"> making off-the-wall claims</a>.</p><p>Despite that, Musk's ambitions for his AI venture are apparently lofty: he's said that he aims to build a "<a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-building-truth-seeking-ai" class="underline hover:text-the-byte hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">maximum truth-seeking AI</a> that tries to understand the nature of the universe" — an ethos that is matter-of-factly restated in the company's latest funding announcement.</p><h2 class="font-k text-4 font-black  lg:border-b border-gray-900 pb-1">Open Season</h2><p>But Musk's ambitions are seemingly also very petty, as there's a lot of bad blood between him and OpenAI. Musk co-founded the company in 2015, but <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-quits-research-group" class="underline hover:text-the-byte hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">left three years later</a> after heated disputes over its direction.</p><p>Since then, he's publicly <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-pissed-openai-successful" class="underline hover:text-the-byte hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">raged</a> about OpenAI's <a href="https://futurism.com/openai-sleazy-company-creating-agi" class="underline hover:text-the-byte hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">fishy transition</a> from a non-profit to creating a lucrative for-profit arm, and in March <a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-sues-openai" class="underline hover:text-the-byte hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">sued the company on those grounds</a>. He's also warned <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-horrified-openai" class="underline hover:text-the-byte hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">about the dangers of AI technology</a>.</p><p>But perhaps above all, Musk simply perceives OpenAI and ChatGPT as too "<a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-building-ai" class="underline hover:text-the-byte hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">woke</a>." Grok is meant to be the free-speech absolutist's answer to that, but it too <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-grok-ai-woke" class="underline hover:text-the-byte hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">has apparently fallen victim</a> to the so-called "woke mind virus."</p><p>Now flush with enormous amounts of investment, xAI could finally pose a serious challenge to OpenAI's dominance. It's unclear what all those funds will be put towards, but Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1794964816211087660" class="underline hover:text-the-byte hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">teased</a> on Monday that "<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">there will be more to announce in the coming weeks."</span></p><p class=""><strong>More on AI: </strong><em><a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-cryptic-warning" class="underline hover:text-the-byte hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">Another OpenAI Researcher Quits, Issuing Cryptic Warning</a></em></p></div></div>
