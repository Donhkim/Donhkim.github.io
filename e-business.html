    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Major US banks can withstand a severe recession</strong>: The Federal Reserve found that the 31 largest banks in the US can absorb losses and maintain their ability to lend to consumers and corporations even if the economy faces a severe recession scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stress test assumed severe economic conditions</strong>: The stress test assumed unemployment would surge to 10%, commercial real estate values would plunge 40%, and housing prices would fall 36%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Banks can absorb $685 billion in hypothetical losses</strong>: Under the severe recession scenario, the 31 banks would take hypothetical losses of nearly $685 billion, but still have more capital than their minimum common equity requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fed's stress test ensures bank safety</strong>: The annual stress test, led by the Federal Reserve, forces banks to maintain adequate cushions for bad loans and dictates the size of share repurchases and dividends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Good news for banks and financial stability</strong>: The results of the stress test, according to Michael Barr, the Fed's vice chair for supervision, are "good news" and "underscore the usefulness of the extra capital that banks have built in recent years".</p>

            While that means Americans are stuck dealing with low housing affordability, it’s also proving to be a headache for the Fed: Inflation overall has eased substantially since reaching a four-decade high two years ago, but shelter costs have remained stubbornly elevated. It is effectively making the final stretch of the Fed’s inflation battle more difficult. Fed officials, including Fed chief Jerome Powell, have said that it’s only a matter of time until declining rents show up in official government measures of inflation. Renters are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/23/business/stocks-week-ahead-america-housing-crisis-worsen/index.html">very much still struggling</a> in today’s tough US housing market.

            The Biden administration has laid out its own solutions to the country’s housing crisis. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday announced $100 million in funding over the next three years “to support the financing of affordable housing,” according to a release. On Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris and Housing and Urban Development Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman announced $85 million in grant funding toward a housing program that “aims to identify and remove barriers to affordable housing production and preservation, and lower housing costs.”

            “Housing costs are a particular pain point for American households,” Lael Brainard, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said last week at an event in Washington.

            Brainard touted the Biden administration’s cap on annual rent increases for the 2 million households in “low-income housing tax credit” units and a reduction in Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance premiums that took effect in the spring, which she said has helped nearly 700,000 homeowners save roughly $900 annually.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Amazon's Just Walk Out technology</strong>: Amazon's "Just Walk Out" technology is an AI-powered system installed in physical grocery stores, which allows customers to simply pick their items and then leave without having to queue up at a checkout counter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Facial recognition and sensors</strong>: The AI uses facial recognition technology, as well as lots of sensors and cameras, to track what customers are buying and automatically bill them.</p>
</li>

You then get automatically billed.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">However, back in April it was widely reported that rather than solely using AI, Just Walk Out needed around 1,000 workers in India to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133029/amazon-just-walk-out-cashierless-ai-india" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">manually check almost three quarters of the transactions.</a></p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Amazon was quick to claim that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-just-walk-out-dash-cart-grocery-shopping-checkout-stores" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">the reports were “erroneous”,</a> and that staff in India were not reviewing video footage from all the shops.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Instead it said that the Indian workers were simply reviewing the system. Amazon added that “this is no different than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where human reviewers are common”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">However, Amazon also confirmed that it would be reducing the number of stores that used the Just Walk Out system.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Whatever the exact details of the Amazon case, it is a high-profile example of a new and growing question – whether companies are making over-inflated claims about their use of AI. It is a phenomenon that has been dubbed “AI washing” in reference to the environmental "green washing".</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But first, a reminder of what exactly AI means. While there is no exact definition, AI allows computers <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65855333" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">to learn and solve problems</a>. AI is able to do this after first being trained on huge amounts of information.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The specific type of AI that has made all the headlines over the past few years is so-called "generative AI". This is AI that specialises in creating new content, be it having text conversations, or producing music or images.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Microsoft's Copilot are popular examples of generative AI.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">When it comes to AI washing, there are several types. Some companies claim to use AI when they're actually using less-sophisticated computing, while others overstate the efficacy of their AI over existing techniques, or suggest that their AI solutions are fully operational when they are not.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Meanwhile, other firms are simply bolting an AI chatbot onto their existing non-AI operating software.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">While only 10% of tech start-ups mentioned using AI in their pitches in 2022, this rose to more than a quarter in 2023, according to OpenOcean, a UK and Finland-based investment fund for new tech firms. It expects that figure to be more than a third this year.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And, says OpenOcean team member Sri Ayangar, competition for funding and the desire to appear on the cutting edge have pushed some such companies to overstate their AI capabilities.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Some founders seem to believe that if they don’t mention AI in their pitch, this may put them at a disadvantage, regardless of the role it plays in their solution," says Mr Ayangar.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"And from our analysis, a significant disparity exists between companies claiming AI capabilities, and those demonstrating tangible AI-driven results."</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dOZXmm"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-13b8515c-1 bbjeKz"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3c8b/live/1a49ac70-3379-11ef-9fb3-db4b10d023b6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3c8b/live/1a49ac70-3379-11ef-9fb3-db4b10d023b6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3c8b/live/1a49ac70-3379-11ef-9fb3-db4b10d023b6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3c8b/live/1a49ac70-3379-11ef-9fb3-db4b10d023b6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3c8b/live/1a49ac70-3379-11ef-9fb3-db4b10d023b6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3c8b/live/1a49ac70-3379-11ef-9fb3-db4b10d023b6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3c8b/live/1a49ac70-3379-11ef-9fb3-db4b10d023b6.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3c8b/live/1a49ac70-3379-11ef-9fb3-db4b10d023b6.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Sri Ayangar Sri Ayangar" class="sc-13b8515c-0 hbOWRP"><span class="sc-13b8515c-2 iuvLSH">Sri Ayangar</span></div></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Sri Ayangar says that some start-up bosses feel they just have to mention AI</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from  another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures. In a 2019 study it found that 40% of new tech firms that described themselves as "AI start-ups" in fact <a target="_blank" href="https://mmc.vc/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-MMC-State-of-AI-2019-Report.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">used virtually no AI at all.</a></p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"The problem is the same today, plus a different problem," says Simon Menashy, general partner at MMC Ventures.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He explains that "cutting-edge AI capabilities" are now available for every company to buy for the price of standard software. But that instead of building a whole AI system, he says many firms are simply popping a chatbot interface on top of a non-AI product.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Dougal Dick, UK head of emerging technology risk at accountancy giant KPMG, says the problem of AI washing is not helped by the fact there not a single agreed definition of AI.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"If I asked a room of people what their definition of AI is, they would all give a different answer,” he says. “The term is used very broadly and loosely, without any clear point of reference. It is this ambiguity that is allowing AI washing to emerge.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"AI washing can have concerning impacts for businesses, from overpaying for technology and services to failing to meet operational objectives the AI was expected to help them achieve."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Meanwhile, for investors it can make it harder to identify genuinely innovative companies.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And, says Mr Ayangar: "If consumers have unmet expectations from products that claim to offer advanced AI-driven solutions, this can erode trust in start-ups that are doing genuinely ground-breaking work."</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Regulators, in the US at least, are starting to take notice.

I remember seeing advertisements in the London Tube for electric toothbrushes that are powered by AI. Who is this for? Who is helped by this?"</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Also, the environmental impact of AI is often glossed over, she says.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“AI does not grow on trees… the technology already contributes more to climate change than aviation. We have to move away from this one-sided overhyped discussion, and really think about specific tasks and sectors that AI can be beneficial for, and not just blindly implement it into everything.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But in the longer term, says Advika Jalan, head of research at MMC Ventures, the problem of AI washing may subside on its own.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"AI is becoming so ubiquitous - even if they’re just ChatGPT wrappers - that 'AI-powered' as a branding tool will likely cease to be a differentiator after some time," she says. "It will be a bit like saying 'we’re on the internet'."</p></div></article></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Auto sales expected to decline</strong>: According to a joint forecast by J.D. Power and GlobalData, new vehicle sales in the US are expected to decline by 2.6% to 7.2% in June compared to the same month last year, due to an outage at software provider CDK Global.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CDK Global outage affects dealerships</strong>: The outage at CDK Global, which provides software to thousands of car dealerships in North America, has caused disruptions to business operations, with some dealerships returning to manual paperwork and others temporarily shutting down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outage impacts sales</strong>: Analysts believe that the outage will not reflect actual consumer demand for new vehicles, as a significant number of sales that would have occurred in June are now likely to occur in July once operations fully resume.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uncertainty about sales outcome</strong>: Due to the uncertainty about when the system outages will be resolved and what countermeasures dealers will put in place to transact sales, a significant range of sales outcomes is possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decline in sales expected</strong>: The forecast predicts that total new vehicle sales in June will range between 1,336,800 and 1,273,600 units, which would be a decline from the same month last year.</p>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge said she’s not likely to approve the $30 billion settlement between the payment processing giants Visa and Mastercard and the merchants who say they’ve overpaid on swipe fees. </p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/visa-mastercard-merchants-swipe-fee-5f2a75674d472ef95af9f6fd426f1f6e">Visa and Mastercard reached a settlement with a group of small businesses and merchants</a></span> back in March. The deal would lower and cap the fees charged by Visa and Mastercard and allow small businesses to collectively bargain for rates with the payment processors in a similar way that the large merchants do on their own now.</p><p>But the settlement was not universally accepted. The National Retail Federation, the largest U.S. retail trade group, said it was likely to oppose the settlement, saying the relief was only temporary and that payment processing fees remain too high. The settlement would have capped swipe fees for five years, which merchants opposed to the settlement said was insufficient. </p>
    

<p>In a brief order, Judge Margo Brodie of the Eastern District of New York said she was unlikely to grant final approval to the settlement. The decision means that, absence a settlement, the case could go to trial. </p>



<p>The settlement stems from a 2005 lawsuit that alleged merchants paid excessive fees to accept Visa and Mastercard credit cards, and that Visa, Mastercard and their member banks acted in violation of antitrust laws. Visa and Mastercard collect a fee from every transaction that runs on their network. The fee varies depending on the size of the merchant as well as the industry they operate in, but generally it’s between 1% and 3% of a transaction’s value. </p>
    
<p>In 2018 <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-visa-mastercard-20180918-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visa and Mastercard agreed to pay $6.2 billion</a></span> as part of the long-running suit filed by a group of 19 merchants. But the lawsuit then had two pieces that needed to be resolved: a dispute over the rules Visa and Mastercard impose to accept their cards, and the merchants who chose not to participate in the settlement.</p>

Yesterday, after this two-day correction, it was 39 times forward price-earnings. But there have been three times in the last five years where it's had a look forward price-earnings multiple of over 50x, and two times in the last five years where it's gotten just about to 70x and then it pulled back. So we just haven't seen that euphoria yet," Jackson <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/25/the-euphoria-for-nvidia-could-drive-the-market-cap-to-6-trillion-says-emj-capitals-eric-jackson.html" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">told CNBC</a> on Tuesday.</p><p>Jackson is betting that as investors start to focus on Nvidia's earnings potential in 2025 and 2026, euphoria could drive Nvidia well above its average forward P/E multiple and closer to its peak.</p><p>"This is a high flyer, and expectations can reset on a bad earnings report, but they can also get equally overhyped on good news. And despite the fact the stock has had this enormous run, the euphoria hasn't yet caught up in terms of the go-forward multiple," Jackson said.</p><p>Shares of Nvidia have already soared 151% year-to-date, and the chip maker was <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvidia-stock-price-market-cap-microsoft-most-valuable-company-ai-2024-6?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">briefly the most valuable company in the world at its peak last week,</a> with a market valuation of about $3.3 trillion.</p><p>"I think what's going to happen in the second half of this year, as people start to see how well the Blackwell chips are selling, how good the gross margins are on those, and start thinking about what's to come with the Rubin chips around the corner, I think we'll start to see that euphoria reflected in a lofty go-forward price-earnings multiple, and if that happens, this thing can go to $6 trillion market cap," Jackson said.</p><p>Jackson also argued that Nvidia has a sizable lead over its competition and will take advantage of that for years to come. Additionally, Jackson said that comparisons of Nvidia today to Cisco during the dot-com bubble are unfounded.</p><p>"This is not Cisco in the dot-com era. Back then Cisco's go-forward p/e multiple got to a peak of something like 136x. Again, we're below the mean for the last five years. So even though the stock has done so well, it is still relatively cheap compared to where it was trading in the past," Jackson said.</p><p>Jackson isn't the only one on Wall Street who is still bullish on the stock even when accounting for its massive run over the past year.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvidia-stock-price-prediction-upside-200-per-share-target-ai-2024-6?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Constellation Research</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvidia-stock-outlook-rosenblatt-price-target-increase-ai-software-profits-2024-6?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Rosenblatt have a $200 price target</a> for Nvidia stock, while Bank of America recently <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvidia-stock-price-prediction-buy-nvda-decline-dot-com-differences-2024-6?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">reiterated its $150 target.</a></p><p>While Nvidia's long-term prospects remain bullish, according to Wall Street, that does not mean it is immune from sharp declines.</p><p>Shares of <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvidia-stock-price-sell-off-erases-431-billion-market-value-2024-6?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Nvidia wiped out more than $400 billion in market value earlier this week,</a> with the stock staging a three-day correction of 16%.</p>

<p>Mate Rimac, founder of Rimac, launched a new level 4 autonomous electric car brand called Verne and coming to market in 2026.</p>



<span id="more-369247"></span>



<p>Rimac is best known for its electric hypercar, the Nevera, and for its surprising takeover of Bugatti through its partnership with Porsche.</p>



<p>But now it is stepping into the other side of the EV spectrum: from hypercars to autonomous cars.</p>



<p>Mate Rimac, along with two other Rimac executives, have launched a new brand called Verne. It’s not clear how the Rimac Group plays into this beyond sharing employees, but it sounds like it is part of it, as the brand was launched at Rimac’s headquarters in Croatia today.</p>



<p>Verne is using Mobileye’s level 4 autonomy system and therefore, it’s core technology is more the vehicle platform than the autonomous driving system.</p>



<p>They wrote about the new vehicle:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The vehicle is built on a completely new platform designed around safety and comfort, engineered solely for autonomous driving using the Mobileye Drive autonomous platform. It is completely rethought, conceived, designed, and engineered as a safe and comfortable autonomous vehicle. Built from the ground up it is free from the compromises and disadvantages necessary in using a legacy platform built for human driving.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here are some pictures of the new Verne autonomous electric vehicle:</p>

<p>As you can see, it’s a two-seater built around the passenger experience since the vehicle is driverless.</p>



<p>There’s an extensive sound system and a giant screen with a UI built for a variety of passenger experiences.</p>




	<p>It is built for ride-hailing systems with a high level of customization. Verne says that the customers are going to be able to customize the experience via an app before the vehicle arrives:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It’s a re-envisioning of the ride-hailing app and mobility platform. The customers can personalise the vehicle’s settings via app before ordering a ride. That way, the vehicle will be set exactly how you like it with the comfort, lighting, temperature and even scent. Even though the customer will never own the vehicle, it will be tailored to feel like your own. On the backend, Verne uses all the benefits an autonomous connected fleet provides to make the service run smoothly and efficiently in every city.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Verne is going to launch first in Zhagreb in 2026, and the company plans to expand in Europe and the Middle East shortly after.</p>



<p>The company claims to already have deals with 11 cities.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chicago has some of the worst traffic in the world</strong>: According to Inrix's Global Traffic Scorecard, Chicago ranks No. 5 for worst traffic in the world, with the average traveler losing 96 hours in traffic in 2023, compared to 42 hours for the typical American driver.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic congestion surge in Chicago</strong>: The city's congestion surged by 18% from pre-pandemic travel times in 2019, making it one of the most congested cities in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Expressways are among the busiest in the country</strong>: Some of Chicago's expressways, such as the Dan Ryan and Stevenson Expy, are among the busiest in the country, with the Dan Ryan headed south from the Jane Byrne Interchange to Interstate 57 ranking 10th busiest in the country.</li>
<li><strong>Cost of congestion</strong>: The cost of lost time and general price of congestion averaged out to $1,672 per Chicago driver, with the city of Chicago losing $6.1 billion in 2023 from congestion alone.</li>
<li><strong>Possible causes of congestion</strong>: Experts speculate that the online shopping boom and decreased public transit ridership may have contributed to the increase in congestion, as more freight traffic is on the roads and fewer people are using public transportation.</li>

    <div><div id="content" class="_content_wmpvm_1" data-component="annotation" data-testid="annotation_testID"><p><span>It’s official: Chicago has some of the worst traffic in the world.</span></p>
<p><span>According to Inrix’s </span><a href="https://inrix.com/scorecard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Global Traffic Scorecard</span></a><span>, Chicago ranks No. 5 for worst traffic in the world with a loss of 96 hours in traffic for the average traveler in 2023. To compare, the typical American driver lost 42 hours in traffic in the same year.</span></p>
<p>Chicago ranks behind New York, London, Paris and Mexico City in highest global traffic delay times. The study uses traffic data to provide delay comparisons, economic projections and commuting trends based on unique geographic travel patterns. </p>
<p>Chicago’s congestion surge was an 18% jump from pre-pandemic travel times in 2019. </p>
<p><span>Some of Chicago’s expressways are the busiest in the country, too. The Dan Ryan headed south from the Jane Byrne Interchange to Interstate 57 at 4pm ranks as the 10th busiest travel corridor in the country, and eastbound on the Stevenson from the Dan Ryan to Cicero Avenue at 4pm ranks 12th in the nation. </span></p>
<p><span>The report also showed travel trends reflecting changes in Chicago’s downtown. As the Loop approaches one of its </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/state-street-downtown-vacancy-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span>highest storefront vacancies in decades</span></a><span>, Chicago’s year-over-year trips to its city center decreased by 1%, the only U.S. city in the report to experience a reduction.</span></p>
<p><span>The damages done to travelers aren't just to their psyches, either. The cost of lost time and general price of congestion averaged out to $1,672 per Chicago driver, according to the report. On a wider scale, the study estimates the city of Chicago lost $6.1 billion in 2023 from congestion alone. Economic costs were calculated from hourly values of time via the Federal Highway Administration.</span></p>
<p>While there is no proven cause for the increase in congestion, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/06/25/its-not-your-imagination-chicago-traffic-has-gotten-worse-since-the-pandemic-report-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">experts speculate</a> that the online shopping boom has resulted in more freight traffic. Decreased public transit ridership has also led to worsening congestion on the roads over the years. </p>

And, while that may be good news for borrowers, it could mean that savers earn smaller returns on the money they set aside.

Of course, you'll have to agree to keep your money in the account for its entire term to lock today's high rates in, but that may be a good thing too.
