<li>Eli Lilly's experimental Alzheimer's drug, donanemab, has been recommended for approval by a panel of independent advisors to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</li>
<li>The FDA typically follows the recommendations of its advisory panels, but is not required to do so. If approved, donanemab would become the second Alzheimer's drug of its kind to enter the US market, after Biogen's Leqembi.</li>
<li>An approval would expand treatment options for the over 6 million Americans living with Alzheimer's, the fifth-leading cause of death for adults over 65.</li>
<li>The FDA advisory panel voted unanimously in favor of the drug, stating that the available data shows donanemab is effective in treating Alzheimer's patients at early stages of the disease.</li>
<li>However, some advisors noted that more data is needed on the drug's effectiveness in Black and Hispanic patients, as well as other groups, before it can be widely approved.</li>

But several advisors noted that more data is needed on donanemab in Black and Hispanic patients, among other groups.</p><p>In a second vote, advisors unanimously said the benefits of Eli Lilly’s donanemab outweigh its risks.<strong> </strong></p><p>“There’s a huge unmet medical need here that hopefully can be addressed,” temporary committee member Sarah Dolan said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/LPdOPydM18E" target="_blank">a meeting</a> on Monday. Dolan is a consultant for the non-profit organization Critical Path Institute, which aims to improve the drug development process.</p><p>The recommendation follows snags Eli Lilly faced in bringing the treatment to market.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>The FDA in March called a last-minute meeting of an advisory panel to further review the safety and efficacy of Eli Lilly’s drug in a late-stage trial, just weeks before the agency’s deadline to rule on the treatment.</p><p>It was another blow to Eli Lilly, which initially expected donanameb to win approval at the end of last year. The FDA also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/20/eli-lillys-alzheimers-drug-hits-fda-hurdle-what-it-means-for-the-stock.html">rejected</a> the drug in January last year, saying it had insufficient data to greenlight it. </p><p>Leqembi and donanemab are milestones in the treatment of Alzheimer’s after three decades of failed efforts to develop medicines that can fight the fatal disease. </p><p>Both drugs are monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid plaque in the brain, considered a hallmark of Alzheimer’s, to slow the progression of the disease in patients at the early stages of it. </p><p>But neither of the treatments are cures.</p><p>Drugs that target and clear amyloid plaque can also cause brain swelling and bleeding in patients, which in some cases can be severe and even fatal. Three patients who took Eli Lilly’s drug in a late-stage trial died from severe cases of those side effects, called amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA.</p><p>A host of hurdles has slowed Leqembi’s rollout since its approval in July, including the steps needed to diagnose Alzheimer’s and monitor and handle the weekly infusions required with the drug. Biogen and Eisai signaled in April that they are seeing adoption pick up.</p><p>In a note Sunday, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said he expects limited commercial adoption of donanemab relative to Leqembi because Eli Lilly’s drug has “more safety liabilities” and will be less convenient, since it is administered once a month through the veins. That is a method known as intravenous infusion. </p><p>Leqembi is currently administered through twice-monthly infusions, but Biogen expects to launch an injectable version of the drug next year, Risinger noted. He expects donanemab to rake in $500 million in sales by the end of the decade. </p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline0"></a>How effective is Eli Lilly’s Alzheimer’s drug?</h2><div class="group"><p>Eli Lilly’s phase three trial on more than 1,700 patients found that donanemab slowed the progression of Alzheimer’s by 29% compared to a placebo after around 18 months, based on a traditional tool used to measure the severity of dementia.</p><p>Those results are comparable to those seen with Leqembi. </p><p>Patients in Eli Lilly’s phase three trial needed to test positive on a PET scan for amyloid plaque and another protein in the brain called tau, which is thought to be a marker of Alzheimer’s severity. People with no or very low levels of tau were not included in the primary analysis of the trial because researchers thought their disease was less likely to progress during the study. </p><p>Eli Lilly’s trial mainly focused on patients with low-to-medium levels of tau, who appeared to benefit more from the treatment than those with high tau.</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107179321" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"></p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Westend61 | Westend61 | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>Eli Lilly argued that patients should be tested for amyloid plague to be eligible for the drug, but not for tau. The company said it tested for tau in the trial to enroll patients whose condition was expected to worsen, which made it more likely for the study to “clearly determine” the drug’s effect. </p><p>Most advisors agreed that tau tests should not be required to access donanemab because it would likely restrict the population who can benefit from the drug.</p><p>“From a very practical perspective, I think this would be not a wise thing to to have as a barrier,” said temporary committee member Dr. Kathleen Poston, a professor in neurology, neurological sciences and neurosurgery at Stanford University, during the meeting on Monday.</p><p>Patients taking Eli Lilly’s drug in the trial were eligible to switch over to a placebo if amyloid levels in their brains fell below a certain threshold. By the end of the trial, 60% of participants on donanemab were able to stop treatment.</p><p>Dolan said allowing patients to discontinue the drug when enough amyloid has been cleared could be a “motivational factor” for patients to comply with their infusions and regular testing.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline1"></a>Risks of brain swelling, bleeding</h2><div class="group"><p>Around 24% of trial participants who took donanemab experienced brain swelling, while 31% experienced brain bleeding. </p><p>The majority of those ARIA cases were mild to moderate, as 6% of participants with brain swelling and 1% with brain bleeding experienced symptoms. They included headache, confusion, dizziness, nausea and in rare cases, seizures.</p><p>Serious cases occurred in 1.5% of patients with brain swelling and less than 1% with brain bleeding.</p><p>If donanemab is approved, FDA staff said they expect the drug’s label to include a strong “boxed” warning about the risks of brain swelling and bleeding, especially for people with two copies of a gene called ApoE4. They also expect recommendations for MRIs to monitor for those side effects in patients, among other strategies.</p><p>That is consistent with Leqembi’s approval label.</p><p>There were 19 deaths in participants on donanemab, including the three attributed to Eli Lilly’s drug, within the 18-month trial, according to a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/179166/download" target="_blank">final analysis of data</a> by FDA staff. That compares to 16 deaths in patients on placebo, reflecting a smaller imbalance in the number of deaths between people who took donanemab and those who didn’t.</p></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

    <p>Here are five key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Market Reversal</strong>: Despite initially opening lower, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes ended the day higher, with Nvidia's stock recovering after an early sell-off due to its 10-for-1 stock split.</li>
<li><strong>Data Center Buildout and Power Generation</strong>: The CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer highlighted the strong comeback in this theme, with stocks such as Eaton, Dell Technologies, and Vistra Energy trading higher, fueled by declining concerns about data centers and the Justice Department.</li>
<li><strong>Apple WWDC</strong>: The annual Apple World Wide Developers Conference drew attention, with Apple announcing new software updates, features, and markets for the Future Pro, as well as new healthcare tools for the Apple Watch. The stock rallied initially but sold off subsequently.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise Software Concerns</strong>: Jim Cramer expressed concerns about the threat to enterprise software, specifically Salesforce, from Nvidia's AI advancements, citing a research piece by Melius. ServiceNow's partnership with Nvidia may exempt it from these concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Upcoming Events</strong>: There are no major earnings reports or economic data expected until Wednesday, when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) updates its summary of economic projections and the May CPI report is released, potentially leading to a holding pattern in the market.</li>

Market reverse: The markets initially opened lower Monday as volatility in the European markets spilled over into the United States. But both the S &amp; P 500 and the Nasdaq climbed out of the red and turned slightly higher while Nvidia flipped positive, overcoming some early selling tied to its 10-for-1 stock split. Power on: We’re seeing a strong comeback in the date center buildout-electricity-power generation theme, which has been more volatile of late. Club stock Eaton traded more than 2% higher at one point Monday after pulling back more than 5% last week. Other names in the data center buildout complex are Dell Technologies , Vertiv , and Super Micro Computer , and, to a lesser extent, Dover Corp . Some names in the power generation theme are Vistra Energy , Constellation Energy , and GE Vernova . Jim Cramer added: “The worry about data centers and the Justice Department is forgotten as of today, with Enphase , Constellation on fire.” The solar stocks were trading higher, too. Apple watch: We’re keeping an eye on the big headlines coming from Apple’s annual World Wide Developers Conference. The focus so far has been on what’s coming to Apple TV+, a new major software update to the Vision Pro (which will also be sold in many new markets, including China), improved personalization tools, a new Tap to Cash feature for the wallet , and some health-care tools for the watch . As usual, it’s a lot of incremental features and the stock rallied into the event so there’s been some selling on the news. We’re still waiting on the intelligence section of the presentation when we expect to learn more about what’s happening in AI. SaaS challenges: Jim is concerned about enterprise software after the Melius research piece on Monday about how enterprise software — specifically software-as-a-service subscriptions of all kinds, including Salesforce — could be threatened by Nvidia . “I didn’t see a lot of software as a service execs at GTC [Nvidia’s big AI conference in March],” Jim said. “I do know that ServiceNow may be exempt given its partnership with Nvidia.” Up next: There are no major earning reports after the close or Tuesday before the opening bell. No major economic data until Wednesday when we’ll see May’s CPI report and the FOMC’s updates to its summary of economic projections. We would not be surprised to see the market trade in somewhat of a holding pattern before these two key events. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer’s Charitable Trust.)

PacifiCorp plans to get carbon-free power from the reactor and says it is weighing how much nuclear to include in its long-range planning.</p><p>The work begun Monday is aimed at having the site ready so TerraPower can build the reactor as quickly as possible if its permit is approved. <a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/fast-neutron-reactors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Russia is at the forefront;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="0">Russia is at the forefront</a> for developing sodium-cooled reactors.</p><p>Gates told the audience at the groundbreaking that they were “standing on what will soon be the bedrock of America’s energy future.”</p><p>“This is a big step toward safe, abundant, zero-carbon energy,” Gates said. “And it’s important for the future of this country that projects like this succeed.”</p><p>Advanced reactors typically use a coolant other than water and operate at lower pressures and higher temperatures. Such technology has been around for decades, but the United States has continued to build large, conventional water-cooled reactors as commercial power plants. The Wyoming project is the first time in about four decades that a company has tried to get an advanced reactor up and running as a commercial power plant in the United States, according to the NRC.</p><p>It’s time to move to advanced nuclear technology that uses the latest computer modeling and physics for a simpler plant design that’s cheaper, even safer and more efficient, said Chris Levesque, the company’s president and chief executive officer.</p><p>TerraPower's Natrium reactor demonstration project is a sodium-cooled fast reactor design with a molten salt energy storage system.</p><p>“The industry’s character hasn’t been to innovate. It’s kind of been to repeat past performance, you know, not to move forward with new technology. And that was good for reliability,” Levesque said in an interview. “But the electricity demands we’re seeing in the coming decades, and also to correct the cost issues with today’s nuclear and nuclear energy, we at TerraPower and our founders really felt it’s time to innovate.”</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>A Georgia utility just finished <a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-nuclear-plant-energy-secretary-granholm-05a6e2444a8b5a9e9c7c61b111b87192" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the first two scratch-built American reactors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="0">the first two scratch-built American reactors</a> in a generation at a cost of nearly $35 billion. The price tag for the expansion of Plant Vogtle from two of the traditional large reactors to four includes $11 billion in cost overruns.</p><p>The TerraPower project is expected to cost up to $4 billion, half of it from the U.S. Department of Energy. Levesque said that figure includes first-of-its-kind costs for designing and licensing the reactor, so future ones would cost significantly less.</p><p>Most advanced nuclear reactors under development in the U.S. rely on a type of fuel — known as high-assay low-enriched uranium — that's enriched to a higher percentage of the isotope uranium-235 than the fuel used by conventional reactors. TerraPower delayed its launch date in Wyoming by two years to 2030 because Russia is the only commercial supplier of the fuel, and it’s working with other companies to develop alternate supplies. The U.S. Energy Department is working on <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/us-department-energy-haleu-consortium" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:developing it domestically;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="0">developing it domestically</a>.</p><p>Edwin Lyman co-authored an article in Science on Thursday that raises concerns that this fuel could be used for nuclear weapons. Lyman, the director of nuclear power safety with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the risk posed by HALEU today is small because there isn’t that much of it around the world. But that will change if advanced reactor projects, which require much larger quantities, move forward, he added. Lyman said he wants to raise awareness of the danger in the hope that the international community will strengthen security around the fuel.</p><p>NRC spokesperson Scott Burnell said the agency is confident its current requirements will maintain both security and public safety of any reactors that are built and their fuel.</p><p>Gates co-founded TerraPower in 2008 as a way for the private sector to propel advanced nuclear energy forward to provide safe, abundant, carbon-free energy.</p><p>The company's 345-megawatt reactor could generate up to 500 megawatts at its peak, enough for up to 400,000 homes. TerraPower said its first few reactors will focus on supplying electricity. But it envisions future reactors could be built near industrial plants to supply high heat.</p><p>Nearly all industrial processes requiring high heat currently get it from burning fossil fuels. Heat from advanced reactors could be used to produce hydrogen, petrochemicals, ammonia and fertilizer, said John Kotek at the Nuclear Energy Institute.</p><p>It’s significant that Gates, a technological innovator and climate champion, is betting on nuclear power to help address the climate crisis, added Kotek, the industry group’s senior vice president for policy.</p><p>“I think this has helped open people’s eyes to the role that nuclear power does play today and can play in the future in addressing carbon emissions," he said. “There’s tremendous momentum building for new nuclear in the U.S. and the potential use of a far wider range of nuclear energy technology than we’ve seen in decades.”</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

        <div class="content article-descr news-summary">
    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Volvo is recalling all 72,000 EX30 models</strong>: The recall is due to a software error that causes the center monitor to display a "test screen" instead of normal driving statistics, including the speedometer.</li>
<li><strong>The issue affects the central screen display</strong>: The bug prevents important information, such as speed, from being displayed, which could lead to reckless or cautious driving.</li>
<li><strong>The fix is an over-the-air software update</strong>: Owners do not need to take their cars to a dealership; instead, they can download and install the update, version 1.3.1, which resolves the issue.</li>
<li><strong>This is not Volvo's first software issue</strong>: The company previously delayed the launch of its EX90 model to focus on software development. The stakes are high for software development in the automotive industry.</li>
<li><strong>Software issues are common across the industry</strong>: The article notes that the car industry is introducing more complex software features, and issues arise when these systems rely on software to function properly, as seen in the Cruise self-driving taxi incident.</li>

    <div><div id="body">
<p>Volvo has announced a recall of every single EX30, nearly 72k in all, and it's all because of a relatively minor software error.</p>
<p>In a statement released today, the Sweden-based car manufacturer says EX30 vehicles can accidentally throw up a "test screen" on the center monitor, obscuring the normal driving statistics shown there including the speedometer and infotainment features. The exact cause of the bug has yet to be disclosed.</p>
<p>The issue first emerged last month when Volvo announced a recall for 1,255 specifically in Australia.</p>

    

<p>"Due to a software error, the infotainment unit screen may enter a test mode during startup of the vehicle. This may prevent key information such as the vehicle's speed from being displayed," the Australian recall <a href="https://www.vehiclerecalls.gov.au/recalls/rec-005968" rel="nofollow">says</a>. "Failure to display key information may potentially increase the risk of injury or death to vehicle occupants and other road users."</p>

        


        

<p>What makes the bug especially problematic is that, unlike almost every other car, all of Volvo's car statistics and info like speed are located on the central screen and nowhere else. When that test screen error occurs, drivers are left in the dark about exactly how fast they're going, and that could lead to driving that's too reckless or too cautious, neither of which are great.</p>
<p>Thankfully for EX30 owners, they won't need to take their cars into the shop or to dealers in order to get the error patched. An update, termed version 1.3.1, is now available over the air so that any user can download and install it.</p>

        

<p>This isn't the first time Volvo has run into software issues with its newer cars. The higher-end EX90 actually got delayed by half a year purely to focus on software development, according to Volvo's public declarations. The stakes are high when it comes to software and potential issues, especially when important components of a vehicle rely directly on software to work properly.</p>

<p>It's not even an issue that uniquely plagues Volvo, as the whole car industry is introducing more cutting-edge software features and moving existing functions to the car's central computer.</p>
<p>That's especially true when it comes to self-driving, which has to run on a computer no matter what. In one instance, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/08/cruise_selfdriving_software_update/">Cruise had to update its robo taxis</a> so they could recognize when they've hit a person who is already down low or on the ground. That update was a direct response to an incident where a Cruise robo-taxi drove over a pedestrian who was already on the road after having been hit by a different vehicle, instead of just stopping after the collision happened. ®</p>

                    <p class="col-sm-12 article-lead">Then Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz asked <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/steve-jobs" title="Steve Jobs" data-kpt="1">Steve Jobs</a> for advice and got a profane tirade in response —  which he says he later wished he'd listened to.
</p><div class="col-sm-12"><p>In 2008, Schultz reportedly asked many people for advice about problems he was having with the Starbucks coffee company. But perhaps his wisest choice was Steve Jobs, who the following year would be named the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/09/12/21/apples_steve_jobs_named_worlds_best_performing_ceo">worlds' best performing</a> CEO by Harvard Business Review.
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>However, speaking on the <em>Acquired</em> podcast —  a <a href="https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/starbucks-with-howard-schultz">business series</a> beloved by Apple's <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/eddy-cue" title="Eddy Cue" data-kpt="1">Eddy Cue</a> —  Schultz said he didn't think Jobs was serious.
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>"Basically, we took a walk... [and] I just told him all my problems, everything that was going on," said Schultz. "He just stopped me and said: 'This is what you need to do,'" continued the Starbucks CEO. "'You go back to Seattle and you fire everyone on your leadership team.' I thought he was joking."
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>"'I just told you,'" continued Jobs. "F***** fire all those people."
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>"He was screaming in my face," said Schultz. "I said 'Steve, I can't fire all these people, who's going to do the work?'"
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>"He said: 'I promise you in six months, maybe nine, they'll be gone,'" continued Schultz. "He was right. Except for one, the general counsel, they were all gone."
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>So Schultz had ignored Jobs's advice and continued for that time with a dwindling leadership team. At some point later, Schultz says he met Jobs at an event and told him that he had been right, that they had all left.
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>"'Well, you're six months, nine months late,'" said Jobs, "think about all the things you could've done."
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>Schultz doesn't say if he were annoyed by Jobs. But even if he were, some years after these exchanges, he had Starbucks <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/06/19/starbucks-bought-23000-ipads-for-racial-bias-training-day">buy 23,000 iPads</a> for staff training.</p></div><p></p>

Over the last decade, Nvidia went from a little-discussed Silicon Valley company worth around $10 billion to the talk of Wall Street, as its profits exploded due to its market dominance in AI chips, with the likes of Amazon, Apple and Microsoft among its big-ticket customers. Thanks largely to the eye popping rally over the last two years with the AI boom, Nvidia stock’s long-term chart looks downright silly, with split-adjusted shares trading at less than $1 as recently as 2016. Nvidia was among the 10 most expensive S&amp;P 500 components by share price at Friday’s close, but is now in line with the S&amp;P median of $118 per share.

<ol>
<li>Scammers are using fake social media accounts on X (formerly Twitter) to impersonate major UK airlines, tricking customers into giving away personal data.</li>
<li>Fake accounts exist for every major UK airline on X, including EasyJet, and are regularly used to carry out scams.</li>
<li>According to consumer association Which?, X is too slow to take down offending accounts that impersonate organizations.</li>
<li>X has a "misleading and deceptive identities policy" that prohibits accounts that impersonate organizations, and such accounts may be permanently suspended.</li>
<li>X claims to have taken down all the fake accounts identified by Which?, but the scam persists, highlighting concerns over the platform's inability to effectively prevent and remove fake accounts.</li>

<p>NuScale is one of many nuclear and battery startups aiming to capitalize on AI’s energy intensity. Typical data centers use about 32 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 6,000 homes, compared with about 80 megawatts for AI-oriented data centers, said Doug Vine, director of analysis at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, an environmental policy think tank in Arlington, Virginia. “And they need energy-dense systems, which, unfortunately, is why natural gas plants are still popular. But the same thing is true of nuclear power,” he said. “From a very small footprint, you can generate a lot of electricity.”</p><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-17" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text">Rendering of a nuclear power plant using NuScale's small modular reactor technology.</p><small class="color-body light-text">NuScale</small></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nvidia’s H100 chip, loaded with eight GPUs and two CPUs, is the most in-demand AI server box for data centers, said Arman Shehabi, a Lawrence Berkeley Lab who’s tracked data center power demands since 2007. He estimates that each one uses eight to 10 kilowatts of electricity, versus previous servers, which would use a fraction of that. They generate so much heat that cooling them uses up to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00478-x#ref-CR1" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00478-x#ref-CR1" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00478-x#ref-CR1" aria-label="30% more water">30% more water</a> than traditional data centers. Globally, AI demand may use up to 6.6 billion cubic meters of water in 2027, or “more than the total annual water withdrawal of Denmark or half of the United Kingdom,” according to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03271" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03271" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03271" aria-label="Cornell University study">Cornell University study</a>.</p>
<p>“They're so heat dense and so power dense, they’re up in the range of 70 to 80 kilowatts per rack. And there’s talk that’s going to go up to 100 kilowatts really soon,” Shehabi said. “It's basically 10 times higher than servers used in the past.”</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-1"><p id="article-0-topx-1"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>Companies like Microsoft are also making plans to use SMRs to power their AI data centers, and company founder Bill Gates is chairman of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2024/03/19/terrapower-what-we-know-about-bill-gatess-nuclear-power-plant-in-wyoming/?sh=5f06e84a350f" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2024/03/19/terrapower-what-we-know-about-bill-gatess-nuclear-power-plant-in-wyoming/?sh=5f06e84a350f" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2024/03/19/terrapower-what-we-know-about-bill-gatess-nuclear-power-plant-in-wyoming/?sh=5f06e84a350f" aria-label="TerraPower">TerraPower</a>, which is developing a new kind of sodium reactor that also uses salt to store energy. OpenAI’s Sam Altman is backing Oklo, a developer of small fission reactors that recently went public, as well as Helion, one of many startups attempting to commercialize nuclear fusion, a compelling carbon-free power source that’s free of problematic nuclear waste. Still, it’s unlikely any fusion-based systems will become commercially viable until the 2030s.</p><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light">
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"><strong>Microreactors</strong></h2>
<p>SMRs aren’t the only nuclear option. Smaller microreactors like those developed by Radiant Nuclear can be used to replace dirty diesel backup generators or provide data centers with a little extra energy boost as needed. The Los Angeles-based company plans to sell 1-megawatt units that can be shipped directly from a factory by truck or airplane.</p><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-16" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text">Rendering of Radiant's Kaleidos micro-reactors helping power a data center.</p><small class="color-body light-text">Radiant Nuclear</small></figcaption></figure>
<p>“They arrive in a single container and can just be set up and turned on,” CEO Doug Bernauer told <em>Forbes</em>. “That means if you suddenly needed a little bit of extra power at a data center, you could do that. Or if you wanted to set up a data center on the edge or in a microgrid, it may be very suitable for that. It takes just a couple of days to set up a unit and bring it up to full power.”</p>
<p>Radiant has raised $60 million of venture capital, led by Andreessen Horowitz, and wants to start delivering commercial units late this decade – assuming testing at Idaho National Laboratory goes well.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-2"><p id="article-0-topx-2"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>While nuclear power systems create no carbon emissions and are increasingly seen as a necessary component of a net-zero energy system, they still have a long-term challenge of safely storing spent radioactive fuel rods and other dangerous materials. Some companies are trying stationary fuel cells powered by carbon-free green hydrogen, though the supply of that clean fuel may not be cheap and plentiful for several years.</p><blockquote class="embed-base quote-embed embed-32 bg-accent color-base font-accent font-size text-align"><p>“If you wanted to set up a data center on the edge or in a microgrid, it may be very suitable for that.”

<p>Another potential source is geothermal energy systems, being developed by startups like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2024/02/29/geothermal-startup-raises-244-million-to-drill-hot-rocks-in-utah/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2024/02/29/geothermal-startup-raises-244-million-to-drill-hot-rocks-in-utah/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2024/02/29/geothermal-startup-raises-244-million-to-drill-hot-rocks-in-utah/" aria-label="Fervo">Fervo</a>. Late last year, Google began testing Fervo’s system – it uses a horizontal drilling technique to tap into underground geothermal reservoirs of hot water to power generators – in Nevada that may be used for a data center.</p><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light">
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"><strong>Sodium Batteries</strong></h2>
<p>Regardless of what type of energy data centers are using, Colin Wessells, cofounder and co-CEO of Natron Energy, has created a new type of battery that is uniquely suited to one of the particularities of AI data centers: GPU chips can demand sudden surges of power. It’s “like a heartbeat,” Wessells told <em>Forbes</em>. “And that can cause stability issues for the grid.”</p>
<p>Natron Energy is among the first companies to begin selling sodium-ion batteries, which are well-suited to smoothing out those surges in power when AI servers “overclock” their standard compute speed. They act like a buffer that can smooth out the distribution of electricity to prevent overloads, “shaving the peak” off those surges. “We're doing real-time energy management to support the compute as opposed to being just backup power.”</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-3"><p id="article-0-topx-3"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>Sodium batteries have other benefits too: they can be recharged frequently without the kind of degradation that limits the life of lithium cells and, importantly, don’t catch on fire. Instead of holding electricity for a long time like the lithium-ion batteries in your electronics, they’re better at recharging quickly and shooting out power far more rapidly. “We’re driving a race car, not a Prius,” Wessells said. “We don’t have the range but we’ve got crazy speed.”</p><blockquote class="embed-base quote-embed embed-27 bg-accent color-base font-accent font-size text-align"><p>“We’re driving a race car, not a Prius. We don’t have the range but we’ve got crazy speed.”
</p><footer class="text-align">Colin Wessells, Natron Energy co-CEO</footer></blockquote>
<p>Wessells now expects a major portion of the Santa Clara, California, startup’s initial revenue to come from data centers catering to AI applications. It’s shipping commercial units from a pilot line in Santa Clara and in a few months begins deliveries from a new plant in Michigan that opened this year.</p><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-15" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text">Natron's sodium-ion battery is designed to rapidly disburse large amounts of electricity.</p><small class="color-body light-text">Natron Energy</small></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even though his batteries use lower-cost raw materials than lithium-ion cells, namely iron and manganese, they aren’t cheaper yet because they’re a new technology and there’s not yet a large supply base making the anodes and cathodes they use. As the sodium battery market grows, that should change later in the decade. But because of the demand from data centers, initial customers aren’t particularly concerned about price at this point, Wessells said.</p>
<p>“We targeted data centers as our initial market in 2014, so it's been a full 10 years that we've been designing the product for this use case,” he said. “For the longest time, it was challenging for investors to understand this. They were saying, ‘Why the hell aren't you trying to build car batteries like every other battery company out there?’ Now it's really flipped in the past year. The market is going crazy.”</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-4"><p id="article-0-topx-4"></p></fbs-ad>

They don’t actually measure your blood sugar but instead measure glucose in interstitial fluid — the stuff between your cells — just under the skin. Thus far, they’ve generally been used for people with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who rely on insulin for treatment. However, there’s been a growing push among medical device makers and health tech startups to see whether the tech can help non-insulin dependent diabetics, people with prediabetes, or people who wish to improve their metabolic health.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">According to Abbott’s <a href="https://abbott.mediaroom.com/2024-06-10-Abbott-Receives-U-S-FDA-Clearance-for-Two-New-Over-the-Counter-Continuous-Glucose-Monitoring-Systems#assets_2429_124654-111">press release</a>, <a href="https://www.hellolingo.com/us">Lingo</a> is meant to be a “consumer wearable” for people 18 years and older. Like Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre CGMs, it’s worn on the upper arm for 14 days and glucose data can be sent to a smartphone app. In the app, users will be able to view coaching insights into a person’s reactions to certain foods, exercise, and stress.

Typically, CGMs require a prescription to obtain, which can deter folks who don’t technically “need” a CGM but could benefit from using one. Improved accessibility may give people with prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes a more effective means of monitoring how certain lifestyle changes affect their condition.
