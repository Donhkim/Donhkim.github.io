  <p>GLP-1 drugs, which stands for glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists, help people feel fuller and less hungry, aiding their efforts to lose weight. But the brand-name versions made by a handful of pharmaceutical companies can be pricey, with Novo Nordisk's Wegovy costing about $1,350 a month, or more than $16,00 a year, without insurance, according to <a href="https://www.goodrx.com/wegovy/wegovy-for-weight-loss-cost-coverage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">GoodRx</a>. </p><p>Hims &amp; Hers Health's may also beat out competitors on another key metric: availability.

<p>The company added that it will also sell brand-name versions of GLP-1 drugs, once supply rebounds. </p><p>"We've leveraged our size and scale to secure access to one of the highest-quality supplies of compounded GLP-1 injections available today," Hims &amp; Hers Health CEO and co-founder Andrew Dudum said in a statement Monday.

    <div><p>Something has caught Satya Nadella’s attention. It’s a small thing—just a five-letter word inside a box, lurking in the corner of a complicated PowerPoint slide, flashed on a screen for a fraction of a second inside a convention hall in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. But it niggles. “You’re doing also Llama? You’re using both?” Nadella asks, a note of surprise in his voice.</p><div class="paywall paywallActive">



<p><a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/18/meta-ai-llama-3-open-source-ai-increasing-competition/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/18/meta-ai-llama-3-open-source-ai-increasing-competition/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">Llama</a> is the AI model, not the animal. It is a piece of open-source software created by Meta, the social media giant that has pivoted hard to AI and is competing with <a href="https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">Microsoft</a> and others to dominate the foundations of the emerging generative AI economy. “Both” is a reference to the fact that this Malaysian agriculture technology company—chosen to show off its use of Microsoft’s technology to Microsoft’s CEO— is using Meta’s rival AI model in addition to GPT-4, the large language model (LLM) created by Microsoft’s strategic partner, <a href="https://fortune.com/tag/openai/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/tag/openai/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">OpenAI</a>. Nadella wants his Redmond, Wash.–based software giant to have the most capable, popular AI models on the market. </p>



<p>“Um, yep, so we are, we are using Llama also,” says Adrian Lee, the chief technology officer at Agroz, the Malaysian startup, a hint of embarrassment in his reply. Agroz, which builds hydroponic farms, has created an AI chatbot to answer farmers’ questions about how best to tend their lettuce and bok choy.  </p>



<p>“What are you using Llama for?” Nadella asks pointedly, standing before Lee at Agroz’s exhibition kiosk.</p>



<p>Agroz, Lee explains, eventually wants to use humanoid robots for farming, and the robots may need to operate offline. Some versions of Meta’s Llama model are compact enough to be embedded in robots or phones, unlike the larger GPT-4. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“Take a look at Phi,” Nadella says, switching from CEO-as-chief-market-researcher to CEO-as-chief-salesman. Phi is a family of small language models Microsoft has built in-house and offered, like Llama, as open-source software. Nadella apparently knows the parameter count of the smallest Phi model off the top of his head, and he rattles it off—just 3.8 billion parameters, making it small enough to run “on the edge.” </p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><span><span></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive"><noscript></noscript></span><figcaption>Nadella meets with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Malaysia in May. The CEO’s message to leaders: AI could become their economic rocket fuel.</figcaption><p class="image-credit">Annice Lyn—Getty Images for Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Lee says Agroz will experiment with Phi. Meanwhile Agroz’s CEO Gerard Lim offers Nadella some Agroz-grown bok choy. “Oh, you want me to eat it?” Nadella says. He takes a small piece. “Mmmm,” he says, chewing vigorously, and, no doubt, chewing over the lesson about how perilously competitive the AI race is. </p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>It’s a telling exchange. Few companies have benefited as much from the generative AI boom as Microsoft. <a href="https://fortune.com/company/investor/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/investor/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">Investor</a> fervor for the technology has helped make Nadella’s company a perennial contender for the title of the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/12/microsoft-surpasses-apple-most-valuable-public-company/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/01/12/microsoft-surpasses-apple-most-valuable-public-company/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">world’s most valuable corporation</a>, with a market cap that consistently bobs somewhere in excess of $3 trillion. </p>



<p>When Nadella <a href="https://fortune.com/2014/02/04/microsoft-nadella-named-ceo-thompson-named-chairman/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2014/02/04/microsoft-nadella-named-ceo-thompson-named-chairman/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">took the reins</a> at Microsoft in 2014, the company was floundering. Under his predecessor, Steve Ballmer, it had missed the smartphone revolution, was lagging on tablets, and was even losing market share in the PC operating system business that made it a household name. Microsoft’s shares had fallen more than 40% during Ballmer’s tenure. In 10-plus years as CEO, Nadella has reinvigorated the company, successfully steering it through two technological transformations: from PCs to the era of cloud computing, and now, to the age of AI. Nadella’s prescient and early bet on OpenAI and its technology, and the fruitful-if-sometimes-tense relationship that ensued, have given Microsoft as good a shot as any company at supremacy in this new era. The company arguably hasn’t been this powerful since it dominated the PC market in the 1990s’ “Wintel” era. </p>



<p>But as Nadella begins his second decade at the helm, there’s no guarantee Microsoft will retain its lead. Regulators, hackers, and rivals each present threats serious enough to potentially undermine its industry leadership. Above all, it must reckon with its own leviathan size—and avoid becoming a victim of bureaucracy and bloat when AI’s protean nature calls for speed, agility and finesse.</p>



<p>Nadella’s approach to leadership reflects his acute awareness of these risks. Even when seemingly ahead of the pack on AI, he and his team are constantly listening, their corporate antennae sensitive to the tiniest pivots in users’ needs and preferences. Microsoft is continually investing in technologies and talent that might someday supplant OpenAI’s models—or even supplant generative AI altogether. In other sectors, such hypervigilance might seem like overkill, even paranoia. But as Nadella knows as well as anyone, in tech, platform shifts happen frequently and fast. Blink for a second too long and you’re chasing the future, not making it. </p>



<hr class="sc-fa0656e5-0 hDabQp">



<p>Nadella’s jet-setting tour of Southeast Asia in late April and early May—Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia in just three days—showcases AI’s rapid progress. At each stop, he meets <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/31/malaysia-prime-minister-anwar-ibrahim-interview-elon-musk-economy-corruption/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/08/31/malaysia-prime-minister-anwar-ibrahim-interview-elon-musk-economy-corruption/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">government leaders</a> eager to understand how AI can boost their economies and software developers building AI products—from personal tutors to “copilots” for fish farmers—as sophisticated as any of their counterparts in the U.S. or Europe. </p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>“The thing that is striking to me is the rate of diffusion,” Nadella tells me when I sit down with him in Jakarta. “If I had come to Indonesia in the second year of cloud, or even the server, obviously, there would have been some adoption, but it wouldn’t have been this broad and this fast.” </p>



<p>The pace of AI’s diffusion is only possible, he says, because it builds on previous innovations, in particular cloud computing, the area where Nadella spent much of his career prior to becoming CEO. It is hard to democratize technology, he notes, when people can’t actually access it in large swaths of the world. But today that’s no longer true. The internet, smartphones, and the cloud are omnipresent.</p>



<p>In one sense, Microsoft navigated the platform shift to the cloud so well, and has so deftly played the opening round of the platform shift to AI, that its future success seems assured. If AI increases economic productivity, which most analysts think likely, global GDP growth should accelerate too, while tech will represent a bigger piece of this enlarged economic pie. Combined, Nadella says, this ought to mean that Microsoft—whose top line has been accelerating at a double-digit annual pace even with economic growth fairly constant at 3%—has nothing to worry about. It helps explain why investors love Microsoft—it looks like a no-lose bet. (Its share price has risen 11-fold under Nadella.) “Microsoft’s growth prospects are pretty straightforward,” Nadella says. “Just do a good job of what we do.” </p>



<p>But, of course, “just doing what we do,” isn’t simple. There are a thousand ways a colossus like Microsoft can lose its way. It has before—it largely missed mobile, after all. And of the three big technological innovations Nadella famously said in 2017 would shape Microsoft’s future—AI, quantum computing, and mixed reality—the company has really only hit the jackpot with AI. It sank billions into its HoloLens mixed-reality glasses, billing them as “augmented reality for business,” before discontinuing work on the hardware and laying off most of the mixed- and virtual-reality teams in early 2023. It invested $1 billion in a swing-for-the-fences drive to develop a quantum computer based on an exotic subatomic particle called a Majorana fermion that has so far failed to result in a commercially viable machine. For now, Microsoft has fallen back on offering quantum services through a partnership with Quantinuum, a company that is partly a spinoff of Honeywell’s quantum tech.</p>



<p>Nadella says the idea of missing the next big technological leap keeps him up at night. “When the paradigm shifts, do you have something to contribute?” he asks. “Because there is no God-given right to exist if you don’t have anything relevant.” That in turn, he says, requires “a culture that allows you to build capability long before it is conventional wisdom that you need that, to come up with new concepts.” </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><br>“When the paradigm shifts, do you have something to contribute? Because there is no God-given right to exist if you don’t have anything relevant.”</p><cite>Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nadella says build. But <em>find</em> might be more accurate. For an executive who spent nearly his entire career at Microsoft, Nadella is surprisingly willing to go outside the organization to obtain the innovation on which the company’s future depends—whether through acquisitions, partnerships, or hiring. Nadella tells me he also closely tracks how many senior and junior people Microsoft is hiring from other tech companies, seeing the influx as critical to ensuring the company doesn’t become sclerotic. “The only way to keep yourself honest is to bring senior talent that comes from the outside and keeps you intellectually grounded,” he says. </p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>Those who have worked closely with Nadella say he acts decisively when he senses a big strategic opportunity. His record as acquirer-in-chief supports that idea. To cement Microsoft’s position as the hub for all digital business activity and to expand the company into social networking, he spent $26 billion to acquire <a href="https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">LinkedIn</a> in 2016. Two years later, he bought the open-source software code repository GitHub for $7.5 billion in stock. That deal gave Microsoft a better window into what legions of software developers were working on, helping it spot trends, and also gave the company a purchase point for selling those developers on other Microsoft products. More recently, he spent $75 billion to buy video game giant <a href="https://fortune.com/company/activision-blizzard/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/activision-blizzard/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">Activision Blizzard</a>. The deal was alternately couched as Microsoft’s “metaverse” play or about acquiring content for its Xbox hardware franchise, but as some analysts pointed out, the more compelling strategic logic was ensuring Microsoft’s cloud is where the world’s most valuable entertainment medium gets built and run.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s dependency on a pipeline of innovation—and innovators—from outside the ranks of its own 221,000 employees has been most glaring when it comes to AI. In 2019, Kevin Scott, a veteran engineer who came to Microsoft when the company acquired LinkedIn, and who Nadella subsequently elevated to chief technology officer, became concerned the company wasn’t making enough progress in AI—that its efforts lacked ambition. Like Nadella, Scott thought AI would be transformative, not just for Microsoft but for society. Yet despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars over a decade, and having a research arm stuffed with leading computer scientists, Microsoft had not achieved the kinds of headline-grabbing breakthroughs Alphabet was regularly churning out from its two AI labs, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/deepmind/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/deepmind/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">DeepMind</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">Google</a> Brain. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><span><span></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive"><noscript></noscript></span><figcaption>CTO Kevin Scott spotted OpenAI as the ideal partner for Microsoft. </figcaption><p class="image-credit">Katie Thompson for Fortune</p></div>



<p>Nadella green-lit Scott’s plan to look for startups that Microsoft could invest in and partner with that might help the company grab a lead in the AI race. Microsoft faces “top competitors who are more vertically integrated,” Nadella says. “And if you want to compete with those players, we felt like partnering is the right approach.” </p>



<p>Scott homed in on an unusual San Francisco outfit called OpenAI. The startup’s ambition couldn’t have been greater. OpenAI was committed to achieving artificial general intelligence, or AGI, software as capable at cognitive tasks as a person—AI’s holy grail. As it turned out, Nadella had met OpenAI CEO Sam Altman at Allen &amp; Co.’s Sun Valley conference—nicknamed “summer camp for billionaires”—and come away intrigued. Altman, meanwhile, twigged that Microsoft might be the deep-pocketed backer OpenAI needed to achieve its goals.</p>



<p>Since then, Microsoft has invested at least $13 billion into the AI company, and the startup’s technology has become the bedrock of Microsoft’s AI offerings. OpenAI’s models underpin the company’s “Copilot”-branded AI products, including GitHub Copilot, its AI software coding assistant, and generative AI features it has built into its Microsoft 365 office productivity software. They also power “Copilot for Bing,” its free, consumer-facing chatbot and generative AI search engine. Microsoft’s integration of AI Copilot features into its ubiquitous Office 365 products gives the company a lot of ways to hook customers. Still, some of those customers have balked at the hefty $30 per user per month Microsoft charges for Copilot. “No one budgeted a 50% lift on their M 365 license,” says Jason Wong, a distinguished vice president, analyst at technology research firm <a href="https://fortune.com/company/gartner/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/gartner/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">Gartner</a>.</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing business has gotten the biggest financial boost from OpenAI’s models so far, showing the symbiosis between Nadella’s two big strategic transformations. The desire of companies to tap OpenAI’s GPT models through Azure has contributed meaningfully to the company’s revenues. In the quarter that ended in March 2024, Microsoft attributed 7% of Azure’s 31% overall sales growth to AI. <a href="https://fortune.com/company/morgan-stanley/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/morgan-stanley/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">Morgan Stanley</a> estimates that Azure AI services are on track to generate $4 billion in annual sales. Overall, Microsoft’s cloud revenues were $35.1 billion in the quarter, up 23% from a year earlier. That has also helped Microsoft, which ranks second in cloud market share, narrow the gap with the industry leader, Amazon’s AWS. </p>



<p>Lee Sustar, principal analyst at technology research firm Forrester, says that after spending years chasing AWS, the OpenAI partnership has given Microsoft “the initiative for the first time ever in cloud computing.” The premium Microsoft can charge for AI offerings gives it a chance to recoup the costs of building its cloud. The question, he says, is whether Azure can maintain this momentum given that many customers have piled into AI without knowing how best to generate a return on their investment. “We just went through the ‘buy before you try’ phase of AI development,” he quips.</p>



<p>Of course, Microsoft is also spending big to purchase graphics processing units (GPUs), the specialized chips on which AI applications run, and to construct still more data centers. Its capital expenditures in the first three months of 2024 surged 79% from a year earlier, to $14 billion, and the company has told investors those costs will keep rising at least through 2025. Microsoft has begun designing its own AI chips to lessen its reliance on Nvidia’s GPUs, but those chips are only expected to begin arriving later this year.</p>



<hr class="sc-fa0656e5-0 hDabQp">



<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft’s dependency on OpenAI carries risks. This became painfully obvious when, days before Thanksgiving 2023, OpenAI’s board suddenly fired its charismatic CEO and cofounder, Sam Altman, saying he had not been “consistently candid,” throwing the startup’s future into doubt.</p>



<p>Nadella scrambled to reassure customers and investors that Microsoft’s access to OpenAI’s tech wasn’t in jeopardy. He also helped catalyze Altman’s reinstatement by offering to hire him, OpenAI cofounder Greg Brockman, and any other OpenAI employees who wanted to join them. The threat of mass resignations forced OpenAI’s board to rehire Altman. As a condition of his return, most of the board members involved in his firing were replaced, and Microsoft gained an observer’s seat on the body. Nadella claimed in a television interview in January that Microsoft’s board position was unimportant, but that he wanted to see “good governance and real stability.”</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p><a href="https://fortune.com/company/overstock-com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/overstock-com/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">Beyond</a> that blowup, there have been periodic reports hinting at tensions between the partners: OpenAI has been too slow delivering new, more powerful AI models; it has tried to sell its tech directly to big Microsoft customers. Scott acknowledges occasional friction on both sides. “Everybody just sort of feels this incredible sense of urgency. And so you’re just putting everything that you’ve got into it, and we’re all occasionally getting frustrated with each other because we just want things to move forward so quickly,” he says. </p>



<p>Top Microsoft execs insist they are exuberant about OpenAI overall. When I catch up with Nadella a few days after his return from Southeast Asia, he emphasizes that OpenAI delivered Microsoft GPT-4, which by most benchmark tests remains the most high-performing AI model in the market, as well as the model most companies are using for generative AI applications. Work on an even more powerful GPT-5 model is well underway. “We feel very good about where we are, with what we have been able to do on top of GPT-4,” he says. </p>



<p>Altman describes a close relationship with Microsoft, and in particular with Scott, whom he calls “one of the most important partners, colleagues, whatever you want to call it, of my entire career.” He and Scott speak multiple times a week, and Altman says he leans on the Microsoft CTO for thoughts on strategy and even AI’s societal implications. </p>



<p>OpenAI’s sweeping ambitions and Microsoft’s practical focus on execution don’t always harmonize neatly. In Malaysia, I watched Nadella deflect a question from a local CEO about what AGI—OpenAI’s ultimate goal—might mean for humanity. When I ask Altman about Nadella’s seeming discomfort, Altman says he and the Microsoft CEO “have different jobs and different roles, and we are kind of focused on different time horizons. But it’s on the same vector, so I think it’s fine.” Outside of those differences, Altman describes tight collaboration between Microsoft and OpenAI at every level. “We don’t do ropes course together or anything,” he says, but notes that executives and engineers from the two companies are in constant communication, frequently work at one another’s offices, and bond at post-work dinners.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“We have different jobs and different roles, and we are focused on different time horizons. But it’s on the same vector.”</p><cite>Sam Altman, OpenAI, on how he and Nadella approach the goal of Artificial General Intelligence</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>That said, competitors are also innovating at AI’s frontier, and customers are still working out how best to derive value from AI—so Nadella wants options beyond OpenAI. “Microsoft is hedging its bets,” notes Arun Chandrasekaran, a distinguished vice president, analyst for tech innovation, cloud, and AI at Gartner. With $80 billion in cash and short-term investments sitting on Microsoft’s balance sheet as of the end of March 2024, Nadella can afford to place multiple wagers. In addition to helping cloud customers implement sometimes-pricey OpenAI models, Microsoft offers them free, open-source AI models, including some from rivals such as Meta’s Llama. These models are generally less capable than GPT-4, but for some uses will do the trick at a potentially lower cost. </p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>In April, Microsoft made a $1.5 billion investment in Abu Dhabi–based G42, a technology conglomerate closely tied to Abu Dhabi’s royal family that has trained open-source Arabic language AI models. It has invested $16 million in Mistral, a French AI startup that has built highly capable open-source language models. Microsoft has also created its own family of open-source small language models, Phi, that pack an outsize punch.</p>



<p>“Customers want choice and optionality,” Chandrasekaran says. Microsoft’s goal is to ensure “whichever way the customer goes they will still spend money on Azure.” If they do, he explains, Microsoft can build lucrative long-term relationships with them. Most companies need to run AI applications on the same cloud that houses their data. Once Microsoft has that data, it is difficult for customers to leave—“data has gravity,” Chandrasekaran says—and Microsoft can sell them additional services around data management and security. </p>



<p>Microsoft’s most significant AI play aside from OpenAI came in March, when it hired DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman and much of the staff from his AI startup Inflection to form the core of a new consumer AI division. Microsoft also agreed to pay $620 million to license Inflection’s technology—it had built one of the best LLMs outside of OpenAI’s—a move that Microsoft executives told me was intended to forestall possible trade secret theft lawsuits from Inflection and its investors. (Microsoft execs dispute speculation that the hiring and license deal was designed to evade antitrust scrutiny.) </p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><span><span></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive"><noscript></noscript></span><figcaption>Chris Young nurtures promising AI startups via the company’s M12 venture arm.</figcaption><p class="image-credit">Chona Kasinger for Fortune</p></div>



<p>What Microsoft really wanted from Inflection was talent. Tech publication The Information has <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meet-mai-1-microsoft-readies-new-ai-model-to-compete-with-google-openai" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meet-mai-1-microsoft-readies-new-ai-model-to-compete-with-google-openai" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">reported</a> that the former Inflection team is hard at work on a new LLM that might rival OpenAI’s systems. When I asked Nadella about this, he said only that Microsoft will continue to innovate on AI models in-house. Chandrasekaran, the Gartner analyst, says Microsoft needs its own expertise training the most capable, large frontier models. A key provision of its partnership with OpenAI is that Microsoft loses its automatic right to license OpenAI’s most powerful AI models if the San Francisco company achieves its stated goal of AGI—a determination that is at the sole discretion of OpenAI’s nonprofit board. Nadella likes to have a plan B. Suleyman and the AI experts he brought from Inflection give him one.</p>



<p>The quest to keep tabs on where AI is heading extends beyond LLMs. One warm, overcast April afternoon, I rode through London’s congested streets in a self-driving Jaguar I-Pace powered by software from a Microsoft-backed startup called Wayve. Watching a car steer, stop, and start itself had all the wow factor you’d expect, but the tech powering it is where Microsoft’s deeper interest lies.</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>Chris Young, Microsoft’s executive vice president for business development, strategy, and ventures, tells me investments like Wayve are about gaining “market signal”—in this particular case, a view into the emerging world of “embodied intelligence,” the term for AI systems that operate in the physical world, controlling cars, drones, or robots. Microsoft makes investments in startups both directly, from its cash reserves, and through its corporate venture capital arm, M12. Since arriving at Microsoft in 2020, Young has, with Nadella’s blessing, shifted M12’s strategy from generating financial returns to focusing on startups that can help Microsoft expand its business, gain market intelligence, or keep up with key innovations. Helping to train Wayve’s AI will give Microsoft a better understanding of the auto sector’s future cloud-computing demands as carmakers adopt ever more sophisticated driver assistance technology.</p>



<p>Young says that Wayve is not Microsoft’s only investment in embodied intelligence. It has also backed humanoid robotics company Figure. And the company is putting money into synthetic data creation, cybersecurity, and even biotech and drug <a href="https://fortune.com/company/discovery-insurance/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/discovery-insurance/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">discovery</a> that are seen as key potential future markets for Microsoft’s applications or its cloud services.</p>



<hr class="sc-fa0656e5-0 hDabQp">



<p>A good surfer rides a wave as much by feel as sight, sensing the water passing beneath the board. Nadella’s Microsoft surfs technological waves by keeping as close as possible to developers—the engineers and coders who build software within companies—and trying to remain responsive to what they want. Nadella’s trip to Southeast Asia was a C-suite-level exercise in developer dialogue.</p>



<p>Among the cultural changes Nadella instituted at Microsoft shortly after becoming CEO was the idea of “a growth mindset”—that employees should stop being “know-it-alls” and seek to become “learn it-alls.” That philosophy now guides the company’s interactions with developers. Scott Hanselman, a Microsoft vice president who looks after its global developer community, says that in the pre-Nadella era, Microsoft had a reputation for dictating to developers and forcing them to use the company’s entire tech stack. Now it allows developers to pick and choose components, and seeks constant feedback on features they want Microsoft to build. “Azure is beholden to them; they are the customer, and they will keep using it if they find it helpful and delightful,” he says. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><span><span></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive"><noscript></noscript></span></div>



<p>Microsoft’s latest effort to delight developers centers on GitHub Copilot, its AI coding tool. Amanda Silver, corporate vice president of product design, user research, and engineering systems, rattles off a long list of stats from studies that have shown how much faster and more accurately programmers code with Copilot. Coders have enthusiastically embraced the tool. In April, Microsoft went further, debuting GitHub Copilot Workspace. This software allows a developer to describe a feature they want to build, and then the software generates all the necessary code automatically. Copilot is binding Microsoft and developers in an ever-tighter vortex—one that has the potential to draw in more and more people as Copilot helps democratize software creation. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><span><span></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive"><noscript></noscript></span><figcaption>Amanda Silver oversees Microsoft’s developer division, building and tracking the tools that put AI to work for coders and engineers.</figcaption><p class="image-credit">Dan DeLong—Courtesy of Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Copilot’s success isn’t uncomplicated, however. It was trained on code developers had previously uploaded to GitHub. Some of those developers claim Microsoft’s use of their code violates the license terms under which they uploaded it, and they’ve sued Microsoft and OpenAI for breach of contract. The case—as well as <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/02/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-copyright-lawsuit/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/01/02/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-copyright-lawsuit/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">copyright infringement lawsuits</a> Microsoft and OpenAI face, including from the <em>New York Times</em>—point to something else that Nadella says keeps him up at night: the possibility the company might lose what he calls “its license to operate.” </p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>That license, he says, “rests on our social contract,” which makes several demands of Microsoft. “Trust is one of them,” he says. Another is whether Microsoft’s products and services create economic surplus everywhere it operates. “Why would anyone in Asia give us a license to operate there?” he tells me after his swing through the region. “Are we making small businesses there more productive, multinationals there more competitive, the public sector in those countries more efficient, or driving better health outcomes and education outcomes?” </p>



<p>To ensure it can deliver those benefits—and to buy itself goodwill—Microsoft has announced a series of multibillion-dollar investments around the world. During his Asia tour, Nadella announced Microsoft would help train 2.5 million people across Southeast Asia in AI skills. It announced that it would spend $1.7 billion for data centers and training in Indonesia and $2.2 billion in Malaysia over the next four years, as well as announcing Microsoft’s first data center in Thailand at an undisclosed cost. The company is making similar investments in infrastructure and training in Europe and Japan.</p>



<p>But when it comes to trust, there are some ominous blips on the radar screen. The alleged plundering of data to train AI models may mar the company’s reputation. Microsoft has suffered a series of damaging cyberattacks over the past two years, making it seem suddenly vulnerable in a domain where it was once considered best-in-class: cybersecurity. A further potential vulnerability might be the proliferation of deepfakes, AI-assisted fraud, and AI-generated junk content flooding the internet, some of it created with Microsoft’s tech. Nadella tends to argue, conveniently, that deepfakes and disinformation should be policed at the point of distribution (the social media platforms) not the point of creation (Microsoft’s AI apps). It isn’t clear the public and governments agree. </p>



<p>A loss of trust would feed into another big threat facing Microsoft: regulation. Big Tech companies, Microsoft included, are operating under unprecedented government scrutiny globally, and AI’s emergence has only increased that attention. “The days of the deregulated technology sector are over,” says Brad Smith, Microsoft’s vice chair and president, and the person who spearheads Microsoft’s relationship with governments around the globe. </p>



<p>Last year, Microsoft agreed to unbundle its Teams workplace collaboration tools from Office, in a bid to avert a European Union antitrust fine. But the move has failed to assuage regulators. And while EU competition authorities declined to pursue action based on Microsoft’s OpenAI partnership, antitrust enforcers in the U.S. continue to probe the relationship. Smith acknowledges that acquisitions are more difficult to make than five years ago; the company still faces a Federal Trade Commission claim related to its Activision Blizzard purchase. Meanwhile, the company must comply with a raft of laws in Europe aimed at Big Tech, including a new AI Act.</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>A quarter-century ago, the U.S. government successfully sued Microsoft over its bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows, almost resulting in the company’s breakup. Smith tells me Microsoft has benefited from that experience—“with having tasted defeat,” he asserts—and come away wiser. Under Nadella, Microsoft has adopted a more conciliatory approach to regulators than founder Bill Gates did as CEO. “Everybody who’s in the technology sector is going to need to adapt to succeed in this combination of engineering and regulation,” Smith says. “I think we’re probably more willing to lean into the need to adapt than some others.”</p>



<hr class="sc-fa0656e5-0 hDabQp">



<p>Indeed, as Microsoft’s ambitions—and its commitment to achieving them—grow larger, it will need even more collaboration with governments. </p>



<p>AI and cloud services demand data centers, for example, and data centers need energy. In Kuala Lumpur, Nadella told a group of CEOs that a lack of renewable energy sources was limiting where Microsoft could build them. If governments wanted Microsoft to invest in their countries, he said, they should fund green-energy generation and upgrade power grids. In the U.S., Microsoft faces similar constraints. It has even explored ways AI could be used to streamline regulatory approvals for new nuclear power plants. Microsoft also needs to lessen the carbon intensity of manufacturing AI chips and building data centers; the company revealed in May that its CO2 emissions have spiked 30% since 2020, in large part because of those activities, jeopardizing its pledge to become carbon negative by 2030.</p>



<p>Microsoft and OpenAI are also, according to a story in The Information, considering construction of a vast data center for OpenAI’s future models that might cost as much as $100 billion to equip. Scott says that report is “amusingly wrong,” but declines to say how. What he does say is that “we most certainly are not going to be outspent by rivals.”</p>



<p>This whatever-it-takes attitude makes Microsoft a formidable competitor. But it may not be enough to ensure it remains the world’s most valuable company. Staying on top, Nadella tells me in Jakarta, requires that Microsoft continue meeting “unmet, unarticulated needs of customers.” That in turn demands that the company “stay humble, stay hungry, and exhibit a growth mindset.” The company can never coast. “I don’t take it for granted,” he says. </p>



<hr class="sc-fa0656e5-0 hDabQp">



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Beyond ChatGPT: Microsoft’s other bets</h2>



<p>Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI has allowed it to leap to the front of the generative AI race. But AI technology is rapidly evolving, and Microsoft’s cloud customers want to explore a variety of AI models for different use cases and to better control costs. So Microsoft is hedging its bets with investments like these:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. G42 </h3>



<p>Microsoft has invested $1.5 billion in this Abu Dhabi–based tech conglomerate, which has built some of the best large language models (LLMs) for Arabic. The investment is widely seen as a U.S.-brokered reward for G42 severing its once-close ties with China and Chinese chip companies.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Mistral </h3>



<p>Founded by former DeepMind researchers in 2023, the Paris-based startup has built a family of highly capable, open-source LLMs. Mistral has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in venture funding. Microsoft made a small $16 million investment in the company and offers Mistral’s models on Azure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Wayve</h3>



<p>London-based Wayve builds software for self-driving cars that doesn’t require specialized sensors or detailed street mapping. Instead, it takes in visual information and directly outputs the correct driving actions, a significant advance over many competing systems. Microsoft has joined multiple funding rounds for Wayve, including a $1 billion fundraise in May.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Figure </h3>



<p>A startup building humanoid robots for commercial use, Figure has won plaudits for impressive demos of its technology. It has also partnered with OpenAI to provide AI brains for the robots. Microsoft participated in a $675 million funding round for the Sunnyvale, Calif., company in February that valued it at more than $2 billion. </p>

<p>More than 60 years after he was denied an opportunity to become America's first Black astronaut, Ed Dwight finally traveled into space Sunday with five other passengers on a 10-minute flight inside a Blue Origin capsule.</p>
<p>Dwight, a retired Air Force captain and test pilot, had a chance to become the first African American astronaut. He was one of 26 pilots the Air Force recommended to NASA for the third class of astronauts in 1963, but the agency didn't select him. It took another 20 years for America's first Black astronaut, Guion Bluford, to fly in space in 1983.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>“Everything they did, I did, and I did it well," Dwight said in a video released by Blue Origin. "If politics had changed, I would have gone to space in some kind of capacity.”</p>
<p>At the age of 90, Dwight finally entered the record books Sunday, becoming the oldest person to reach space, displacing the previous record-holder, actor William Shatner, who flew on a similar Blue Origin launch to the edge of space in 2021.</p>
<p>“I thought I didn’t need it in my life," Dwight said after Sunday's fight. "But I lied!"</p>
<p>Since retiring from the Air Force, Dwight became an accomplished sculptor. His works, which focus on Black history, are installed at memorials and monuments across the country.</p>
<p>“The transitions, the separations and stuff were a little bit more dynamic than I thought," Dwight said in remarks after Sunday's flight. "But that’s how it’s supposed to be. It makes your mind wonder, 'Is something wrong?' But no, it was absolutely terrific and the view ... absolutely fantastic. This was a life-changing experience. Everybody needs to do this.”</p>

<p>Dwight and his five co-passengers lifted off from Blue Origin's remote launch site in West Texas at 9:35 am CDT (14:35 UTC). Strapped into reclining seats inside a pressurized capsule, the passengers rode Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket into the uppermost layers of the atmosphere. After burning its main engine more than two minutes, the rocket released the crew capsule and continued coasting upward to an apogee, or high point, of nearly 66 miles (107 kilometers), just above the internationally recognized boundary of space.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>This was the seventh time Blue Origin, the space company owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, has flown people to suborbital space, and the 25th flight overall of the company's fleet of New Shepard rockets. It was the first time Blue Origin has launched people in nearly two years, resuming suborbital service after a rocket failure on an uncrewed research flight in September 2022. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/12/blue-origins-suborbital-rocket-flies-for-first-time-in-15-months/">In December</a>, Blue Origin launched another uncrewed suborbital research mission to set the stage for the resumption of human missions Sunday.</p>
<p>Joining Dwight on Blue Origin's capsule were investor Mason Angel, French businessman Sylvain Chiron, software engineer Kenneth Hess, adventurer Carol Schaller, and Gopi Thotakura, an Indian pilot and entrepreneur. Dwight's ticket with Blue Origin was sponsored by Space for Humanity, a nonprofit that seeks to expand access to space for all people, and the other five participants were paying passengers.</p>
<p>After cutoff of the New Shepard rocket engine, the passengers had a few minutes to unfasten their seatbelts and float around the cabin while taking in the view of Earth. They returned to their seats as the capsule descended back into the atmosphere. The reusable New Shepard booster reignited its main engine for a propulsive landing back in Texas, while the crew capsule deployed parachutes to slow for touchdown a few miles away.</p>
<h2>Two of three</h2>
<p>However, one of the three main parachutes did not fully unfurl as the capsule drifted back to the ground. The capsule is designed to safely land with two chutes, a capability Blue Origin demonstrated on a test flight in 2016.</p>
<p>“It looks like we do have two parachutes that have full inflation, the third is not quite fully inflated," said Ariane Cornell, a Blue Origin official hosting the company's live webcast Sunday. “Landing with two parachutes is perfectly OK for this system.”</p>
<p>Family members and Blue Origin personnel greeted the passengers as they exited the capsule. All six appeared to be in good spirits and good health.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Although it had no obvious ill effects on the crew or the spacecraft, Blue Origin engineers will investigate the malfunction to determine what went wrong. The capsule's three main parachutes were supplied to Blue Origin by Airborne Systems, which manufactures parachutes for every US human-rated spacecraft.</p>

<p>Airborne also provides parachutes for SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, Boeing's Starliner, and NASA's Orion capsule. Those parachutes have different designs and sizes than the chutes used on Blue Origin's capsule, but it wasn't immediately clear if there might be any crossover concerns on other programs stemming from the malfunction on Sunday's flight.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration, the regulatory agency that oversees US commercial space missions, said in a statement it did not consider the parachute issue a mishap. This statement suggests the incident will not trigger a mishap investigation that would require FAA oversight.</p>
<p>Before the 2022 launch failure, Blue Origin's New Shepard program achieved a cadence, on average, of roughly one flight every two months. Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company founded by Richard Branson, ramped up the flight rate of its suborbital SpaceShipTwo spaceplane over the last year as Blue Origin's rocket remained grounded.</p>
<p>But Virgin Galactic is about to halt operations of its own spaceship following one more flight with passengers next month. The company says it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/for-virgin-galactic-becoming-profitable-means-a-pause-in-flying-to-space/">decided to suspend flights of the VSS <em>Unity </em>rocket plane</a> to focus its resources on developing a fleet of larger air-launched spaceships that are easier to reuse.</p>
<p>This means Blue Origin, assuming it can regain or build on the cadence it demonstrated in 2021 and 2022, will be the only company serving the suborbital space tourism and research market for at least the next couple of years.</p>

<li><strong>Record profit</strong>: Ryanair reported its best-ever annual profit, with a 34% jump in profit after tax to 1.92 billion euros ($2.09 billion) and a 25% year-on-year rise in revenue to 13.44 billion euros.</li>

<li><strong>Higher costs</strong>: Despite increased passenger numbers, operating costs rose 24% year-on-year, mainly due to higher jet fuel costs, which surged 32%. The airline also flagged a "recessionary feel" in Europe, which may affect pricing.</li>
<li><strong>Share buyback program</strong>: Ryanair announced a 700 million-euro share buyback program, reflecting the company's "very strong" balance sheet, which has enabled the airline to pay down debt and restart dividend payments.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing concerns</strong>: While the airline reported strong results, analysts expressed concern about softer pricing in recent months, and Ryanair's CEO warned of a "recessionary feel" and potential need to discount fares to maintain load factors during the peak summer period.</li>

At the time, Cerner managed the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/electronic-health-records-benefits-challenges" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="20">electronic health records</a> for a quarter of all American hospitals, including those run by the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Ellison's plan was to pump all that medical data into Oracle's AI models and develop an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ehr-systems-vendors" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="20">EHR</a> of the future.</p><p class="premium">"You have this wealth of data that will help doctors make much better decisions of what therapeutics to give you, and that will deliver better outcomes at a much lower cost," Ellison said onstage in Las Vegas, adding, "I'm not sure there's anything we're working on here at Oracle that's more important than this."</p><p class="premium">There was just one problem: Cerner was a total mess. While Ellison was fixated on the wildly exciting possibilities of marrying Cerner's medical records with Oracle's technology, Cerner was failing at even the most elementary tasks of data management. The company's rollout at the VA, which serves 9 million vets, had been a slow-moving catastrophe. One feature of its electronic records system had caused more than 11,000 orders for medical care to disappear into an "unknown queue." As a result, thousands of patients didn't receive the treatment their doctors had ordered. VA staffers were left in what one hospital leader called "a constant state of hypervigilance and distress" as they scrambled to retrieve and reenter the missing orders, which wound up harming 149 patients.<strong> </strong>Even worse, errors in the system's underlying design were contributing factors in three deaths.</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-right" data-quote="I'm not sure there's anything we're working on here at Oracle that's more important than this." data-quote-updated="true" data-source="Larry Ellison" data-source-updated="true" class="premium">

                            </es-blockquote><p class="premium">Cerner's electronic records, in short, were a deadly disaster for the VA. Never mind the futuristic, AI-driven healthcare system Ellison envisioned. In purchasing Cerner, Oracle had saddled itself with a huge liability. The company found itself in a race against time to fix the broken and dysfunctional system it had inherited from Cerner — before more veterans were injured or killed.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">Ellison first approached Cerner about an acquisition two decades ago.</p><p class="premium">It was the mid-2000s, and the healthtech sector was red hot. The RAND Corporation had released a report estimating that the mass digitization of medical records would cut healthcare costs by $81 billion a year. While some saw the prediction as excessively rosy — it was paid for, in part, by Cerner — the report helped pave the way for a massive infusion of federal stimulus dollars to supercharge the adoption of electronic health records at American hospitals. Never mind that EHRs were more cumbersome than advertised; RAND would later conclude there were barely any savings. The promise of bringing hospitals into the digital age was deemed too important to put off.</p><p class="premium">Meanwhile, Big Tech was starting to invest heavily in healthcare IT, and Oracle wanted in.</p><p class="premium">Neal Patterson, Cerner's cofounder and its CEO at the time, was not impressed with Ellison's pitch. Like other executives at the company, he was distrustful of Silicon Valley. Big Tech, they felt, brought more chutzpah than expertise to the healthcare table. For years executives at Cerner passed around an internal slide that cataloged tech investments in healthcare and the raft of embarrassing exits by companies like GE and Siemens. Patterson rebuffed Ellison's advances, according to a former Cerner executive familiar with the discussions.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image  breakout  premium" data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

                          </figure><p class="premium">A decade later, Cerner scored a huge win. In 2015, it beat out Epic, its main competitor, for a $4.3 billion contract to handle electronic health records for the Defense Department. Two years later, it landed a similar contract for the VA, worth an estimated $10 billion, without even having to bid. The thinking was that giving both contracts to a single company would ensure seamless care for service members, especially in the period immediately after they're discharged, when they're most vulnerable to mental illnesses and substance-use disorders. "I wanted to move towards a single instance of an electronic record with the Department of Defense to make sure that this issue was resolved finally, once and for all," says Dr. David Shulkin, who served as the secretary of veterans affairs at the time.</p><p class="premium">But Cerner didn't have long to savor its victory. A month after it landed the VA contract, Patterson died of cancer. A bruising succession process ensued. Cerner was losing ground to Epic, and its stock had plateaued. In 2019, the activist investor and private-equity shop Starboard Value gained seats on Cerner's board, putting public pressure on the company to turn things around.</p><p class="premium">What's more, taking on two vast government systems turned out to be overwhelming. In the fall of 2020, as Cerner's inaugural system was rolled out at the VA health center in Spokane, Washington,<strong> </strong>things began to go wrong. Doctors and nurses complained that the system was slow and difficult to use, requiring them to spend more time inputting data and less time caring for patients. "You're spending all your time messing around on Cerner and taking like 10 minutes with your patients," one VA provider says. While VistA, the bespoke EHR that Cerner had replaced, was outdated and vulnerable to cyberattacks, it was generally reliable and user-friendly. With the new system, completing basic tasks was maddeningly complex, impeding the care Cerner was designed to streamline.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image  breakout  premium" data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

But the system didn't send an alert when this happened, and the inspector general found that Cerner had failed to train VA staff on the feature, putting the burden on the VA to identify the issue and request a fix. One VA leader compared Cerner's attitude about the missing medical orders to the post office stuffing "undeliverable mail behind a bush instead of placing them back in your mailbox."</p><p class="premium">While <a target="_blank" href="https://digital.va.gov/ehr-modernization/news-releases/va-signs-contract-with-cerner-for-an-electronic-health-record-system/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="40">the VA had promised</a> to "do right by both veterans and taxpayers," the switch to Cerner was doing harm.

                          </figure><p class="premium">As Cerner was rolled out to more VA and Defense Department health centers, their shared activity and data — more than Cerner had ever handled at once — pushed the company's aging hardware to a breaking point. And since its system wasn't on the cloud, Cerner was struggling to meet the increasing demand. It had agreed to process tens of millions of crucial medical records, but it couldn't handle the subsequent deluge of data.</p><p class="premium">The longer Cerner's system ran, the more the problems piled up. By the time Oracle <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/804753/000119312522012548/d289699dsc14d9.htm" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="40">approached</a> the company for the second time, Cerner was no longer in a position to say no.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">IIn the years after Ellison first approached Cerner, he became preoccupied with matters of health and longevity. "Larry and I both share a sadness with all the folks we've lost to cancer," says Marc Benioff, the Salesforce CEO and longtime Ellison protégé. "He wants to extend human life and help people live healthier lives. He's quite advanced in age, and aging, and may not be able to benefit himself."</p><p class="premium">Medicine has been a lifelong obsession for Ellison. He once thought of becoming a doctor, but he didn't stick with school long enough to get a degree, much less a medical degree. Once he became wealthy, he started to view death, as his biographer Mike Wilson put it, as "just another kind of corporate opponent he can outfox."</p><p class="premium">Ellison views healthcare as "a remarkably backward business," says Dr. David Agus, a renowned oncologist who met Ellison in the mid-2000s, right around the time Oracle first approached Cerner. Agus was treating Ellison's nephew for prostate cancer, and he'd later treat the Apple cofounder Steve Jobs, Ellison's close friend, who died in 2011. Since then, Agus and Ellison have collaborated on healthcare investments worth hundreds of millions of dollars, including the Ellison Institute of Technology and Sensei, a wellness-retreat company that includes a health utopia built on the Hawaiian island Ellison owns almost in its entirety.</p><p class="premium">"We've met with hospital administrators, researchers, and doctors," Agus says. "He commits to them, 'I can solve this problem.' And he does. Larry actually solves the problem, not just gives money."</p><p class="premium">Ellison saw medical records as another area where he could solve a problem. EHRs stand at the center of modern healthcare, used for storing a patient's medical information, ordering follow-up appointments, calling in prescriptions, and more. And yet the systems are treated mostly, as Ellison likes to say, as a "bag of words" — you can't easily extract data from them on a mass scale. All that medical information was going to waste.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image  breakout  premium" data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

But Cerner, the go-to EHR for small and midsize hospitals, had a quality that would have appealed to Ellison: It was widely seen as taking a more relaxed approach to data privacy. The company was investing in the technology infrastructure to help hospitals share data with one another — and with third parties.</p><p class="premium">As it happens, the pandemic strengthened Oracle's case for scooping up Cerner. In the race to defeat the coronavirus, both companies were afforded greater latitude in handling patient records, including those that fall under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. That would enable Oracle to get started on Ellison's EHR of the future right away. Buying Cerner would also help the tech giant compete with Amazon and Microsoft in the massively profitable cloud-computing business and establish a foothold in the healthcare industry, which, at $4.4 trillion, accounted for roughly 18% of the American economy in 2022. It seemed like nothing but upside for Oracle.</p><p class="premium">Oracle and Cerner <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-buys-cerner-2021-12-20/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="60">announced</a> the deal in December 2021, and the acquisition was finalized on June 8, 2022. Oracle believed it was finally in a position to fulfill Ellison's dream of revolutionizing modern medicine. In reality, it had acquired a high-tech filing system that couldn't even perform the simplest of filing tasks.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">The stark reality of what Oracle had just paid for was made clear six weeks after the deal closed, when the tech giant was summoned to Washington, DC, for a grilling before the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs.</p><p class="premium">In the months since Oracle had announced its intention to buy Cerner, the mess at the VA had only gotten worse. Outages were increasingly common, and one Cerner executive says the entire system was on the verge of failing: "We were going to go off a cliff and die." The system was considered so dangerous that its rollout to the remaining 166 VA medical centers had been put on hold. Senators listed 36 fixes they expected Cerner — now Oracle — to address before additional sites could make the switch.</p><p class="premium">Oracle, incredibly, claimed it hadn't been aware of the magnitude of the challenges facing Cerner when it made the biggest acquisition in its history. "I would say there's always things that you discover after the fact," Mike Sicilia, the Oracle executive leading Cerner, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-cerner-va-issues-larry-ellison-2022-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="60">told the irate lawmakers</a>. "You know, we certainly had read the press, and we certainly had read things that were publicly disclosed. But there's nothing like owning something to fully understand what's going on."</p><p class="premium">Still, Sicilia assured lawmakers that Oracle intended to turn things around. The company, he said, had already shifted its top talent, including senior engineers, to work on the VA project. Within nine months, Oracle would move the project onto the cloud, remedying bugs and cutting costs. It would also design a state-of-the-art program for pharmacy, a trouble-ridden area for the project. "Everything here is fixable and addressable" and Cerner would soon be the "gold standard" among EHRs, Sicilia said, adding, "We intend to exceed expectations."</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-right" data-quote="Oracle, incredibly, claimed it hadn't been aware of the magnitude of the challenges facing Cerner when it made the biggest acquisition in its history.

                            </es-blockquote><p class="premium">Behind the scenes, Oracle was throwing resources at the situation. To address the raft of blackouts and slowdowns, Oracle installed expensive new hardware and made tweaks that stabilized the system and reduced outages dramatically, the Cerner executive told BI. Ellison was directly involved, holding a monthly meeting with 50 or 60 executive and senior vice presidents in the Oracle Health unit to review incidents and brainstorm solutions, according to a high-level employee who attended the meetings. "Oracle is still learning what they have actually acquired from Cerner," an Oracle executive concedes.</p><p class="premium">But as Sicilia was trying to assuage concerns on Capitol Hill, a fresh disaster was unfolding at the VA. Only this time, it was happening on Oracle's watch.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">Anthony Jones Jr., a 28-year-old Ohio native who had served in the Navy for four years, had a history of post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide attempts. In May 2022, he was due to see a VA psychologist, but he failed to show up.</p><p class="premium">At the time, the Columbus VA had just switched over to Cerner. One feature of the EHR was that if a vet missed an appointment, the no-show would trigger VA staff to follow up. For mental-health cases, VA rules require that vets get three calls, on separate days, followed by a letter.<strong> </strong>The extra layer of precaution is vital because vets are far more likely to die from suicide or a drug overdose than nonveterans. But because of a design error, that didn't happen. In Jones' case, the record of the no-show "just kind of evaporated," says a Columbus provider familiar with his care. Jones got two calls, but not a third.</p><p class="premium">Six weeks later, on July 4, Jones was found unresponsive in the shower with the water running. The coroner's report noted that numerous empty cans of inhalants were found scattered around the apartment.</p><p class="premium">By the time of Jones' death, Oracle was fully in charge of the electronic records system — but it didn't discover and fix the error until August. This led to the VA sending out 70,000 letters to veterans who might have been affected by the error, including 24,000 in central Ohio alone, according to a letter to lawmakers from Donald Remy, the VA's deputy secretary at the time — a copy of which was obtained by BI.</p><p class="premium">The VA's inspector general <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vaoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2024-03/vaoig-23-00382-100_0.pdf" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="80">later</a> issued a report on the scheduling error that described a case mirroring Jones'. It concluded that "the lack of contact efforts may have contributed to the patient's disengagement from mental health treatment and ultimately the patient's substance use relapse and death."</p><p class="premium">In another case linked to the same scheduling error, a vet with cirrhosis of the liver failed to appear for an appointment with staff to discuss his drinking, according to a provider familiar with his care. When the vet didn't show up, VA staff — unaware of the scheduling error — left a single voicemail. The vet died in late August of complications from liver damage.</p><p class="premium">The vet's disease was already so progressed that it's unlikely a single appointment could have made the difference. But because of Oracle's oversight, there's no way to know if better follow-up could have saved the veteran's life.</p><p class="premium">"Could you imagine in a case like that where we did all the outreach we could have — but that one call," the VA provider says. "And then having to tell that family member he should have got one more call."</p><p class="premium">A month later, there was another death in Columbus, this time linked to an error in Cerner's pharmacy app. Antibiotics ordered for a vet who had been treated in a community hospital didn't arrive. When the vet's family called the VA pharmacy to see what was holding it up, they were given a tracking number — confirming, it seemed, that the medication had been shipped. But according to Remy's letter to lawmakers, the Cerner EHR had generated a bogus tracking number; the medication had been slated for pickup. The vet never received the medication, and his condition <a target="_blank" href="https://veterans.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2022-11-15_rmb_carey_balderson_to_secva_re_columbus_patient_deaths.pdf" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="80">worsened</a> while at home. He died of hypoxia in late September.</p><p class="premium">Problems with ordering medications were widespread. When Cerner was first deployed in Columbus, delays kept patients with severe schizophrenia waiting for their medication, a Columbus provider says. In the old system, ordering the shots they needed took about two minutes. It required 30 or so steps — and making a single mistake meant starting over. Vulnerable patients, already resistant to treatment and prone to stress, were kept waiting. In one case, staffers had to retrieve a patient who'd bolted for the parking lot bus stop. "By the time we go through all of this difficulty of ordering the medication — which should be a simple thing — the patient can't hardly take it and they go running outside," the provider says.</p><p class="premium">After Oracle took over, it took months for improvements to be made — and the orders still take 10 minutes to complete.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium"><strong>N</strong>early two years after its blockbuster deal with Cerner, Oracle says it has made thousands of improvements. "Our veterans and the people who care for them deserve a world-class EHR system," Seema Verma, the head of Oracle Health and Life Sciences, said in a statement to BI, "and Oracle is delivering it."</p><p class="premium">The VA also insists it is addressing the problem. "We know from listening to both veterans and VA clinicians that the electronic health record is not meeting expectations — and we're holding Oracle Health and ourselves accountable to get this right," says Dr. Neil Evans, who heads the VA's EHR modernization office. The rollout of the system remains on pause, and the VA will impose higher penalties on Oracle if the company fails to meet performance targets.</p><p class="premium">But Oracle is still struggling to stabilize the system it bought. The company hasn't fully moved Cerner onto the cloud, as Sicilia promised. While outages have decreased, the VA says they remain "an area of significant attention." According to one Columbus provider, the system went down for 90 minutes in late April, forcing staff to write notes by hand. "Ninety minutes is an eon in clinical time," the provider says. "No scheduling, charting, ordering, reading — nothing."</p><p class="premium">And while Oracle said it largely resolved the issues with the unknown queue within months of buying Cerner, two VA clinicians described a case from last fall where the disappearance of lab results caused a delay in a patient receiving critical medication. The records, they suspect, went into the unknown queue.</p><p class="premium">Ellison continues to push for his EHR of the future. But one Oracle executive described the VA contract as a "shackle," absorbing time and attention from Ellison's grander vision for the database he spent so much to purchase. And while Ellison is pushing the AI envelope, there's a chance Oracle could lose a lot of the health data that made Cerner such an attractive bet in the first place. Cerner has continued to lose ground to Epic, its main competitor. Intermountain Health and UPMC, two massive longtime Cerner clients, recently announced they were <a target="_blank" href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/epic-gains-new-ehr-clients-intermountain-and-upmc-move-cerner" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="80">switching</a> to Epic.</p><p class="premium">EHR deployments can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and require extensive training, making hospitals reluctant to bet on a company struggling to get the job done. "Folks feel like Cerner is circling the drain," says Sara Vaezy, a chief strategy and digital officer at Providence, a health system in Washington with more than 50 hospitals. "You don't want to pick a dud that you're going to have to replatform in a few years because they don't exist anymore or their product is so bad."</p><p class="premium">One Oracle executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, acknowledged that many of Cerner's clients were unhappy, in part because <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-conducts-layoffs-cerner-health-unit-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">cuts</a> to Cerner's workforce had left them with less day-to-day support. "There's not a whole lot we have to tell clients other than please hang in there," he says.</p><p class="premium">A growing chorus of lawmakers has been calling for the contract to be scrapped. "It's a political and governmentwide failure," says Ed Meagher, a former top official at the VA. "The DOD made a terrible decision, and then that forced a terrible decision on the VA."</p><p class="premium">It's clear that shifting a vast government-run system like the VA over to a standard EHR designed for the private sector proved far more complex than either Cerner or the VA anticipated. The EHR that Cerner replaced, VistA, was built specifically for the VA, and it was constantly tweaked and upgraded to suit the needs of individual providers and hospitals. The VA brought this mentality to the Cerner project, flooding the company with requests for special customizations — and Oracle has grown so frustrated that it has stopped taking on individual requests that haven't been formally contracted.</p><p class="premium">Within Oracle's health team, morale has suffered. "Morale is at an all-time low," an Oracle-Cerner manager says. "We have so much important work to do. Everybody's velocity is lower because basically everybody is depressed or upset."</p><hr class="premium"><figure class="figure image-figure-image  breakout  premium" data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

                          </figure><p class="drop-cap premium">In Spokane, where Cerner was unveiled, it's not clear that things have gotten any better since Oracle took over. During a recent visit to the VA, Charlie Bourg — the vet whose referral was lost in the unknown queue — noticed that the computer was down and that his providers from different departments seemed to have trouble communicating about his case. "I had to watch them struggle," he says.</p><p class="premium">Bourg knew the issues to be on the lookout for. He and another vet, Charlie Monroe, have become something of a rapid-response team for vets in Spokane and elsewhere. Known to providers and patients as "the Charlies," Bourg and Monroe are among the first to know when a new problem with Cerner is discovered. Lawmakers call them to find out what's going on. Relatives call when they need help advocating for a patient. "People come up to us out of the blue," Monroe says. "They know who we are. 'Can you do something about this? Can you talk to somebody about this?' No. Yeah. Maybe."</p><p class="premium">In February, the Charlies helped connect the family of a recently deceased vet with Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a congresswoman representing Spokane who has called for the termination of the VA's contract with Cerner. Based on initial information from the VA, the vet's daughter was concerned that Cerner might have led to his being given the wrong antibiotic, contributing to his death from sepsis.</p><p class="premium">Bourg and Monroe are about as different as two vets with long white hair could be. Bourg is soft-spoken and has a flat delivery, even when the topic turns to how much time he has left and how much he worries about his wife and grandkids. (Last December he sued the VA and Oracle for an undisclosed amount.) Monroe, who wears the yellow logo of the Seabees, the Navy's construction regiment, is loud and likes to say he's the better-looking of the two. "We're just two veterans that got involved with this shit because we were screwed over," Monroe says.</p><p class="premium">When Oracle entered the picture, the Charlies were confused by the company's name, believing it to be a video-game company. They don't know much about Ellison's grand vision for revolutionizing medicine. They just want vets to get the high-quality care they deserve.</p><p class="premium">Late last year, not long after Ellison's appearance at CloudWorld, the Charlies received a surprise invitation to meet with the VA's leadership in Spokane. Bourg says meetings like that take a toll on his body and mind. Back in 2022, the two had traveled to Washington to meet with lawmakers only to return feeling like it had been a waste of time. "I was totally mentally and physically exhausted," Bourg recalled, "and it still didn't do anything."</p><p class="premium">Bourg expected to come out of the Spokane meeting feeling the same way. Instead, he delivered a simple message to the assembled leaders. Given Oracle's track record of botched care, he said, there's only one thing for the VA to do: put an end to a contract that has proved so disastrous for so many veterans before someone else gets hurt.</p><p class="premium">"If they aren't telling me they are shutting it down," Bourg said, "there's nothing to say."</p><hr class="premium"><p class="premium"><a target="_blank" rel="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/ashley-stewart" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100"><em><u>Ashley Stewart</u></em></a><em> is a chief technology correspondent at Business Insider. <br></em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/blake-dodge" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100"><em>Blake Dodge</em></a><em> is a correspondent at Business Insider covering technology in healthcare.</em></p></div>

<ol>
<li><strong>California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) opposes ExxonMobil's board of directors</strong>: The $484 billion pension fund manager has announced that it will vote against all 12 of ExxonMobil's director nominees, including CEO Darren Woods, due to the company's actions against environmental activists.</li>
<li><strong>ExxonMobil's battle with activists</strong>: The company has been engaged in a months-long battle against two environmentally focused activist investors, Arjuna Capital and Follow This, over a shareholder proposal to reduce direct emissions and set emission targets for suppliers and customers.</li>
<li><strong>ExxonMobil sued the activists in Texas federal court</strong>: The company sued the investors in January, prompting the activists to withdraw their proposal. ExxonMobil has continued its lawsuit, seeking to prevent the activists from ever again submitting such a proposal.</li>
<li><strong>CalPERS has a $1 billion stake in ExxonMobil</strong>: As a significant investor in the company, CalPERS' decision to oppose ExxonMobil's board of directors is significant, as it can influence the company's direction and decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>ExxonMobil's rhetoric vs. actions</strong>: The company claims that the activists are trying to "silence the voices of up to 90% of our voting shareholders who have rejected the proposal twice." However, CalPERS' decision shows that ExxonMobil's actions have alienated a significant investor and may undermine the company's credibility on environmental issues.</li>

According to the state attorney’s office, if those creditors are not made whole based on present digital asset values, the fund will receive up to $2 billion from Genesis’ remaining assets.</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="SpecialReportArticle-RelatedContent-1"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Don’t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO</h2></div></div></div></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>
