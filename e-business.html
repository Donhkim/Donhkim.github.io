Announcements of cancellations for certain trains continued throughout the afternoon.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The changes come after a disastrous day of rail service disruptions and cancelations <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/amtrak-njtransit-rail-service-delayed-penn-station-due-overhead-wire/14981317/" target="_blank">on Thursday afternoon</a> on the Northeast Corridor.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">NJ Transit and Amtrak service was suspended just before 3 p.m. on Thursday due to power issues. A malfunctioning circuit breaker caused the widespread issue, resulting in a loss of power on the tracks between New York Penn Station and Newark Penn Station.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy"><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/nj-traffic-brush-fire-secaucus-impacting-traffic-new/14981424/" target="_blank">An unrelated brush fire in the area</a> complicated the repairs, according to NJ Transit.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">This was the latest in a string of incidents that have adversely impacted rail commuters.  <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/overhead-wire-issues-suspend-service-new-york-penn/14969643/" target="_blank">On Tuesday, NJ Transit and Amtrak commuters experienced delays and cancelations</a> due to overhead wire problems in the morning and later a stalled train outside Penn Station.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">NJ Transit and CEO Kevin Corbett released the following statement Friday afternoon, and called the issues "unacceptable."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"We are as frustrated as our customers, and the frequency and impact these issues are having on our customers' quality of life is clearly unacceptable. Regarding today's incident specifically, we've had rail maintenance supervisors positioned at Newark Penn Station to inspect trains in light of the recent incidents. The train involved was inspected thoroughly before leaving Newark, including the pantograph, and no defects were found," Corbett said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Corbett went on to say that they are working with Amtrak to identify root causes of the recent spate of incidents.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"For instance, Amtrak reported that yesterday's incident was caused by one of their circuit breakers impacting power between Philadelphia and New Haven," Corbett said. "What we can say is that we operate approximately 700 trains every weekday along hundreds of miles of track on 11 rail lines with the same equipment and these incidents are mainly occurring on just this one stretch of track on the NEC between Newark and New York. We continue to offer Amtrak our assistance to resolve the issue."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">But perhaps a piece of good news to emerge from the difficult transportation week in the Garden State, New Jersey has a <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/nj-transit-funding-new-jersey-has-tentative-tax/14986070/" target="_blank">tentative agreement in place</a> with the state's most profitable companies to temporarily pay higher taxes to fund NJ Transit.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Under the plan, the 600 corporations in the state that make at least $10 million a year in profits will pay a 2.5% tax on all earnings for five years.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In return, the state will not pursue restoring the sales tax to 7% from to 6.625%, a major point of contention for the businesses, who strongly oppose increasing the corporate tax rate.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Both the "transit tax" and a final state budget still need to be approved by the Legislature next week.

								<p>US regulators are flagging JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank and Goldman Sachs over the banks’ contingency plans for trillions of dollars in derivatives.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) say the lenders’ so-called “living wills” – which in part detail how banks could safely unwind their derivatives portfolios without requiring government assistance – are inadequate, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-bank-regulators-find-flaws-four-big-bank-living-wills-2024-06-21/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reports</a> Reuters.</p>


<p>For Citigroup specifically, the regulators say shortcomings in the bank’s data management and control systems are corrupting the bank’s calculations on how much liquidity and capital it would need to close derivatives positions in the event of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The use of derivatives played a central role in the 2008 financial crisis, significantly amplifying systemic risks and triggering widespread losses and instability when the underlying mortgage assets defaulted.</p>
<p>Per Reuters,</p>
<p><em>“Big banks hold derivatives worth trillions of dollars in notional value and potential changes to how they manage the risk, liquidity or contingent liabilities on those portfolios could be extremely expensive.”</em></p>
<p>The agency says the banking giants need to “address contingency planning” including how to ensure the lenders can obtain necessary approvals or actions from foreign governments to carry out their resolution plans effectively.</p>
<p>Big banks are required to file living wills due to the Dodd-Frank Act, which passed in the aftermath of 2008.</p>
<p>US regulators are giving the big banks until September to address their shortcomings.</p>

<li><strong>Prices hit an all-time high</strong>: The median sales price of previously owned homes reached a record high of $419,300 in May, contributing to the affordability challenges faced by homebuyers.</li>
<li><strong>Interest rates hovering around 7%</strong>: Elevated interest rates are making it difficult for homebuyers to afford homes, with rates hovering around 7% for several weeks.</li>

<li><strong>Millennials have grown up</strong>: The eldest millennials, born in 1981, turn 43 this year, and the majority of the generation has entered peak milestone years of homebuying and starting families.</li>
<li><strong>Younger millennials are aging out of their 20s</strong>: Only 9 million 20-something millennials remain, and the youngest of the generation, born in 1995 and 1996, are turning 28 and 29 this year, leaving only a small cohort to represent young adulthood.</li>
<li><strong>"Zillennials" are a new microgeneration</strong>: This group, born between 1995 and 1996, are caught between millennial and Gen Z generations and are shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted their early careers and wealth-building years.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on the workplace</strong>: Late 20-somethings, in particular, have seen their in-office experience shortened due to the pandemic, which may have negatively affected their ability to learn soft skills and led to missing out on growth opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Struggles point to larger cracks in social support systems</strong>: These late 20-somethings are faring better than their older millennial peers, but their struggles highlight issues with America's social support systems, which need to be addressed to ensure successful transitions into adulthood.</li>

The youngest of the generation, born in 1995 and 1996, turn 28 and 29 this year, and just under 9 million 20-something millennials remain, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-national-detail.html" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">per the US Census</a>. This cohort falls into cusper territory, those born between generations, and are part of the larger "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spotting-zillennials-millenial-gen-z-tiktok-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Zillennial</a>" microgeneration.</p><p class="premium">Not quite millennial, not quite Gen Z, these late 20-somethings are shaped by the pandemic happening early on in their careers and initial wealth-building years. In some ways, they're actually faring better than their older millennial peers, and their struggles point to larger cracks in America's social support systems.</p><h2 id="7edd6569-b00b-494c-ac42-72ec8eefba36" data-toc-id="7edd6569-b00b-494c-ac42-72ec8eefba36" class="premium"><strong>A bridge in the workplace</strong></h2><p class="premium">Diana Elliott, vice president of programs at Population Reference Bureau (PRB), told Business Insider that one's late 20s have always been peak years to establish careers. However, these particular late 20-somethings saw the pandemic shorten their typical in-office experience more than the rest of their generation. They were only 24 and 25 at the time, in the workforce for just a few years, and they fear it gave them an uneven footing in the labor force.</p><p class="premium">"They feel this has negatively affected their ability to learn the soft skills that come from working in an office and may lead to missing out on growth opportunities," Gabby Davis, a career expert at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indeed.com/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">Indeed</a> and younger millennial herself, told Business Insider. But Davis said Indeed research shows they don't want to go back into an office full-time. While return-to-office mandates have the potential to push them away, she says the youngest millennials are more likely to stick around in a job than Gen Z, who view their jobs with more dispensability.</p><p class="premium">Cuspers often act as a bridge in the workplace, but younger millennials may find it challenging to bridge this generational gap when reporting to older colleagues and managing younger ones, Davis said. But they've already pushed for greater flexibility, communication, and transparency at work, which she thinks can help them ease that transition. Millennials, now the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/04/28/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers-as-americas-largest-generation/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">largest generation</a>, will continue to move into leadership roles as they age into their 30s and 40s which Davis believes will help "foster diversity, accountability, and more meaningful workplaces."</p><p class="premium">As the generation ages, Elliott predicts they'll start taking over boomers' roles as they retire. "We're going to see a lot of exits from the labor force, not just now but into the next decade or so," she says. "So it could be a really interesting time for opportunities for young millennials in the labor market."</p><h2 id="8157dcf1-280c-4073-80a1-e4aa7cceef67" data-toc-id="8157dcf1-280c-4073-80a1-e4aa7cceef67" class="premium"><strong>Rollin' in the dough</strong></h2><p class="premium">At first glance, it seemed the pandemic might also jeopardize the wealth trajectory of the youngest millennials and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-class-of-2020-a-look-at-gen-z-as-it-graduates-into-chaos" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">oldest Gen Zers</a>. Older millennials struggled with the aftermath of the Great Recession and 2008 financial crisis, the rising cost of living, and $1.2 trillion in student loan debt.</p><p class="premium">In 2018, the St. Louis Fed predicted that those born in the 1980s were at risk of being a "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/1980s-millennials-wealth-the-great-recession-2018-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">lost generation</a>" when it came to wealth accumulation. Fortunately, that didn't come to pass: By 2022, their wealth levels were 37% above expectations. But the wealth of younger millennials and older Gen Zers made an even sharper swing at 39%.</p><p class="premium">That wealth is even more striking when compared to their older peers at the same age. In 2013, 24- to 33-year-olds had a typical wealth level of $16,567, per data the St. Louis Fed provided Business Insider. That's more than doubled (even accounting for inflation) for those aged 26 to 32 in 2022, who have a typical wealth level of $55,760.</p><p class="premium">It shows how much the macroeconomic context can change even within a generation. St. Louis Fed data scientist Lowell Ricketts told Business Insider at the end of May, "you have these older millennials still grappling with some of the aftermath of the Great Recession, a subdued economy in which employment outcomes languish for some time," he said. "Younger millennials have made it by 2022 through much of the pandemic disruptions and found themselves with a much higher amount of wealth accumulated."</p><p class="premium">Ricketts said the coronavirus recession's shorter duration and more aggressive federal policy response saved them. A government cash infusion and a lockdown that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/henrys-millennials-pandemic-reopening-financial-challenges-2020-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">prevented us from spending on trips and dinners out</a> "buoyed a lot of financial outcomes across the wealth spectrum," making 2022 an overall high-water mark for wealth accumulation.</p><h2 id="0b639908-5cdb-46ab-a460-2f9c4335c4e3" data-toc-id="0b639908-5cdb-46ab-a460-2f9c4335c4e3" class="premium"><strong>Creatively becoming homeowners</strong></h2><p class="premium">The Fed finds that real estate was a primary driver for younger millennials' wealth gains, as a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/housing-market-forecast-millennials-buying-homes-crisis-2021-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">hot pandemic housing market</a> hiked up home values. But aren't millennials <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/first-time-homebuyer-challenges-starter-home-shortage-millennials-gen-z-2021-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">unable to buy homes</a>, especially those who've had less time to save? Ricketts said that despite affordability issues, some have managed to make it work.</p><p class="premium">Younger millennials are getting creative about becoming homeowners, explained Jessica Lautz, deputy chief economist and vice president of research at the National Association of Realtors. They're living at home first to save money or partnering up — 19% of those aged 25 to 33, which includes the youngest millennials, are unmarried couples, the highest NAR sees among any generation in its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/home-buyer-and-seller-generational-trends" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">Generational Trends Report</a>.</p><p class="premium">They're also the most likely to get down payment transfers, often from family members helping out with the purchase. Maybe that's why 55% of them prefer to live near friends and family; the only other generation that comes close to this preference is retirees. "They're moving from their family members' homes, before purchasing at higher rates, so perhaps they have that strong family connection already," Lautz said. "During COVID, a lot of people reprioritized what's important to them, and family is more important."</p><h2 id="b73814ff-9863-435b-9c94-4ec056a32a92" data-toc-id="b73814ff-9863-435b-9c94-4ec056a32a92" class="premium"><strong>A mixed bag for women</strong></h2><p class="premium">Young millennial women have especially seen their economic well-being improve; the rise of educational opportunities has them outearning what their mothers and grandmothers did relative to men, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prb.org/resources/losing-more-ground/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">PRB research</a>. "The pay gap is closing with every successive cohort," Elliott said.</p><p class="premium">Because younger millennial women are focused on their careers, they're continuing the overall millennial trend of delaying family formation. The US fertility rate decreased by 3% between 2022 and 2023, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2024/20240525.htm" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">reaching a historic</a> low. "What this suggests is that younger millennials will likely have smaller families," Elliott said. This is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/birth-rate-decline-pandemic-millennials-change-reshaped-economy-infrastructure-2021-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">neither good nor bad</a>, but interplays with other economic factors such as housing affordability, getting a foothold in the work world, and student debt.</p><p class="premium">Of course, generations are nuanced. Not everyone is faring well; some millennials are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-typical-alice-middle-class-poverty-housing-food-benefits-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">stuck in poverty</a>, and young millennial women have lost ground in terms of health and safety. "Systems and supports are not in place to understand how to best help people," Elliott said. "We need that right now. In terms of maternal mortality, it reflects a lot of the ways in which the U.S. does not do as well as its peer countries."</p><p class="premium">And some of younger millennials' accumulated wealth has faded thanks to inflation, Ricketts said. Still, he's hopeful that "the wealth outcomes we see in 2022 might be an optimistic note and a source of strength going forward."</p><p class="premium">He pointed out that younger millennials who invest their wealth well are more likely to consume and drive economic growth.

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Treasury Department on Friday fleshed out a proposed rule that would restrict and monitor U.S. investments in China for artificial intelligence, computer chips and quantum computing.</p><p>The proposed rule stems from President Joe Biden’s August 2023 executive order <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-china-investment-ai-national-security-dd6a5b138e6c7cba31468dc89f776e8d">regarding the access that “countries of concern”</a></span> have to American dollars that fund advanced technologies, which the U.S. government says would enhance their military, intelligence, surveillance and cyber capabilities. The order identified China, Hong Kong and Macau as countries of concern.</p><p>The Biden administration has sought to stymie the development of technologies by China, the world’s second-largest economy, that could give it a military edge or enable it to dominate emerging sectors such as electric vehicles.</p><p>In addition to the proposed rule, Democrat Biden has also placed <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-byd-auto-seagull-auto-ev-cae20c92432b74e95c234d93ec1df400">a stiff tariff on Chinese EVs</a></span>, an issue with political implications as the president and Republican Donald Trump are both trying to show voters who can best stand up to China, a geopolitical rival and major trading partner.</p>
    

<p>The proposed rule outlines the required information that U.S. citizens and permanent residents must provide when engaging in transactions in this area, as well as what would be considered a violation of the restrictions.</p>



<p>It specifically would prohibit American investors from funding AI systems in China that could be used for weapons targeting, combat and location tracking, among other military applications, according to a senior Treasury official who previewed the rule for reporters on the condition of anonymity.</p>
    
<p>J. Philip Ludvigson, a partner at King &amp; Spalding and a former Treasury official for Investment Security, said “companies and investors are now getting a much better look at what will be expected of them” under the new outbound investment program. “These added details are particularly important because the private sector will be shouldering the many due diligence and compliance burdens associated with making new investments,” he said.</p>
    

<p>Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, a nonprofit organization of American firms that do business in China, said his organization “supports the Biden administration’s efforts to protect U.S. national security while also ensuring robust commercial exchange with China for the benefit of American companies, workers and our economy.”</p><p>Treasury is seeking comment on the proposal through Aug. 4, 2024, and after that is expected to issue a final rule.</p><p>Biden administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have insisted that they have no interest in “decoupling” from China — however, tensions between the two nations have increased in recent years. </p><p>After the U.S. military in February 2023 <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-china-antony-blinken-51e49202f2a0a50541cde059934c4cfb">shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the Carolina coast</a></span> after it traversed sensitive military sites across North America, China threatened repercussions. </p><p>Since then, incidents between the two nations based on national security concerns have regularly occurred.</p><p>For instance, Biden in May issued an order blocking a Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining firm from owning land near a Wyoming nuclear missile base, calling its proximity to the base a “national security risk.”</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Record volume on US exchanges</strong>: Friday's trading saw nearly 18 billion shares change hands, a 55% increase above the three-month average, driven by the expiration of derivatives contracts known as "triple witching".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact on markets</strong>: The expiration led to a rollercoaster ride for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 edging lower and individual stocks like Nvidia and Apple experiencing significant volatility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nvidia's role</strong>: Nvidia's options expiration was the second-largest of any underlying asset, and its index weight was set to rise dramatically, potentially at the expense of Apple's. This caused traders to be wary of outsized movements in the market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tech fund inflows</strong>: Despite concerns about equity concentration risk, record inflows of $8.7 billion into tech funds were seen, driven by the artificial-intelligence frenzy surrounding Nvidia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Downgrade of technology sector</strong>: Truist Advisory Services is downgrading the technology sector to "neutral" after it largely outperformed the S&amp;P 500 since their "overweight" call in November, citing concerns about the industry's high valuation.</p>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s massive expiration of options not only left stock traders more cautious, it also drove one of the leaders of the bull market to a roller-coaster ride. Volume soared at the close of trading.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>It was estimated that $5.5 trillion expired during the quarterly event ominously known as “triple witching” in which derivatives contracts tied to equities, index options and futures mature. Nearly 18 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges Friday. That’s over 55% above the three-month average.</p><p>This time around, Nvidia Corp. played an added role. The value of contracts tied to the chipmaker due Friday was the second-largest of any underlying asset, lagging only the S&amp;P 500. And the expiration coincided with index rebalancing by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p><p>To Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers, the “key” rebalance was set to occur in the Technology Select Sector Index — which is the benchmark for the roughly $80 billion XLK exchange-traded fund.</p><p>“Nvidia’s index weight will rise dramatically, mostly at the expense of Apple’s,” he noted. “Considering the outsized importance of megacap tech overall — and Nvidia in particular — upon broad market indices, it is not unreasonable for traders to be wary about outsized movements late in the day.”</p><p>As the contracts disappear, investors adjust their positions, adding a burst of volume capable of swinging individual holdings. The S&amp;P 500 edged lower to around 5,465. Nvidia almost erased a plunge of about 5% before pushing lower again. It erased over $220 billion in value in two days. Apple Inc. also fell.</p><p>Treasury 10-year yields were little changed at 4.25%. France’s risk premium over Germany closed at the highest since 2012.</p><p>The artificial-intelligence frenzy that briefly made Nvidia the world’s most-valuable company this week also drove record inflows into tech funds, said Bank of America Corp. strategists.</p><p>About $8.7 billion flowed into tech funds in the week through June 19, according to a note from the bank citing EPFR Global data.</p><p>“The ‘all roads lead to Nvidia’ trade is once again bolstered” as Europe falters amid the political turmoil in France, strategist Michael Hartnett said. Still, while investors still feel they need more exposure to AI-related plays, “all asset allocators are concerned about the equity concentration risk.”</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services says the firm is downgrading the technology sector to “neutral” after the industry largely outperformed the S&amp;P 500 since their “overweight” call in November.</p><p>“Although we still have a favorable long-term view of technology, on a shorter-term basis the sector appears extended, and we would not be chasing the sector,” Lerner noted. “That said, the sector appears far from ‘bubble’ territory, and we believe secular tailwinds will persist around artificial intelligence.”</p><p>Friday’s options event came at a critical juncture for markets positioning for the second half of 2024 and the Federal Reserve’s next steps. Data showed US services activity picked up early this month to the fastest pace in more than two years. Separately, sales of existing homes fell for a third straight month.</p><p>“Investors should brace for drama,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management. “The second half of 2024 is shaping up to be a time of transition and volatility.

<li>A 1924-built three-bedroom, two-bathroom home in Russian Hill, San Francisco has been listed for sale on Zillow for $488,000, despite its value being estimated at $1.5 million just last month.</li>
<li>The home has a tenant living there who is paying only $416.67 in monthly rent and has a lease that grants them occupancy rights until 2053.</li>
<li>The Zillow listing mentions that the tenant's lease has "unconventional method of rental payment" and "possible occupancy rights" that will keep the buyer from moving in for decades.</li>
<li>Despite the property's appeal, its list price has dropped sharply from its previous estimated value, likely due to the tenant's long-term lease and the need for the buyer to wait until 2053 to move in.</li>
<li>The home's previous owner was over 100 years old and died by natural causes in the home, adding to the property's unusual circumstances.</li>

    <div><p>A three-bedroom, two-bathroom home built in 1924 in an upscale San Francisco neighborhood saw its value tumble after the recently listed property came with a major catch.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>The single-family house on North View Court in Russian Hill <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/30-N-View-Ct-San-Francisco-CA-94109/15070477_zpid/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/30-N-View-Ct-San-Francisco-CA-94109/15070477_zpid/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/30-N-View-Ct-San-Francisco-CA-94109/15070477_zpid/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">went on the market for $488,000 on Zillow</a> two weeks ago. That looks like a steal considering other homes on the cul-de-sac are valued at well above $1 million, with one approaching $3 million.</p>



<p>But any buyer would have to wait decades to actually move in because there’s a tenant living there who’s only paying $416.67 in monthly rent and isn’t going anywhere for a while.</p>



<p>“Tenant’s current lease appears to grant tenants strong long term rent rate amount restrictions, unconventional method of rental payment, and possible occupancy rights until 2053,” the <a href="https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Zillow</a> listing says. “This is an AS-IS sale and seller hereby reserves the right to reject, counter and/or accept any offer. Seller &amp; listing agent do not guarantee access to the home and STRONGLY recommend buyers review the seller disclosure package/addenda and confer with a San Francisco landlord/tenant attorney BEFORE making offer.”</p>



<p>The home’s previous owner was more than 100 years old and died by natural causes in the home, the listing adds.</p><p></p>



<p>Despite the home’s “nice curb appeal” and Edwardian-style design, its $488,000 list price is well below Zillow’s $526,500 “<a href="https://www.zillow.com/z/zestimate/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.zillow.com/z/zestimate/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.zillow.com/z/zestimate/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Zestimate</a>” and down sharply from its value of $1.5 million just last month, according to the <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/22/real-estate/san-francisco-home-hits-market-for-488k-but-buyers-have-to-wait-30-years-to-move-in/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://nypost.com/2024/06/22/real-estate/san-francisco-home-hits-market-for-488k-but-buyers-have-to-wait-30-years-to-move-in/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://nypost.com/2024/06/22/real-estate/san-francisco-home-hits-market-for-488k-but-buyers-have-to-wait-30-years-to-move-in/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">New York Post</a></em>, representing a decline of more than 60%.</p>



<p>The house still drew a drew long line of prospective buyers last week, <a href="https://abc30.com/post/san-francisco-russian-hill-home-sale-cant-move-in/14982412/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://abc30.com/post/san-francisco-russian-hill-home-sale-cant-move-in/14982412/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://abc30.com/post/san-francisco-russian-hill-home-sale-cant-move-in/14982412/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">local TV reports</a> said. That may be because the listing advertises the home as “an excellent investment opportunity for just the right buyer.”</p>



<p>Douglas Lee, a real estate agent with <a href="https://fortune.com/company/compass/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/compass/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Compass</a>, told the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-06-21/a-house-under-500k-in-the-bay-area-catch-is-theres-a-tenant-until-2053" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-06-21/a-house-under-500k-in-the-bay-area-catch-is-theres-a-tenant-until-2053" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a> that the home is an opportunity to “land bank,” or defer using the property for long time.</p>



<p>“You sit and wait until that tenant either dies, vacates or the lease ends,” he told the <em>Times</em>. “Once that happens, you realize a ton of your potential. That’s a really good purchase for trust fund people. If you’re buying it for your kid who is like zero or 1, in 18 years you know that this thing will be about ready to realize.”</p>



<p>The relatively cheap property is contrast with the overall housing market, which has grown increasingly unaffordable, especially in places like California.</p><p></p>



<p>Nationwide, the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/21/housing-market-crisis-home-prices-record-high-existing-sales-inventory/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/21/housing-market-crisis-home-prices-record-high-existing-sales-inventory/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/06/21/housing-market-crisis-home-prices-record-high-existing-sales-inventory/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">price on sales of existing homes</a> jumped to a fresh record high in May even as the supply increased. In addition, Zillow says <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/16/housing-market-crisis-impossibly-unaffordable-cities-california-feudalizing-land-home-prices/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/16/housing-market-crisis-impossibly-unaffordable-cities-california-feudalizing-land-home-prices/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/06/16/housing-market-crisis-impossibly-unaffordable-cities-california-feudalizing-land-home-prices/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">buyers must now put down roughly 35%</a>, or almost $128,000, to afford a typical home.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, high home prices are having a “<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/16/housing-market-crisis-impossibly-unaffordable-cities-california-feudalizing-land-home-prices/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/16/housing-market-crisis-impossibly-unaffordable-cities-california-feudalizing-land-home-prices/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">feudalizing impact</a>” on California, as policies that limit urban sprawl have raised land values, according to the annual <a href="http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT"><em>Demographia International Housing Affordability</em></a> report, which was produced by Chapman University in California and the Frontier Centre for Public Policy in Canada.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the Fortune Next to Lead newsletter to get weekly strategies on how to make it to the corner office. </p><a href="https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p> before it launches on June 24, 2024.</p></div></div>

<div class="articlebody clear cf" id="articlebody">
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions against a dozen individuals serving executive and senior leadership roles at Kaspersky Lab, a day after the Russian company was <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/06/us-bans-kaspersky-software-citing.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">banned</a> by the Commerce Department.</p>
<p>The move "underscores our commitment to ensure the integrity of our cyber domain and to protect our citizens against malicious cyber threats," Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian E. Nelson, said.</p>
<p>"The United States will take action where necessary to hold accountable those who would seek to facilitate or otherwise enable these activities."</p>

<p>The sanctions, however, do not extend to Kaspersky Lab, its parent or subsidiary companies, nor the company's founder and chief executive officer (CEO), Eugene Kaspersky, OFAC noted. The 12 C-suite and senior-level executives sanctioned are listed below -</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrei Gennadyevich Tikhonov, Chief Operating Officer (COO) and board member</li>
<li>Daniil Sergeyevich Borshchev, Deputy CEO and board member</li>
<li>Andrei Anatolyevich Efremov, Chief Business Development Officer (CBDO) and board member</li>
<li>Igor Gennadyevich Chekunov, Chief Legal Officer (CLO) and board member</li>
<li>Andrey Petrovich Dukhvalov, Vice President and Director of Future Technologies</li>
<li>Andrei Anatolyevich Suvorov, Head of Kaspersky Operating System Business Unit</li>
<li>Denis Vladimirovich Zenkin, Head of Corporate Communications</li>
<li>Marina Mikhaylovna Alekseeva, Chief Human Resources (HR) Officer</li>
<li>Mikhail Yuryevich Gerber, Executive Vice President of Consumer Business</li>

<li>Kirill Aleksandrovich Astrakhan, Executive Vice President for Corporate Business</li>
<li>Anna Vladimirovna Kulashova, Managing Director for Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)</li>
</ul>
<p>The development follows actions by the Commerce Department prohibiting Kaspersky from providing its software and other security services in America starting July 20, 2024, citing national security concerns. The company has also been placed on the Entity List.</p>

<p>Russia has said the sales ban on Kaspersky software was a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/kremlin-says-us-decision-ban-kaspersky-software-designed-stifle-competition-2024-06-21/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">typical move</a> by the U.S. to stifle foreign competition with American products. Kaspersky has maintained that it has no links to the Russian government.</p>

<li>Alaska Airlines flight attendants have reached a tentative agreement on a new contract with the airline's management, after voting to authorize a strike in February 2024.</li>
<li>The new contract, which has been described as a "record contract" by the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, would likely include significant wage increases to reflect recent inflation.</li>
<li>The negotiations were facilitated by the National Mediation Board and took place over the past week in Washington.</li>
<li>The exact details of the contract are not yet being released, but the union will work with the airline to "clean up" the contract language and present it to the Master Executive Council for a vote. If approved, the membership will then vote to ratify the agreement.</li>
<li>While the tentative agreement is a positive development, it's not guaranteed that the membership will ultimately ratify the contract. Southwest Airlines flight attendants, for example, initially rejected the first tentative agreement before ratifying a revised agreement.</li>

<p>At the moment, we’re seeing flight attendants at most major US airlines trying to ratify new contracts (except at Delta, where flight attendants aren’t unionized). Flight attendants largely haven’t had pay increases since before the pandemic, and are looking for significant raises, to reflect the inflation we’ve seen in recent years.</p>



<p>Back in April, Southwest flight attendants <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/news/southwest-airlines-flight-attendant-contract/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became the first to ratify a new contract</a>, and it’s probably the richest flight attendant contract we’ve ever seen, in terms of wage increases, retroactive pay, and more.</p>



<p>There’s now a positive update for another US airline, as Alaska flight attendants now have a tentative agreement on a new contract, which should help with labor relations at the Seattle-based oneworld carrier.</p>




<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alaska-flight-attendants-reach-new-tentative-agreement"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="alaska_flight_attendants_reach_new_tentative_agreement" ez-toc-data-id="#alaska_flight_attendants_reach_new_tentative_agreement"></span>Alaska flight attendants reach new tentative agreement<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents Alaska’s flight attendants, has just announced that it has reached a tentative agreement with Alaska management for a “record contract.”</p>







<p>The union describes this tentative agreement as having been reached with the help of the National Mediation Board (NMB). Over the past week, negotiations took place in Washington, with AFA International President Sara Nelson and AFA General Counsel in attendance, along with Alaska Chief Operating Officer Constance von Muehlen.</p>



<p>Exact details of the contract aren’t yet being released. The union states that in the coming days, both parties will “work to clean up the contract language to present the full text of the TA to the Master Executive Council.” The Master Executive Council will then vote to release the agreement for a full membership ratification vote. </p>





<p>Back in February 2024, Alaska flight attendants voted to authorize a strike, with 99.48% of participants voting in favor of a strike (and 93.47% of flight attendants participating in the vote). So it’s good to see that there’s finally some common ground between management and the union.</p>



<p>However, I wouldn’t assume it’s a given that the membership will necessarily ratify the new contract. For example, Southwest flight attendants rejected the first tentative agreement they were presented by the union during their negotiations, and only ratified the second agreement, after additional improvements.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AS-FA.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-322800"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Alaska flight attendants have been fighting for a new contract</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-i-m-curious-how-lucrative-this-contract-is"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="im_curious_how_lucrative_this_contract_is" ez-toc-data-id="#im_curious_how_lucrative_this_contract_is"></span>I’m curious how lucrative this contract is<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>It’s interesting how the union is referring to the tentative agreement as a “record contract.” Is that suggesting that this is the most lucrative contract that has been negotiated in the entire industry so far, or just a record for the airline (which seems like it would be a given)?</p>



<p>The reason I ask is because historically Alaska hasn’t exactly had the best pay in the industry. The airline has paid much better than ultra low cost carriers, but not consistently to the same level as carriers like Southwest.</p>



<p>Southwest flight attendants have ratified a new contract whereby they get immediate 22% pay increases, and 3% pay increases in each of 2025, 2026, and 2027. On top of that, they received retro pay, which comes out to around $18K per flight attendant. Does that mean Alaska flight attendants are getting contracts that are even more lucrative?</p>



<p>With a second carrier now nearing a new contract, this should also <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/news/american-flight-attendants-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help American flight attendants</a> with getting a new contract, as American has had the most hostile negotiations on a new contract.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Alaska-737-MAX-8-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-284781"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">I’m curious how lucrative this new contract is</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bottom-line"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="bottom_line" ez-toc-data-id="#bottom_line"></span>Bottom line<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The union representing Alaska flight attendants has announced that a tentative agreement has been reached for a new “record contract.” The details are expected to be released in the coming days, so it’ll be interesting to see the details.</p>



<p>It’s great news that flight attendants at a second US airline are nearing a new contract, as it should help with this cycle of negotiations, providing stability to passengers (though perhaps a little less stability to the bottom line of airlines). </p>



<p><strong>What do you make of Alaska flight attendants getting a tentative agreement on a new contract?</strong></p>

<li><strong>FDA expands approval for gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy</strong>: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has expanded approval for a gene therapy called Elevidys (delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl) to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) despite the fact that it failed a Phase III clinical trial.</li>
<li>** FDA Director Peter Marks made the decision**: The decision to approve the therapy was made almost entirely by Peter Marks, Director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, over the objections of three of FDA's own expert review teams and two of its directors.</li>
<li><strong>Original approval was over objections</strong>: The therapy initially gained an FDA approval last year, also over objections from staff, and was only approved for use in DMD patients ages 4 and 5 who are able to walk. The new approval opens access to DMD patients of all ages, regardless of ambulatory status.</li>
<li><strong>Criticism of the decision</strong>: The move has been criticized by researchers, who have called it "a string of controversies" and a "disgraceful decision" in light of the therapy's failure in a clinical trial and the fact that it was approved over the objections of many experts.</li>
<li><strong>FDA remains committed to advancing treatments for patients</strong>: Despite criticism, the FDA director, Peter Marks, stated that the agency remains committed to helping advance safe and effective treatments for patients with devastating and life-threatening diseases like DMD.</li>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday announced <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-expands-approval-gene-therapy-patients-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy">expanded approval for a gene therapy to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy</a> (DMD)—despite the fact that it failed a Phase III clinical trial last year and that the approval came over the objections of three of FDA's own expert review teams and two of its directors.</p>
<p>In fact, the decision to expand the approval of the therapy—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delandistrogene_moxeparvovec">called Elevidys</a> (delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl)—appears to have been decided almost entirely by Peter Marks, Director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>Elevidys initially gained an FDA approval last year, also over objections from staff. The therapy intravenously delivers a transgene that codes for select portions of a protein called dystrophin in healthy muscle cells; the protein is mutated in patients with DMD. Last year's initial approval occurred under an accelerated approval process and was only for use in DMD patients ages 4 and 5 who are able to walk. In the actions Thursday, the FDA granted a traditional approval for the therapy and opened access to DMD patients of all ages, regardless of ambulatory status.</p>
<p>"Today’s approval broadens the spectrum of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy eligible for this therapy, helping to address the ongoing, urgent treatment need for patients with this devastating and life-threatening disease," Marks said in the announcement Thursday. "We remain steadfast in our commitment to help advance safe and effective treatments for patients who desperately need them."</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Criticism</h2>
<p>The move, which follows <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/a-disgraceful-decision-researchers-blast-fda-for-approving-alzheimers-drug/">a string of controversies</a> in recent years of the FDA issuing questionable approvals over the assessments of advisors and its own staff, has quickly drawn criticism from agency watchers.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/sarepta-why">a blog post Friday</a>, a notable pharmaceutical industry expert and commentator, Derek Lowe, admonished the approval. Lowe expressed concern that the agency seems to be tilting toward emotional rhetoric and the will of patient advocates over scientific and medical evidence.</p>
<p>"It appears that all you need is a friend high up in the agency and your clinical failures just aren't an issue any more," he wrote. "Review committees aren't convinced? Statisticians don't buy your arguments? Who cares! Peter Marks is here to deliver hot, steaming takeout containers full of Hope. ... And while I realize that this may make me sound like a heartless SOB, I think this is a huge mistake that we will be paying for for a long time."</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/20/sarepta-duchenne-elevidys-fda-approval-peter-marks-overruled-staff/">a comment to Stat News</a>, former FDA chief scientist Luciana Borio echoed concerns about how decisions like this will affect the agency in the longer term.</p>
<p>"I don’t know what to say. Peter Marks makes a mockery of scientific reasoning and approval standards that have served patients well over decades," said Borio, who has also opposed earlier controversial approvals. "This type of action also promotes the growing mistrust in scientific institutions like the FDA."</p>
<h2>Internal dissent</h2>
<p>In a series of review documents and memos released by the FDA, the divide between Marks and agency staff is abundantly clear. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/179489/download?attachment">A review by FDA statisticians</a> concluded that the collective clinical trial results "do not suggest there is substantial evidence to support the effectiveness of [Elevidys] for the expanded indication to all DMD patients and do not support the conversion of accelerated to traditional approval."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/179486/download?attachment">A joint review from the agency's Clinical and Clinical Pharmacology teams</a> likewise concluded that the "totality of the data does not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness of Elevidys for treatment of ambulatory DMD patients of any age" and that the results "argue against" expanding access.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/179487/download?attachment">In a memo</a>, Lola Fashoyin-Aje, Director of the Office of Clinical Evaluation in the Office of Therapeutic Products (OTP), and Dr. Nicole Verdun, Super Office Director of the OTP, concluded that the clinical results "cast significant uncertainty regarding the benefits of treatment of DMD with Elevidys." The two directors found the primary clinical trial endpoint results were "not statistically significant" and smaller analyses looking at secondary endpoints of specific patient measures—such as the time it takes patients to rise from the floor or walk 10 meters—were "inconclusive," in some cases "conflicting," and overall illustrated the "unreliability of exploratory analyses to support regulatory decision-making."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/179485/download?attachment">In a memo of his own</a>, Marks agreed that primary endpoint result of the trial—based on scores on a standardized assessment of motor function in patients—did not show a statistically significant benefit. But he argued that the secondary endpoints were convincing enough for him. Marks wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Specifically, although acknowledging that the Applicant’s randomized study of Elevidys failed to meet its statistical primary endpoint ... I find that the observations regarding the secondary endpoints and exploratory endpoints are compelling and, combined with other data provided in the efficacy supplement and the original [Biologics License Application], meet the substantial evidence of effectiveness standard ...</p></blockquote>
<p>If Marks had not overruled the agency's reviewers and directors, Fashoyin-Aje wrote that she would have recommended the therapy's maker, Sarepta, conduct "an additional adequate and well-controlled study of Elevidys in the subgroup(s) of patients for which [Sarepta] believes the effects of Elevidys to be most promising." However, Marks' decision to approve renders the possibility of such a trial "highly infeasible to explore in a post-approval setting," she wrote.</p>

<li><strong>FDA approves menthol-flavored e-cigarettes</strong>: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first menthol-flavored e-cigarette products, which are manufactured by NJOY, a subsidiary of tobacco giant Altria Group.</li>
<li><strong>Menthol flavors are a departure from previous policies</strong>: Unlike previous FDA policies, which effectively banned flavored e-cigarettes except for tobacco and mint, the agency has approved menthol as a flavor option.</li>
<li><strong>Public health advocates criticize the decision</strong>: The approval has drawn criticism from some public health advocates, who argue that menthol flavors can appeal to young people and undermine efforts to prevent youth vaping.</li>
<li><strong>The FDA believes e-cigarettes can help adult smokers quit</strong>: The agency has authorized the products under its "predicate rule," which allows e-cigarettes that are substantially equivalent to previously marketed tobacco products to be sold without further review.</li>
<li><strong>The approval comes amid controversy over e-cigarette regulations</strong>: The FDA's decision comes as the agency faces increasing criticism for failing to rein in illegal flavored vaping products and amid mounting legal challenges over its handling of e-cigarette regulations.</li>
