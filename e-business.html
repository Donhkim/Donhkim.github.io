    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tesla shareholders reapprove Elon Musk's record-breaking pay pact</strong>: Despite controversy, 72% of votes cast by shareholders (excluding Elon Musk and his brother Kimbal) approved the $56 billion compensation package for Musk.</li>
<li><strong>Musk's future and leadership of Tesla cleared up</strong>: The approval of Musk's pay package has dissipated concerns about Musk's future and leadership of the company, allowing Tesla to focus on execution and growth.</li>
<li><strong>Analysts optimistic about Tesla's future</strong>: DataTrek's Nick Colas and Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives are bullish on Tesla's future, with Colas stating that "Tesla shareholders have not made the same mistake" as Open AI, which fired Sam Altman, and Ives predicting a "pop-the-champagne" moment for Tesla.</li>
<li><strong>Clouds lifted, Tesla stock expected to rise</strong>: The removal of the overhang on Tesla's stock is expected to lead to an increase in the company's valuation, with Ives predicting Tesla's valuation could reach $1 trillion in 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Focus shifts to execution and growth</strong>: With the pay package approved and concerns about Musk's future cleared up, Tesla is now focused on executing on its growth plans, particularly in autonomous and full self-driving (FSD) technologies.</li>

Musk said limited production of the robots was coming this year, and that Tesla itself would have “a few thousand” robots working in Tesla factories next year.

<li><strong>Consumer sentiment tumbles</strong>: The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey revealed that consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in seven months in June, with a reading of 65.6, down from 69.1 in May.</li>
<li><strong>Higher prices are a pain point</strong>: The decline in sentiment is attributed to modestly rising concerns over high prices and weakening incomes, with many households struggling under the weight of higher interest rates and elevated consumer prices.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation expectations remain steady</strong>: Year-ahead inflation expectations remained unchanged at 3.3% in June, likely influenced by recent positive inflation readings, but not yet factoring in recent positive inflation data from May.</li>
<li><strong>Recent inflation data is not yet reflected</strong>: The survey's interview window ended on June 12, the same day May's Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was released, which reported a 3.3% year-over-year increase in May, the lowest monthly headline reading since July 2022.</li>
<li><strong>Economic growth remains resilient</strong>: Despite the decline in consumer sentiment, the US economy has shown largely resilient growth, with a strong labor market and low unemployment rate, contributing to the overall mixed picture of the economy.</li>

Application software peers like Salesforce Inc., Workday Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. have confronted similar concerns in recent weeks after reporting slowing demand. The results signal that Adobe’s efforts to incorporate AI features into its products are gaining support among customers as the company battles smaller rivals, including startups focused on the emerging technology.</p><p>The shares rose as much as 16.5% after trading opened on Friday, marking the biggest intraday jump since March 2020. After rising 77% in 2023, the stock had dipped 23% through Thursday’s close.</p><p>Adobe expects an acceleration in new creative business through the rest of the fiscal year, Chief Financial Officer Dan Durn said in a conference call after the quarterly results were released.</p><p>The company also raised its fiscal-year profit forecast to as much as $18.20 a share, excluding some items, compared with a previous outlook of $18 a share. Analysts, on average, estimated $18.02.</p><p>Adobe’s proprietary AI model, Firefly, has been integrated into products such as Photoshop and Illustrator while the company is working on developing similar technology for its video-editing software, Premiere. The model has been used to generate over 9 billion images, Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen said.</p><p>The results and share reaction are a “positive contrast to the rest of enterprise software,” Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., wrote in a note.</p><p>In the fiscal second quarter, sales increased 10% to $5.31 billion, Adobe said Thursday in a statement. Profit, excluding some items, was $4.48 a share. Wall Street projected earnings of $4.40 a share on revenue of $5.29 billion.

Monthly active users of Express — Adobe’s product for casual creators that works similarly to Canva — more than doubled in the three months ended May 31 compared with the previous quarter, said David Wadhwani, who oversees Adobe’s creative business.</p><p>Still, the company is in the early stages of making money from AI products, executives said during the call. Adobe is focused on “converting the pipeline, interest and awareness of AI into monetization,” Narayen said.</p><p>The digital media unit, which includes Adobe’s flagship creative and document-processing software, posted an 11% increase in sales to $3.91 billion, in the period ended May 31. Revenue from the unit that includes marketing and analytics software rose 9% to $1.33 billion.</p><p>Particular strength was reported in Adobe’s document cloud business. That unit added $165 million of new annually recurring business in the quarter, compared with the $122.7 million expected by analysts. This was driven by users opting for a new AI-assistant feature, which helps analyze and understand PDFs and other documents, Narayen said during the earnings call.</p><p>The strong outlook should allay investor concerns about other generative AI tools detracting from Adobe’s growth prospects, wrote Anurag Rana, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.</p><p>--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.</p><p>(Updates share price in the fourth paragraph.)</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

<li>The EU Commission's decision came after a probe that found Chinese EVs had an unfair advantage in European markets, leading to the imposition of tariffs.</li>

<p>Just days after the EU Commission determined EVs imported from <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/china/">China</a> have an unfair advantage due to government subsidies and responding with higher tariffs, Germany, one of the region’s largest automotive markets, has spoken against the decision, stating the imposed tariffs could hurt the success of local automakers selling vehicles in China.</p>



<span id="more-367642"></span>



<p>It has been a long saga leading up to this week’s decision by the EU Commission that Chinese EVs have an unfair advantage in European markets following a probe that began last fall. While the probe was taking place behind closed doors, the EU was already <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/31/eu-delays-decision-on-chinese-ev-tariffs-european-parliament-elections/">threatening tariffs on Chinese imports</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the US didn’t need a probe (or many Chinese EV imports, for that matter) to impose its own steep tariffs. In retaliation, China threatened <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/24/china-threatens-tariffs-up-to-25-imports-retaliation-eu-probe-us-tariffs/">tariffs of up to 25%</a> on European-built models like those from Germany, for example, imploring the EU to play fair and not follow the US’ decision.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for China, the EU Commission confirmed the results of its probe, hailing EV imports as unfair due to local subsidies. As a result, it announced <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/06/12/how-new-eu-tariffs-impact-chinese-ev-makers-byd-nio/">plans to slap massive tariffs of up to 48%</a> on those incoming models that are just starting to hit their stride in new markets overseas.</p>



<p>Days later, Germany spoke out against the EU’s decision on tariffs, expressing hope there is still time to reach an agreement to avoid them. Or, at the very least, soften those percentages.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-germany-argues-chinese-tariffs-hurt-eu-automakers-too">Germany argues Chinese tariffs hurt EU automakers too</h2>



<p>Following the EU Commission’s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese EVs next month, the government of Germany is stepping up to try to mediate tensions and, ideally, stop the upcharges altogether.</p>



<p>Per <em>Automotive News Europe</em>, a spokesperson with ties to Berlin officials who requested anonymity said the group remains optimistic <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/germany-works-block-eu-tariffs-chinese-evs">the EU can resolve the issue</a> through direct talks with China. With allies overseas, Germany believes there’s still room (and time) to reverse or soften the tariffs, but both sides must compromise.</p>



<p>Germany’s strongest argument is that retaliatory tariffs against China may also hurt local OEMs, including Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group, and BMW – all of which rely heavily on sales in Asia, particularly China.</p>



<p>Mercedes-Benz is an especially popular automaker in China, and its G- and S-Class vehicles, in particular, have done well with those consumers. As the German automaker goes electric, Mercedes has seen EV growing sales in China and intends to bring <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/23/mercedes-unveils-2025-electric-g-class-with-4-motors-and-tank-turns/">its new all-electric G-Class</a> overseas this year. Germany argues the EU’s tariffs could throw a wrench in those plans as its local OEMs could face the eye-for-eye wrath from the Chinese government.</p>



<p>Germany’s Economy Minister Robert Habeck said there’s still time to stop this looming tariff escalation and will travel to China next week to discuss the issue with government officials.</p>

Cohen’s stake has since increased to more than 36 million shares following a 4-for-1 stock split in July 2022, corporate filings show. He has also purchased additional shares on the open market.</p><p>Gill may have dedicated a significant amount of his cash reserves to increasing his stake in the videogame retailer as his cash on hand had dwindled to $6.3 million from nearly $30 million, according to an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dcv6t6/gme_yolo_update_june_10_2024/?rdt=40415" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:update he shared on Reddit on Monday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0">update he shared on Reddit on Monday</a>.</p><p>According to the latest numbers from FactSet, Gill’s newly expanded position makes him the fourth-largest shareholder in GameStop, with a 2.1% stake based on the company’s most recent share count per corporate filings.

<p>WASHINGTON —<strong> </strong>The U.S. Space Force has selected Blue Origin, SpaceX, and United Launch Alliance for the National Security Space Launch Phase 3 launch services program. The three companies won contracts potentially worth $5.6 billion over five years, the Pentagon announced June 13. </p>

<p>The three companies will compete for orders over the contract period starting in fiscal year 2025 through 2029. Under the NSSL program, the Space Force orders individual launch missions up to two years in advance. At least 30 NSSL Lane 1 missions are expected to be competed over the five years.</p>

<p>The Phase 3 contract is a big win for Blue Origin, marking the first time the space company founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos has been selected to launch sensitive national security satellites. SpaceX and ULA — a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture — have had a lock on national security launch contracts under the Phase 2 program that began in 2020.   </p>

<p>Blue Origin did compete for the Phase 2 contract and <a href="https://spacenews.com/in-protest-decision-gao-negates-blue-origins-claim-that-air-force-launch-procurement-favors-incumbents/">unsuccessfully protested</a> the decision.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New Glenn targeting first launch this year</h2>

<p>Blue Origin’s New Glenn heavy lift reusable rocket — in development for nearly a decade — is undergoing testing and is projected to attempt its first <a href="https://spacenews.com/nasa-planning-september-launch-of-mars-smallsat-mission-on-first-new-glenn/">orbital flight later this year</a>. </p>

<p>The NSSL Phase 3 program was structured into two “lanes.” Lane 1 is for less demanding launches to low Earth orbit, while Lane 2 is reserved for heavy lift rockets capable of delivering payloads to nine reference orbits, including some of the most demanding national security missions.</p>

<p>The selection of Blue Origin, SpaceX, and ULA for Lane 1 contracts confirms that no other launch providers met the criteria. Seven bids were submitted, according to the DoD announcement. </p>

<p>“As we anticipated, the pool of awardees is small this year because many companies are still maturing their launch capabilities,” Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, program executive officer for Assured Access to Space, said in a statement. “Our strategy accounted for this by allowing on-ramp opportunities every year, and we expect increasing competition and diversity as new providers and systems complete development.” </p>

<p>The next opportunity for providers to on-ramp will be in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Potential new entrants include Rocket Lab, Relativity Space and Firefly Aerospace which are developing medium lift rockets aimed at Lane 1 missions. </p>

<p>As part of the Phase 3 contract, Blue Origin will receive $5 million to conduct an initial capabilities assessment of its mission assurance. Space X and ULA will receive $1.5 million each since they are incumbent Phase 2 providers. <a href="https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-gets-u-s-space-force-funding-for-new-glenn-integration-studies/">The Space Force earlier this year </a>awarded Blue Origin nearly $18 million for NSSL Phase 3 “early integration studies” to assess the capabilities of the New Glenn rocket.</p>

<p>The first task order opportunity in Phase 3 Lane 1 will be for seven U.S. Space Force Space Development Agency launches and one for the National Reconnaissance Office. “Any launch provider on the base contract can bid for launch service task orders provided they have completed a successful orbital launch prior to the proposal due date,” the Space Force said in a statement June 13.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Space Force wants diversity in launch providers</h2>

<p><a href="https://spacenews.com/space-force-changed-launch-procurement-plan-due-to-concerns-about-capacity/">Space Force officials said</a> the goal of NSSL Phase 3 is to increase competition, drive down launch costs for national security payloads while maintaining assured access to space through redundant capabilities. </p>

<p>“The NSSL Phase 3 launch service procurement contracts provide the opportunity to include the most current domestic commercial innovation into our launch program as soon it becomes available,” said Frank Calvelli, assistant secretary of the Air Force for space acquisition and integration.</p>

<p>The Space Force plans to select Lane 2 providers this fall. “The government intends to award up to three contracts for the NSSL Phase 3 Lane 2 Launch Service Procurement,” said the Space Systems Command. Lane 2 contracts will include missions that require full mission assurance with NSSL-certified launch vehicles. The payloads included in Lane 2 require launches to more stressing orbits than Lane 1, necessitating higher performance launch systems.</p>

  <p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
 </div>
 <div class="key-facts-element">
  <p>Musk, who described himself as “pathologically optimistic” and has a history of making bold claims about his companies that fail to materialize, previously said he thinks Tesla is the “best positioned of any humanoid robot maker” to produce the bots at scale and believes they could become the company’s most valuable asset by far and evidently valuable enough to spur a more than 40-fold increase to Tesla’s market capitalization.</p>
  <p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>
 </div>
 <div class="key-facts-element">
  <p>Animesh Garg, assistant professor of AI robotics at the Georgia Institute of Technology, told Forbes Musk’s timeline is “aggressive” but “realistic from a pure release perspective,” but said the question will be “how useful are the skills that ship out of the box,” particularly when it comes to breadth, generalizability and robustness.</p>
  <p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p>
 </div>
 <div class="key-facts-element">
  <p>To launch, Garg said he would expect Tesla to have a humanoid platform with limbs, though it’s “unclear how robust and useful” the hands will be, but would be surprised if Optimus could perform tasks beyond competent locomotion and skills like picking up objects that aren’t complicated to grasp, with other features like interacting with objects like windows and doors to possibly follow a year or two later.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="key-facts-element">
  <p>Jonathan Aitken, a roboticist at the University of Sheffield in the U.K., agreed Musk’s “timeline would be very challenging” and described 2025 as “ambitious but not out of the question,” saying that a lot depends on “the details of exactly what” Musk is suggesting for its applications.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="key-facts-element">
  <p>Christian Hubicki, a robotics professor at Florida State University, said he “wouldn’t be shocked to see some carefully prepared video demos of an Optimus doing some nominal tasks in a factory” by the end of the year but warned it will be “incredibly difficult” to get the bots into the hands of customers who will find them useful in that time.</p>

<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">What We Don’t Know</h2>
<p>Hubicki said there are several unknowns surrounding the humanoid robots of Tesla and its competitors like Boston Dynamics and Figure AI that are critical to evaluating their potential for use in the real world outside of glitzy, carefully staged demo videos. Foremost among these is reliability, he said, adding that “the only useful robot is a reliable robot.” Hubicki said this “is a problem for humanoids,” where control is still in the laboratory phase and hardware is fragile. “Will they work 90% of the time? 99%? How many 9’s are enough before they’re more useful in your production line than they are a hassle to fix and babysit? Those are the numbers I’d want to know from a humanoids company.”</p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">What’s The Point Of Humanoid Robots?</h2>
<p>Most of the built world is designed for humans and humanoid robots, by design, are well suited to this. While work environments and tasks can be challenging for robots with wheels or other designs to navigate, a humanoid could feasibly thrive and undertake kinds of work that are otherwise limited to humans or very specific machinery. The design imposes a number of formidable technical challenges for both hardware and software, including tasks most humans take for granted like movement and grasping objects. The current boom in AI is helping to drive the field forward, Aitken said, as generalizability is crucial to making humanoids viable tools. “We can't program a robot to pick up 1000 different objects by programming a process for each one individually,” he explained</p>

<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">What To Watch For</h2>
<p>It’s tough to imagine Musk’s claim that Optimus will one day overshadow Tesla’s other products will be realized at any point in the near future, robotics experts told Forbes, particularly its cars. For his part, Musk did not indicate a timeline for the enormous growth he expects Optimus will catalyze. Garg said humanoids are “unlikely to be cashflow positive anytime soon” and despite the hype, they lack a convincing use case that other emerging technologies like driverless cars have. They “will not likely come close to the car business in terms of revenue” for the next decade, he said. Aitken told Forbes “it's hard to see a humanoid competing seriously with the large industrial players in the sector” and questions whether they’d be able to do the kinds of “high-value, dull, dirty and dangerous” work that would motivate a company to invest. Hubicki said he “would not bet on that market approaching automotives for the foreseeable future.” While humanoid bots have “progressed impressively” in recent years, he said they lack a compelling use case suggesting “a massive market is imminent” and at the moment remain “a complicated technology for completing tasks we can already do better.”</p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" class="inread-active" display-called=""></fbs-ad>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Chief Critic</h2>
<p>Analyst Gordon Johnson, of GLJ research, said Musk’s claims were “absurd” and dismissed his year-end 2025 target for Optimus as “utter nonsense and borderline investor fraud.” Johnson said companies that have worked on humanoids for decades haven’t got anywhere close to “where Musk is claiming he will be by the end of 2025.” Optimus is a “pipe dream stock pump,” Johnson said. “There is no product.”</p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Forbes Valuation</h2>
<p>Musk is the world’s richest person and has a net <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/?sh=2c6554bd7999" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/?sh=2c6554bd7999" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/?sh=2c6554bd7999" aria-label="worth">worth</a> of $210.7 billion. Much of his wealth is tied up in Tesla, including a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars that a Delaware judge struck down.

<p>The Associated Press separately found another Perplexity product feature inventing fake quotes from real people, including a former elected town official from Martha’s Vineyard falsely quoted to say he didn’t want the Massachusetts island to become <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-pot-marthas-vineyard-island-time-f59e9907f9d523c7eb60bd6c109cd12c">a destination for marijuana.</a></span></p>



<p>“I never said that,” said Bill Rossi, a former member of the island town of Chilmark’s select board.</p><p>Srinivas told The Associated Press that his company is trying to build positive relationships with news publishers that ensure their news content “reaches more people.”</p>
    
<p>“We can definitely coexist and help each other,” he said.</p><p>Asked about Forbes, he said his product “never ripped off content from anybody. Our engine is not training on anyone else’s content,” in part because the company is simply aggregating what other companies’ AI systems generate.</p><p>“We are actually more of an aggregator of information and providing it to the people with the right attribution,” Srinivas said. But, he added, “It was accurately pointed out by Forbes that they preferred a more prominent highlighting of the source. We took that feedback immediately and updated changes that day itself. And now the sources are more prominently highlighted.”</p>
    

<p>Perplexity also revealed this week that it has been seeking revenue-sharing partnerships that would pay news publishers a portion of Perplexity’s advertising revenue each time an outlet’s news content is referenced as a source.</p><p>Randall Lane, chief content officer of Forbes Media, called the dispute an “inflection point” in the conversation about AI.</p><p>“It’s a case study in where we’re heading,” Lane told the AP. “If the people who are leading the charge don’t have a fundamental respect for the hard work of doing proprietary reporting, and keeping people informed with value-added content, we’ve got a big problem.”</p><p>A self-described “AI bull” who believes that the technology could help make many news organizations more efficient, Lane said the dispute between Perplexity and Forbes is important because it is a “metaphor for what can happen if the people controlling the AI don’t respect the people doing the work.”</p><p>Perplexity bills itself as a search engine while “acting like a media company and publishing a story” that only Forbes had reported, Lane said.</p>
    

<p>“The whole thing was very disingenuous. And what we didn’t hear was, ‘Oops, yeah we messed that one up and we need to do better,’” he said. “Instead, it was just putting out more content, little tweaks to the model and treating journalism like it’s just a commodity to be manufactured.”</p><p>Srinivas, a computer scientist and former AI researcher at OpenAI and Google, co-founded Perplexity in the summer of 2022, not long before the AI image-generator Stable Diffusion and OpenAI’s ChatGPT began sparking the public’s fascination with the possibilities of generative AI.</p><p>Inspired, in part, by his childhood love of Wikipedia, he described Perplexity to the AP as “like a marriage of Wikipedia and ChatGPT” that can instantly answer a person’s questions without the “huge cluttered mess” of Google’s conventional search results.</p><p>“You ask a question, you get an answer with clean sources, and there’s like three or four suggested (follow-up) questions and that’s it,” he said of Perplexity. “That way people’s minds can be free from distractions, and they can just focus on learning and digging deeper.”</p>
    

<p>The company sells a subscription for premium features and is planning to start an advertising-based service as it grows its user base.</p><p>“We are not profitable as a company today, but we are also more sustainably run than foundation model companies because we do not train our own foundation models,” which requires huge amounts of computing power, he said.</p><p>Perplexity relies on existing AI large language models such as those built by OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook; and then “post-trains” them.</p><p>“We shape them to be really good summarizers,” he said.</p><p>It’s not always clear where the summarized information is coming from. One Perplexity feature called Writing — which enables a user to “generate text or chat without searching the web” — produces lengthy and unsourced commentary, often in the style of a news article. Tests of the feature by an AP reporter asking it to write about <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/marthas-vineyard-nantucket-medical-marijuana-cannabis-sold-b1a791faabf107f4f72d7330693a5ece">the lack of marijuana</a></span> on Martha’s Vineyard led it to produce a 465-word document that resembled a news article and included fabricated quotations from the former town official and another real person.</p>
    

<p>The AP is not repeating the false quotes in order to avoid perpetuating misinformation. Srinivas said that the Writing feature of Perplexity is a “minor use case” that was intended for helping to compose essays or correcting grammar when primary source information isn’t needed. He said it’s “more prone to hallucinations” — a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-hallucination-chatbots-chatgpt-falsehoods-ac4672c5b06e6f91050aa46ee731bcf4">common problem with AI</a></span> large language models — because it isn’t tethered to the web search capabilities of Perplexity’s core product.</p><p>“There is no doubt that generative AI is upending journalism, content creation, and search,” said Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute.</p><p>She pointed to Google’s new, Perplexity-like approach that summarizes answers based on information pulled from crawling the web, as an example. That, too, led to false information and forced <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/google-ai-overviews-hallucination-33060569d6cc01abe6c63d21665330d8">Google to make adjustments</a></span> to the product after its public release.</p><p>“But their whole model of advertising is based on sending people to websites,” she said in an email. “Why will people go to websites if they can have the one-stop-shop of the answer in the AI output?”</p><p>Srinivas claimed to the AP that “a lot of people get referrals from Perplexity, and I’m happy that they’re getting referrals from a new player in the internet.”</p><p>For now, much of that benefit may be aspirational. Perplexity’s worldwide user base has grown rapidly this year to more than 85 million web visits in May, but that barely registers compared to the billions of users of ChatGPT and other popular platforms from Microsoft and Google, according to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/perplexity.ai/?utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_source=outreach#traffic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data from Similarweb</a></span>.</p>
    
<p>The debate demonstrates the “uncertain and challenging times” for online content creators in general and journalism in particular because aggregators only work if publications such as Forbes exist, said Stephen Lind, an associate professor at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business.</p><p>Using AI as a synthesizing tool works for widespread dissemination of information until “you <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-training-data-running-out-9676145bac0d30ecce1513c20561b87d">run out of originals</a></span>,” he said.</p><p>“There are whole companies or whole applications that are also doing this, where they are rolling out new services without fully thinking through the implications or best practices or safeguards because they’re rolling out applications for industries that maybe they’re not native to,” he said.</p><p>Lind said it’s good that companies like Perplexity are “taking at least some steps to course correct when an industry or a user pushes back.” But some of the changes should have been baked in from the beginning, he added.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Members of the House Homeland Security Committee pressed Microsoft on Thursday to strengthen how it handles reported security flaws in its products, following a series of cyberattacks that struck the federal government.</li>
<li>The criticism comes after a ProPublica investigation found that Microsoft repeatedly rebuffed a company engineer who warned that a product flaw left millions of users vulnerable to attack, including federal employees.</li>
<li>Microsoft President Brad Smith testified before the committee and acknowledged that the company is shifting its approach to security, aiming to empower every employee to focus on continuous improvement and speak up about security concerns.</li>
<li>Smith emphasized the importance of creating a culture that encourages employees to look for, report, and help fix problems, and to learn from them.</li>
<li>The hearing was a response to the SolarWinds cyberattack, which was attributed to Russian hackers, and the subsequent ProPublica investigation that uncovered Microsoft's handling of the affair.</li>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">Members of Congress pressed Microsoft on Thursday to strengthen how it handles reported security flaws in its ubiquitous products after a series of cyberattacks struck the federal government.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">The criticism from members of the House Homeland Security Committee came in response to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/microsoft-solarwinds-golden-saml-data-breach-russian-hackers">a new ProPublica investigation</a> that found Microsoft repeatedly rebuffed a company engineer who, beginning in 2017, warned that a product flaw left millions of users vulnerable to attack, including federal employees. Russian hackers later exploited that weakness in one of the largest cyberattacks in U.S. history, widely known as SolarWinds.</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0"><a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/T000193-bennie-thompson">Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi</a>, the committee’s top Democrat, entered the news organization’s story into the congressional record. He then asked Microsoft President Brad Smith if the company has since established a process “to ensure that employee concerns about security at Microsoft or their products are prioritized and addressed.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">Smith, sitting alone at the witness table in a packed hearing room, told lawmakers that the company is shifting its approach to security. Microsoft is trying “to empower every employee to focus on continuous improvement and speak up ... and to ensure that those voices are heard and heeded,” he said.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">Smith added, “We want a culture that encourages every employee to look for problems, find problems, report problems, help fix problems and then learn from the problems.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">As ProPublica reported, that is not the corporate culture that the former Microsoft engineer, Andrew Harris, encountered in the years leading up to SolarWinds. Harris said product leaders, who were focused on Microsoft’s drive to dominate the cloud computing market, told him that addressing the weakness he’d identified would undermine the company’s business goals of securing federal government contracts and marginalizing competitors.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">The federal Cyber Safety Review Board, in its own examination of Microsoft’s role in a separate hack perpetrated last year by Chinese attackers, also found the company’s security culture “inadequate” and in need of an “overhaul.” Microsoft “deprioritized both enterprise security investments and rigorous risk management,” the board found, resulting in a “cascade of … avoidable errors.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">On Thursday, Smith said Microsoft accepted responsibility for the board’s findings and has since moved to tie executive bonuses to cybersecurity. He said security would also be part of every Microsoft employee’s performance review, and thus would indirectly impact compensation across the company.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Microsoft’s promise to change its security culture echoes a similar pledge from founder Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. “When we face a choice between adding features and resolving security issues, we need to choose security,” Gates wrote at the time.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">In the decades since, former employees told ProPublica, developing new products and features was often prioritized over fixing security bugs in existing offerings.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">While the official subject of Thursday’s hearing was the cybersafety board’s report on the China hack, members of the committee asked Smith question after question about ProPublica’s SolarWinds investigation, which <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/R000617-delia-ramirez">Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill.</a>, called a “bombshell report.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">She said the hearing was a “reckoning moment” for the company, which has repeatedly downplayed its role in SolarWinds. One of the flaws the Russians exploited involved a Microsoft application, which was supposed to ensure users had permission to log on to cloud-based programs. The weakness allowed intruders to masquerade as legitimate employees and rummage through sensitive data in the cloud, including emails.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0"><a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/M001223-seth-magaziner">Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I.</a>, asked Smith about his prior congressional testimony, in which he said that Microsoft had first learned about this weakness in November 2017, when an outside cybersecurity firm published a report on it. ProPublica’s investigation, Magaziner noted, found that Harris had raised it even earlier, only to be ignored. The lawmaker asked Smith if his prior testimony was incorrect.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">Smith demurred, saying he hadn’t read the story. “I was at the White House this morning,” he told the panel.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">Later, Smith complained that ProPublica’s investigation was published the day of the hearing and said that he’d know more about it “a week from now.” ProPublica sent detailed questions to Microsoft nearly two weeks before the story was published on Thursday and requested an interview with Smith. The company declined to make him available.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">On Thursday, Smith pointed out that the weakness in Microsoft’s product could also be found in other companies’ software. Cybersecurity specialists have noted, however, that Microsoft’s version was one of the most widely used, including by the federal government.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">When Ramirez asked how Harris’ discovery would have been handled differently today, Smith said, “I think what’s most important for today is simply to note how we are changing … how we elevate these issues and reward people for finding, reporting and helping to fix problems.”</p>

<ol>
<li>The "lock-in effect" is easing, with sellers returning to the market but buyers hesitating to make purchases, according to Zillow's chief economist, Skylar Olsen.</li>
<li>In May, new listings rose 8% and 13% from a year earlier, indicating a slight increase in seller activity.</li>

<li>The number of homes for sale increased by 22% from a year earlier, and total inventory is at its smallest deficit in three years, indicating a slight rebound in housing inventory.</li>
<li>Home price appreciation cooled in May, with prices rising 3.9% from a year earlier, compared to 4.4% in April, suggesting that the market may be leveling off after a period of intense competition.</li>

<p>It’s a phenomenon called the <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/02/housing-market-lock-in-effect-3-percent-mortgage-rates-real-estate-home-buyers-sellers/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/03/02/housing-market-lock-in-effect-3-percent-mortgage-rates-real-estate-home-buyers-sellers/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">lock-in effect</a>, and all year it has shown subtle signs of easing. Last year, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/19/housing-market-2023-existing-home-sales-lowest-since-1995/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/01/19/housing-market-2023-existing-home-sales-lowest-since-1995/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">existing home sales</a> fell to their lowest point in almost three decades because nobody was selling or buying homes. But it seems sellers are finally ready; the only thing is, buyers aren’t matching their energy. “Home sellers are returning to the market but finding buyers hesitating,” Zillow’s chief economist Skylar Olsen wrote in a <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/may-2024-market-report-34136/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.zillow.com/research/may-2024-market-report-34136/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">monthly housing report</a> published yesterday. </p>



<p>“Buyers aren’t matching sellers’ uptick in activity,” Olsen reiterated. But how do we know sellers are making a comeback? New listings rose roughly 8% in May and close to 13% from a year earlier. “The effects of ‘rate lock,’ owners holding on to their existing homes and low-rate mortgages, appear to be lessening over time, even as most outstanding mortgages have a rate well below what’s currently being quoted on the market,” she wrote. </p>



<p>Still, there were fewer sales in May than last year; they were down 6%, according to Zillow. Separately, according to a Redfin <a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-market-update-home-prices-record-high-mortgage-rates-decline/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-market-update-home-prices-record-high-mortgage-rates-decline/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">analysis</a> published today, pending home sales are down 3.5% from a year earlier, which is the biggest decline in more than three months, and its homebuyer demand index, which considers requests for tours and other services from Redfin agents, is down 18% (the lowest since February). </p>



<p>Either way, Olsen said, the drop in sales volume helped with a sort of housing restock: The number of homes for sale rose 22% from a year earlier, when it was near an all-time low, and total inventory is at its smallest deficit in three years—which basically means it’s still a ways away from pre-pandemic levels, about 34% less, per Zillow. </p><p></p>



<p>Competition wasn’t as intense last month, so home price appreciation cooled. In April, home values rose 4.4% from a year earlier, but in May, they rose 3.9% (the monthly increase was lower, too). Slower home price appreciation is great for anyone who wants to buy a home, but home prices are still 45% higher than they were before the pandemic. </p>



<p>“Zillow’s Market Heat Index shows the nation is becoming a bit friendlier for buyers and is headed toward ‘neutral’ territory, but sellers still hold a slight advantage,” Olsen wrote. “Buffalo, Hartford, and San Jose are the top markets for sellers among the 50 largest metro areas. New Orleans, Miami, Jacksonville, and Memphis are all tilted toward buyers, giving those in the market better leverage in negotiations.” And nationally, almost a quarter of homes for sale slashed prices, which is the greatest share in the past six years.</p>



<p>All in all, it’s a much different, more costly landscape for people who want to buy homes. On a monthly basis, home prices are up in all 50 major metropolitan areas, and on an annual basis, they’re up in 46 metros, per Zillow. We already know home prices are considerably higher since the start of the pandemic; monthly mortgage payments are, too. The typical monthly mortgage payment is 11.3% higher than last year, and ready for this—115.3% since before the pandemic. So not only is the housing world more costly than last year, it’s a completely different entity from four years ago. It’s not hard to imagine why buyers are backing off.</p>



<p>Mortgage rates have come down a bit; <a href="https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/mortgage-rates/mnd" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/mortgage-rates/mnd" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">daily rates</a> are at 6.97% (their lowest in three months on the back of yesterday’s <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/12/inflation-report-cpi-unequivocally-good-federal-reserve-interest-rate-cuts-soon/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/12/inflation-report-cpi-unequivocally-good-federal-reserve-interest-rate-cuts-soon/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">consumer price index report</a>), and <a href="https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">weekly rates</a> are at 6.95%. Home price appreciation has slowed as well, according to Zillow. So maybe things will start to look up for would-be buyers? </p>



<p>“The latest inflation report is good for homebuyers because it has already sent mortgage rates down, though this week’s Fed meeting will temper mortgage-rate declines,” Redfin’s economic research lead Chen Zhao said in the analysis. “But on the other side of the coin, if lower mortgage rates bring back more demand than supply, that could erase the possibility that home-price growth softens, and push prices up even further. Lower rates and higher prices may ultimately cancel each other out when it comes to homebuyers’ monthly payments.”</p><p></p>



<p>Still, if anything, the housing world is moving toward a balance of sorts, Zillow’s Olsen wrote.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>
