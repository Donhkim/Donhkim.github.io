<li><strong>US regulators are investigating</strong> a Boeing 737 Max 8 flight by Southwest Airlines where the plane rocked side to side while in air, a potentially dangerous movement known as a Dutch roll.</li>
<li><strong>Boeing faces two new inquiries</strong> involving potentially falsified documents used to certify titanium in its planes, and a separate issue with tainted titanium parts.</li>
<li><strong>Tainted titanium parts</strong> were used in Boeing planes, with over 1,000 tests completed to identify suspect parts, which have been removed from production.</li>
<li><strong>Boeing and regulators are investigating</strong> the scope of the issue, with Boeing stating that tests show the correct alloy was used, despite false documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Regulators are taking action</strong> to address the issue, with the FAA issuing a bulletin to suppliers to be on the alert for counterfeit records, and Canadian transportation safety officials pledging to take action if necessary.</li>

Our analysis shows the in-service fleet can continue to fly safely,”  the company said. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The New York Times, which first reported the issue, said a supplier to Spirit AeroSystems, which makes parts for Boeing and European plane-maker Airbus, started looking into the issue after noticing holes from corrosion. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Spirit, which had alerted the two manufacturers to the problem earlier this year, said more than 1,000  tests had been completed on the suspect parts, which had been removed from production.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"It is the documents that were counterfeit, not the titanium," spokesman Joe Buccino said.

<p>The notion was hardly far-fetched. Over the course of two weeks, Gill had been posting images of a massive stake in GameStop and its call options in a portfolio that peaked at more than $550 million on June 6. Though he’s added even more stock since then, the dollar value of his holdings has dropped along with the company’s shares.</p>



<p>With the stock little changed since the early days of its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-13/gamestop-surges-as-roaring-kitty-return-adds-fuel-to-rally" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-13/gamestop-surges-as-roaring-kitty-return-adds-fuel-to-rally" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">latest mania</a>, a new kind of anxiety is building among Wall Street and retail traders alike.</p>



<p>The original 2021 GameStop rally shook the idea of short-selling to its core — eroding the appeal of betting against a floundering company when you can wind up feeling the wrath of Redditors. This time around, the existential question is about what counts as market manipulation. </p>



<p>Does posting a <a href="https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1789807772542067105" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1789807772542067105" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">meme</a>, potentially delivering an instant profit, violate the spirit of free and fair markets? Has the David versus Goliath nature of meme stocks shifted? What if Roaring Kitty <em>is </em>the Goliath? And how exactly did he build a position bigger than <a href="https://fortune.com/company/charles-schwab/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/charles-schwab/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Charles Schwab</a> Corp.’s?</p><p></p>



<p>“The original meme stock craze was us versus them, with ‘them’ being the guys who would short-sell millennials’ favorite companies like GameStop,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “But I’m not sure who ‘them’ is anymore.” </p>



<p>Gill didn’t reply to a request for comment. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Losing Charm</h3>



<p>The populist ringleader of a short squeeze that shook Wall Street in the original 2021 meme-stock rally, Gill is losing his folksy charm, at least for some followers. Trading firms and even some former fans are eying Gill with more suspicion, as Redditors pose questions like: “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1crttc4/how_is_roaring_kitty_coming_back_not_a_basic_pump/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1crttc4/how_is_roaring_kitty_coming_back_not_a_basic_pump/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">How is Roaring Kitty coming back not a basic pump and dump scheme</a>?”</p>



<p>By Thursday, Gill’s brokerage account snapshots suggested he’d unwound an earlier position of 120,000 call options and added more GameStop, upping his portfolio to about 9 million shares of the video game retailer, worth more than $262 million. (Gill’s final post of 2021 showed he had 200,000 shares worth more than $30 million; GameStop did a four-for-one stock split in July 2022.)</p>



<p>As Gill’s actions sent the price soaring again, GameStop seized on the volatility to sell more than $2 billion worth of stock. </p><p></p>



<p>All told, anyone who bought shares over the past month and held was about as likely to lose money as profit. To some, one major difference is hedge funds and other sophisticated investors have adapted from three years ago and are likely to come out ahead — at the expense of Gill’s retail-trading fans. </p>



<p>“Some of the quantitative managers have models to look at the trends in price and those models are extremely quick to get out of the stock if they see significant downside volatility,” said Don Steinbrugge, chief executive officer of Agecroft Partners, which helps hedge funds raise money. “At some point retail investors are going to wise up and realize there’s a lot of danger.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Manipulation Concerns</h3>



<p>The episode brought to the fore questions of what constitutes market manipulation. The Wall Street Journal reported Morgan Stanley-owned brokerage E*Trade was considering barring Gill from its platform over such concerns, after previously banning other popular personalities like Dave Portnoy, the Barstool Sports founder who streams as Davey Day Trader and said he got kicked off of the brokerage.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>A spokesman for E*Trade declined to comment.</p>



<p>What’s singular about Gill’s case is that market manipulation typically involves pushing a price higher to profit off the stock movement, said Craig Marcus, a partner and co-chair of the capital markets group at law firm Ropes &amp; Gray. If Gill’s snapshots are real, that hasn’t obviously been the case, he said. </p><p></p>



<p>“You can disagree with his thesis about the value of the stock, but if all he’s doing is executing on his thesis and not doing manipulative things to profit,” it’s difficult to prove ill intent, Marcus said in an interview.</p>



<p>To be sure, Gill was accused of using his clout to manipulate prices even three years ago when he first arrived on the public stage. In 2021, a lawsuit against Gill and MassMutual alleged he was manipulating markets with his outsize influence on certain stocks. </p>

<p>“Three years ago this was funny,” said Peter Atwater, an adjunct professor of economics at William &amp; Mary. “People have become more bothered by this than amused by it, and that to me is an indication that it is unlikely that this behavior will be allowed to continue.”</p>



<p>When Gill scheduled a highly anticipated return to <a href="https://fortune.com/company/youtube/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/youtube/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">YouTube</a> on June 6 without details of what he’d talk about, the stock shot up nearly 50%, adding $16 billion to its market value in a matter of hours. </p><p></p>



<p>In the livestream, which garnered hundreds of thousands of viewers, Gill vamped for about an hour against the backdrop of GameStop’s violently fluctuating share price. He seemed to sense the possibility he’d draw more scrutiny from fans, regulators and trading professionals. </p>



<p>“Do I have to be careful what I say here?” he asked.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Home prices in the US have increased significantly, with the median sales price of houses sold in the country being $420,800, and prices are 45% higher since the pandemic.</li>
<li>The cost of owning a home has also risen, with the typical monthly mortgage payment being 115% higher since the pandemic, making it difficult for many to afford.</li>
<li>The number of affordable homes has decreased dramatically, with a Realtor.com report finding that the number of homes under $200,000 has fallen from around half of all sales to less than a quarter of sales in 2023.</li>
<li>The pandemic has been a major factor in the housing market boom, causing a shortage of homes and driving up prices. Additionally, building costs, land availability, and regulation have also hindered the construction of affordable homes.</li>
<li>Despite predictions that renting may become cheaper than buying, renting is still a costly option, with rent prices not decreasing significantly despite the increase in housing prices.</li>

<p>“We’re creating, inadvertently, a renter society not because of choice but because of force,” Wolf said. Rent isn’t cheap either, even though some predict <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/03/26/renting-cheaper-than-buying-home-prices-all-time-highs/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/03/26/renting-cheaper-than-buying-home-prices-all-time-highs/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">renting will be cheaper than buying</a> for years. Even so, in Wolf’s mind, $300,000 homes should have been attainable. But everything from the cost of building materials to land availability to the lack of housing to regulation made it so much harder to build affordable homes—and a lot of it stemmed from the pandemic-fueled housing boom.</p>



<p>A Realtor.com <a href="https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/cities-with-the-most-homes-under-200000/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/cities-with-the-most-homes-under-200000/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">report</a> released Thursday seemed to confirm the fall-off in the number of affordable homes. “Over the past several years, the number of homes under $200,000 has gone from around half of all sales to less than a quarter of sales in 2023,” it said, calling the statistic, “stark proof of shrinking affordability across the country.” </p>



<p>Affordability is shot, that’s no secret; this is just one more indicator of that trend. Home prices skyrocketed during the pandemic: They’re 45% higher now than they were before, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/lock-in-effect-mortgage-rates-home-prices-housing-market-zillow-redfin/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/lock-in-effect-mortgage-rates-home-prices-housing-market-zillow-redfin/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">according to</a> <a href="https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Zillow</a>, and the typical monthly mortgage payment is 115% higher since that time. And, since there’s not enough homes to go around, prices haven’t really fallen. (There are <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/12/housing-market-outlook-hot-metros-pandemic-crashing-cooling-demand/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/12/housing-market-outlook-hot-metros-pandemic-crashing-cooling-demand/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">some metropolitan areas</a> where home prices have declined from a year earlier, but it’s less than a handful—nationally, home prices hit their <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/housing-market-outlook-home-prices-all-time-high-case-shiller/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/housing-market-outlook-home-prices-all-time-high-case-shiller/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">ninth all-time high</a> in the past year). In any case, the median sales price of houses sold in the country is $420,800, and the average weekly 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.95%. </p>



<p><strong>‘Where all the $200k homes are hiding’ </strong></p><p></p>



<p>There are some signs that home-price appreciation is slowing, and mortgage rates are coming down, but it might not feel fast enough for anyone who wants to buy a home. Still, Realtor.com analyzed listing data from the first week of this month and compiled a list of what it called “affordability havens…where all the $200k homes are hiding.” Let me tell you, not a single one is in sunny California—or even Texas, its cheaper, and sometimes more popular, counterpart. </p>

<p>Here’s the thing, though: These starter homes might not be $200,000 forever. “These are still some of the most affordable places in the country, but they’ve seen a lot of price growth over the last year or so,” Hannah Jones, a Realtor.com senior economic analyst, said in the report. </p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

                                        <p>Even though the median U.S. CEO pay package last year was nearly 200 times more than a worker in the middle of their company pay scales, Elon Musk’s record-setting Tesla compensation dwarfs them by comparison.</p><p>Tesla shareholders on Thursday voted overwhelmingly in favor of restoring Musk’s 10-year pay plan, valued by the company in April at $44.9 billion. It was worth more early in the year, but Tesla’s stock value has fallen about 25% since then.</p><p>The all-stock package, approved by the board and shareholders in 2018, rewards Musk for hitting milestones that include raising Tesla’s market value, pretax income and revenue.</p><p>It had been tossed out by a Delaware judge in January who said the process for approving it was “deeply flawed.” The court ruled that Musk controlled the company’s board, and shareholders weren’t fully informed.</p>



<p>But the company said Musk deserves the pay because he turned Tesla into the top-selling electric vehicle maker in the world, increasing its market value by billions. </p>
    

<p>Even with the reapproval vote, Musk won’t get access to the stock options just yet. Tesla is expected to ask the judge to revisit her decision in light of the vote, and if she doesn’t, the company probably will appeal the ruling to Delaware’s Supreme Court. The whole process could take months.</p><p>No matter the outcome, Musk’s package — the largest award to a CEO of a U.S. public company — is far above what’s been granted to other chief executives. Here’s how the package compares:</p><h2>WITH THE MEDIAN CEO PAY</h2>
    
<p>The median pay package for an S&amp;P 500 <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ceo-pay-compensation-ratio-workers-fa25db3338b68ad9eb395dfd46190383">U.S. CEO last year was $16.3 million,</a></span> according to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.equilar.com/reports/110-equilar-associated-press-ceo-pay-study-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data analyzed for The Associated Press by Equilar</a></span>. If you multiply that by 10 to get $163 million for a decade of work, Musk’s earnings still would be 275 times greater.</p><p>In her January ruling that struck down the package, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick wrote that Musk’s package, then worth about $56 billion, was 250 times larger than the median peer CEO’s pay plan. </p>
    

<h2>WITH INDIVIDUAL CEOS</h2><p>The top earner in the AP’s survey was Hock Tan, CEO of artificial intelligence company Broadcom Inc. His package, mostly consisting of stock awards, was valued at about $162 million, when given to Tan at the start of fiscal 2023. Thanks to a surging stock price, Broadcom in March valued Tan’s pay package, plus older options he hadn’t yet cashed in, at $767.7 million. That’s an amount easily eclipsed by Musk’s potential haul of 304 million shares worth almost $45 billion. </p><p>Other CEOs at the top of AP’s survey are William Lansing of Fair Isaac Corp, ($66.3 million); Tim Cook of Apple Inc. ($63.2 million); Hamid Moghadam of Prologis Inc. ($50.9 million); and Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix ($49.8 million). </p><p>Technically, Musk got no compensation last year because he didn’t get any stock options. But he stands to get even richer if his pay package goes through.</p><h2>WITH TESLA WORKERS</h2><p>It’s difficult to calculate what Musk’s annual pay would have been last year. The company says he got nothing. But if his compensation package makes it through the courts, his pay will be in the billions. According to the company’s proxy filing this year, the median annual pay of a non-CEO Tesla employee last year was $45,811.</p>

<p>Stem cells have long fascinated researchers because of their ability to reproduce and, in some cases, transform into other cell types. Because of this, they are thought to hold the potential for treating many diseases and injuries. </p>
    
<p>But the FDA has approved only a handful of such therapies, and only for certain forms of blood cancer and immune system disorders. Stem cells are considered experimental for most uses, despite being marketed as a treatment for everything from autism and emphysema to sports injuries.</p><p>The FDA has repeatedly <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/consumers-biologics/consumer-alert-regenerative-medicine-products-including-stem-cells-and-exosomes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a></span> Americans to be wary of businesses hawking unapproved, unproven and costly stem cell therapies, which occasionally have caused <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1609583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blindness</a></span>, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/29e1c0a2c3134bbb927285319ba5a17d">bacterial infections</a></span> and tumors.</p>
    

<p>In a 2020 notice, the agency expressed concern about patients being misled about products that are “illegally marketed, have not been shown to be safe or effective, and, in some cases, may have significant safety issues.”</p><p>Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg, chair of ophthalmology at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University, whose work has <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1609583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented</a></span> vision loss in some patients treated with cells removed from patients’ own bodies, processed and reinjected, lamented that people are “desperately willing to shell out large sums of money for unproven and in some cases, explicitly sort of sham, so-called therapeutics.” </p><p>Since August <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/us-health-agency-to-crack-down-on-risky-stem-cell-offerings-b4904665014743ccbfd9fd9542b48f4b">2017</a></span>, the FDA has issued about 30 warning letters regarding the unproven treatments. </p><p>Experts, including Dr. Paul Knoepfler, a stem cell researcher at the University of California at Davis, and Leigh Turner, a bioethicist at the University of California, Irvine, are among those who have raised alarm that such federal action is too little to regulate a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-science-health-california-106808694cb797a59db366df54e85692">U.S. industry</a></span> which Turner estimated in 2021 topped <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/pdf/S1934-5909(21)00420-3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2,700 clinics</a></span>.</p>
    

<p>Because states can seek substantial fines against wayward operators, Turner said their legal actions offer promise.</p><p>“If you look at them collectively, they might over time start to have an impact,” he said.</p><p>The FDA offers training to attorneys general pursuing such cases. Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said federal regulators partner with state law enforcers in a “shared mission.” </p><p>That puts people like Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird on the front lines.</p><p>Last year, Bird brought the case over mailers offering Iowans a pain-free life, naming the now dissolved Biologics Health and Summit Partners Group, which operated under the name Summit Health Centers, as defendants. The state also sued the companies’ proprietors: Rylee Meek, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, and Scott Thomas, of Thonotosassa, Florida. </p><p>Neither man claims to have any medical training. Yet over a series of free dinners across Iowa, attendees listened to their presentations about how stem cells could ostensibly repair damage linked to back or joint pain. The claims came despite an <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/consumers-biologics/consumer-alert-regenerative-medicine-products-including-stem-cells-and-exosomes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FDA warning</a></span> that no such product has been approved to treat any orthopedic condition.</p>
    

<p>One testimonial featured a woman quoted as saying she had multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, degenerative joint problems and scoliosis. It implied the treatment worked so well she was able to stop using a walker and taking opioids. Prosecutors say that left people believing stem cells are effective at treating all the conditions listed. </p><p>The company offered packages ranging from 5 million cells to up to 60 million to fix customers’ ailments. Iowa’s lawsuit described the practices as “scattershot, for-profit experimentations.” </p><p>Research has shown dead cells are often injected, Knoepfler said.</p><p>The Iowa case is still in the discovery stage, with the trial set for March 2025.</p>
    

<p>Meek and Thomas did not return multiple text and email messages from The Associated Press. Nor did their attorney, Nathan Russell, though he did rebut many of the allegations in court filings, including that the promotional information was “deceptive or misleading.” The filing stressed that Meek and Thomas always emphasized they were not doctors. </p><p>Instead, Meek promoted himself as the “$100 million man” and touted his business prowess on his King’s Council podcast. His and Thomas’ book, “Intentional Influence in Sales: The Power of Persuasion with Neuro-linguistic Programming,” is described as a way to “get people to think the way you want them to think, without them even realizing it.” </p><p>Meek previously reached a settlement with the North Dakota attorney general to resolve allegations that a business he ran sold insulation and energy conservation products without a proper license.</p><p>As for the stem cell business, Bird argued in the Iowa lawsuit that the companies downplayed safety concerns.</p><p>Sales material described the most worrisome side effects as “flulike symptoms” in a “very small percentage of patients.” It’s an assertion that Meek’s and Thomas’ attorney argued lacked context.</p><p>Complaints, which the businessmen described as “rare,” trickled in, including from a man whose hip pain hadn’t improved after undergoing a $5,845 treatment. His wife paid $2,650 for hers. Another person said she had “no improvement whatsoever” after spending $16,580 to help her sciatic nerve pain and arthritis.</p><p>A nurse practitioner responded by telling such patients healing could take longer and they should drink more water, the lawsuit said.</p><p>“The problem,” Knoepfler said, “is that people actually get hurt and they get ripped off.”</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cocoa prices have tripled</strong>: The price of cocoa has increased by more than 300% over the past year, causing a significant headache for food companies that use the ingredient to make chocolate.</li>
<li><strong>Weak crop expectations</strong>: The price surge is attributed to reports of a weaker-than-expected cocoa crop, which has sparked concerns about supply and driven up prices.</li>
<li><strong>Largest candy companies protected</strong>: Major candy companies like Hershey, Mars, Ferrero, and Mondelez are likely protected from higher cocoa costs due to long-term contracts that lock in prices, giving them time to adjust to the new prices.</li>
<li><strong>Future price increase expected</strong>: However, these companies will eventually pay more for cocoa when their long-term contracts expire in 2025, likely leading to increased costs and impacting their business decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Significant cost impact</strong>: The sharp increase in cocoa prices is having a significant impact on the businesses of candy companies, forcing them to reassess their operations and strategies to mitigate the effects of the higher costs.</li>

But reports of a weaker-than-expected crop set off concerns about supply, sparking the commodity’s run-up in recent months. Cocoa hit an all-time high of more than $11,000 per metric ton in April.

Prices could come down in September, once more information about the new crop is available — but that doesn’t mean that they’ll return to normal.</p><p>The commodity’s climbing cost comes at a tough time for many food companies. Over the last two years, many have raised prices to deal with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/10000793">inflation</a> that touched on a broader array of commodities. As a result, shoppers have become choosier about what they buy and more dissatisfied with the prices they see at grocery stores.

Companies will cut a product’s quantity or weight while the price stays the same.  But consumers have gotten wise to the trick.

The company owns brands including Dippin’ Dots, SuperPretzel and Hola Churros and manufactures products for other companies, such as Subway’s footlong churro. Chocolate is a common flavor in its portfolio, which includes treats such as a chocolate-filled churro.</p><p>“It won’t stop us from using chocolate, but it will cause us to think about and say, ‘Now, if we do this innovation with that new pricing, is it sellable?’ And then when we sell it, ‘Is it at a low enough cost that customer could sell it and still make a good margin?’” Fachner told CNBC in May.</p><p>One hypothetical solution, proposed by Fachner, could involve cutting back the number of chocolate chips from 12 to nine in a certain product. He also said J&amp;J is looking for any possible substitutes that could work for some of its recipes.</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107391780" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">Chocolates are displayed on a shelf at Celine’s Sweets in Novato, California, March 22, 2024.</p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Justin Sullivan | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi cited Hershey’s new Jumbo Reese’s Cup as one creative workaround.</p><p>“This one has extra peanut butter, so it’s a nice way of trying to get innovation into the market at a premium price, let the consumer feel like they’re getting value, but just changing the product itself to lower the reliance on chocolate,” he said.</p><p>For food companies that don’t primarily deal in chocolate, they might start avoiding the flavor, especially when it comes to new products.</p><p>“I think more or less, people will try to stay away from chocolate at this point,” Modi said.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline2"></a>The long tail of the cocoa crisis</h2><div class="group"><p>While this year’s spike in cocoa prices has been historic, it likely won’t be the last time food companies find themselves paying more for the commodity. Analysts are already predicting another cocoa shortfall next year, although it would likely be less dramatic than this season’s.</p><p>However, systemic issues, such as government-controlled farmgate pricing, and climate change will likely keep hurting the beans’ crop. Plus, the use of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/mars-accused-of-using-child-labor-in-cocoa-supply-chain.html">child labor and slavery</a> in West African cocoa farms has led to lawsuits and scandal for candy companies.</p><p>In the long term, that means many companies will have to look for more permanent solutions. In some cases, that may mean alternatives to cocoa.</p><p>“There are examples where companies are increasing the amount of non-cocoa additives, like sugar, more economical things like cocoa butter equivalents, shea butter, palm oil, coconut oil, those types of things,” Rosenstock said.</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107410387" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"></p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Justin Sullivan | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>Recipe reformulation takes about nine months on average, according to a research note published Thursday from Bank of America Securities analyst Antoine Prevot. He said he thinks fast-moving consumer goods companies have been looking at changing their formulas since the beginning of this year, which means the new candy could start trickling out as soon as August.</p><p>There are more extreme substitutes, too. Startups such as Voyage Foods and Win-Win have made cocoa-free chocolate using alternatives such as grape seeds and legumes.</p><p>At least one candy company isn’t planning any major changes to its formulas.</p><p>“We will do some cost tightening, but we’re not going to change recipes or do things that are not necessarily the right thing for the business in the long run,” Mondelez CFO Luca Zaramella said June 4 at a Deutsche Bank conference.</p><p>There’s also the potential for diversification with other kinds of snacks. When Kraft spun out Mondelez more than a decade ago, it already had Triscuit, Sour Patch Kids and Wheat Thins snacks in its portfolio, in addition to chocolate products Milka, Oreo, Toblerone and Chips Ahoy.</p><p>Other candy companies have followed its lead, adding more salty snacks to their lineups to drive more growth. For example, Hershey bought Amplify Snack Brands in 2017, adding SkinnyPop to its portfolio, and Dot’s Homestyle Pretzels in 2021.</p><p>“I don’t think they did it to be less dependent on cocoa — they did it to more easily react to the ups and downs of consumer trends and to be able to really diversify their portfolio,” Rosenstock said. “But the ability to lean on some of the non-chocolate categories, whether it’s salty snacks, jelly beans or gummy products, I think that’s a good way to combat the cocoa crisis.”</p></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

Individual officials’ views on the best path forward for borrowing costs differed. The Fed’s “dot plot” showed four policymakers saw no cuts this year, while seven anticipated just one reduction and eight expected two cuts.</p><p>A key measure of underlying inflation stepped down for a second month in May, a pleasant surprise for Fed officials looking for signs that they can start to lower interest rates. The figures, taken with the deceleration in the core CPI in April, may represent the early stages of inflation resuming a downward trend. The release landed the morning of the Fed’s decision.</p><p>Issuance of catastrophe bonds just hit a record high, as the market braces for a rough hurricane season with the potential to do substantial damage. Sales of so-called cat bonds are 38% higher this year through May than over the same five-month period in 2023, which was already a record, according to Artemis, a compiler of data on insurance-linked securities.</p><p>Asia</p><p>The Bank of Japan’s decision Friday to stand pat on interest rates was widely expected, but traders were surprised by it just flagging a cut in debt purchases without laying out any figures or a timeline. Given that more than half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected the central bank to begin cutting its purchases in June, the announcement was viewed by many analysts and investors as a delay in the normalization of policy that’s vital to the recovery of the currency.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="32" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>South Korea’s labor market showed signs of cooling in May as employment growth slowed to its slowest pace in more than three years, a weak outcome that may support the case for authorities to consider adjusting policy.</p><p>Europe</p><p>The euro slid to its lowest in a month against the dollar after French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz were trounced by far-right parties. The concern is that the outcome of the elections has also darkened the longer-term outlook for the world’s second-most traded currency, as it throws into question the prospects for greater integration and a united Europe.</p><p>Britain’s economic recovery ground to a halt in the run-up to the general election, a setback for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who has campaigned on evidence the economy is turning the corner.</p><p>Euro-zone industrial production unexpectedly fell at the start of the second quarter, casting a shadow over the economy’s pickup this year from its poor performance in 2023. The outcome leaves the euro-zone economy leaning more heavily on services to continue its recovery after a growth spurt in the first quarter.</p><p>Emerging Markets</p><p>Israel’s worst armed conflict in half a century has set off an inflationary chain reaction that’s finally coming into view. “Help, We Are Out of Air, We Are Collapsing,” blared a headline on the popular news website Walla in June — an appeal for help against inflation as the public outcry grows.</p><p>World</p><p>The German government is working to prevent the European Union’s new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles from coming into force — or at least soften them should a full halt not be possible, according to people familiar with the matter. Brussels decided to impose additional tariffs on electric cars shipped from China as certain automakers were accused of distorting the market through state subsidies and violating WTO rules.</p><p>After the 2011 Fukushima disaster, nuclear energy was once again too scary, and uranium, the delicate and deadly fuel that powers the reactors, became a sleepy backwater in the global commodities market. But as climate change intensified and governments across the world were drawn anew to the steady carbon-free power generated by nuclear plants, interest in uranium deposits picked up — slowly at first and then, after Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, at a frantic pace.</p><p>Outside the Fed and BOJ, Thailand, Peru, Taiwan and Uzbekistan also held interest rates steady. Ukraine’s central bank delivered a third straight cut to borrowing costs as policymakers weigh the economic impact of Russian attacks on the nation’s energy sector. Pakistan, Serbia and Botswana also lowered rates.</p><p>--With assistance from Galit Altstein, Irina Anghel, Arne Delfs, Toru Fujioka, Sumio Ito, Vassilis Karamanis, Sam Kim, Kamil Kowalcze, Jacob Lorinc, Jonnelle Marte, Geoffrey Morgan, Gautam Naik, Tom Rees, Augusta Saraiva, Zoe Schneeweiss, Craig Stirling and Naomi Tajitsu.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

<p>Just days after the EU Commission determined EVs imported from <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/china/">China</a> have an unfair advantage due to government subsidies and responding with higher tariffs, Germany, one of the region’s largest automotive markets, has spoken against the decision, stating the imposed tariffs could hurt the success of local automakers selling vehicles in China.</p>



<span id="more-367642"></span>



<p>It has been a long saga leading up to this week’s decision by the EU Commission that Chinese EVs have an unfair advantage in European markets following a probe that began last fall. While the probe was taking place behind closed doors, the EU was already <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/31/eu-delays-decision-on-chinese-ev-tariffs-european-parliament-elections/">threatening tariffs on Chinese imports</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the US didn’t need a probe (or many Chinese EV imports, for that matter) to impose its own steep tariffs. In retaliation, China threatened <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/24/china-threatens-tariffs-up-to-25-imports-retaliation-eu-probe-us-tariffs/">tariffs of up to 25%</a> on European-built models like those from Germany, for example, imploring the EU to play fair and not follow the US’ decision.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for China, the EU Commission confirmed the results of its probe, hailing EV imports as unfair due to local subsidies. As a result, it announced <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/06/12/how-new-eu-tariffs-impact-chinese-ev-makers-byd-nio/">plans to slap massive tariffs of up to 48%</a> on those incoming models that are just starting to hit their stride in new markets overseas.</p>



<p>Days later, Germany spoke out against the EU’s decision on tariffs, expressing hope there is still time to reach an agreement to avoid them. Or, at the very least, soften those percentages.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-germany-argues-chinese-tariffs-hurt-eu-automakers-too">Germany argues Chinese tariffs hurt EU automakers too</h2>



<p>Following the EU Commission’s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese EVs next month, the government of Germany is stepping up to try to mediate tensions and, ideally, stop the upcharges altogether.</p>



<p>Per <em>Automotive News Europe</em>, a spokesperson with ties to Berlin officials who requested anonymity said the group remains optimistic <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/germany-works-block-eu-tariffs-chinese-evs">the EU can resolve the issue</a> through direct talks with China. With allies overseas, Germany believes there’s still room (and time) to reverse or soften the tariffs, but both sides must compromise.</p>



<p>Germany’s strongest argument is that retaliatory tariffs against China may also hurt local OEMs, including Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group, and BMW – all of which rely heavily on sales in Asia, particularly China.</p>



<p>Mercedes-Benz is an especially popular automaker in China, and its G- and S-Class vehicles, in particular, have done well with those consumers. As the German automaker goes electric, Mercedes has seen EV growing sales in China and intends to bring <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/23/mercedes-unveils-2025-electric-g-class-with-4-motors-and-tank-turns/">its new all-electric G-Class</a> overseas this year. Germany argues the EU’s tariffs could throw a wrench in those plans as its local OEMs could face the eye-for-eye wrath from the Chinese government.</p>



<p>Germany’s Economy Minister Robert Habeck said there’s still time to stop this looming tariff escalation and will travel to China next week to discuss the issue with government officials.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>JNUG and JDST ETFs move in opposite directions</strong>: The Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 2X Shares (JNUG) lost over 4% in value, while the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bear 2X Shares (JDST) rose nearly 4%.</li>
<li><strong>Underlying gold market rebounds</strong>: The gold market has rebounded sharply since late February, driven by inflationary concerns and speculation about the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates.</li>
<li><strong>Fed interest rate cuts and inflation</strong>: Speculation about a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve drove gold prices higher in May, but the strong labor report in June may have reduced the likelihood of a rate cut, presenting a mixed signal on inflation and interest rates.</li>
<li><strong>JNUG faces momentum loss</strong>: The JNUG ETF, which tracks the junior gold miners index, has been experiencing momentum loss since May, falling below its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) and posting a few losses.</li>
<li><strong>Influence of consumer behavior</strong>: The article also mentions the influence of consumer behavior, such as the example of Costco selling millions of dollars' worth of gold bars to its customers, showing that consumers are becoming more interested in investing in gold as a hedge against inflation.</li>

The former leveraged exchange-traded fund lost more than 4% during Thursday's afternoon session while the latter moved up nearly 4%. The underlying gold market rebounded sharply since late February of this year, mainly due to inflationary concerns. Indeed, last year, retail giant </p><strong>Costco</strong> <span class="ticker" data-ticker="COST" data-exchange="NASDAQ">COST</span><p> reported that it</p><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/12/36289207/costco-sold-millions-of-dollars-worth-of-gold-to-customers-was-it-bad-for-business"> sold millions of dollars' worth of gold bars</a><p> to its members. Costco began selling one-ounce bullion bars in September Fundamentally, one of the biggest catalysts for the precious metals ecosystem is the Federal Reserve. Prior to the disclosure of the May jobs report on Jun. 7, gold prices soared amid</p><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/24/06/39207128/gold-prices-reach-2368-usd-amid-speculation-of-fed-rate-cuts"> speculation that the central bank would cut the benchmark interest rate</a><p>.

This dynamic presents a mixed signal. On one hand, it means more dollars may chase after fewer goods, which would be inflationary. But on the other hand, the strong labor print implies that the Fed may put off rate cuts until much later While JNUG has been a strong performer since late February, the ETF started to encounter momentum loss after the May 21 session. After falling below its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), the fund managed to pop higher on Jun. 6.

		    <h2><strong><span>When stuff gets inflated like this, no one should be surprised when it gets deflated.</span></strong></h2>

<p>Sure, France is dealing with a complicated political situation, including snap elections, that might alter the political landscape. That’s what elections are for.</p>
<p>But why did French stocks spike 20.7% in the 7 months of Rate Cut Mania? What kind of crazy show was this? And not just in France.</p>
<p>The French blue-chip stock index, the CAC 40, dropped by 2.7% today, and by 4.6% over the past two days. Over the past six trading days, the index lost 6.7%, and it’s down a whopping stunning mindboggling 8.9% from its all-time high on May 15.</p>
<p>I mean, how can stocks be allowed to drop???</p>
<p>And so a lot of headlines cropped up today. The Guardian: “French stock market plummets amid fears of far right election win.” The FT: “French stocks suffer worst week since 2022 over fears of populist win.” Bloomberg today: “French Stocks See $200 Billion Wipeout…”</p>
<p>You get the idea: In France, stocks are sinking though everyone knew that during inflationary times, stocks can never sink, and that they’re the best hedge against inflation or whatever, and that rates are going to get cut, and already got cut by the ECB on June 6, and that therefore stocks would just keep on booming because of rate cuts, inflation, and all.</p>
<p>So now that theory has been obviated by events, shock is spreading through the media that had hyped this stuff all along?</p>
<p>But wait a minute. The CAC 40 had spiked by 20.7% (1,415 points) in less than seven months, from the end of October to its all-time high on May 15 of 8,240, a result of this epic Rate-Cut Mania that had gripped Europe as well. So now, the ECB has cut once, and stocks are sagging.</p>
<p>But wait another minute. The “plunge” of French stocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Barely wiped out the gains this year! The CAC down just 0.5% year-to-date.</li>
<li>Wiped out only half (737 points) of the seven-month Rate-Cut Mania spike (1,415 points), instead of all of it plus some.</li>
<li>Took the index only back to where it had first been in April 2023, instead of carving out multi-year lows.</li>
</ul>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-96333" src="https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Global-stocks-France-CAC40-2024-06-14_.png" alt="" srcset="https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Global-stocks-France-CAC40-2024-06-14_.png 982w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Global-stocks-France-CAC40-2024-06-14_-560x416.png 560w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Global-stocks-France-CAC40-2024-06-14_-768x570.png 768w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Global-stocks-France-CAC40-2024-06-14_-260x193.png 260w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Global-stocks-France-CAC40-2024-06-14_-160x119.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px"></p>
<p>In other words, that’s not even a real sell-off just yet, just an 8.9% dip from the all-time high. It just seems like a big deal because during Rate-Cut Mania, and even before, the brains of investors and the media got fried by the illusion that stocks can never drop.</p>
<p>And now that French stocks dropped 8.9% from their all-time high of Rate-Cut Mania, it’s a scary thing that reality is allowed to seep through the veneer? ECB, please do something about this fiasco?</p>
<p>Stock markets in general – especially in the US – have gone completely nuts in recent years, and then spectacularly nuts during Rate-Cut Mania, and the media hyped it and promoted it, and now that there’s this little unwind of a spike, the handwringing starts? I mean, come on. When stuff gets inflated like this, no one should be surprised that it gets deflated.</p>

    <div><div id="body">
<p><span class="label">Feature</span> Microsoft president Brad Smith struck a conciliatory tone regarding his IT giant's repeated computer security failings during a congressional hearing on Thursday – while also claiming the Windows maker is above the rule of law, at least in China.</p>
<p>He answered nearly three hours of questions from US House reps about Microsoft's infosec shortcomings. Now it's time for the White House and Congress to do their job and ensure we don't learn about yet another Redmond blunder exploited by a foreign government six months from now.</p>
<p>And the US government has several tools at its disposal, from executive orders to federal spending, to avoid another Microsoft-connected security breach.</p>

    

<p>Smith kicked off his testimony before Congress this week by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/14/brad_smith_microsoft_hearing/">accepting</a> "responsibility for each and every one of the issues" cited in a recent Homeland Security report that blasted Microsoft for a series of "avoidable errors." These errors, the investigation found, allowed Beijing-backed cyberspies to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/28/chinese_hackers_stole_60000_state/">steal</a> tens of thousands of sensitive emails from the Microsoft-hosted Exchange Online inboxes of high-ranking US government officials.</p>

        


        

<p>That theft was enabled by China <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/06/microsoft_stolen_key_analysis/">stealing</a> a cryptographic key from a crash dump file that had been left on Microsoft's internal internet-connected corporate network; the key should not have made it out of the mega-corp's isolated production environment.</p>
<p>Despite this major security intrusion by China, Smith defended Microsoft's business in the Middle Kingdom. National intelligence laws in China can be used to force companies operating there to provide snooping services for the government, or hand over proprietary code if pressured to do so. But Microsoft doesn't have to comply with that, Smith claimed, to some unbelieving members of Congress.</p>
<h3 class="crosshead">Mea culpa, then deflect</h3>
<p>He gets an A for presentation, but a D for content. Smith issued a mea culpa, but also deflected some of the lawmakers' tough questions about China, and why Microsoft isn't doing a very important job (securing its code, which in this case is also a national security issue) that the government is paying it millions of dollars to do. </p>
<p>Smith also said he hadn't read a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/microsoft-solarwinds-golden-saml-data-breach-russian-hackers">ProPublica report</a> that came out ahead of the Homeland Security subcommittee hearing and was the subject of several questions to the executive. That investigative report cited a now-ex-Microsoft whistle-blowing engineer who claimed he had repeatedly warned bosses as far back as 2017 about an authentication flaw that left Microsoft users and their work accounts vulnerable to compromise.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote">

<p>If anything like this happened with us ... it would not only destroy our product in the marketplace but the government would just kick us out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That flaw, which we're told involves exploiting weaknesses with Microsoft's Active Directory Federation Service and SAML, was allegedly used by the Russian government snoops behind the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/29/solarwinds_sec_lawsuit/">SolarWinds</a> backdoor.</p>
<p>According to the whistle-blower, the Kremlin spies used the SAML-based authentication flaw to gain full access to organizations' files and messages after sneaking into those victims' IT networks via the backdoored SolarWinds software. In other words, this was a post-exploitation vulnerability.</p>

        

<p>It was further alleged Microsoft refused to fix this years-old problem because in doing so, the corporation would have to admit that its Active Directory software was faulty, which could have cost it billions of dollars as the biz was vying for a massive IT contract with the US federal government at the time.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Exchange Online intrusion, all of Microsoft's pledges to do better on security, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/10/microsoft_president_brad_smith_summoned/">overhaul its entire security culture</a>, are either voluntary or - with ideas like tying top exec pay to security performance - are going to be really hard to measure.</p>
<p>"If it was any other vendor, if anything like this happened with us, where we had such a gaping security hole that foreign governments could come into our cloud environment it would not only destroy our product in the marketplace because we have no credibility, but the government would just kick us out," Trellix CTO Karan Sondhi told <em>The Register</em>.</p>

<p>The repeated intrusions by both <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/08/microsoft_confirms_russian_spies_stole/">Russian</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/21/microsoft_key_skeleton/">Chinese</a> cyber-spies highlight the national security risks of Uncle Sam's increasing reliance on a single technology vendor, Sondhi told us. </p>
<p>Specific to Microsoft and America: The US government uses everything from the super-corp's cloud infrastructure to its operating system and productivity tools, and then also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/24/microsoft_security_addons/">adds on</a> Redmond's security products, which Trellix and other infosec vendors say discourages competition in the marketplace.</p>

        

<p>"We're just saying to the government: Have an independent evaluation of security tooling," Sondhi said. "Measure the security tools' effectiveness, independent of the bundle that Microsoft offers, and pick your favorite. If it's us, great. If it's CrowdStrike, more power to you. If it's Sentinel One, great."</p>
<p>Microsoft, he added, "should be fixing vulnerabilities in their products. They should be squarely focused on that instead of trying to sell you security tools."</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote">

<p>Microsoft ... should be fixing vulnerabilities in their products. They should be squarely focused on that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When asked during the congressional hearing about Microsoft's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/04/microsoft_bundles/">bundling practices</a>, which may dissuade the government and other customers from selecting a third-party vendor for security, Smith responded: "I'm not aware of any so-called practices that limit what our customers can do in terms of cybersecurity protection."</p>
<h3 class="crosshead">No real incentive to change</h3>
<p>As long as federal dollars keep <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/05/microsoft_government_contracts/">pouring into</a> Microsoft's coffers, there's no real incentive to change. US government data showed at least $498 million of payments to Microsoft in 2023 alone.</p>
<p>In a May 29 letter to US Department of Defense CIO John Sherman, Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Eric Schmitt (R-MO) questioned why the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/04/pentagon_doubling_down_on_microsoft/">Pentagon is "doubling down"</a> on its investment in Microsoft products despite the IT giant's serious failings.</p>
<p>This, after the Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Safety Review Board's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/03/cisa_microsoft_exchange_online_china_report/">slammed</a> Microsoft's "cascade" of security snafus that made China's digital intrusion into government inboxes possible.</p>

<p>"What should the government do? Probably not give a $10 billion DoD contract to Microsoft for a commercial, off-the-shelf product," said Cory Simpson, CEO of the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology and a senior advisor to the Cyberspace Solarium Commission.</p>
<p>"You have one entity responsible for national security saying here's an entity that poses a risk, and then you have DoD, another entity responsible for national security, doubling down on Microsoft," Simpson told <em>The Register</em>. "We've got to have that conversation, and it needs to be with the White House." </p>
<p>The first thing that needs to happen, according to Simpson, is triage, which needs to come from a White House Executive Order. Later, there's long-term care, which comes from Congress. </p>
<p>While the administration doesn't control the government's purse strings, it could put a pause on future Microsoft integrations while the government explores other vendors' security products, he explained. "That could be done with an executive order," Simpson noted.</p>
<p>The White House Office of the National Cyber Director declined to comment for this story.</p>
<p>The long-term care, on the other hand, involves Congressional action to codify best security practices and even simpler ones, such as requiring Microsoft products to be <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/24/wyden_government_interoperability/">interoperable</a> with those from its peers.</p>
<p>"The two ends of the continuum are a decoupling of Microsoft, and at the other end doing nothing," Simpson said. "And there's a range of options in between."</p>
<h3 class="crosshead">Time for Biden administration to 'walk the talk'</h3>
<p>Under President Joe Biden's leadership, the administration has touted its commitment to shoring up the nation's networks. This included releasing the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/03/us_national_cybersecurity_strategy/">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a> in March 2023.</p>
<p>Part of the strategy centers around holding software makers liable for security flaws in their products, thus shifting IT defense away from the end users of technology and onto the providers. It also says the administration will work with Congress and the private sector to develop legislation around secure software and services.</p>

<p>Plus, this is the focus of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/09/68_tech_firms_sign_cisas/">secure by design pledge</a>, signed by nearly 70 software companies - including Microsoft - at last month's RSA Conference.</p>
<p>Another piece of the strategy involves investing in longer-term security practices at the government and enterprise level, rather than relying on short-term fixes, such as patches and more temporary solutions to problems.</p>
<p>"You can't accomplish both of those things with minimum regulation," Simpson said. "The best way to do that is to fully leverage the government as the largest consumer in the world. It's about purchasing power. If they don't change procurement practices, shame on them. They have to walk the talk of their strategy." ®</p>
