<p class="article_paragraph_2"></p><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light">
<p><abbr class="drop-cap color-accent font-accent">“I</abbr>owe Columbia a lot,” says Robert Kraft, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots, who announced in April he would stop donating to his alma mater amid <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesfarrell/2024/04/23/columbia-says-its-grateful-to-robert-kraft-after-billionaire-pulled-funding/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesfarrell/2024/04/23/columbia-says-its-grateful-to-robert-kraft-after-billionaire-pulled-funding/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesfarrell/2024/04/23/columbia-says-its-grateful-to-robert-kraft-after-billionaire-pulled-funding/" aria-label="the student protests">the student protests</a> spreading across college campuses. “Columbia gave me a full scholarship when I really needed it, and I’m loyal. But the [protesters] are not held accountable for their words or actions, and the university is letting them get away with it.”</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p>Columbia might lose millions from Kraft’s decision, considering he has given at least $8 million to the university over his lifetime. Luckily, the New York City school has plenty of other deep-pocketed alumni, including cable magnate Rocco Commisso, who tells <em>Forbes</em> he doesn’t plan to sit on his wallet. “I think now is the time to give more, not less,” says Commisso. “As alumni and wealthy people, we should commit ourselves to help Columbia grow. This is a school that gave me money and opportunity.”</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p>Commisso and Kraft are two of 11 billionaires who got an undergraduate degree from Columbia, making it one of the most elite schools in the world when it comes to educating billionaires. America’s richest people hail from colleges all across the country—from small liberal arts schools like Hobart and William Smith Colleges, where Fidelity Investments CEO Abigail Johnson studied art history, to major public research universities like Indiana University Bloomington, where Mark Cuban graduated with a business degree. But a quarter of the 813 American citizens on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#89ff9203d788" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#89ff9203d788" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#89ff9203d788" aria-label="Forbes’ billionaires list"><em data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#89ff9203d788">Forbes</em>’ billionaires list</a> got their undergraduate degree from one of just a dozen schools. This elite group includes two major California private colleges, two state schools and seven of the eight Ivies, including the University of Pennsylvania, by far the school with the most billionaire undergraduates, with 36, about two-thirds of whom studied at the esteemed Wharton School.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>
<p>Such deep-pocketed alumni networks can mean big bucks for a school’s endowment and big benefits for students. The late hedge fund billionaire Jim Simons and his wife Marilyn pledged $500 million in unrestricted funds through The Simons Foundation to Stony Brook University’s endowment last year. And Michael Bloomberg gave the largest single donation to any U.S. college or university in 2018, with a $1.5 billion gift to Johns Hopkins University, earmarked for undergraduate financial aid. Billionaire names adorn everything from New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business, to Harvard’s Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts &amp; Sciences, to the University of Oregon’s Phil and Penny Knight Campus.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p>

<p class="article_paragraph_7"></p><p>Of course fundraising from the ultra-wealthy can also place schools’ budgets at the whims of a small group of donors. Charlie Munger (d. 2023) donated $200 million to the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2016—with the requirement that the school construct a dorm using his design, which lacked windows and <a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2023/08/university-california-abandons-windowless-dorm-munger-hall/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.archpaper.com/2023/08/university-california-abandons-windowless-dorm-munger-hall/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.archpaper.com/2023/08/university-california-abandons-windowless-dorm-munger-hall/" aria-label="stirred controversy before the gift was scrapped">stirred controversy before the gift was scrapped</a>. When Charles and David Koch endowed a professorship at George Mason University as far back as the 1990s, their foundations got a seat on the board that chooses nominees for the position. And when billionaires are displeased with how a school is run, they might just pull their checkbooks altogether. Kraft isn’t the only wealthy donor halting his giving these days—so are others, such as hedge fund billionaire <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/10/26/billionaire-leon-cooperman-cutting-off-donations-to-columbia-over-student-protests-of-israel-hamas-war/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/10/26/billionaire-leon-cooperman-cutting-off-donations-to-columbia-over-student-protests-of-israel-hamas-war/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/10/26/billionaire-leon-cooperman-cutting-off-donations-to-columbia-over-student-protests-of-israel-hamas-war/" aria-label="Leon Cooperman">Leon Cooperman</a>, real estate investor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/business/sterlicht-brown-university-donor.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/business/sterlicht-brown-university-donor.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/business/sterlicht-brown-university-donor.html" aria-label="Barry Sternlicht">Barry Sternlicht</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/12/21/harvards-claudine-gay-under-fire-now-billionaire-blavatnik-pauses-donation/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/12/21/harvards-claudine-gay-under-fire-now-billionaire-blavatnik-pauses-donation/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/12/21/harvards-claudine-gay-under-fire-now-billionaire-blavatnik-pauses-donation/" aria-label="Len Blavatnik">Len Blavatnik</a>, who got his wealth from both chemicals and the music industry.</p>

<p>With more than three dozen billionaire alumni, the Philadelphia institution educated the likes of Tesla’s Elon Musk, former president Donald Trump, and Apollo cofounders Marc Rowan and Josh Harris. Penn is also in the blood of the heirs to the Estée Lauder fortune, with Leonard Lauder, William Lauder, Aerin Lauder and Ronald Lauder all attending over the span of four decades. Leonard and Ronald Lauder helped to establish Penn’s Lauder Institute, providing joint MBA and Master’s degrees in international studies, and Leonard Lauder gave $125 million to the university in 2022 to create a tuition-free nursing program. Though many CEOs—from Comcast’s Brian Roberts to Bilt Rewards’ Ankur Jain—studied business at Wharton, it’s not the only school within the university to turn out wealthy alumni. Designer Tory Burch got an art history degree from Penn, while film producer Dick Wolf studied English. Wolf and Rowan were among the university’s wealthy donors who called for former president <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/willskipworth/2023/12/09/penn-president-liz-magill-resigns-after-backlash-over-antisemitism-hearing-testimony/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/willskipworth/2023/12/09/penn-president-liz-magill-resigns-after-backlash-over-antisemitism-hearing-testimony/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/willskipworth/2023/12/09/penn-president-liz-magill-resigns-after-backlash-over-antisemitism-hearing-testimony/" aria-label="Liz Magill to resign">Liz Magill to resign</a> last year following her testimony during a congressional hearing on the rise of antisemitism on college campuses.</p><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-45 bleedright" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text"><small>David Madison/Getty Images</small></p></figcaption></figure>

<p>The Silicon Valley school has helped mold plenty of tech billionaires, from Andy Fang and Stanley Tang, who were students when they cofounded food delivery app DoorDash, to Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, two fraternity brothers who created the project that became Snapchat. Several banking and finance moguls graduated with a bachelor’s degree from the institution, including Charles Schwab, Capital One’s Richard Fairbank and Scott Crabill, managing partner at private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Then there’s Jerry Yang, who completed his undergraduate and masters studies at Stanford, then cofounded Yahoo after dropping out of a Ph.D. program at the school. Yang now chairs the university’s board.</p><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-46 offset" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text"><small>Maddie Meyer/Getty Images</small></p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Harvard College has educated Natalie Portman, Neil deGrasse Tyson, six U.S. presidents—and more than two dozen current U.S. billionaires. That includes Citadel’s Ken Griffin, who installed a satellite dish on his dorm roof to get real-time stock quotes, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Airbnb cofounder Nathan Blecharczyk. Some alumni are Boston legends, including Jim Koch, the creator of Sam Adams beer, and Tom Werner, whose Fenway Sports Group owns the Boston Red Sox, Fenway Park and a big stake in New England Sports Network. Just as famous as the school’s graduates, however, are its dropouts. Bill Gates, for example, left to launch Microsoft in 1975, while Mark Zuckerberg left in 2004 to pursue Facebook full-time. He and his wife Priscilla Chan, who met at Harvard, announced in 2021 they would give $519 million to the university through The Chan Zuckerberg Foundation to launch and operate the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence, named after Zuckerberg’s mother.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-1"><p id="article-0-topx-1"></p></fbs-ad><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-47 bleedright" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text"><small>Plexi Images/GHI/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty Images</small></p></figcaption></figure>

Three heirs behind candy company Mars, Inc. are all Bulldogs, too, as are oil tycoons Lee, Edward, Robert and Sid Bass.

<p>Known for its School of Cinematic Arts, USC was the launching point for filmmaker George Lucas, who graduated in 1967 and who gave $175 million to the film school in 2006. Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO of software giant Salesforce graduated from USC’s Marshall School of Business, meanwhile. And Scott Cook, cofounder of Intuit, studied economics at the university. Some of California’s biggest real estate moguls also call USC their alma mater, including former LA mayoral candidate Rick Caruso, Edward Roski Jr. and two heirs behind storage company Public Storage, Tamara Gustavson and B. Wayne Hughes Jr.</p>
<p>When real estate developer Igor Olenicoff first arrived on campus as a transfer student in the 1960s, he didn’t have any friends. Olenicoff, whose family immigrated to the United States at the age of 15 from Iran, said pledging a fraternity at USC was the first chance for him to make real connections—relationships that he continues to use in business.</p>
<p>“When I needed a large unsecured line of credit to do early real estate projects, I could go back to people I knew at USC in the banking world.” Olenicoff tells <em>Forbes</em>. “Having friends in the business world was very helpful after graduating.

Bezos and his billionaire ex-wife Mackenzie Scott are both graduates, though they didn’t meet until after they separately left the university and took jobs at hedge fund D.E. Shaw. Princeton is also the jumping off point for several other tech fortunes. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, an alum, and his wife Wendy established a $25 million endowment in 2009 to fund “risk-taking projects” in natural sciences and engineering. And, in 2002, former eBay CEO Meg Whitman gave $30 million to Princeton to help expand its student body. Among the alumni are also notable names in finance, such as investor Carl Icahn, Cerberus Capital CEO Stephen Feinberg and Michael Novogratz, the founder of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital.</p><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-43" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text"><small>Simon Simard/Bloomberg</small></p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Best known for its engineering and physical science programs, MIT has helped mold several notable healthcare and tech billionaires. That includes Drew Houston, who cofounded Dropbox with MIT classmate Arash Ferdowsi, and Lisa Su, the CEO of semiconductor firm AMD. The school named its nanoscience research building after Su in 2022, after she donated an undisclosed sum. Other alumni include founder of analytics software firm MicroStrategy and Bitcoin investor Michael Saylor, and technology-focused venture capital investor Philippe Laffont. Koch Industries co-CEO Charles Koch and his brother William Koch both studied engineering at MIT. The Institute’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research is named after their late brother David (d. 2019), also an alum, who gave $100 million to MIT in 2007 to build the facility.</p>
<p>“I spent my early years believing I was destined for a career in engineering, but it became clear at MIT that I would be a lousy engineer,” says Charles Koch in a statement to <em>Forbes</em>. “But MIT helped me develop a problem-solving mindset and the ability to see the bigger picture.”</p><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-42 bleedleft" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text"><small>Bing Guan/Bloomberg</small></p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Almost all of Dartmouth’s billionaire alumni got rich in private equity. Leon Black, cofounder of Apollo Global Management, studied philosophy and history at Dartmouth and was a trustee of the college from 2002 to 2011. Black and his wife Debra gave $48 million to the Black Family Visual Arts Center there. (A college spokesperson stated there were no plans to rename the center after Black was sued by a woman in 2023 alleging Black raped her in 2002 at the home of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein; Black has denied the allegations.) Others include Thoma Bravo managing partner Holden Spaht; Jim Coulter, co-CEO of TPG; and Nvidia board member Tench Coxe, whose wealth largely stems from his stake in the chipmaker but who has served for more than three decades at VC firm Sutter Hill Ventures. Stephen Mandel Jr., founder of hedge fund outfit Lone Pine Capital, is the third generation of his family to graduate from Dartmouth and served as chair of the college’s board of trustees from 2010 to 2014.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-3"><p id="article-0-topx-3"></p></fbs-ad><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-53 offset" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text"><small>gregobagel/getty images</small></p></figcaption></figure>

    <div><div class="paywall">



<p>But now, Gen Zers are clamoring to get their hands on that shiny gold plastic. Indeed, this generation, along with millennials, accounted for 75% of new consumer platinum and consumer gold accounts in 2023, Howard Grosfield, president of U.S. consumer services at American Express, tells <em>Fortune</em>. </p>



<p>“Amex is becoming the card for an entirely new generation,” Grosfield says. “Our premium products and membership model resonate with high-credit quality, high-spending younger customers, which means we capture a longer relationship over their lifetime and grow with them into their peak spending years.”</p>



<p>It may seem surprising that younger generations facing high inflation, student loans, and high housing costs would go for a card they have to pay for. (A platinum Amex card comes with an <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/credit-cards/credit-intel/platinum-fee/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/credit-cards/credit-intel/platinum-fee/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">annual fee of $695</a>). But millennials and Gen Zers are indeed willing to shell out for a card that comes with “lifestyle” perks that go beyond just travel points. The platinum card comes with entertainment credits to subscribe to platforms such as <a href="https://fortune.com/company/hulu/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/hulu/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Hulu</a> and <em>The New York Times</em>, as well as <a href="https://fortune.com/company/uber-technologies/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/uber-technologies/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Uber</a> cash, airport lounge access, and even credit to shop at Saks. A platinum card offers $1,500 in value per year relative to its yearly fee, according to Amex. </p>



<p>“Until about 10 to 15 years ago, we thought that no-fee cards were the entry point to bring in younger customers to the franchise,” Grosfield says. “We’ve learned that that’s not the right strategy for millennials and Gen Zs. They like the brand affiliation. They like to travel and eat out, and they like the special access and experiences that come with our premium cards.”</p><p></p>



<p>It also helps that more merchants are accepting Amex than in the past, helping the card shed its occasional reputation as fussy or elitist.. While Amex has long offered more-generous perks than other cards, the flipside is its relative priciness for merchants meant it wasn’t accepted everywhere. Competitor <a href="https://fortune.com/company/visa/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/visa/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Visa</a> had great success trolling Amex with its 20-year “It’s Everywhere You Want to Be” advertising campaign. </p>



<p>However, that’s now shifted as the number of locations globally that accept American Express cards has more than tripled since 2017, a company spokesperson tells <em>Fortune</em>. “Nearly 18 million stores and vendors accept Amex here in the U.S., as we maintain 99% parity coverage with other credit card networks,” Amex tells <em>Fortune</em>.</p>



<p>Stil, the fee fights aren’t over, as one major e-commerce company will <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/06/ebay-american-express-fees/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/06/ebay-american-express-fees/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">stop accepting Amex</a> this summer: <a href="https://fortune.com/company/ebay/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/ebay/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">eBay</a>. The e-commerce platform will drop Amex payments in August, citing “unacceptably high fees.” (Amex’s spokesperson says they are “disappointed” in the decision, which “will limit customers’ payment choices.” They add, “Our research tells us that in the U.S. the cost of acceptance for American Express is comparable to what eBay pays for similar cards on other networks.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Not just anyone has an Amex</h2>



<p>While American Express has undoubtedly seen a wave of new, young customers, it doesn’t mean they’re shying away from their high-income or high-quality clientele. Amex customers still have “super prime FICOs and credit quality that outperforms their industry peers,” Grosfield says. Plus, the average income of U.S. millennial and Gen Z customers is about 70% higher than the average income of those customers across the industry, an American Express spokesperson tells <em>Fortune</em>. </p>



<p>Their average 18-24 year old customer has a 679 credit score, while 25-40 year olds have a 686 average credit score, according to <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/credit-cards/credit-intel/credit-score-by-age-state/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/credit-cards/credit-intel/credit-score-by-age-state/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">American Express</a>. When looking at the entire credit card industry, Gen Zers have an average credit score of 665, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/27/average-credit-score-at-every-age-in-the-us.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/27/average-credit-score-at-every-age-in-the-us.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">VantageScore CreditGauge</a>.</p><p></p>



<p>It’s also important to recognize that the annual fee of the card isn’t sustainable for everyone, and that fees on competitors’ cards could fluctuate as these travel and lifestyle cards become even more popular. Even still, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/03/housing-market-gen-z-spending-influencer-lifestyle-envy/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/03/housing-market-gen-z-spending-influencer-lifestyle-envy/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Gen Z is attracted to a luxury lifestyle</a>—even if they can’t afford it.</p>



<p>Amex “traditionally symbolized stability, coined for the older, affluent bunch,” says </p>



<p>Gloria Garcia Cisneros, a Gen Z wealth manager for LourdMurray. Gen Z’s interest in the “card is more so because of the change in value proposition from AmEx. They are framing themselves in a new light and Gen Z doesn’t like to miss out on the newest and hottest trends.”</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Gen Z also loves a ‘good life hack’</h2>



<p>While Amex has long been popular among the wealthy who collect travel points like no other, Gen Zers enjoy the perks of the card beyond flight and hotel points. With a more diversified set of perks, Gen Zers see the card as a way to get the most bang for their buck. </p>



<p>Gen Z “loves a good life hack,” Gabriela Serpa Royo, a senior cultural analyst at consumer insights agency Canvas8, tells <em>Fortune</em>. To them, “credit card perks are even better than credit, because it computes in the brain as free money.”</p><p></p>



<p>Indeed, Gen Z is more engaged with the Amex benefits—including travel, dining, and special-access events—than older generations, Grosfield says. Amex users also have access to online education regarding budgeting, saving, retirement planning, owning a home, and building good credit. These factors all spell hope for a “long runway for growth from millennial and Gen Z customers,” Grosfield says. </p>



<p>Bottom line is, though, that Gen Z is always looking for a deal. Indeed, the “growing love for credit card perks isn’t dissimilar to the explosion that we’ve been witnessing lately, nor does it stand apart from the rise of” buy-now-pay-later products, Royo says. </p>



<p>“People are looking for deals because they feel like they need more, want more—and also want to appear like they have more—while having, or feeling like they have, less,” Royo says.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

    <div><p class="drop-cap preview">We are once again at a crucial point in the world's economic recovery. Everything must go right, or global markets could turn violent.</p><p class="preview">For the past four years, the world has been unified in its efforts to first ease the economic pain caused by the pandemic and then combat the historic bout of inflation that followed. When the pandemic set in, central banks around the world slashed rates to zero — just as they did during the financial crisis. Then as inflation set in, they started raising rates at a rapid clip unseen in decades. They did all this in nearly perfect time, which ensured that markets remained stable and predictable. But now, the world risks falling out of sync.</p><div class="premium-content"><p class="premium">The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ecb-lagarde-economy-interest-rates-cuts-inflation-growth-central-banks-2024-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">European Central Bank began easing interest rates </a>on Thursday, cutting its benchmark rate by 0.25%. The move is not only a sign of confidence that the eurozone is in the last bouts of its battle with inflation but also an indication of worry that the economy needs a small boost to keep rolling. Investors and economists expect the Federal Reserve to follow suit and cut interest rates <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fed-interest-rate-decision-may-rates-held-steady-no-cuts-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">in September</a>. And so, the story goes, central banks around the world will begin their coordinated descent into a soft landing — a perfect calibration of that push-pull between fighting inflation and evading a recession.</p><p class="premium">The thing is, reality has been making a mockery of experts' assumptions all year long. Wall Street started the year expecting inflation to cool off, the economy to slow to a more leisurely pace of growth, and as many as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/interest-rates-2024-outlook-rate-cut-predictions-wall-street-stocks-2023-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">six interest rate</a> cuts from the Fed. Instead, inflation data has consistently come in hot, and the US economy's strength has defied expectations. This combination means there's a good chance that the September cut Wall Street is praying for may never materialize.</p><p class="premium">"Summer will definitely be interesting," Tamara Basic Vasiljev, a senior economist at Oxford Economics, told me. Her base case is that everything will go according to plan, but there are caveats: "The Fed has proven its ability to fight off any kind of financial stability issues. But what if services inflation keeps surprising to the upside through the summer? Then it becomes apparent they can't even cut in September."</p><p class="premium">If the Fed doesn't cut come fall, America's high interest-rate regime will be out of step with the rest of the world. And any differential between the US and the rest of the world would send a weird wave of money crashing onto America's shores. That sudden surge of cash could, in turn, add liquidity to our financial system just as the Fed is trying to dry it up and push up prices around the economy. This would make it even harder for the Fed to ease, further diverging US policy from the rest of the world. Think of it as a vicious cycle standing in the way of the world's smooth, soft landing.</p><p class="premium">Over time, this has the potential to add volatility to already skittish markets. Here in the US, stocks move on mood — one week, Wall Street thinks we're in for stagflation; the next, it believes a soft landing is coming. This divergence in interest policy, over time, has the potential to bring that same frantic energy to currency markets.</p><h2 class="premium">The carry nation</h2><p class="premium">Wind is the result of an imbalance: air moving from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. The greater the pressure differences, the faster the wind blows. The same principle applies to the global flow of cash — investors chase imbalances, and sometimes things get blown over in the process.</p><p class="premium">The US already has somewhat higher interest rates than other countries — the Fed's benchmark rate is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fed-rate-cuts-forecast-2024-full-accommodation-economic-contraction-unemployment-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">5.25%- 5.50%.</a> These differentials have allowed Wall Street to make what is called a "<a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/foreign-exchange-funds-central-banks-fed-rate-hikes-carry-trade-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">carry trade</a>": Investors borrow money from a country with low interest rates, invest it in bonds from a country where interest rates are high, and pocket the difference. In this case, that means moving money from the rest of the world and buying US assets, particularly government bonds.</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-quote="What seems like a slam dunk for Wall Street is not such good news for either the US or the global economy." data-quote-updated="true" data-source="Add source (optional)" data-source-updated="false" class="premium">

                            </es-blockquote><p class="premium">This trade has been hot since the start of the year — investment banks like JPMorgan and UBS recommended it to clients, and a Bloomberg index based on selling the lowest-yielding G10 currencies and buying the highest ones has already returned 7% this year. The Institute of International Finance reported that in May alone, Emerging Markets ex-China — where rates are also higher — saw bond-market inflows of $10.2 billion, mostly due to investors benefiting from carry trades like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-futures-dip-as-growth-concerns-linger/card/japanese-yen-strengthens-as-risk-aversion-rises-carry-trade-crumbles-9tGHrcickLndc749YzTO" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">selling Japanese yen</a> to buy Mexican pesos. These trades are "everywhere," Peter Schaffrik, a global macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets, told Bloomberg. And the more rates diverge, the more attractive this march of money from weak to strong becomes.</p><p class="premium">What seems like a slam dunk for Wall Street is not such good news for either the US or the global economy. At a time when economies in Europe and elsewhere are losing momentum, sucking more money away from these economies will tighten financial conditions while they're trying to avoid a slowdown — especially in crucial regional data like <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/european-shares-fall-amid-data-deluge-1033460481" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">German industrial production</a>, which has come in soft of late. It will also weaken the euro, which will make it harder for the continent to import the energy it needs to fuel its economy and make it more expensive to buy American goods. And in Asian economies, where interest rates are already significantly lower than in the US, things could get even messier.</p><p class="premium">"We expect that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/japan-yen-slump-intervention-currency-buy-us-involvement-interest-rates-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Japan</a> and South Korea will face challenges balancing monetary policy to maintain stability as the dollar appreciates," Nigel Green, the CEO of deVere Group, a global wealth-management firm, told me. "I wouldn't be surprised if policymakers feel the need to intervene in the currency markets or adjust interest rates to manage these effects."</p><p class="premium">For the US, more money sloshing onto America's shores has the opposite impact of what the Fed wants to achieve: It pushes up asset prices and loosens financial conditions. In other words, it makes it harder for the Fed to fight the inflation that is aggravating consumers.</p><p class="premium">"There are legitimate concerns that this influx of capital into the US will increase liquidity, driving up asset prices and inflationary pressure, making it more challenging for the Fed to lower rates," Green said. "Increased liquidity can lead to inflationary pressures, which the Fed might need to counteract by maintaining or even raising rates."</p><p class="premium">As Green mentioned, there's a way for the Fed to fight back: hiking interest rates some more. But jacking up interest rates even further could finally break the back of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/recession-outlook-hard-landing-economy-consumer-spending-slowdown-growth-gdp-2024-5#:~:text=Consumers%20are%20finally%20slowing%20their,and%20a%20weakening%20job%20market." data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">until now strong US consumer</a> and send us into a recession. It's the same calculation the ECB is making, though the EU's slowdown is more marked. Given these downsides, the Fed is unlikely to hike, which will create the perfect market for the carry trade to thrive. And as long as US data remains choppy — pointing to sticky inflation one day and disinflation the next — this carry-trade cash will end up sloshing around in the economy. This is a dynamic that central banks from countries already on their rate-cutting path will be watching. They're already seeing growth slow and, on top of that, will have money sucked away to the US, where data has been relatively strong through the first half of the year. Carry-trade cash exploits the dislocations between global economies that are keeping our policies from coordinating. We're in the early innings, but the longer this goes on, the more of an impact it will make. For Wall Street, that means <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-summer-worry-stock-market-crash-inflation-hamtons-vacation-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">a summer of vigilance</a>. For economists, it means the picture of our economy that they're trying to cobble together with contradictory data is even blurrier. It's a time of increased uncertainty.</p><h2 class="premium">Sticky-ing the landing</h2><p class="premium">There is, of course, hope that this divergence will be only a temporary state of affairs. If the US suddenly starts printing weak economic data, that will hasten the Fed's move to cut rates. And there are signs that EU inflation is stickier than policymakers would like, which could slow the pace of cuts enough for America to catch up.</p><p class="premium">There are already signs of a slight tempering of America's red-hot economy: The household savings rate is at a 16-month low, disposable incomes have made only modest gains, and the amount that people have to pay on credit balances is elevated. The white-hot job market has cooled, and job openings have returned to prepandemic levels. But not every indicator is telling the story of a soft landing. On Friday, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-unemployment-rate-job-growth-looked-in-may-2024-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">May's jobs report</a> showed that the country created 272,000 jobs — way more than the 182,000 expected.

                            </es-blockquote><p class="premium">On the other side of the Atlantic, there are signs that UK and EU inflation could be stickier than policymakers had foreseen. <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/interestrates/eurozone-inflation-rises-ahead-of-ecb-meeting-1033440963" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">EU inflation ticked up slightly to 2.6% in May</a>, surprising the ECB but not shocking it enough to stop a June rate cut. In the UK, stubborn services inflation, which came in at 5.9% for the month of April, may give the Bank of England reason to pause. Oxford Economics' Basic Vasiljev told me that this indicated that the EU and US were moving more in tandem than this policy lag suggests and the current policy divergence would remain short. Even the Bank of Canada, which cut its benchmark rate to 4.75% from 5% last week, is cautiously optimistic the dislocation will be momentary. "There are limits to how far we can diverge from the United States, but we're not close to those limits," Gov. Tiff Macklem said at the Bank of Canada's latest meeting. Not close… yet.</p><p class="premium">This rosy outlook is not a guarantee: Wall Street still expects three cuts this year from the ECB and the <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/european-shares-fall-amid-data-deluge-1033460481" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Bank of England</a>. Even in little clips of 0.25%, three cuts would create a divergence traders would exploit. And if September comes and the US is still hot, that exploitation could continue all year long, exacerbating the conditions that are keeping monetary policy out of sync. That sucking sound you'll hear all summer is the sound of Wall Street slurping money from Europe, Canada, the UK, and East Asia into US markets. Policymakers will have to recalibrate. This doesn't mean we won't stick a soft landing — especially if this disordered moment is brief — it just increases the odds of a bumpy ride until we get there.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="premium"><a target="_blank" rel="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/linette-lopez" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><em><u>Linette Lopez</u></em></a><em> is a senior correspondent at Business Insider.</em></p></div>

But those worried about U.S. debt levels today note that while it surged during the pandemic emergency when the federal government sought to prop up the economy, debt has continued to pile up without a comparable emergency, not to mention a global calamity on the scale of World War II.</p><p>Meanwhile, the trajectory of deficits and debt in the coming decades is spooking investors and policymakers more than the current levels.</p><p>Krugman pointed out that unlike individuals, governments don't have to pay off all their debt.</p><p>"How did we pay off the debt from World War II? We didn’t," he wrote. "Federal debt when John F. Kennedy took office was slightly higher than it had been in 1946. But debt as a percentage of G.D.P. was way down, thanks to growth and inflation."</p><p>Of course, the U.S. must still keep up with interest payments and maturing Treasury bonds, and the cost of servicing all that debt expense is expected to exceed defense spending this year.</p><p><strong>How to fix U.S. debt</strong></p><p>But in Krugman's view, the key is stabilizing debt as a share of GDP rather than paying it all down, and he highlighted a recent study from the left-leaning <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/what-would-it-take-to-stabilize-the-debt-to-gdp-ratio/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Center for American Progress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="13" data-v9y="0">Center for American Progress</a> that estimates the U.S. needs to hike taxes or reduce spending by 2.1% of GDP to achieve that.</p><p>"That isn’t a big number!" he added.</p><p>The tax revenue that the U.S. government collects as a share of GDP is smaller than what other wealthy countries collect, and increasing it enough to stabilize debt isn't likely to hurt growth, Krugman said.</p><p>Since the economics of stabilizing the debt are relatively straight forward, the main obstacle is politics, he explained.</p><p>"Given the political will, we could resolve debt concerns quite easily," he wrote.

                </div><p>At a night market on May 29, Huang told reporters that “Taiwan is one of the most important countries in the world. It is at the center of the electronics industry. The computer industry is built because of Taiwan.”</p><p>In a speech at National Taiwan University on June 2, he displayed a map of Taiwan surrounded by the names of Taiwanese companies and institutes Nvidia has partnered with, thanking them for being the “bedrock for the AI [artificial intelligence] industrial revolution.”</p>        
        
    <p>On Thursday, Chinese online media firm Guancha published an article that said Huang’s popularity in Taiwan might have gone to his head.</p><p>“Perhaps he has gotten carried away and it has made him arrogant,” Guancha said. “He even called Taiwan a country.”</p><p>“While it was unclear whether his words were a mistake or held a hidden agenda, many Taiwanese media firms responded to them as if they were treasure,” it said, adding that Huang had not responded to online criticism in China so far.</p><p>It is absolutely impossible for Chinese companies to work with a company that supports “Taiwan independence,” it said, calling on Huang to give “Chinese compatriots and supply chain partners an explanation.”</p><p>In Taipei yesterday, reporters asked Huang to comment on Chinese reactions to his “country” remark.</p><p>“I wasn’t making a geopolitical comment, but thanking all of our technology partners here for all their support and contributions to the industry,” Huang said.</p><p>Huang departed Taiwan last night.</p><p>Voice of America on Friday reported that a National Taiwan University academic said that Beijing would not become hostile toward Huang, because “China needs Nvidia, but Nvidia does not need China.”</p><p>Lin Tsung-nan (林宗男), a professor in the university’s Department of Electrical Engineering, told Voice of America that Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, and while the Chinese government backs Huawei Technologies Co, its chips do not perform as well as even Nvidia’s downgraded products.</p><p>“The Chinese government bullies the good and fears the strong, so it arbitrarily bans imports of Taiwan’s agricultural products, but does it dare ban Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s [TSMC]?” Lin asked.</p><p>China needs Nvidia’s high-end chips, he said, adding that as long as China needs Huang, Beijing will not shoot itself in the foot even if he makes remarks that conflict with its ideology and policies.</p><p>Huang was born in Taiwan and when Nvidia was founded, it relied on Taiwanese partners, including TSMC, so he knows the importance of Taiwan in the development of information and communications technology and chip production, Lin said.</p><p>Chung Hua University adjunct professor Tu Tzu-chen (杜紫宸) said that the Chinese government knows well the concept of “the lesser of two evils,” so it knows there is nothing to gain from criticizing Huang.</p><p>However, Beijing would hold a grudge and whether it seeks redress would depend on Nvidia’s strength, Tu said.</p><p>Nvidia is already working with 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer chip technology, while the best China has is 7-nanometer, so it still relies on Nvidia for high-end AI chips, which could be used in products such as PCs and autonomous vehicles, he said.</p><p>Liu Pei-chen (劉佩真), a research director at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, said that China sees how central Nvidia is in the global AI industry, with an edge in hardware, software, next-generation server platforms, edge computing, smart factories and robotics, so it would not make Huang an enemy to preserve opportunities for cooperation.</p><p>Moreover, with China failing to make breakthroughs in high-end AI chip manufacturing and advanced packaging solutions, as well as the algorithm technology gap it faces, it has no choice but to bet its hope on Nvidia, she said.</p>

</div><p>Virgin Galactic on Saturday successfully completed its last spaceflight before heading into a two-year pause on commercial operations to upgrade its fleet, as the space tourism company seeks to finally turn a profit.</p>


										      
																																	<p>"Galactic07 is back on terra firma, now as astronauts!" the company said on X, formerly Twitter, referring to a team of two pilots and two passengers. "Our pilots, crew and spaceship have landed safely at Spaceport America, New Mexico."</p>
<p>A huge carrier plane took off from the runway at 8:31 am Mountain Time and climbed to an altitude of some 44,500 feet (13,500 meters) over approximately 50 minutes.</p>
<p>After that, it released from under its wings a spaceplane that soared at supersonic speed to the edge of space, where the passengers were able to enjoy a few minutes of weightlessness and admire the Earth's curve.</p>
<p>It landed on the same runway at 9:41 am, having accelerated to Mach 2.96, almost three times the speed of sound.</p>
<p>One of the private was Tuva Atasever, a Turkish space agency astronaut whose seat was contracted through another space company, Axiom, while the names of the other three were revealed only after landing.</p>
<p>They were Anand "Andy" Harish Sadhwani, a propulsion engineer at SpaceX, New York real estate developer and airplane pilot Irving Izchak Pergament and Italian investment advisor Giorgio Manenti.</p>
<p>During the flight, Atasever wore custom headgear with <a href="https://phys.org/tags/brain+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag">brain activity</a> monitoring sensors to collect physiological data, a dosimeter, and two commercially available insulin pens to examine the ability to administer accurate insulin doses in microgravity, Virgin said in a statement.</p>

<p><b>Last flight before pause</b></p>
<p>It was the seventh commercial flight for the company founded in 2004 by British tycoon Richard Branson, in an emerging suborbital tourism market where its main competitor is Blue Origin, owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>It was also the final <a href="https://phys.org/tags/flight/" rel="tag" class="textTag">flight</a> for its current spaceplane called VSS Unity, which it intends to replace with two next-generation "Delta class" ships, currently under construction in Arizona, with test flights due in 2025 before commercial operations in 2026.</p>
<p>The future of the company is at stake as it seeks at long last to get into the black. Virgin is burning through cash, losing more than $100 million in each of the past two quarters, with its reserves standing at $867 million at the end of March.</p>
<p>It also laid off 185 people, or 18 percent of its workforce, late last year. Its shares are currently trading at 85 cents, down from $55 in 2021, the year Branson himself flew, garnering global headlines.</p>
<p>While similar in appearance to Unity, the Delta ships will carry six passengers, compared to the current four. Seat prices will be set at $600,000 and up to 125 flights are projected per year, the company says, hoping to turn around its fortunes.</p>
<p>Some are skeptical, however.</p>
<p>"Virgin Galactic investors can look forward to owning a stock generating essentially zero revenue for the next 18 to 30 months—and that's if everything goes as planned, and the Delta program doesn't get delayed," The Motley Fool wrote in a note to investors this week.</p>
<p>Blue Origin, which launches on a small suborbital rocket, resumed crewed flights in May after its own hiatus of nearly two years, though it experienced an anomaly with one of the three landing parachutes failing to fully inflate, which could delay the next mission.</p>

<li>The US job market is still strong, with the addition of 272,000 jobs in May, exceeding analyst estimates and indicating sustained momentum.</li>
<li>The strong job growth may lead the Federal Reserve to hold off on initiating rate cuts, as the central bank closely monitors employment figures.</li>

The NFP report, released on Friday, showed the addition of 272,000 jobs in May, crushing analyst estimates.</p><p>Such a divergence from the consensus is likely have a substantial effect on the Federal Reserve. This surge suggests sustained momentum in the labor market. </p><p>As a result, the central bank, which has been closely monitoring employment figures, may see the strong job growth as a reason to hold off on initiating rate cuts.</p><p>The rise in the unemployment rate to 4.0% may seem counterintuitive given the substantial job gains, yet it is a nuanced indicator that could reflect changes in labor force participation or other demographic shifts within the U.S. economy.</p><h2><strong>What economists are saying about the NFP report</strong></h2><p><strong>Bank of America</strong>: "The bottom line is that the stronger-than-expected May employment report remains consistent with our monetary policy outlook for staying on hold. This report showed solid payroll gains with positive implications for consumer spending."</p><p>"We expect the Fed to stay on hold for now and start a gradual cutting cycle in December which will depend on a moderation in the inflation data. The economy may be cooling, but it is not cool."</p><p><strong>TD Securities</strong>: "The FOMC is widely expected to keep the Fed funds target range unchanged at 5.25%-5.50%, with Chair Powell likely providing a similar policy message to May."</p><p>"However, the risk is that the chairman appears somewhat optimistic given the recent evolution of the US consumer, and if the May CPI report shows further inflation progress. We also look for the dot plot to show two cuts as the median for 2024 and four for 2025."</p><div class="mt-3 text-center text-xs text-[#5b616e]"><p>3rd party Ad.

The actual decision at next week’s meeting is unlikely to throw too many surprises, but we will be hunting for clues as to whether our idea of where rates are heading matches that of the Fed’s."</p><p><strong>Jefferies</strong>: "Bottom line is that the Fed is still firmly on hold. Next week's CPI is likely to print +0.1%/+0.3%, and we see some upside for a +0.2% on the headline. A July cut is also likely a pipe dream, and it's unlikely that things will fall apart quickly enough before September for a cut as well."</p><p>"We continue to expect 1 cut in 2024, likely in November or December depending on how the Fed handles the election results."</p><p><strong>UBS</strong>: "This report seems likely to continue to bolster FOMC participants' assessments of the expansion's resilience. It also puts at risk our expectation that the June SEP has a 2 cut dot median for 2024. However, there are a other reasons for the FOMC retaining the option of a September rate cut and keeping market pricing between one and two cuts while they await more data."</p><p><strong>Citi</strong>: "We are shifting our base case for a first rate cut from July to September on well-above-consensus 272k new jobs in May.

    <div><p>Steven Schwartz was just 13 years old when he started his first side hustle. Like many teenage boys his age, he wanted a pair of sneakers—the <a href="https://fortune.com/company/nike/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/nike/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Nike</a> Kobe 7 Easter shoe, to be exact—but his parents wouldn’t pay for them.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>Instead of stomping his foot in protest, he found a like-minded teen on <a href="https://fortune.com/company/facebook/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/facebook/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Facebook</a>, Cameron Zoub, to help him build a bot which would buy limited-edition sneakers for people before they sell out. </p>



<p>“We basically spent the next eight years building a ton of different products,” Schwartz tells <em>Fortune</em>. “We built marketplaces, we built consumer apps, we built games, we built social networks, we built SAS companies, people agencies and we did pretty well.”</p>



<p>Now in their mid 20’s—and at least 22 side hustles later—Schwartz, Zoub and a third co-founder Jack Sharkey are running Whop, a marketplace for digital entrepreneurs. Think <a href="https://fortune.com/company/etsy/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/etsy/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Etsy</a> meets <a href="https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">LinkedIn</a>. </p>



<p>According to Schwartz, the platform, which launched in 2021, is currently valued at around a quarter of a billion dollars and processes around $400 million a year in transactions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">22 side hustles in the making</h2>



<p>For those old enough to remember dial-up internet, it’s hard to imagine building businesses online and moonlighting as a tech boss after school hours. </p>



<p>But for the generation that grew up playing on a smartphone instead of in the playground, turning one’s hand to entrepreneurship isn’t so far-fetched.</p><p></p>



<p>In fact, the second fastest-growing job title amongst Gen Z grads right now is “founder”, according to LinkedIn.</p>



<p>“My generation don’t want to go work a consulting or banking job. They don’t even want to be an astronaut anymore. They want to make content online, they want to find customers online and they want to find friends online because the internet is so powerful,” Schwartz says.</p>



<p>“Being educated with more information about what people can do, why would they want to do something that isn’t the most elite experience and the most fun for them?”</p>



<p>It isn’t just Gen Z who have embraced the be-your-own-boss hype. </p>



<p>Being able to work where and when you wanted during the pandemic awakened the entrepreneur in many people—and it didn’t go unnoticed by Schwartz. </p><p></p>



<p>“Every single person in the world wanted to have a side hustle,” he adds. “They didn’t really want to work a nine-to-five job anymore, they wanted to do something that they were more passionate about.” </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>The only problem? Many didn’t have anywhere to connect with customers.</p>



<p>For those who took up pottery or painting in their free time, they could sell their work on Etsy. </p>



<p>But when Schwartz spotted “hundreds of thousands of people” trying to buy and sell software on Redditt, he knew a gap in the market could be plugged. </p>



<p>“We saw that as a great opportunity for us to build something that can help streamline the process and make sure that more people are able to participate in this marketplace—at the time, there was no element of customer support, no reviews, no streamlined payments.”</p><p></p>



<p>Now, he says 4 million people a month are turning to Whop to tap their inner Jeff Bezos.</p>



<p>Having launched at least 22 side hustles—from a disappearing chat tool like <a href="https://fortune.com/company/snap/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/snap/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Snapchat</a> before Snapchat existed to a hamburger delivery service at college—before finding success with Whop, Schwartz has some words of wisdom to those looking to make the leap into entrepreneurialism: Just do it. </p>



<p>“We learned that failure is kind of implied,” the Gen Zer says. “Some of them are going to hit and some of them aren’t.”</p>



<p>As tiring as it sounds, Schwartz frames it simply as a matter of picking yourself and trying again. Indeed, Whop wouldn’t exist if Schwartz gave up on venture number 5 and got an office job. </p>



<p>Schwartz’s main lesson? Just don’t let the fear of failure hold you back from starting at all. </p><p></p>



<p>“The biggest learning is you have to just start a business if you want to. You can’t be successful in business, if you’re not starting a business. That’s step one,” Schwartz laughs. “So I think just doing it is a huge thing and not really worrying about, ‘what if this doesn’t work?’ Because like, what if it does work?”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mentorship with Tinder’s cofounder and backing from Peter Thiel</h2>



<p>It’s not only remote freelancers who are buying into Schwartz’s vision. </p>



<p>In its latest round of funding earlier this month, Whop raised <a href="https://fundraiseinsider.com/blog/whop-raises-18-million-in-series-a-funding/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fundraiseinsider.com/blog/whop-raises-18-million-in-series-a-funding/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">$18 million</a>. </p>



<p>But it wasn’t until the digital marketplace had around 1,000 monthly users making around $1,000 a month that investors started to take notice, Schwartz says.</p>



<p>It took just one early investor to bring Peter Thiel, the co-founder of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/paypal-holdings/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/paypal-holdings/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">PayPal</a> and the first outside investor in Facebook, on board and to introduce Schwartz to Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen.</p><p></p>



<p>“We talk all the time,” the 25-year-old comments on his relationship with Mateen, before whipping out his phone and reading out the most recent motivational text the entrepreneur-turned-investor sent him.</p>



<p>“His advice, to paraphrase, is that ‘good things take time and it’s a pretty long game—a marathon, not a sprint,’” he reads. </p>



<p>“People have a tendency to get a little bit riled up like ‘why isn’t everything working all the sudden’, but in reality, it just takes a pretty long time and if you can persevere through it, his philosophy is that you’ll likely do very well.”</p>



<p>That being said, the young CEO has big ambitions for his company’s success. </p>



<p>“In five years, we want to be making 1 million people sustainable income each month and our version of a sustainable income is $2,000 a month,” he says. </p><p></p>



<p>“And then longer term, we think that everyone in the world is going to be making money on the internet. We think the internet is powerful enough where we could have literally every single person in the world using our platform to make a living.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But ‘human interaction is still really awesome’</h2>



<p>Despite banking on a future where people quit their traditional corporate careers to make money online on their own terms, Schwartz doesn’t follow the same mantra at home; Whop’s 50-strong workforce is mostly expected to commute into the company’s “aesthetic” Brooklyn HQ most days.</p>



<p>And, he doesn’t see how the two are at odds. </p>



<p>“It’s not like a desk job—this is the least desk job job ever and because of that, I don’t think it’s actually attached to making money online,” he added. “People can make money online, while working with people in person.”</p>



<p>In his eyes, young people’s gripe with in-office working isn’t down to wasting time and money commuting or being able to enjoy more work-life balance at home—rather, it’s due to outdated office spaces. </p><p></p>



<p>“They hate the offices they don’t like. But if it’s a Gen Z-ran office, then it’s gonna be a cool office,” he insists while listing the many reasons why Whop’s workspace is superior to your standard vertical tower.</p>



<p>“We’re a shoes-off office, we have a lot of cool snacks, everyone has really nice monitors, and I think it’s just about bringing in the most amazing experience,” he says. “We have a room with a piano, we have a big photo wall, we have a podcast studio, we have a sauna and steam room in the basement.”</p>



<p>“We want to make sure that everyone is in a really pleasant mental state, including myself.”</p></div></div>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Seriously overdue credit card debt is at the highest level in more than a decade, and people 35 and under are struggling more than other age groups <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/off-charts-credit-card-delinquencies-1eb685347b091ff53361e141d80405ad">to pay their bills.</a></span></p><p>The share of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/debt-credit-cards-delinquencies-scores-renters-85aab5e510f531df140f99629a4f60c3">credit card debt</a></span> that’s severely delinquent, defined as being more than 90 days overdue, rose to 10.7% during the first quarter of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A year ago, just 8.2% of credit card debt was severely delinquent.</p><p>If you’re experiencing delinquency, or at risk of it, experts advise speaking with a nonprofit credit counselor and negotiating with your creditors directly. Here’s what you should know:</p><h2>WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I’M AT RISK OF DELINQUENCY?</h2><p>Bruce McClary, senior vice president at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, says that anyone at risk of delinquency should reach out as soon as possible for help from a nonprofit credit counselor, some of whom can be <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nfcc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found through his organization</a></span>. The consultation is free, and a non-judgmental counselor can give guidance towards a long-term solution.</p>
    

<p>Nonprofits can also help create debt management plans that have lower interest rates, no late fees, and a single payment each month, McClary said. These plans may come with maintenance fees, which vary, but the fees are offset by the overall savings on the debt. McClary urged borrowers to be careful of scammers and for-profit debt consolidation companies, which often charge much higher fees than nonprofit organizations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-credit-counseling-en-1451/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a helpful breakdown comparing the two</a></span>.</p>



<p>Martin Lynch, president of the Financial Counseling Association of America, echoed this advice.</p>
    
<p>“Taking that first step and contacting a counselor is difficult for many people,” Lynch said. He emphasized that consumers in debt should do their best to “first, relax,” and then to be as forthcoming as possible about their circumstances with the counselor.</p>
    

<p>“You’ll be talking to someone for free, who will listen to you describe your situation,” he said. “You can share your concerns without being judged for falling into difficulty.” </p><h2>WHAT ABOUT NEGOTIATING WITH CREDITORS?</h2><p>Both Lynch and McClary urge borrowers to reach out directly to credit card companies to negotiate interest rates, fees, and long-term payment plans, noting that it’s in the companies’ best interests if you pay before the debt goes into collections.</p><p>“The best thing to do is to reach out, give an honest assessment of your ability to pay over time, and ask what options are available to you both ‘on and off-the-menu,’” McClary said. This kind of phrasing can give creditors an opening to offer more flexibility, he said. </p><p>McClary and other experts stress that most credit card companies and other lenders have hardship programs available for cases like these. Such options gained visibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, when more companies publicly advertised that consumers facing difficulty may skip or defer payments without penalties. </p><h2>WHY ARE DELINQUENCIES INCREASING?</h2><p>The average annual interest rate on a new credit card is 24.71%, according to LendingTree, the highest since the company began tracking in 2019. That’s in part because the Federal Reserve has raised its key interest rate rate to a 23-year high to combat <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-rates-economy-federal-reserve-biden-d86c5a3a91a61687496f4a985e6bf362">the highest inflation</a></span> in four decades, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. </p>
    

<p>Simultaneously, pandemic-era aid such as stimulus payments, the child tax credit, increased unemployment benefits, and a moratorium on student loan payments has ended. Wage gains haven’t all kept up with inflation, which hits lower-income consumers harder, and rent increases have eaten into savings some consumers may have built up during the early years of the pandemic. </p><p>Silvio Tavares, CEO of VantageScore, a credit score modeling and analytics company, said that delinquencies have now exceeded their pre-pandemic levels, and that <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/affordable-housing-rent-eviction-price-harvard-congress-f5411012e10fa78d0257c137e60c1be3">renters are especially vulnerable to falling behind</a></span>.</p><p>“Younger and less affluent people are experiencing challenges,” he said. “And high interest rates are having an effect.”</p><p>Tavares said the most important thing a borrower can do is to know their credit score and keep up with payments to avoid paying additional interest on revolving balances and debt. He cautioned consumers not to over-extend themselves with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/buy-now-pay-later-holiday-loans-3d66d38295868c03b686577dff85f912">“buy now, pay later” loans</a></span>, which are increasingly available “at every checkout.”</p>
    

<h2>HOW WORRISOME IS THE INCREASE IN DELINQUENCIES?</h2><p>Credit cards only make up about 6.5% of consumer debt, according to a Bank of America Global Research report, but the increase in delinquencies appears to be outpacing <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/jobs-hiring-unemployment-economy-inflation-federal-reserve-d1d73005dbc40b081a555850a44e73d1">income growth</a></span>. </p><p>According to McClary, there’s also likely a large group of consumers paying minimum balances and staying out of delinquency for now but who are too financially stressed to pay their balances in full. A worsening of the economy could push those consumers into severe delinquency, he said.</p><p>On top of increasing credit card delinquencies, retail spending stalled in April. Walmart has said its customers are spending more on necessities and less on discretionary goods. Starbucks lowered its sales expectations, and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mcdonalds-value-meal-deal-bda434c5a939b610a9c1fc09446a38d1">McDonald’s is offering</a></span> more deals as people cut back.</p>

<p>I've read far too many books on ChatGPT and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p>Almost all of them are a waste of time when it comes to applying them to education.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p class="article_paragraph_2"></p>
<p>But, there are five books educators on LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook have recommended. And it's these five books I recommend to every educator exploring AI.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>
<p>I've authored a best-seller for educators on artificial intelligence, "<a href="https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" aria-label="The AI Classroom: The Ultimate Guide to Artificial Intelligence in Education">The AI Classroom: The Ultimate Guide to Artificial Intelligence in Education</a>," and I'm currently working on a practical guide for leaders on AI strategy. Being deeply immersed in the world of AI books for educators, I can confidently say that whether you are new to AI, experimenting with it, or already incorporating it into your practices, these are books worth your time:</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p>


<p>AI for Educators is a readable guide that translates AI through a teacher lens.</p>
<p>It offers practical ideas you can use in class right away. It unlocks powerful ways to streamline teaching, save time and paints a picture of the future our students will face, providing questions you can help them grapple with.</p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" class="inread-active" display-called=""></fbs-ad>
<p>Dana Leonardo, a technology integration educator from Gilbert, Arizona, praises the book for its clarity and practical advice: "Miller's book gets at the heart of what educators need to know about AI, including practical applications, benefits, and cautions. This text brilliantly explains how and why we need to use AI as a tool, while leveraging our most valuable asset—our humanity."</p>








<p>Salman Khan, the visionary behind Khan Academy, explores how AI and GPT technology will transform learning.</p>
<p>Khan offers a road map for teachers, parents and students to navigate this exciting new world. Beyond technology, Khan delves into the ethical and social implications of AI, providing insights on how administrators, guidance counselors and hiring managers can harness AI to build a more accessible education system.</p>

<p>Kevin Soli, a homeschooling parent from Papua New Guinea, highlights the book's value: "I homeschool my children so this book is very encouraging for me as a parent. ChatGPT is like your tech-buddy—not just to answer your prompts but to prompt you too, asking probing questions that challenge assumptions, clarify concepts and encourage deeper dialogue."</p>

<p>Furze explores the opportunities and challenges of AI in education.</p>
<p>He offers insights into its workings and ethical considerations. The book guides readers through the construction and ethics of generative AI, navigates policy landscapes and provides practical strategies. It has detailed sections on text and image generation and preparations for multimodal technologies like video, audio and 3D generation.</p>
<p>Al Kingsley, chair of Hampton Academies Trust in the UK, emphasizes the book’s approach: “This is an excellent book. It’s highly accessible, evidence informed and structured to step you through AI basics, ethics and assessment.”</p>

Edward Watson</h2>
<p>Bowen and Watson present emerging and powerful research on the seismic changes AI is already creating in schools and the workplace, providing invaluable insights into what AI can accomplish in the classroom and beyond.</p>
<p>Dr. Heather M. Brown, an instructional designer from Virginia, shared, “The book resonates with me because it adopts a holistic view of AI's potential, challenging us to embrace this revolution as an opportunity to reimagine education.”</p>

<p>The key to successfully integrating any digital tool, according to Clark, is to focus on the deep learning and masterful pedagogy teachers can achieve amidst educational shifts.</p>
<p><em>The AI Infused Classroom</em> emphasizes that AI will bring about changes, but it does not replace the need for well-trained and highly qualified teachers in the classroom. Students need educators’ guidance now more than ever to prepare for the world of AI. With the right mindset, questions and strategies, educators can use AI to create and broaden meaningful learning experiences for every student.</p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Bonus</h2>
<p><a href="https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" aria-label="The AI Classroom">The AI Classroom</a> and most of the books listed above tackle the issues of ethics and equity in AI education. But educators always welcome more guidance on this topic. That's why I’m looking forward to the upcoming book, "The Promises and Perils of AI in Education" by Ken Shelton and Dee Lanier. It’s not published yet, but it should be available soon.</p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">One Reminder Before You Go</h2>
<p>Reading is great, but applying what you read is better.</p>
<p>Reading books on AI in education feels productive. And it is! Until a certain point. Then, it turns into procrastination disguised as "research." How do you avoid falling into this trap?</p>
<p>Easy—start integrating AI into your educational practices every day.</p>

That trajectory will see the industry reach close to $2 trillion, indicating it's not too late to invest.</p><p>AI stocks have captivated Wall Street over the last year, with bullish investors boosting the <strong>Nasdaq Composite</strong> by 27% since last June.

According to Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company's Xeon 6 processors have improved performance and power efficiency for intensive workloads compared to the previous generation.</p><p>In the same presentation, Intel announced the cost of its Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, which is priced lower than similar products from its competitors. AI chips have become costly, especially from market leaders like Nvidia. If Intel can offer competitive price to performance, it could attract more clients to its AI offerings and take market share from Nvidia.</p><p>Besides new chips, Intel is setting itself apart from the competition by heavily investing in manufacturing. It's building chip plants throughout the U.S., with Gelsinger recently saying its Ohio location would be the "AI systems fab for the nation."</p><p>Intel has an exciting outlook in AI, both in chip design and manufacturing. The company is an attractive long-term prospect that could deliver significant gains as it expands its business.</p><h2>Advanced Micro Devices</h2><p>Like Intel, AMD is working hard to match Nvidia in AI. CEO Lisa Su told reporters at the Computex technology trade show in Taipei this month, "AI is clearly our No. 1 priority as a company, and we have really harnessed all of the development capability within the company to do that."</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Last year, the company announced new AI <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/g/gpu/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=aba53184-b9c4-43d3-869c-9f909189296d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:graphics processing units (GPUs);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="0">graphics processing units (GPUs)</a> and unveiled its latest AI chip, the MI325X accelerator, this month. The new chip will be available in the fourth quarter of 2024, and the company is following Nvidia's recent decision to shift to annual chip updates rather than releasing upgrades every two years, as was previously done.</p><p>At the same conference, AMD announced its MI350 series of chips, which will launch in 2025 and be based on an entirely new architecture. AMD has said the new chip will perform 35 times better in inference, granting it significantly improved AI capabilities.</p><p>AMD still has a long way to go before making a significant dent in Nvidia's AI market share, but recent earnings show it could be on the right track. In the first quarter of 2024, the company's AI-driven data center segment posted revenue growth of 80% year over year thanks to increased GPU sales.</p><h2>Is Intel or AMD the better AI stock?</h2><p>Intel and AMD are in steep competition with each other and market leader Nvidia in AI. The industry's vast potential and soaring chip demand indicate there could be room for each of these companies to find their niche and profit from the generative technology.</p><p>However, Nvidia's spot at the top of the market and Intel's venture into manufacturing make it feel like these companies could have more secure positions in AI over the long term than AMD. The chart below indicates that Intel is trading at a far better value than both companies, with the lowest forward-price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio among the three most prominent chipmakers.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">AMD PE Ratio (Forward) Chart</figcaption></p></figure><p>Given its recent AI chip releases and expansion into manufacturing, Intel's stock is the better choice over AMD and a screaming buy right now for long-term investors.</p><h2>Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?</h2><p>Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:</p><p>The <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the <strong><a href="https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=f86c51be-fde6-40b4-a08a-545813ffe5f1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-foolcom-sa-bbn-dyn%3Faid%3D8867%26amp%253Bsource%3Disaeditxt0010895%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D13885&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=aba53184-b9c4-43d3-869c-9f909189296d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 best stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

<ol>
<li>Kyle Rice, a paramedic and father of two, commutes from his home in Delaware to Manhattan every day, traveling 4 states and 2 hours one way, to work in Manhattan.</li>
<li>Rice's motivation for the long commute is the significant pay raise he received for his job in Manhattan, earning "Manhattan money" while living in Delaware with a lower cost of living.</li>
<li>The cost of the commute is around $170 to $200 roundtrip, which Rice considers to be cost-effective due to the significant pay raise.</li>
<li>Rice recognizes that the commute can be unreliable, with potential delays, rising ticket costs, and cancelations, but he believes the financial benefits outweigh the inconveniences.</li>
<li>Rice's decision to super commute is a common strategy for those who want to take advantage of higher salaries in cities like New York City while maintaining a lower cost of living in a nearby state.</li>

As a reminder, <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/ex-law-professor-sues-former-students-for-108m-over-sexual-harassment-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wright isn’t denying that he slept with his 1L students</a>, but claims that they defamed him when they said they found themselves in these years-long sexual engagements with their professor because he leveraged his influence to advance their careers and, relatedly, could withdraw that influence when they weren’t compliant.</p>
<p>He says this cost him millions because clients abandoned his private sector venture when the <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/sexual-harassment-allegations-mount-against-former-ftc-commissioner-law-professor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women told their story</a> to <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1710427" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Law360</a>. As though clients were cool with the part about using seating charts as “Analog Tinder” — which he does NOT claim is false — but that they drew the line at the idea that the women felt they were trapped in the relationships because of his influence. Not knowing Wright’s client base, I’d say they were probably more concerned with the bit <em>that he’s conceding is true</em>.</p>
<p id="atl-div-id-for-top-300x250-mobile" class="ad--mobile">
</p><p>Not to mention that the latter claim seems like the defendants’ opinion and thus non-actionable, but here we are.</p>
<p>Kirkland &amp; Ellis partner Elyse Dorsey, one of the defendants along with Freshfields counsel Angela Landry, discussed the ruling on social media. Another aspect of the ruling is that the case will use statements made during the George Mason University Title IX process against the defendants with the court deciding that those aren’t “reasonably” protected.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/ElyseOnLife/status/1796692893249241184"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1065057" src="https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-04-at-1.49.40%E2%80%AFPM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-04 at 1.49.40 PM"></a></p>
<p id="atl-div-id-for-middle-300x250-mobile" class="ad-story-inline ad--mobile">
</p><p>It would be one thing if the subject of a Title IX complaint categorically denied the accusation and pursued a defendant for defamation, but Wright’s argument is that sleeping with his students was all cool because there was no policy against it at the time. That seems like a complaint he can maybe raise <em>against the school</em>, not the basis of a libel claim against the former students.</p>
<p>Though lawsuits against the accusers serve another purpose that doesn’t necessarily require them to be $108 million winners…</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/ElyseOnLife/status/1796694884583092374"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1065087" src="https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-04-at-2.23.03%E2%80%AFPM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-04 at 2.23.03 PM"></a></p>
<p>Those targeted by harassment keep silent too often in the best of circumstances. When courts decline to invoke anti-SLAPP laws and force victims to go through the costly legal process, it throws more upon the legal scaffolding that allows perpetrators to hold the threat of protracted litigation over anyone willing to stand up to them. Not every defendant is going to be a senior Biglaw attorney and precedents like these put more pressure on the accuser to cave or stay quiet in the first place.</p>
<p>The trial is on target for March of next year.</p>

																										<p>The top U.S. safety regulator has officially launched more relaxed fuel economy standards, following a similar move from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made a few months ago.</p>

<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has officially announced new fuel standards requiring an average fleet fuel economy of 50.4 mpg by 2031 for the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules, as detailed in a report from <a href="https://www.autonews.com/regulation-safety/504-mpg-cafe-standard-new-vehicles-2031-finalized" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Automotive News</i></a>. The new standard is down from the original requirement, which stated that vehicles and light trucks to reach a fuel economy average of 58 mpg by 2032.</p>
<p>In addition, the new standards require just a 2 percent improvement in fuel efficiency per year for cars, while light trucks will need to see a 4 percent improvement between the 2027 and 2032 model years.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The NHTSA rule shift comes as a means to accommodate and comply with recent standard changes from the EPA, which doesn’t require as many <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/u-s-bev-sales-milestone-2023-state-adoption-rates/">electric vehicles (EVs) sold</a> as the previous rules. Under the <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/biden-administration-pulls-back-rule-ev-mileage-rating/">new EPA rules, which went into effect in March</a>, EVs must now make up between 30 and 56 percent of automakers’ light-vehicle sales between 2030 and 2032, coming down from the previous proposal of reaching 67 percent by 2032.</p>
<p>The EPA is typically able to set stricter standards than the NHTSA, given that the latter agency is not allowed to use the fuel economy of EVs when determining maximum possible standards for a given year, though it does have to use them when figuring out compliance.</p>
<p>“Because we have a market that has an increasing number of electric vehicles, it just becomes more difficult for NHTSA to set standards that are as strong as EPA’s emission standards,” said Chris Harto, Consumer Reports Senior Policy Analyst.</p>
<p>The Alliance for Automotive Innovation has argued that the newly revised standards bring the NHTSA’s rules into alignment with those from the EPA.</p>
<p>“Should an automaker be considered in violation of CAFE rules (and subject to billions of dollars in civil penalties) if it complies with the standards established by EPA’s new greenhouse gas rules? No, they shouldn’t,” said alliance CEO John Bozzella. “And … at first glance, the final CAFE rule seems to say as much!”</p>
<p>The alliance also notes that as the automotive industry moves toward EVs, fuel economy standards will become increasingly irrelevant.</p>
<p>“CAFE’s a relic of the 1970s — a policy to promote energy conservation and energy independence by making internal combustion vehicles more efficient,” Bozzella adds. “But those vehicles are already very efficient. And EVs? They don’t combust anything. They don’t even have a tailpipe.”</p>
<p>The NHTSA says the new regulations were developed alongside the EPA, with the two agencies working in tandem to “optimize the effectiveness of its standards while minimizing compliance costs.”</p>

<p>(WJW) — <a href="http://fox8.com/tag/red-lobster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Lobster</a> plans to close eight Ohio locations, including three in Northeast Ohio, amid its Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring, court filings show.</p>



<p>The seafood restaurant chain <a href="https://www.redlobster.com/news-press/press/2024/05/19/red_lobster-files-voluntary-chapter-11-petitions-to-strengthen-financial-position-and-maximize-value-for-stakeholders/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.redlobster.com/news-press/press/2024/05/19/red_lobster-files-voluntary-chapter-11-petitions-to-strengthen-financial-position-and-maximize-value-for-stakeholders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a news release last month</a> announced it would sell off “substantially all of its assets” as it looks to streamline following financial losses.</p>



<p>In all, nearly 100 locations across the country may shut down if the company can’t renegotiate their leases. </p>



<p>According to bankruptcy court filings in Florida, Red Lobster has rejected unexpired leases at eight of its Ohio locations:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Columbus</strong>: 1691 Dublin-Granville Road</li>



<li><strong>Dayton</strong>: 6500 Miller Lane</li>



<li><strong>Findlay</strong>: 2340 Tiffin Ave.</li>



<li><strong>Maumee</strong>: 1422 Reynolds Road</li>



<li><strong>New Philadelphia</strong>: 255 Graff Road SE</li>



<li><strong>Parma</strong>: 7607 Day Drive</li>



<li><strong>Strongsville</strong>: 17227 Southpark Center</li>



<li><strong>Toledo</strong>: 4990 Monroe St.</li>
</ul>



<p>Filings show the restaurant chain has also rejected the lease for its former Orange Village location at 3655 Orange Place, which closed in 2022 after 45 years, according to reports.</p>



<p>The company closed dozens of locations last month before filing for bankruptcy, and planned to auction off those eateries’ kitchen equipment and furniture, <a href="https://fox8.com/news/red-lobster-is-closing-dozens-of-restaurants-and-auctioning-off-furniture-equipment/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fox8.com/news/red-lobster-is-closing-dozens-of-restaurants-and-auctioning-off-furniture-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexstar reported</a>.</p>





<p>The company endured an executive shakeup between 2021 and 2022. Though the addition of the company’s “Ultimate Endless Shrimp” limited special to its regular menu drove business in 2023, it ultimately backfired, leading to an $11 million operating loss in one quarter, <a href="https://fox8.com/news/red-lobster-is-closing-dozens-of-restaurants-and-auctioning-off-furniture-equipment/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fox8.com/news/red-lobster-is-closing-dozens-of-restaurants-and-auctioning-off-furniture-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexstar reported</a>.</p>



<p>Several other Northeast Ohio locations are still open, according to its website, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Akron</strong>: 3901 Medina Road</li>



<li><strong>Ashtabula</strong>: 3013 N. Ridge Road E</li>



<li><strong>Canton</strong>: 4600 Belden Village St. NW</li>



<li><strong>Cuyahoga Falls</strong>: 1090 Graham Road</li>



<li><strong>Elyria</strong>: 6935 Midway Mall Blvd.</li>



<li><strong>Mansfield</strong>: 2322 W. 4th St.</li>



<li><strong>Mentor</strong>: 7744 Reynolds Road</li>



<li><strong>North Olmsted</strong>: 25615 Brookpark Road</li>



<li><strong>Sandusky</strong>: 4016 Milan Road</li>



<li><strong>Wooster</strong>: 3805 Burbank Road</li>



<li><strong>Youngstown</strong>: 1410 Boardman-Poland Road</li>
</ul>
