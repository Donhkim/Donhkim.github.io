<p>After some persuasion from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the CEO of Novo Nordisk will testify before lawmakers later this year on the "outrageously high cost" of the company's diabetes and weight-loss drugs—Ozempic and Wegovy—in the US.</p>
<p></p><p class="teads-adCall"></p><p>CEO Lars Jørgensen </p><a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-announces-ceo-of-novo-nordisk-to-voluntarily-testify-before-help-committee/">will appear</a><p> before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), which is chaired by Sanders, in early September. The agreement came after a conversation with Sanders in which the CEO reportedly "reconsidered his position" and agreed to testify voluntarily. As such, Sanders has canceled a vote scheduled for </p><a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/chair/newsroom/press/news-chairman-sanders-announces-help-committee-vote-to-subpoena-novo-nordisk-inc-president">June 18 on whether to subpoena Novo Nordisk</a><p> to discuss its US prices, which are considerably higher than those of other countries.
</p><p>The independent lawmaker has been working for months to pressure Novo Nordisk into lowering its prices and appearing before the committee. In April, Sanders <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Letter-from-Sen.-Bernard-Sanders-to-Novo-Nordisk.pdf">sent Jørgensen a letter</a> announcing an investigation into the prices and included a lengthy set of information requests. In May, the committee's investigation released a report suggesting that Novo Nordisk's current pricing threatens to "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/outrageously-priced-weight-loss-drugs-could-bankrupt-us-health-care/">bankrupt our entire health care system</a>."</p>
<p>Sanders has repeatedly hammered not only the high prices of Novo Nordisk's two blockbuster drugs but also the huge disparity between US prices and those in other countries.</p>
<h2>Up to 15x more in the US</h2>
<p>"Novo Nordisk currently charges Americans with type 2 diabetes $969 a month for Ozempic, while this same exact drug can be purchased for just $155 in Canada and just $59 in Germany," Sanders wrote in April. "Novo Nordisk also charges Americans with obesity $1,349 a month for Wegovy, while this same exact product can be purchased for just $140 in Germany and $92 in the United Kingdom."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Yale researchers, meanwhile, published a study in JAMA in March estimating that both drugs could be manufactured <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2816824">for less than $5</a>.</p>
<p>In May, Novo Nordisk responded with a letter to Sanders, arguing that blame for high prices in the US lies with the country's complex health system and with middle managers who take cuts, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-28/novo-blames-us-health-system-after-sanders-wegovy-criticism">Bloomberg</a>. Novo Nordisk said in the letter that it is prepared to address "systemic issues so that everyone who can benefit from its medicines is able to get them," the outlet reported. The company also said it has spent over $10 billion on research and development to bring Wegovy and Ozempic to the market.</p>
<p>Still, that number is small in comparison to the projected revenue from the drugs. Bloomberg noted that analysts estimate that Novo Nordisk will make $27 billion from the two drugs this year alone. The May analysis by the HELP committee found that if just half of the adults in the US with obesity start taking a new weight-loss drug, such as Wegovy, the collective cost would be around $411 billion per year. Another report by the Congressional Budget Office found that the drugs' costs are so high that they will not be offset by any financial gains from improved health outcomes.</p>
<p>"The Committee looks forward to Mr. Jørgensen explaining why Americans are paying up to 10 or 15 times more for these medications than people in other countries," Sanders said last week.</p>

Eli Lilly late last month also said it would <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/24/eli-lilly-invests-to-increase-mounjaro-zepbound-supply.html">invest another $5.3 billion</a> in its manufacturing plant in Lebanon, Indiana. </p><p>Those facilities add to the company’s “existing, very large” manufacturing footprint across the U.S. and Europe, Ashkenazi said. Since 2020, Eli Lilly has spent more than $18 billion to build, expand and purchase manufacturing plants in those regions, the company said in May.</p><p>Ashkenazi noted that Eli Lilly is also tackling another barrier to patient access: limited insurance coverage for weight loss drugs in the U.S. </p><p>Some employers and other health plans are still reluctant to cover GLP-1s for weight loss due to their hefty price tags, which they say could significantly strain their budgets. Insurers also have other questions, such as how long patients actually stay on the treatments. </p><p>Still, Ashkenazi said coverage of Zepbound by U.S. commercial insurers is improving, with about 67% commercial coverage as of April 1. Eli Lilly is working to build that access for the remainder of the patients, she noted. </p><p>“It’s not enough to have a highly efficacious, safe drug that can truly change people’s healthcare – but also make it accessible,” Ashkenazi said. </p><p>She also hopes that patients enrolled in the federal Medicare program will eventually see increased coverage for weight loss drugs as Eli Lilly and other drugmakers demonstrate their ability to treat a wide range of obesity-related conditions. </p><p>Eli Lilly is studying tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro, in patients with obesity and fatty liver disease, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease and heart failure, among other health conditions. </p><p>Under <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/medicare-can-cover-weight-loss-drugs-if-used-for-added-health-benefit.html">new guidance </a>issued in March, Medicare Part D plans can cover obesity treatments that receive regulatory approval for an additional health benefit. Medicare prescription drug plans administered by private insurers, known as Part D, currently cannot cover those drugs for weight loss alone.</p><p>A bigger issue at hand is a long-held misconception that obesity is a “lifestyle choice” rather than a chronic disease, according to Ashkenazi.</p><p>Eli Lilly is trying to change that. </p><p>“Our goal is to ensure that society, the health-care system and patients themselves actually view this and understand that it is a chronic disease…and therefore should be treated as such,” Ashkenazi said. </p></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The IRS plans to end a tax loophole that allows wealthy taxpayers to avoid paying taxes by shifting assets among related parties, which could raise $50 billion in revenue over the next decade.</li>
<li>The proposed rule and guidance aims to stop "partnership basis shifting", a process by which businesses or individuals can avoid paying taxes by moving assets among related parties.</li>
<li>The Treasury Department says that the practice of partnership basis shifting has an estimated $160 billion gap between what the top 1% of earners likely owe in taxes and what they pay.</li>
<li>The IRS commissioner, Danny Werfel, stated that the tax shelters allow wealthy taxpayers to avoid paying what they owe, and that the additional funding provided through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act has enabled increased oversight and greater awareness of the practice.</li>
<li>The IRS has reported a significant increase in filings for large pass-through businesses used for the type of tax avoidance, increasing 70% from 174,100 in 2010 to 297,400 in 2019, while audit rates for these businesses fell from 3.8% to 0.1% in the same time frame.</li>

featured an AI voice responding to customer orders, had been tested as part of a deal between McDonald’s and IBM that began in 2021.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">McDonald’s gave no public reason for ending its test run, <a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/mcdonalds-ending-its-drive-thru-ai-test" data-link-name="in body link">according to Restaurant Business</a>, telling franchises that it would shut down the technology on 26 July.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">A spokesperson for McDonald’s told the publication that it would decide its plans for automated orders by the end of the year, but stressed that “a voice-ordering solution for drive-thru will be part of our restaurants’ future”.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Fast-food chains have taken an immense interest in integrating generative AI into their systems in recent years. Along with McDonald’s, a range of other companies including Wendy’s, Hardee’s, Carl’s Jr, and Del Taco all use AI technology at their drive-thrus. Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell and KFC, announced earlier this year that it was instituting <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/taco-bell-and-pizza-hut-are-going-ai-first-yums-new-tech-chief-says-2f423d5e" data-link-name="in body link">an “AI-first mentality”</a> in its fast-food restaurants.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The fast-food industry’s growing affinity for AI comes as companies see the technology as a means of replacing human workers to reduce rising labor costs. After California passed a new mandatory minimum wage law for fast-food workers, businesses <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-05-01/ai-powered-drive-thru-fast-food-operators-20-minimum-wage-california-carls-el-pollo-loco" data-link-name="in body link">rushed towards implementing AI technologies</a> that could perform tasks such as taking customer orders.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">While companies have touted AI as the future of the fast-food industry, these technologies have also resulted in viral videos and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktokers-show-failures-with-mcdonalds-drive-thru-ai-robots-2023-2" data-link-name="in body link">media coverage</a> documenting when they get orders wrong. McDonald’s drive-thru AI failures circulated on TikTok last year after several videos purported to show the system adding erroneous items like butter packets or multiplying how many items were ordered.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Another video showed two women uncontrollably laughing and calling out for the system to stop adding items to their order as it appeared to put hundreds of dollars worth of McNuggets on their tab.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">While automated systems have faced backlash for misunderstanding customer orders, some have also come under scrutiny for relying on outsourced human labor to make them run. The company Presto Automation Inc, which provides AI services for fast-food chains, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-07/ai-fast-food-drive-thrus-need-human-workers-70-of-time?sref=fqqmZ8gi" data-link-name="in body link">revealed in an SEC filing last year</a> that it employs workers in countries including the Philippines to get involved in customer interactions about 70% of the time.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">In addition to drive-thru orders, some <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/restaurant-technology/2024/yum-brands-doubles-tech-spending-expands-use-of-generative-ai/" data-link-name="in body link">companies have started to explore</a> how generative AI could be used to develop digital chatbots on their apps or utilize image-recognition to determine wait times.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">McDonald’s struck a deal with Google in December of last year to create a chatbot called “Ask Pickles” that would be able to train employees on issues such as how to clean restaurant equipment. The companies also agreed to work on other potential uses for generative AI, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-06/mcdonald-s-mcd-getting-ai-chatbot-from-google-googl-for-restaurant-crew?sref=fqqmZ8gi" data-link-name="in body link">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed a lawsuit against Adobe, alleging that the company deceives consumers by hiding the early-termination fee and making it difficult to cancel subscriptions.</li>
<li>The DOJ claims that Adobe enrolls consumers in the "annual paid monthly" subscription plan without clearly disclosing important plan terms, and only discloses the early-termination fees when subscribers try to cancel.</li>
<li>The complaint also states that Adobe traps consumers in subscriptions they no longer want by using the early-termination fee as a "powerful retention tool" and making the cancellation process complicated and difficult.</li>
<li>Adobe has denied the allegations, stating that it prioritizes customer experience and is transparent about the terms and conditions of its subscription agreements. The company claims that it has a simple cancellation process.</li>
<li>The DOJ is seeking injunctive relief, civil penalties, and other relief against Adobe, alleging that the company has violated federal laws designed to protect consumers.</li>

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">The U.S. Department of Justice has <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/adobe_complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> against Adobe alleging that the company deceives consumers by hiding the early-termination fee and making it difficult for people to cancel their subscriptions.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In the complaint filed on Monday, the DOJ wrote that “Adobe has harmed consumers by enrolling them in its default, most lucrative subscription plan without clearly disclosing important plan terms.”</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The government says Adobe pushed consumers toward the “annual paid monthly” subscription without informing them that canceling the plan in the first year would cost hundreds of dollars.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Adobe only discloses the early-termination fees when subscribers attempt to cancel, and turns the early-termination fee into a “powerful retention tool” by trapping consumers in subscriptions that they no longer want, the complaint says.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“During enrollment, Adobe hides material terms of its APM plan in fine print and behind option textboxes and hyperlinks, proving disclosures that are designed to go unnoticed and that most consumers never see,” according to the complaint. “Adobe then deters cancellations by employing an onerous and complicated cancellation process.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Adobe says it plans to refute the claims in court. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“Subscription services are convenient, flexible and cost effective to allow users to choose the plan that best fits their needs, timeline and budget,” said Adobe’s General Counsel and Chief Trust Officer Dana Rao, in a statement. “Our priority is to always ensure our customers have a positive experience. We are transparent with the terms and conditions of our subscription agreements and have a simple cancellation process.”</p>
<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">
</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The DOJ’s complaint says Adobe has violated federal laws designed to protect consumers. The government is seeking “injunctive relief, civil penalties, equitable monetary relief, as well as other relief.”</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Adobe shifted to a subscription model in 2012 and started requiring consumers to pay for access to the company’s software on a recurring basis. In the past, users could access the company’s software after paying a one-time fee. Subscriptions account for most of the company’s revenue, the Federal Trade Commission notes.</p>

<li>The UK market's recovery is attributed to analysts, who say the French market has slumped due to uncertainty surrounding the French presidential election and snap election called by President Emmanuel Macron.</li>
<li>The French market's decline is attributed to investors' dislike of uncertainty, and the snap election has raised questions about the financial implications of the new government's policies.</li>
<li>Analysts believe that the Labour party's perceived profligacy and unbalanced budget may also be contributing to the market's uncertainty, as investors are skeptical of the government's ability to fund its pledges.</li>

Here's what experts say to do.</p><h3><strong>Look at your finances</strong></h3><p>The best place to start is to look at your finances. How much do you have that you can comfortably deposit into a CD without stressing your budget?</p><p>"I would start with looking at what you have saved and could potentially invest," says Brittany Pedersen, director of deposit and payment operations at Georgia's Own Credit Union. "You can review the previous year to see how often you needed to draw on saved funds and any life events that affected you financially. Then consider any possible upcoming expenses — vacations, home repairs, car repairs, etc. — and make sure that you are still leaving enough funds liquid to cover those unexpected costs."</p>

    </p>
<p>Financial pros generally recommend having at least six months of expenses <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/best-places-to-keep-your-emergency-fund/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">in an emergency fund</a></span>, so make sure you have that in place before investing any extra cash. </p><p>"Before deciding on a number first make sure you have your fast cash or emergency fund set up," says Cynthia Campos Delgado, founder and financial advisor at Campos Wealth Management. "Leave that where you can access it without incurring a penalty, then anything above that fund, you can determine how much you are comfortable not touching for an extended period and put it into a CD."</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhow-much-money-should-you-deposit-in-a-cd-now-heres-what-experts-say&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhow-much-money-should-you-deposit-in-a-cd-now-heres-what-experts-say%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=f6e6e19c-bcbf-47fd-8313-12207f0fe813" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Explore today's top CD accounts and find the right one for you here</a>.</p><h3><strong>Think ahead </strong></h3><p>You should also look toward the future when determining what to deposit in your CD account.

You should also have an idea of what you'll use the eventual <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-much-interest-would-a-10000-cd-earn-in-3-years/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">CD earnings</a></span> for — and when you'll need them.</p>

<p>"There is no right or wrong amount to deposit into a CD, it just depends on the money you have available and when you plan to use it," says Kendall Meade, financial planner at SoFi. "Someone saving for a house down payment may put $50,000 into a CD, whereas someone just using it for a portion of their emergency savings may only put $10,000."</p><p>Knowing your end goal for the money also helps you avoid <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cd-early-withdrawal-penalties-what-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">early withdrawal penalties</a></span>, which many CDs come with.</p><p>"The money you're putting into the CD should be an amount you don't need to touch for the duration of the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cd-terms-everything-to-know/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">term</a></span>," Ben McLaughlin, president of saving platform Raisin, says. </p><h3><strong>Don't stretch too thin</strong></h3><p>Whatever you do, don't push your financial limits just to put more money in your CD. Not only could this make paying bills and dealing with unexpected expenses challenging, but it could also force you <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-does-it-make-sense-to-withdraw-early-from-a-cd/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">to withdraw funds early</a></span> if you're in a pinch. Again, this would come with an early withdrawal penalty.</p><p>"It may be more beneficial to go with a slightly lower amount you don't need access to for the duration of the product rather than stretching yourself to put more money in the CD and risk incurring a penalty if you need your money earlier than expected," McLaughlin says. "Take the extra time to crunch the numbers and see what situation will serve you best." </p><h3><strong>Consider laddering</strong></h3><p>If you're not 100% sure when you'll need the funds, you can <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-cd-laddering/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">build a CD ladder</a></span> instead of pouring all your funds into a single CD account.</p><p>This strategy requires you to open several CDs, all with different maturity lengths. Then, when the first one matures, you can decide if you want to withdraw the funds or roll them into a new CD to use at a later date. </p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'>
    </p>
<p>"If you are laddering, I would recommend putting the same amount in each of the accounts," Pederson says. "This will ensure that as they renew, you have access to a similar amount of funds. </p><p>Another strategy is to put a larger amount in your longest-term CD, as this will typically have the highest rate. This can be smart "if you think rates may drop soon," McLaughlin says, as it locks in that high rate for longer. </p><p>"Or, if you think you may need access to some of your funds sooner rather than later, you can put a larger amount of money into a product with a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-you-should-open-a-1-year-cd-this-june/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">shorter term</a></span>," McLaughlin says. </p><h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>The Federal Reserve is largely expected <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/interest-rate-federal-reserve-neel-kashkari/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">to cut interest rates</a></span> later this year, which could mean lower rates on CDs are on the horizon. If you want to take advantage of today's higher rates, consider <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/best-cds-to-open-for-june-2024-up-to-5-30/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">opening your account</a></span> soon. According to <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the CME FedWatch Tool</a>, rate cuts could come as soon as September.</p><p>And if you're not sure how much to put into your account, talk to a financial advisor or investment professional. They can help you make the right choice for your budget and goals.</p>

<p>A previously announced joint venture between China’s Leapmotor and <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/stellantis/">Stellantis</a> has begun building EVs in Europe ahead of local deliveries targeted this fall.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leapmotor-europe">Leapmotor Europe</h2>



<p>Analysts at <em>Jefferies</em> have cited Leapmotor’s management in confirming that T03 production is underway in Europe at Stellantis’ Tychy plant in Poland. Tychy currently houses Fiat and Chrysler production but is now assembling units of Leapmotor’s T03 compact BEV before it hits local markets later this year.</p>



<p><em>Reuters</em> reported that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-leapmotor-started-ev-production-stellantis-polish-plant-jefferies-says-2024-06-17/">Stellantis chose Tychy</a> as the new home to Leapmotor production in Europe for cost-saving reasons. Leapmotor management told <em>Jeffries</em> that manufacturing costs at Tychy equate to about 400-500 euros ($429-$536) per BEV, similar to build prices in China (but without potential tariffs). Either way, it’s significantly more cost-effective than the estimated price of around 1,000 euros ($1,072) per unit to build the T03s at Stellantis’ plant in Italy.</p>



<p>The report also states that T03 will be followed by the production of Leapmotor’s A12 SUV, which is targeted to begin in Q1 2025. The Chinese automaker has also started to prepare localized component production to support BEV builds overseas.</p>



<p>Leapmotor also intends to sell its new C10 SUV in Europe, but it will build those EVs in China and export them. The previously mentioned tariffs may throw a financial wrench in those plans, but Leapmotor has a potential Plan B in Stellantis through the joint venture.</p>



<p>Mass production of the T03 in Poland remains on schedule to begin in September ahead of first deliveries. </p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/acquisitions/2024/synapse-saga-emphasizes-tangled-web-between-fintechs-middlemen-and-sponsor-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Synapse bankruptcy saga</a> continues to rock the BaaS world, marked by last week’s <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/legal/2024/synapse-bankruptcy-trustee-finds-85-million-dollar-shortfall-amid-tangled-web-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revelation of $85 million in missing funds</a>. The plot thickened last week when former CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sankaet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sankaet Pathak</a> disclosed in bankruptcy court that <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/legal/2024/synapses-specter-of-commingled-funds-points-to-issues-in-fintech-baas-governance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funds were commingled</a>, leaving the task of determining rightful ownership and the timeline for restitution a daunting challenge. There’s no money, at least at the moment, to hire a forensic accountant.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qedinvestors.com/team/amias-gerety" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amias Gerety</a>, a partner at QED Investors, shared his insights on the case recently with PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster in the “What’s Next in Payments” series, emphasizing that the issues at Synapse were evident long before the current crisis. “If something serious has gone wrong, it’s because many different things went wrong first,” Gerety remarked, echoing a lesson he imparts to his children.</p>
<p>Despite the turmoil, Gerety cautioned against viewing this as a systemic failure of banking or FinTech sectors. Instead, he likened the situation to a broken ATM — eventually, things will be set right. Gerety expressed confidence in bankruptcy trustee <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/about/jelena-mcwilliams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jelena McWilliams</a>, formerly of the FDIC, to recover a significant portion of what is owed to customers and creditors by meticulously tracing the chain of liability.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Synapse saga is a tale of operational issues — systems did not do what they were designed to do.  Then there’s the fraud question, which has yet to be answered: was an individual or group of individuals in effect lying about or pilfering other people’s funds? And structural issues are also reflected in the $85 million that’s been so difficult to pinpoint.</p>
<p>“If you want your business to survive, you have to figure all this out,” said Gerety. The FinTechs involved in the case — such as neobanks Copper and Juno — are following the money to see if they can stay in business. Evolve and other banks in the case have $180 million in cash invested.</p>
<p>“That’s a big gap,” said Gerety. He noted that 66 cents on the proverbial dollar is a significant amount, but the more important question is finding out where the money is being kept. It’s still common practice in the banking-as-a-service space for those platforms to have only one account at the bank they’ve partnered with. Subledgers bring cash to and from end customers’ accounts.</p>
<p>Other firms, such as Treasury Prime, where Gerety sits on the board, make sure that every FinTech that works with a bank has an FBO account dedicated to that FinTech with that bank. There’s no possibility of commingling funds at this Synapse competitor.</p>
<p>“We keep deposit type accounts,” said Gerety, “that are passed through to the bank and that are separate from payment and settlement accounts. This is very messy and it’s not good for the industry … but for those of us who have been paying close attention, the news that Synapse is going out of business comes as a relief.”</p>
<p>The result, he believes, is that we’ll see the consolidation of stronger BaaS players, and regulators are going to step in to clarify new structures and operational mandates for banks, FinTechs and middleware firms.</p>
<h2>Warning Signs</h2>
<p>There were some warning signs that all was not right at Synapse, he said. Nearly two years ago, reports surfaced that there was roughly $13 million in what he termed “reconciliation challenges” tied to FBO accounts that held customer funds at Evolve. However, former FDIC chair Jelena McWilliams told the Synapse bankruptcy hearing on June 7 that the exact amount of the Evolve-Synapse reconciliation issues is not clear, and could be much higher.</p>
<p>“Why wasn’t this flagged as an issue? Where was the board?” Gerety asked rhetorically? “Where were the investors? Where was the CFO saying, ‘hey, wait, there’s something here we need to address’?”</p>
<p>“It’s very clear in hindsight that Synapse was not executing on its duty to reconcile dollars.”  There were, in addition, lawsuits stretching back to 2019 against Pathak alleging discrimination and harassment. “Now, that’s not related to reconciliation,” he told Webster, “But, boy that sounds like a company that’s not well-run. Reconciliation is not optional. You are dealing with other people’s money, and that carries with it what should be a sacrosanct obligation to know where that money is, at least at the end of every day.”</p>
<p>None of that’s to say that doing so is a simple endeavor. Payments, of course, are complicated, and different payments — debit, credit, ACH — operate on different timeframes in terms of settlements (and chargebacks muddy the picture). There can be fraud in the mix too.</p>
<p>“And that means you’ve got to chase it down,” said Gerety, who added that “it may take a day, or two days — but you’ve got to know, to the penny, what dollars are being chased at all times.”</p>
<p>The $13 million in unreconciled accounts, he said, showed that Synapse’s claims about “auto reconciliation” were faulty.  They were enough to spur Gerety to approach management at Treasury Prime to ask whether the same glitches might be waiting for that company. Turns out that Treasury Prime’s own systems were, and are, set up so that any reconciliation or operational issues are immediately flagged … all the way up to the CEO. The system has not changed even though Treasury Prime has moved to a more direct model, partnering with banks to help them serve FinTechs rather than acting as a middleman between banks and FinTechs.</p>
<p>“I hope we find some middle ground in terms of expectations … especially around fund segregation, account keeping and data flows,” he said of the inevitable meetings between regulators, FinTechs and banks. “And we’ll make these best practices … this will actually increase the confidence of both banks and FinTechs coming into the market, which will make everything better.”</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	The exhibitor said the stats are due to “the jaw-dropping opening weekend success of <em>Inside Out 2,</em> which is reported to have opened to more than $150 million across the industry domestically. Also providing a key attendance lift was the continued performance of <em>Bad Boys: Ride Or Die,</em> which saw a strong hold in its second weekend with a media-reported $33 million at the domestic industry <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/box-office/" id="auto-tag_box-office" data-tag="box-office">box office</a>.”

	“Once again, the moviegoing public has demonstrated that the magic of the movies and the theatrical experience is alive and powerful. While at first glance <em>Inside Out 2 </em>and <em>Bad Boys: Ride Or Die </em>appear to be very different films, they share a strong crossover in that they both were made specifically for the big screen and expertly marketed to a theatrical moviegoing audience. The results of those efforts were in full force this weekend,” said AMC CEO Adam Aron.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case filed by Nvidia, a leading artificial intelligence chipmaker, to appeal a lower court's decision to allow a securities fraud lawsuit against the company to proceed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lawsuit, led by a Swedish investment management firm, alleges that Nvidia and its CEO Jensen Huang misled investors about how much of the company's revenue came from sales related to cryptomining in 2017 and 2018.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plaintiffs claim that Nvidia's statements on its earnings calls and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were false or misleading, intentionally or recklessly, and that this had a material impact on the company's stock price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nvidia argues that the appeal would open the door to "abusive and speculative litigation" and is seeking to have the case thrown out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Supreme Court will hear the case in its next term, which begins in October 2023, along with another case involving Meta's Facebook, which is fighting a similar securities fraud lawsuit related to its misuse of user data.</p>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>By John Kruzel</p><p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear a bid by Nvidia to scuttle a securities fraud lawsuit accusing the artificial intelligence chipmaker of misleading investors about how much of its sales went to the volatile cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>The justices took up Nvidia's appeal made after a lower court revived a proposed class action brought by shareholders in California against the company and its CEO Jensen Huang. The suit, led by the Stockholm, Sweden-based investment management firm E. Ohman J:or Fonder AB, seeks unspecified monetary damages.</p><p>Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia is a high-flying company that has become one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, and its market value has surged.</p><p>In 2018, Nvidia's chips became popular for cryptomining, a process that involves performing complex math equations in order to secure cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.</p><p>The plaintiffs in a 2018 lawsuit accused Nvidia and top company officials of violating a U.S. law called the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making statements in 2017 and 2018 that falsely downplayed how much of Nvidia's revenue growth came from crypto-related purchases.</p><p>Those omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of cryptomining on Nvidia's business, the plaintiffs said.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr. dismissed the lawsuit in 2021 but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 ruling subsequently revived it. The 9th Circuit found that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged that Huang made "false or misleading statements and did so knowingly or recklessly," allowing their case to proceed.</p><p>Nvidia urged the justices to take up its appeal, arguing that the 9th Circuit's ruling would open the door to "abusive and speculative litigation."</p><p>Nvidia in 2022 agreed to pay $5.5 million to U.S. authorities to settle charges that it did not properly disclose the impact of cryptomining on its gaming business.</p><p>The justices agreed on June 10 to hear a similar bid by Meta's Facebook to dismiss a private securities fraud lawsuit accusing the social media platform of misleading investors in 2017 and 2018 about the misuse of its user data by the company and third parties. Facebook appealed after a lower court allowed a shareholder lawsuit led by Amalgamated Bank to proceed.</p><p>The Supreme Court will hear the Nvidia and Facebook cases in its next term, which begins in October.</p><p>(Reporting by John Kruzel; Editing by Will Dunham)</p></div></div>

The activist, which has a long track record of investing in the technology sector, is particularly concerned about the timing of Autodesk’s disclosure of an internal investigation. That investigation revealed that executives misled investors about the company’s free cash flow metrics and operating margins, according to the people, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential information freely.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>After the probe results came out, Autodesk’s then-CFO Deborah Clifford was ousted from her role and moved to a different executive role within Autodesk. The probe found that executives manipulated reporting tied to the company’s contract billing structure, as Autodesk shifted back to upfront payments from annualized payments, to improve those metrics.</p><p>Autodesk first disclosed in April that it had begun an internal investigation into disclosure issues around those metrics, almost a month after first beginning the investigation and informing the Securities and Exchange Commission about the probe into its financial reports. Autodesk shares slid 20% over the next few weeks. The company’s market cap now sits slightly below $50 billion.</p><p>The delayed disclosure came a little more than a week after the deadline to nominate directors closed. The tight window and timing of the disclosure raised significant concerns inside Starboard, the people said, that Autodesk’s board deliberately chose not to inform shareholders ahead of its annual meeting. Such a delay would potentially limit a shareholder’s ability to nominate its own candidates in a contested fight.</p><p>Starboard is weighing legal action in the Delaware Court of Chancery to compel the reopening of Autodesk’s nominating window and the delay of Autodesk’s annual meeting, the people said. Autodesk’s shareholder meeting is currently scheduled for July 16.</p><p>The activist also believes that the company can drive actual margin improvement and improve investor communications to help bolster Autodesk’s stock, the people said.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>Starboard has built stakes in other major technology companies, including Marc Benioff’s Salesforce and Splunk, which was sold to Cisco in 2023 for $28 billion.</p><p>News of Starboard’s stake and plans was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Autodesk has faced activist scrutiny before. In 2016, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/12/business/dealbook/autodesk-chooses-peace-with-activist-investors.html" target="_blank">settled with two activist investors</a> at Sachem Head Capital Management and Eminence Capital to stave off a proxy contest.</p><p>Autodesk disclosed earlier this year that it is facing probes from the Justice Department and SEC.</p><p>An Autodesk spokesperson said the company welcomed “constructive input” from shareholders.</p><p>“We are confident in our strategic direction, significant margin opportunity, and our corporate governance,” the spokesperson said.</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Don’t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO</h2></div></div></div></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>
