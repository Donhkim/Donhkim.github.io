    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>US stocks gained on Monday, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite notching fresh records, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1%.</li>
<li>The week ahead will provide key signals for the near-term path of interest rates, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell set to testify in Congress and the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) print due for release.</li>
<li>The CME FedWatch tool indicates that about 3 in 4 traders expect a rate cut in September, following last week's jobs report, which signaled continued cooling in the labor market.</li>
<li>The CPI print on Thursday is expected to show headline inflation rose 3.1% over the last year, matching the lows seen at the start of the year, which could support the case for a rate cut.</li>
<li>Corporate reports are also on the agenda, with Boeing set to plead guilty to a charge related to a 2018 incident involving one of its 737 Max planes, and several major banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, set to release their quarterly earnings.</li>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<a href="https://variety.com/t/shari-redstone/" id="auto-tag_shari-redstone" data-tag="shari-redstone">Shari Redstone</a>, non-executive chair of Paramount Global and its controlling shareholder through National Amusements Inc., addressed the pact in a memo to employees, as did the trio of co-CEOs currently leading the company: George Cheeks, president and CEO of CBS; Chris McCarthy, president and CEO, Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks; and Brian Robbins, president and CEO of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon. (<em>Read the memos below.</em>)</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“As a longtime production partner to Paramount, Skydance is well aware of what we have accomplished over the years and it is for that reason that they have pursued a combination with Paramount,” Redstone wrote. “They have a clear strategic vision for the future and the resources to build on Paramount Global’s competitive advantages to drive the Company’s success.”

	</p>




<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In her memo, Redstone referred to her late father, Sumner Redstone, who assembled the pieces of what became Viacom and Paramount Global: “Our family has always been committed to continuing my Dad’s legacy and ensuring Paramount’s enduring success. Consistent with that, as the pace of change in the industry has continued to accelerate, it has been our responsibility to work with leadership to make changes in order to maintain our competitive position and fuel growth, thinking of both the near and longer term.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025 — and until then, the co-CEOs told employees in their own memo, “it’s business as usual.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-ceos-town-hall-layoffs-bankers-asset-sales-1236047993/">current plan under Cheeks, McCarthy and Robbins includes layoffs</a> and other measures aimed at achieving upwards of $500 million in annualized costs; selling assets to pay down debt; and pursuing a joint venture to scale up Paramount+ and accelerate its turn to profitability.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“We have been on a journey to transform Paramount for the future, and thanks to your hard work, Paramount brings tremendous value to this combination with Skydance,” Cheeks, McCarthy and Robbins wrote.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Under the two-step Skydance-Paramount deal, Skydance will acquire Redstone’s National Amusements Inc., which holds a 77% controlling stake in Paramount; subsequently, Skydance will merge with Paramount Global. Once those transactions close, the management team of “New Paramount” will comprise Skydance chief <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/paramount-skydance-ellison-redstone-acquire-deal-1236062041/">David Ellison as chairman and CEO and ex-NBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell as president</a>. The Ellison family and its financial partner, RedBird Capital Partners, said they will invest up to $6 billion into the “New Paramount.”

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Before the Skydance-Paramount deal closes, Paramount Global may execute other transactions.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Warner Bros. Discovery has expressed <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/max-paramount-plus-warner-bros-discovery-streaming-joint-venture-1236058533/">interest in exploring potential tie-up between Max and Paramount+</a>. In addition, Paramount Global reportedly has initiated <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/paramount-bet-buyout-talks-scott-mills-1236059457/">talks to sell BET to an investor group led by BET chief Scott Mills</a>. And the company is expected to seek buyers for the famed Paramount Pictures Studio lot in L.A.</p>

	<strong>Read the memo from Shari Redstone:</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>Good evening. Just moments ago, it was announced that we have entered into an agreement under which Skydance Media will acquire National Amusements and merge Skydance’s business with Paramount Global. I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out to you directly not only to share the news, but to express my tremendous gratitude to each and every one of you for what we have been able to accomplish together for the past several decades.</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>As you know, my father built Viacom and CBS by bringing together a group of the best assets in media, news, and entertainment. While people often debated whether content or distribution ruled the day, my father was governed in all of his decisions by his belief that content was indeed king. That has never been more important than it is today, when in a cluttered marketplace, we continue to create content that resonates with our consumers, that they continually seek out, and that keeps them wanting more. Our success is because of you, what you have done individually, and even more importantly, as a team.</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>Seeing the way you have come together since we launched Paramount Global has been one of the highlights of my years at this company, and your accomplishments are evident across the business. Paramount+ is among the fastest-growing streaming services with an exceptional range of content appealing to all demographics. CBS has been the #1 broadcast network for 16 years and running, with clear strength across genres. Paramount Pictures has produced eight #1 movies in the past two years alone and continues to create hit after hit. Our linear networks have delivered culture-shaping content that excites audiences, including the launch of the “Taylor Sheridan universe” with Yellowstone on the Paramount Network. And, Pluto TV is today the most widely distributed FAST service.</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>As all this was accomplished, we remained dedicated to educating and informing ourselves and our audiences in our efforts to fight hate and discrimination, and supporting other important causes in the US and around the world. I am so grateful to all of you for what we have been able to accomplish to make a difference.</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>Our family has always been committed to continuing my Dad’s legacy and ensuring Paramount’s enduring success. Consistent with that, as the pace of change in the industry has continued to accelerate, it has been our responsibility to work with leadership to make changes in order to maintain our competitive position and fuel growth, thinking of both the near and longer term. Most recently, this led to the appointment of George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy, and Brian Robbins as Co-CEOs, to take the meaningful actions necessary to bolster the Company both operationally and financially. I think we can all agree on their enormous contributions to this company. At the same time, as you know, our Board has focused on ensuring we are pursuing all opportunities to best position the Company for the future and maximize value creation for all shareholders.</em>

	<em>The agreement we entered into today is subject to closing conditions, and we expect the deal to be completed in the first half of 2025. Until then, George, Chris, and Brian will continue to lead the Company, and they will be sharing more with you shortly. I of course will also be here to cheer you on, and assist in any way that I can.

	<em>I want to express my deepest thanks to you for your commitment, hard work, and most importantly your support of my family and me.

	<strong>Read the memo from the current Paramount Global co-CEOs:</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>Hi Everyone,</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>Today marks an important milestone for Paramount, as we just announced a definitive agreement with Skydance Media. By combining Skydance with Paramount, we would build on our storied legacy to create an even stronger, next-generation media and technology leader, positioned to win in today’s rapidly transforming media landscape. </em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>As Shari shared, we expect this transaction to close in the first half of 2025, since it’s subject to regulatory approvals and other steps necessary to complete the deal. The agreement also includes what’s called a “go-shop” provision, which means that the Special Committee of Paramount’s Board of Directors and its representatives will be permitted to actively solicit and evaluate alternative acquisition proposals for a 45-day period.</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>Until the transaction closes, it’s business as usual — we will continue to operate as an independent company and move forward with the strategic plan we outlined at our town hall. This includes actions to modernize our organization by streamlining teams, eliminating duplicative functions and reducing the size of our workforce. We will also continue to explore opportunities to transform global streaming and optimize our asset mix by divesting some of our assets.</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>We have been on a journey to transform Paramount for the future, and thanks to your hard work, Paramount brings tremendous value to this combination with Skydance. Paramount continues to be the home of invaluable IP that powers the best that entertainment has to offer to audiences around the world, and a vibrant creative culture. And, our assets are among the most compelling in the industry, including the number one US broadcast network with CBS and our leading free-to-air networks in the UK, Australia, Argentina, and Chile; iconic brands like Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, and Showtime; a top five SVOD service in the US with Paramount+; and a leading global free ad-supported streaming service in Pluto TV. And of course, Paramount Pictures continues to create genre-spanning films that deliver at the box office, most recently with A Quiet Place: Day One – the latest addition to our 100-year-old film library.</em>

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>This transaction would combine Skydance’s financial resources, deep operating experience, and cutting-edge technology with Paramount’s iconic IP, deep film and television library, proven hit-making capabilities, and linear and streaming platforms that reach millions of viewers. And, we already know Paramount and Skydance, led by David Ellison, can achieve incredible results together, as evidenced by our strong, 15-year collaboration that has delivered highly successful films and franchises like Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible – Fallout.</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>The Paramount that we know today would not be possible without the leadership of Shari and the Redstone family. It is because of their vision and support over the many years that we are one of the leading global entertainment companies in the world, with the best team in the business. We would like to sincerely thank Shari and her entire family for their unwavering support and leadership. We would also like to thank our Board of Directors, who have helped guide us along the way. We appreciate all that they do on behalf of Paramount.</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>And most importantly, we want to thank all of you, our Paramount Global team, for all you have done and continue to do to drive Paramount to new heights.</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>We know you will have questions and we’ll share as much information as we can throughout this process. In the meantime, you can read more about the agreement in the press release here.</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<em>Thank you,</em></p>

<p>Average salaries in Europe vary widely, significantly impacting hiring and job decisions. These differences can arise from country-specific regulations, labour laws, industry sectors, and economic development. Northern and western European countries have the highest average net earnings, while eastern and southern European countries report much lower figures.</p>
<h2>How do average earnings across Europe compare?</h2><p>Average annual net earnings are calculated by subtracting income taxes and social security contributions from gross annual earnings and then adding family allowances. Different family situations, such as being single or married and the number of dependent children, impact net earnings.</p>
                    
    




<p>Euronews Business examines the net earnings of a single person without children, but the chart below also provides options for different scenarios.</p>
<p>Switzerland tops the list with an impressive average annual net earning of €85,582, significantly higher than any other country in the region, according to Eurostat, the EU's official statistical office. </p>
<p>Following Switzerland, Iceland and Luxembourg reported average earnings of €53,885 and €49,035, respectively. Norway and the Netherlands also recorded net earnings over €45,000.</p>



<p>The average net earnings within the EU was €28,217, serving as a benchmark for comparison. Countries such as France (€31,481) and Sweden (€33,926) slightly surpass the EU average, while others, including Italy (€24,207) and Spain (€23,568), fall below it. </p>
<p>Among Europe's top economies, Germany had the highest net earnings at €38,086. The latest available figure for the UK is from 2019, making direct comparison difficult, but it was €35,783, indicating the UK's position.</p>
<p>All these figures highlight the substantial income differences that exist even among Europe's wealthiest nations.</p>           <p data-ad-id="adzone-outstream_1" data-ad-type="outstream" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label js-adzone outstream"></p>
  

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, countries like Turkey and Bulgaria report the lowest average annual net earnings, at €8,968 and €9,355, respectively. </p>
<p>Eastern European countries such as Romania (€11,105), Croatia (€12,330), and Hungary (€12,456) also fall towards the lower end of the earnings scale.</p>



<h2>PPS-adjusted salaries</h2><p>When adjusting for purchasing power standards (PPS), the landscape changes slightly. PPS is an artificial currency unit which adjusts for price level differences between countries.</p>
<p>Switzerland remains the highest at 47,403 PPS, but the gap with other countries narrows. This figure underscores Switzerland's strong economic position and high standard of living, substantially surpassing other nations in the region.</p>



<p>Following Switzerland, the Netherlands and Norway also showcase robust net earnings with 38,856 PPS and 36,288 PPS, respectively. Luxembourg and Austria round out the top five, reporting over 35,000 PPS.</p>         <p data-ad-id="adzone-native_1" data-ad-type="native" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label advertising--native js-adzone"></p>
  

<p>These countries, predominantly located in Northern and Western Europe, benefit from strong economies, advanced infrastructure, and favourable labour laws, contributing to their high earnings.</p>
<h2>Net earnings lower in Eastern and Southern Europe</h2><p>In contrast, countries in Eastern and Southern Europe generally report lower average net earnings in PPS terms.</p>
<p>Slovakia, for instance, has the lowest average annual net earnings at 14,758 PPS. Turkey (2022), Latvia, and Bulgaria also fall at the lower end of the spectrum, each with less than 16,000 PPS.</p>
<p>These figures highlight the economic disparities within the continent, influenced by various factors such as economic development, labour market conditions, and cost of living.</p>
<p>Among Europe's top economies, Germany stands out with net earnings of 34,914 PPS. Although the latest data for the UK is from 2019, it reported 29,757 PPS, indicating its competitive position within Europe. </p>
    <div class="c-ad c-ad-halfpage u-margin-bottom-3 u-show-for-small-only">
                             <p data-ad-id="adzone-halfpage_2" data-ad-type="halfpage" data-ad-position="2" class="c-ad__adzone advertising js-adzone"></p>
        
        <div class="c-ad__placeholder">
            <img class="c-ad__placeholder__logo" src="https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-180x22-grey-6.svg" alt="" loading="lazy">

        </div>
    </div>


<p>Countries such as Belgium, Ireland, and Sweden also perform well, with earnings exceeding 30,000 PPS. These statistics reflect the economic stability and higher living standards in these regions.</p>



<p>The chart above illustrates how the number of dependent children and marital status significantly impact net earnings across Europe. While the rankings of certain countries shift under these varying circumstances, the overall changes are generally not dramatic.</p>
<p>All these disparities in net earnings have significant implications for the quality of life, economic stability, and social equity within Europe. Policymakers and stakeholders consider these findings in their efforts to address income inequality and promote balanced economic growth across the continent.</p>
<h2>Pay transparency in the EU</h2><p>The EU promotes pay transparency with new rules adopted on 24 April, 2023. These rules require companies to share salary information and address any gender pay gap over 5%. Pay transparency helps workers enforce their right to equal pay and aims to close the gender pay gap.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Bitcoin price fell due to concerns over Mt Gox distributions</strong>: The price of Bitcoin fell slightly on Monday due to persistent concerns over the distribution of tokens by Mt Gox, a now-defunct crypto exchange, which could lead to selling pressure on the token.</li>
<li><strong>Mt Gox trustees began distributing tokens to affected clients</strong>: The trustees of Mt Gox have begun distributing tokens to clients affected by a 2014 hack, with reports suggesting that wallets associated with the exchange were seen moving around $9 billion worth of Bitcoin earlier this year.</li>
<li><strong>Bitcoin "whale" wallets came online for potential sales</strong>: Several large Bitcoin "whale" wallets were seen coming online for potential sales of their holdings, adding to the selling pressure on the token.</li>
<li><strong>Altcoins saw mixed performance</strong>: While Bitcoin fell, other major altcoins such as Ethereum saw mixed performance, with some rising and others falling. The mixed performance was attributed to the fact that altcoins often follow the lead of Bitcoin.</li>
<li><strong>Interest rate cuts may boost crypto prices</strong>: Despite the selling pressure on Bitcoin, the article notes that crypto prices are expected to be boosted by growing optimism over interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which could lead to a rise in crypto prices.</li>

<p>Tesla shares (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASDAQ:TSLA</a>) saw some momentum last week following the release of its Q2 2024 vehicle delivery and production report, with the company gaining $150 billion worth of valuation in three days. Amidst this rise, Tesla shorts were stung, including hedge funds that bet against the EV maker in the lead up to the Q2 delivery report’s release. </p>



<p>As noted in a <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-07/hedge-funds-that-piled-into-big-tesla-short-stung-by-huge-rally?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg News</a></em> report, about 18% of the over 500 hedge funds being tracked by data provider Hazeltree held a short position in the electric vehicle maker at the end of Q2 2024, the highest percentage in over a year. In comparison, only 15% of the hedge funds tracked by the data provider had a short position against Tesla at the end of Q1 2024. </p>








<p>Tesla shares surged following the release of the company’s Q2 2024 vehicle delivery and production report, which beat Wall Street’s estimates. In the two trading days since the report’s release, <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-ytd-losses-recouped-150b-valuation-gain-three-days/">TSLA shares climbed 17%</a>, leading to short sellers losing an estimated $3.5 billion on a mark-to-market basis, as noted in a <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/04/tesla-short-sellers-lost-3point5-billion-in-two-days-after-q2-deliveries.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a></em> report. It should be noted that since the start of June 2024, Tesla shares have risen about 40%. </p>



<p>In a post on social media platform X, Elon Musk has responded to the news of the hedge funds’ losses with a crying face emoji. </p>



 



<p>Considering the past few months, it is no surprise that Tesla attracted substantial interest from short-sellers. Tesla’s Q1 2024 vehicle deliveries fell below expectations, and over Q2, the company initiated a major round of job cuts that saw the departure of some key executives. Tesla’s leadership also seemed to be in dire straits as rumors suggested that Elon Musk may leave the company if TSLA shareholders did not <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-2024-cyber-roundup-annual-stockholders-meeting-live-blog/">ratify this 2018 CEO Performance Award</a>. </p>



<p>Tesla is expected to hold its Q2 2024 earnings call on Tuesday, July 23, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. CT (5:30 p.m. ET).  Tesla is expected to release its Q2 2024 Update Letter, which will be available on the company’s Investors Relations website after the end of July 23’s trading day. The results of the Q2 2024 Update Letter, as well as other pertinent topics, are expected to be discussed in the earnings call. </p>

    <p>Here are five key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Deceptive June jobs report</strong>: Former Home Depot CEO and former Chrysler Chairman Bob Nardelli and FreedomWorks senior economist Steve Moore are warning that the June jobs report is "deceptively correct" and does not accurately represent the state of the labor market.</li>
<li><strong>Government jobs dominate job growth</strong>: Moore pointed out that one-third of the 206,000 jobs added in June were in the government sector, which contributes little to GDP. Nardelli echoed this concern, stating that government jobs are not a reliable indicator of economic growth.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation is a major problem</strong>: Both Nardelli and Moore emphasized the impact of inflation on the economy, with Nardelli likening it to carbon monoxide, a "silent killer" that affects the quality of life. Moore noted that many Americans are using dynamic pricing to cope with inflation, which is causing economic problems.</li>
<li><strong>Two-thirds of Americans are struggling to make ends meet</strong>: According to Moore, two-thirds of middle-income Americans report falling behind and struggling to make ends meet due to the rising cost of living.</li>
<li><strong>Economy is slowing down</strong>: Nardelli stated that the economy has shifted into a lower gear, suggesting that the job market is not as strong as some may think. Moore agreed, arguing that the U.S. is not experiencing a hot job market, contrary to the Biden administration's characterization.</li>

<p>Tesla (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASDAQ:TSLA</a>) is among a group of stocks that Wall Street has dubbed the “Magnificent Seven.” These seven companies, comprised of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, are dubbed as such due to their high performance and influence in the tech sector. Earlier this year, however, it seemed like Tesla did not really belong to the list. </p>



<p>As noted in a <em><a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/04/elon-musk-tesla-stock-recoup-losses-q2-deliveries-wedbush-dan-ives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortune</a></em> report, Tesla practically became the butt of jokes on Wall Street because the stock trailed the rest of the Magnificent Seven by a substantial degree, and its growth seemed to have stopped. Following the release of the Q2 2024 vehicle delivery and production report, however, TSLA stock showed an incredible rise. </p>








<p>So notable was TSLA stock’s rise following the release of the company’s Q2 2024 vehicle delivery and production report that the electric vehicle maker was able to fully recoup its year-to-date losses after the company boosted its market cap by $150 billion in just three days. That’s a pretty insane amount considering that Ford currently has a market cap of $51.26 billion and GM has a market cap of $53.08 billion. </p>



<p>Tesla stock generally <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-stock-may-2024-most-shorted-large-cap-stock-hazeltree/">stayed in the $180 level for the better part of the last two months</a>, but with the electric vehicle maker’s recent momentum, TSLA bulls are hoping for even more gains in the coming months. Trading &amp; investing tool <em><a href="https://x.com/Barchart/status/1808575246867309015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barchart</a></em>, for one, observed last week that TSLA shares have broken their 2.5-year downward trend. And with the upcoming unveiling of the dedicated Robotaxi next month, Tesla’s momentum could continue in the latter half of the year. </p>



 



<p>Tesla will have a very busy Q3 and Q4, especially since CEO Elon Musk noted during the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call that he expects the company to see higher sales this year compared to the previous year. For context, Tesla has so far been able to deliver 830,776 vehicles over the first and second quarter of 2024. In comparison,  the company was able to <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-vehicle-production-deliveries-and-date-financial-results-webcast-fourth-quarter-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deliver a total of 1,808,581 vehicles in full year 2023</a>. If Tesla wishes to exceed its 2023 deliveries, the company would have to deliver more than 978,000 vehicles between Q3 and Q4 2024. </p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Temporary block on noncompete agreement ban</strong>: A federal judge in Texas has temporarily blocked a Federal Trade Commission rule that bans noncompete agreements, a regulation that business groups had strongly opposed.</li>
<li><strong>Judge's reasoning</strong>: Judge Ada Brown ruled that the FTC lacked the authority to issue the rule, which makes it illegal for employers to include noncompete agreements in workers' contracts.</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong>: The ruling only applies to the plaintiffs in the lawsuit and does not affect the broader population. However, if the rule is ultimately struck down, it could affect up to millions of workers who are bound by noncompete agreements.</li>
<li><strong>Timeline</strong>: Judge Brown's order postpones the effective date of the rule, which was set to take effect on September 4, until the court reaches a decision on the case's merits. She has set a deadline of August 30 for the court to make a decision.</li>
<li><strong>Parties involved</strong>: The plaintiffs in the lawsuit include a Dallas-based tax consultancy and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which have been critical of the FTC's rule. The FTC, on the other hand, has argued that noncompete agreements can harm workers and stifle competition.</li>

<p>As Tropical Storm Beryl impacts greater Houston Monday morning, a critical local resource on power outages and restoration timelines remains unavailable: the Outage Tracker operated by CenterPoint Energy, the city’s primary electricity provider.</p>





<p>This comes as more than 2.1 million of its customers are without power, the utility company reported as of 10:55 a.m. Monday. CenterPoint said it has its own repair crews, as well as neighboring support crews, ready to begin restoring power when it is safe.</p>



<p>CenterPoint’s Outage Tracker, a map of the Houston metro area that highlights areas affected by electrical outages, has been offline since May due to “technical difficulties” caused by the derecho that swept through Harris County that month, CenterPoint officials said. </p>



<p>In an email Sunday, a CenterPoint representative said the company aims to replace the Outage Tracker with a “redesigned cloud-based platform” by the end of July. The updated map will offer “the same level of outage information and functionality” as the previous tool and tolerate higher levels of customer traffic, which “limited performance” on the website during the derecho, utility officials said.</p>



<p>The lack of neighborhood-level data has <a href="https://houstonlanding.org/houstonians-left-in-the-dark-by-centerpoint-turn-to-social-media-to-tackle-power-outages/">frustrated some CenterPoint customers</a>, who wanted more clarity about the extent of power outages and timelines for bringing power back. The utility is responsible for maintaining the systems that deliver power to virtually all residents in Harris and Fort Bend counties, along with several other corners of Greater Houston. About 2.8 million Houston-area customers rely on CenterPoint, according to the company.</p>

<p>CenterPoint released an interactive map detailing estimates for power restoration after the derecho, but it came four days after the storm hit.</p>



<p>State Rep. Armando Walle, D-Houston, whose legislative district includes the Northside and Aldine areas, said he has been in “constant communication” with CenterPoint officials in advance of Monday’s storm arrival. Walle said he is encouraged by their plans to restore outages. </p>



<p>“Having gone through many storms, we’re always concerned about vulnerable communities being left out,” Walle said. “But right now, they’re communicating. I have to at least acknowledge that they’re reaching out.”</p>



<p>In the meantime, here’s how residents across Greater Houston can access information on electrical outages and restorations during this week’s severe weather. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-centerpoint-customers">CenterPoint customers</h2>



<p>While CenterPoint works to restore its Outage Trackers, the company’s <a href="https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/residential/services/electric-utility/outage-center/power-alert-service?sa=ho">Power Alert Service</a> provides community-specific outage information, including estimated restoration times via phone call, text or emails. Customers can sign up for the alerts through their CenterPoint online account.</p>



<p>CenterPoint also provides general outage information through its <a href="https://gisoutagetracker.azurewebsites.net/">Storm Center</a>, which updates every 15 minutes. The center features the number of customers affected by outages and customers that saw power restored in the prior 24 hours, among other totals. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-entergy-customers">Entergy customers</h2>



<p>Entergy, which provides electricity to much of Montgomery, Chambers and Liberty, counties, operates its own <a href="https://www.etrviewoutage.com/map?state=TX&amp;_gl=1*127zbp3*_gcl_au*MTkyOTEwNjE0OC4xNzIwMzc2MzYx*_ga*MTAxMDQ5MzI2NS4xNzIwMzc2MzYx*_ga_8YKL3FLBBC*MTcyMDM3NjM2MC4xLjAuMTcyMDM3NjM2MC42MC4wLjA.&amp;_ga=2.45818596.1927358630.1720376361-1010493265.1720376361">outage tracker</a> with a map. </p>



<p>Like CenterPoint, it provides an <a href="https://cloud.mail.myentergy.com/stay-informed">Outage Alerts</a> service that updates customers on outages and restoration timelines via text message.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-texas-new-mexico-power-customers">Texas-New Mexico Power customers</h2>



<p>Texas-New Mexico Power, which covers parts of Galveston and Brazoria counties, also offers an <a href="https://outagemap.tnmp.com/">outage tracker</a> map, which is working.</p>



<p>Like CenterPoint and Energy, it offers a text message-based <a href="https://www.tnmp.com/customers/power-outages-hazards/outage-notifications">Outage Alerts</a> service with information on outages, restoration updates and severe weather alerts.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Investment banking fees are expected to rebound</strong>: Second-quarter earnings of major US banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Citigroup, are expected to show a significant increase in investment banking revenues, with analysts predicting a 30%+ rise from the previous year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mergers and debt deals are picking up</strong>: The resurgence of dealmaking is expected to be a bright spot for the banks, with large deals such as ExxonMobil's $60bn acquisition and Aon's $13bn purchase closing in the second quarter. This is a departure from the previous two years, which saw a lack of deal activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goldman and Morgan Stanley to benefit the most</strong>: Analysts predict that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, whose businesses have the largest exposure to investment banking, will benefit the most from the rebound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rising defaults may impact overall earnings growth</strong>: While investment banking revenues are expected to rise, rising defaults are expected to contribute to muted earnings growth for many of the largest US lenders this quarter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The recovery has been slower than expected</strong>: Despite predictions of a recovery from last year, investment banking revenues have taken longer than expected to rebound, with Wall Street bosses still talking up the potential for a rebound.</p>

Rising interest rates by central banks around the world have damped activity for M&amp;A and new stock market listings. </p><p>Wall Street bosses have been talking up a recovery for more than a year — the heads of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley spoke about the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4256b07b-789f-4f87-a10e-db9db951c3c4" data-trackable="link">“green shoots”</a> of a recovery as far back as 12 months ago — but the business has taken longer to rebound than initially expected. </p><p>In a jolt of optimism, JPMorgan told investors last month that the increase in revenues from investment banking during the second quarter was set to rise by as much as 30 per cent, double what the bank had initially anticipated.</p><p>Smaller rival Jefferies last week reported that investment banking revenues in the three months to the end of May rose almost 60 per cent from a year earlier. Its top management said it was “increasingly optimistic” about the second half of 2024 and 2025. </p><figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"><picture><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7d1602cc-51de-4b0d-8615-5cc9c2587df3?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7d1602cc-51de-4b0d-8615-5cc9c2587df3?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7d1602cc-51de-4b0d-8615-5cc9c2587df3?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=3 3x"><source media="(max-width: 490px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A9e151593-afe0-4b3e-870a-be1771bd5e22?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=490&amp;dpr=1 1x"><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F10829c50-3965-11ef-82f4-9154095071af-standard.png?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1" alt="Line chart of Fees in $bn showing Wall Street banks seeing long-awaited rebound in investment banking activity" data-image-type="graphic" loading="lazy"></source></source></picture></figure><p>The rebound has been aided by debt offerings, as confidence in the economy has made investors more willing to jump into riskier deals.

<li><strong>Economy slowing down</strong>: Citi analysts say that the economy has cooled off, with inflation resuming its slowdown and the Institute for Supply Management's service-sector gauge turning negative. This may lead to a sharper weakening of economic activity and faster rate cuts.</li>
<li><strong>First rate cut likely in September</strong>: With dovish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the recent jobs report showing unemployment rising to 4.1%, Citi predicts that the first rate cut will likely come in September.</li>
<li><strong>Jobs report shows signs of weakness</strong>: While the headline payroll gain appeared solid, prior months were revised down, and June saw a decline of 49,000 temporary services jobs, which is typically seen around recessions.

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>Get ready for a bonanza of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve that starts in a few months and extends all the way into next summer, according to analysts at Citi Research.</p><p>In a note on Friday, the bank cited fresh signs of a slowing economy for its view that the Fed will trim rates by 25 basis points eight times, starting in September and extending to July 2025.</p><p>That will lower the benchmark rate by a whopping 200 basis points, or from 5.25%-5.5% now to 3.25%-3.5%, where they will remain for the rest of 2025, the note said.</p><p>The economy has cooled off from its "heady" pace in 2023 with inflation resuming its slowdown after some unexpected stickiness, said Citi analysts led by chief U.S. economist Andrew Hollenhorst.</p><p>But the Institute for Supply Management's service-sector gauge, which abruptly reversed into negative territory, and the monthly jobs report, which showed unemployment rising to 4.1%, have raised the risk of a sharper weakening of economic activity and a faster pace of rate cuts, they added.</p><p>The data along with dovish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday suggest the first rate cut will very likely come in September.</p><p>"A continued softening of activity will provoke cuts at each of the subsequent seven Fed meetings, in our base case," Citi predicted.</p><p>The note also pointed to other signs of weakness in the jobs report. While the headline payroll gain of 206,000 appears solid, prior months were revised down. And June saw a decline of 49,000 temporary services jobs, with Citi calling it "the type of decline that is typically seen around recessions as employers begin reducing labor with the least strongly attached workers."</p><p>Payroll data are also likely skewed to the upside, leaving the unemployment rate, which is derived from a separate survey, as the more important metric, it said. And on that front, Citi pointed to the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/recession-indicator-economic-outlook-sahm-rule-unemployment-rate-june-jobs-report/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"Sahm Rule" recession indicator;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link " data-rapid_p="12">"Sahm Rule" recession indicator</a> and said it could be triggered in August if unemployment continues to rise at its current pace.</p><p>Hollenhorst has been a relative contrarian this year by maintaining a dimmer view on the economy, even as the Wall Street consensus shifted to a soft landing.</p><p>In May, he doubled down on his warning that the U.S. is <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/05/economic-outlook-hard-landing-recession-fed-rate-cuts-forecast-citi/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:headed for a hard landing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="13">headed for a hard landing</a> and that Fed rate cuts wouldn't be enough to prevent it. That followed a similar forecast in February, even amid blowout jobs reports.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-07-03/bloomberg-surveillance-07-04-2024&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCxOzGspWHAxWgmI4IHd3VC4YQtwJ6BAgOEAI&amp;usg=AOvVaw3vANgZLjaSZwx1yIMvCBjw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bloomberg TV on Wednesday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="14">Bloomberg TV on Wednesday</a>, Hollenhorst noted that a sharp recession would likely produce enough political consensus for more government spending to stimulate the economy, overcoming concerns about the massive deficit.

In addition, 10-year bond yields, which serve as benchmarks for a wide range of borrowing costs, are already below 2-year yields, leaving less room for further downside, especially as rising deficits and inflation add upward pressure.</p><p>"Most economic activity is going to be more responsive to a 5-year yield, the 10-year yield. It's not really about the overnight policy rate," Hollenhorst explained. "So there really are questions about how much can you transmit that stimulative effect of lower policy rates."</p><p>This story was originally featured on <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/07/fed-rate-cuts-outlook-200-points-economy-sharper-slowdown-citi/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16">Fortune.com</a></p></div></div>
