The achievement caps Nvidia’s rise from a respected maker of video game hardware to the purveyor of one of tech’s hottest commodities: specialized AI chips. The pivot has seen Nvidia dramatically transform its fortunes in a matter of years, growing from a <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/" aria-label="market capitalization">market capitalization </a>of around $16 billion in 2016 to just under $800 billion towards the end of 2021 before dropping to around $300 billion in 2022 amid <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-is-down-57-should-you-buy-right-now" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-is-down-57-should-you-buy-right-now" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-is-down-57-should-you-buy-right-now" aria-label="poor demand">poor demand</a> for gaming chips and a wider rout on U.S. stock markets. The boom in generative artificial intelligence, kickstarted by the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022, has helped propel Nvidia to new heights as demand for its specialized AI chips soared. Since then, the company’s value has multiplied from around $400 billion in late 2022 to $1 trillion by mid 2023, $2 trillion by early 2024 and $3 trillion by the middle of 2024 on a near vertical climb. Nvidia shares are up more than 170% this year alone and its stratospheric growth shows little sign of stopping as tech firms duel it out to dominate the nascent market for AI.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Federal Reserve has projected only one interest rate cut for the year, but some economists are worried it may not come soon enough, given the slowing economy and cooling consumer spending.</li>
<li>Retail sales in May showed a slower pace of consumer spending, easing concerns about an economy running too hot and inflation. The unemployment rate also hit 4%, its highest level since January 2022.</li>
<li>Inflation data for May was more promising than expected, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increasing at its slowest pace since July 2022. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index also increased at its slowest pace of the year during May.</li>
<li>Despite the slower inflation rate, the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain a wait-and-see approach before cutting interest rates, whereas some economists like Neil Dutta of Renaissance Macro believe the Fed should begin cutting rates soon to protect the economy and achieve maximum employment.</li>
<li>Dutta attributes the softening of core inflation momentum and believes the Fed should "get on with it" and cut interest rates to mitigate the risk of a recession and maintain price stability.</li>

In the labor market, while last month's job additions came in higher than expected, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-adds-more-jobs-than-expected-in-may-as-unemployment-rate-ticks-higher-164923920.html" data-ylk="slk:the unemployment rate hit 4%;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="0">the unemployment rate hit 4%</a>, its highest level since January 2022. Overall, Citi's Economic Surprise Index, which measures the extent to which data has come in better than forecast, is hovering near its lowest level in more than a year.</p><p>Inflation data for May, meanwhile, was more promising than expected. The headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inflation-eases-in-may-as-consumer-prices-rise-at-slower-than-expected-pace-123413485.html" data-ylk="slk:increased;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="0">increased</a> at its slowest pace since July 2022. When combining that data with a reading on wholesale prices in May, economists believe the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-enter-shortened-trading-week-near-record-highs-what-to-know-this-week-110034200.html" data-ylk="slk:increased at its slowest pace of the year during May.;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="0">increased at its slowest pace of the year during May. </a></p><p>With inflation falling and the economy slowing, Renaissance Macro's Neil Dutta believes it's time for the "Fed to get on with it" and begin cutting interest rates soon. This, Dutta says, will help protect the Fed's other mandate in addition to price stability: maximum employment.</p><p>"The momentum behind core inflation is probably going to continue softening from here," Dutta told Yahoo Finance. "Then I think for the Fed, the trade-offs with the labor market are becoming a little bit more onerous."</p><p>Dutta points out that any sign of weakness in the labor market has so far been regarded <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/job-openings-dip-to-2021-lows-but-the-labor-market-is-still-quite-strong-152840044.html" data-ylk="slk:as a sign of rebalancing;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="0">as a sign of rebalancing </a>after the pandemic threw supply and demand out of whack<a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/job-openings-dip-to-2021-lows-but-the-labor-market-is-still-quite-strong-152840044.html" data-ylk="slk:.;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="0">. </a></p><p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has acknowledged as much.</p><p>"We see gradual cooling, gradual moving toward better balance [in the labor market]," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on June 12 after the central bank's most recent policy meeting. "We're monitoring it carefully for signs of something more than that, but we really don't see that."</p><p>But what concerns Dutta, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-18/goldman-sees-us-jobs-at-inflection-point-sticks-to-two-cut-call?sref=eeq6exxF" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:and the economics team at Goldman Sachs;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="0">and the economics team at Goldman Sachs</a>, is where the data usually heads from here. The job openings rate is now in line with pre-pandemic levels. If it were to decline further, a pickup in the unemployment rate would usually accompany the downward trend, Dutta said, referencing the Beveridge curve.</p><p>As <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/what-does-the-beveridge-curve-tell-us-about-the-likelihood-of-a-soft-landing-20220729.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:work from the Federal Reserve highlights;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="0">work from the Federal Reserve highlights</a>, the dots on the Beveridge curve moving further along the right axis (as seen in the chart below highlighted in red) would come with diminished chances of a soft landing and, possibly, recession.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>"I just don't think the Fed wants to really push the weakening in labor demand that much more," Dutta said.</p><p>He added, "The Fed knows that. It's not like the risk at this point is for the unemployment rate to unexpectedly go down. The most likely distribution of outcomes is that it's stable or it goes higher."</p><p>To be clear, Dutta and other economists are more concerned about how the economic data could spiral from here rather than where it sits today. Many aren't overly concerned about the current trends quite yet.</p><p>Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti told Yahoo Finance the "risks" in the labor market are there. But at this point, it looks more like the spending power of the US consumer is slowing toward a normal pace, not trending toward a drop-off.</p><p>"While there are some strains, particularly for parts of the households, I would be surprised if you saw a slowing in the labor market and a slowing in the consumer that was enough to get them to cut by September," Luzzetti said.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell takes questions during a news conference at the Federal Reserve in Washington, Wednesday, June 12, 2024.

<li><strong>Unfavorable factors</strong>: The correction is attributed to bearish setups in interest rates, inflation, and stock valuations.</li>

<li><strong>Rate cut uncertainty</strong>: The Federal Reserve is only expected to cut interest rates once by the end of the year, due to concerns about inflation.</li>

However, the benchmark index is <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-spx-index-stovall-crash-recession-warning-tech-2024-6?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="80">poised to dip 5%</a>, he predicted, thanks to the bearish setup in interest rates, inflation, and stock valuations.</p><p>Inflation is declining but is still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, leading central bankers to project just one rate cut by the end of the year. </p><p>Higher rates have triggered the longest-ever inversion of the 2-10 Treasury <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/recession-indicator-economy-inverted-yield-curve-campbell-harvey-fed-unemployment-2024-6?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="80">yield curve</a>, the bond market's famous gauge of a coming recession. The indicator, which flashes when the 2-year yield surpasses the 10-year yield, has been a reliable recession signal throughout history, and economists have said that this time likely won't be different.</p><p>Stock valuations are also high by historical standards, which hints at future downside. The S&amp;P 500 is priced at a 32% premium compared to its average price-to-earnings ratio over the last 20 years, Stovall noted. Tech stocks, which have dominated the market in recent years, are trading at a 68% premium. </p><p>"I think we're really stretched and we got to see some upward revisions to earnings estimates, I think, in order to justify that," Stovall said in a recent interview with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV0zSB4kBIE" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="100">CNBC</a>.</p><p>Stocks could see their first "crack in the ice" in the tech sector, he added, pointing to lofty valuations among mega-cap tech stocks.</p><p>"It's only been tech that's been outperforming the market. I sort of feel this is a jumbo jet that's flying on one engine, and you wonder how long it will stay aloft," he warned.</p><p>Other forecasters have warned of limited upside to the market as stocks — particularly tech stocks — continue to climb higher. According to one valuation metric, the stock market looks to be the most overvalued since 1929, which could pave the way to a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-sp500-outlook-bubble-risks-valuations-indicators-hussman-2024-3?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">steep correction</a>, elite investor John Hussman warned.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/henrik-fisker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Henrik Fisker</a> once envisioned a burgeoning EV empire at the startup he named after himself, which was to be led by the Ocean SUV. But cracks started showing in that vision almost as soon as the Ocean hit the road in 2023. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fisker/">Fisker</a> cut <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/01/ev-startup-fisker-cut-its-2023-production-target-for-the-fourth-time/">production targets multiple times</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/04/ev-startup-fisker-sales-goals-dealerships/">failed to meet sales goals</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/29/fisker-layoffs-cash-going-concern-dealerships/">laid off staff</a>. What’s more, its Ocean SUV was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/09/fisker-ocean-braking-power-loss-problems-investigation/">beset with software and mechanical issues</a>, rendering it inoperable for some. Add troublesome brakes, sudden power loss and doors that wouldn’t open to the list of issues that led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/16/fisker-ocean-rollaway-nhtsa-investigation/">multiple safety investigations</a> and ultimately a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/18/fisker-production-pause-going-concern-cash-raise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pause in production</a> in order to raise new capital. </p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">All of this and more has forced Fisker to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, marking the beginning of an inauspicious period for the eponymous startup. Below is a timeline of the events that led the automaker to this point.</p>

	
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2023">2023</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fisker-fell-short-of-its-q2-production-target">Fisker fell short of its Q2 production target</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>July 7</strong> — The automaker produced 1,022 Ocean SUVs in the second quarter of 2023, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/07/ev-maker-fisker-falls-short-of-q2-production-target/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several hundred vehicles short</a> of its expectation of producing between 1,400 and 1,700 EVs. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fisker-sold-convertible-notes-to-fund-operations">Fisker sold convertible notes to fund operations</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>July 10</strong> — Fisker announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/10/fisker-to-sell-340m-in-convertible-notes-to-fund-operations-add-battery-pack-capacity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans to sell $340 million in convertible debt</a>, expecting the net proceeds to be $296.7 million. The automaker said it planned to use the funds to support its general corporate operations and add an additional battery pack line to “support growth” in 2024 and beyond. The company said funds will also be used for capital expenditures and the development of future products.</p>

	
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-production-target-cut">Production target cut</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>December 1</strong> — Fisker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/01/ev-startup-fisker-cut-its-2023-production-target-for-the-fourth-time/">cut its annual production guidance</a> in an effort to free up $300 million in working capital. The company said it expected to produce about 10,000 vehicles in 2023. The production guidance is just a quarter of Fisker’s bullish forecast from a year ago.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2024">2024</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fisker-struggled-to-meet-internal-sales-goals">Fisker struggled to meet internal sales goals</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>January 1</strong> — Fisker remained far from meeting its publicly stated goal of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/04/ev-startup-fisker-sales-goals-dealerships/">delivering 300 electric SUVs per day globally</a>. The EV startup spent much of December aiming to meet an internal sales goal of between 100 and 200 vehicles a day in North America, where the bulk of its inventory and sales efforts are. Fisker fell well below that target, often selling just one to two dozen of its Ocean SUVs a day here.</p>

	
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ocean-suv-investigated-over-braking-loss-complaints">Ocean SUV investigated over braking loss complaints</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>January 15</strong> — Federal safety regulators have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/15/fisker-ocean-suv-nhtsa-investiagtion-brakes/">opened an investigation</a> into Fisker’s first electric vehicle over braking problems. Owners had lodged 19 complaints with NHTSA on issues ranging from brake loss and problems with the gear shifter to a driver door failing to open from the interior and two instances of the vehicle’s hood suddenly flying up on the highway.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-owners-flagged-sudden-power-loss-and-brake-problems-for-months">Owners flagged sudden power loss and brake problems for months</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>February 9</strong> — Since the initial fleet of Fisker Ocean SUVs were delivered, customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/09/fisker-ocean-braking-power-loss-problems-investigation/">have reported more than 100 separate loss-of-power incidents</a>. The company told TechCrunch it believes these problems are rare, and that it has resolved “almost all the issues” with software updates. Customers have also reported sudden loss of braking power, problematic key fobs causing them to get locked inside or outside of the vehicle, seat sensors that don’t detect the driver’s presence and the SUV’s front hood suddenly flying up at high speeds.</p>

	
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-feds-opened-2nd-probe-into-the-ocean-suv-after-rollaway-complaints">Feds opened 2nd probe into the Ocean SUV after rollaway complaints</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>February 16</strong> — The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/16/fisker-ocean-rollaway-nhtsa-investigation/">opened a second investigation</a> into EV startup Fisker’s Ocean SUV, after the agency received <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2023/FISKER/OCEAN#investigations">four complaints</a> about the vehicle rolling away unexpectedly, including one injury. The company tells TechCrunch it is “fully cooperating” with the safety agency.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fisker-laid-off-15-of-staff">Fisker laid off 15% of staff</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>February 29</strong> — Fisker announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/29/fisker-layoffs-cash-going-concern-dealerships/">plan to lay off 15% of its workforce</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://investors.fiskerinc.com/news/news-details/2024/Fisker-Inc.-Announces-Preliminary-Q4-and-Full-Year-2023-Results/default.aspx">says</a> it likely does not have enough cash on hand to survive the next 12 months. The company says it is trying to find a way to raise that money as it works through a pivot from direct sales to a dealership model. </p>

	
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pause-in-production-with-just-121m-in-the-bank">Pause in production with just $121M in the bank</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>March 18</strong> — Fisker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/18/fisker-production-pause-going-concern-cash-raise/">announced it would pause production of its electric Ocean SUV for six weeks</a> as it scrambles for a cash infusion. The company said in a regulatory filing that it had just $121 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 15th, $32 million of which is restricted or not immediately accessible. Fisker also said that its accounts payable balance is up to $182 million and that there is “substantial doubt” that it can continue operations without raising new capital.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fisker-lost-nissan-deal-putting-rescue-funds-at-risk">Fisker lost Nissan deal, putting rescue funds at risk</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>March 25</strong> <strong>—</strong> The negotiations between Fisker and a large automaker — reported to be Nissan — over a potential investment and collaboration <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-nissan-deal-dead-funding-bankruptcy/">were terminated</a>, a development that puts a separate near-term rescue funding effort in danger. Fisker revealed in a regulatory filing that the automaker terminated the negotiations March 22. It did not explain why. But the company had to keep the negotiations going as part of one of the closing conditions for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/18/fisker-production-pause-going-concern-cash-raise/">potential $150 million convertible note</a>. </p>

	
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trading-suspended-by-nyse">Trading suspended by NYSE</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>March 25</strong> — The New York Stock Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-trading-suspended-by-nyse/">suspended trading shares</a> of Fisker and moved to take the company off its stock exchange, because it is “no longer suitable for listing” because of “abnormally low” price levels. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fisker-lost-track-of-millions-of-dollars-in-customer-payments-for-months">Fisker lost track of millions of dollars in customer payments for months</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>March 27</strong> — Fisker temporarily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/27/fisker-misplaced-payments-internal-audit-bankruptcy/">lost track of millions of dollars in customer payments</a> as it scaled up deliveries, leading to an internal audit that started in December and took months to complete. Fisker struggled to keep tabs on these transactions, which included down payments and in some cases, the full price of the vehicles, because of lax internal procedures for keeping track of them, according to three people familiar with the internal payment crisis. In a few cases, it delivered vehicles without collecting any form of payment at all, they said. </p>

	
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-round-of-layoffs-to-preserve-cash">New round of layoffs to ‘preserve cash’</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>April 29</strong> — EV startup Fisker Inc. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/29/fisker-layoffs-staff-email-cuts-bankruptcy-sale/">is laying off more employees</a> to “preserve cash,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/23/fisker-more-layoffs-bankruptcy-ocean-suv/">making good on a plan announced one week before</a>, according to an internal email viewed by TechCrunch. Fisker expects to seek bankruptcy protection within the next 30 days if it can’t come up with that money, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory filing.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fisker-stiffed-engineering-firm">Fisker stiffed engineering firm</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>May 3</strong> — Fisker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/03/fisker-pear-alaska-lawsuit-engineering-class-action/">stopped paying the engineering firm</a> that helped develop the Pear, a low-cost EV meant for the masses, and the Alaska, Fisker’s entry into the red-hot pickup truck market. The firm also accuses Fisker of wrongfully holding onto IP associated with those vehicles. </p>

	
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fisker-ocean-faced-fourth-federal-safety-probe">Fisker Ocean faced fourth federal safety probe</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>May 10</strong> — The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/10/fisker-ocean-nhtsa-investigation-automatic-emergency-braking/">fourth investigation</a> into the Fisker Ocean SUV to probe multiple claims of “inadvertent Automatic Emergency Braking.” The eight complaints allege that owners experienced sudden activation of the Automatic Emergency Braking system in moments where there were no other vehicles or obstructions in the path of their cars. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hundreds-of-workers-cut-to-keep-ev-startup-alive">Hundreds of workers cut to keep EV startup alive</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>May 29</strong> — An additional hundreds of employees were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/29/fisker-layoffs-workers-restructuring-bankruptcy/">laid off during the final week of May</a> in a bid to stay alive, as the automaker continues to search for funding, a buyout or prepare for bankruptcy. One current and one laid off employee estimated that only about 150 people had remained at the company. </p>

	
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-fisker-s-collapse">Inside Fisker’s collapse</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>May 31</strong> — The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/31/fisker-collapse-investigation-ev-ocean-suv-henrik-geeta/">road to Fisker’s ultimate ruin</a> may have started and ended with its flawed Ocean SUV, which was riddled with mechanical and software problems. But it was paved with hubris, power struggles, and the repeated failure to set up basic processes that are foundational for any automaker.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ocean-suv-issued-first-recall">Ocean SUV issued first recall</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary"><strong>June 12</strong> — Fisker issued the first recall for the Ocean SUV because of problems with the warning lights, according to new information published by the NHTSA. The instrument panel displays the brake, park and antilock brake system warning lights in the wrong font size and, at times, in the wrong color, making them non-compliant with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The agency also says “multiple warning lights fail to illuminate during the ignition cycle.”</p>

	
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fisker-filed-for-bankruptcy">Fisker filed for bankruptcy</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>June 18</strong> — After a year of struggling to stay afloat, Fisker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/ev-startup-fisker-files-for-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a>. The California-based company had been seeking a deal with another automaker in a last-ditch effort to rescue the enterprise. The company estimated assets of $500 to $1 billion and liabilities of between $100 million and $500 million, according to the filing. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fisker-failed-because-it-wasn-t-ready-to-be-a-car-company">Fisker failed because it wasn’t ready to be a car company</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>June 18</strong> — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/fisker-bankruptcy-failure-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the wake of its bankruptcy</a>, Fisker said it will continue “reduced operations,” including “preserving customer programs, and compensating needed vendors on a go-forward basis.” In other words, it will continue to manage a bare-bones operation in case there is a willing buyer of the assets it’s putting up for sale in the Chapter 11 case.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Apple Pay Later withdrawal</strong>: Apple has withdrawn its "Pay Later" service in the United States, which was set to allow consumers to buy now and pay later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TiLA: The Truth in Lending Act</strong>: The service seemed to fall within the scope of the federal law passed in 1968, which regulates the credit card industry and sets out consumer rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CFPB Investigation</strong>: The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau launched an investigation into Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) loans, including Apple Pay Later, back in 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposed Interpretive Rule</strong>: Last month, the CFPB proposed that BNPL loans, including Apple Pay Later, fall within the scope of the Truth in Lending Act (TiLA).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apple Pay Later subject to TiLA</strong>: As a result, Apple Pay Later would be subject to the rules and regulations of the Truth in Lending Act, which would have required the company to meet certain obligations and set out consumer rights.</p>

<p>We speculated at the time that the decision to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/17/apple-pay-later-united-states-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">withdraw Apple Pay Later</a> was probably driven by a desire to get ahead of upcoming legislation, and a piece today suggests that it’s actually a new interpretation of a very old law.</p>



<p>The Truth in Lending Act was passed in 1968, and grants consumers a number of protections when it comes to credit cards – and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/apple-pay-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple Pay Later</a> seemed set to fall within scope …</p>



<span id="more-954790"></span>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apple-pay-later-would-be-subject-to-tila">Apple Pay Later would be subject to TiLA</h2>



<p>The Truth in Lending Act (TiLA) is a federal law passed in 1968 which regulates the credit card industry. It sets out a range of obligations card companies have to meet, and sets out consumer rights which apply to purchase made with a credit card.</p>



<p>None of it applied to Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) loans like Apple Pay Later – but that’s changing. </p>



<p>The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) launched an investigation into these loans back in 2021, and <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_bnpl-interpretive-rule_2024-05.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last month proposed</a> that they fall within the scope of the TiLA.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>[The Bureau] is issuing this interpretive rule to address the applicability of subpart B of Regulation Z to lenders that issue digital user accounts used to access credit, including to those lenders that market loans as “Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL). This interpretive rule describes how these lenders meet the criteria for being “card issuers” for purposes of Regulation Z. Such lenders that extend credit are also “creditors” subject to subpart B of Regulation Z, including those provisions governing periodic statements and billing disputes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Essentially, this means that BNPL lenders have to be much more careful about their lending decisions, as <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/apple-abruptly-abandons-buy-now-pay-later-service-amid-regulatory-scrutiny/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arstechnica</a></em> reports.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“When consumers check out and choose Buy Now, Pay Later, they don’t know if they will get a refund if they return their product or whether the lender will help them if they didn’t get what was promised,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “Regardless of whether a shopper swipes a credit card or uses Buy Now, Pay Later, they are entitled to important consumer protections under longstanding laws and regulations already on the books.”</p>



<p>By getting out of the BNPL game, Apple can avoid requirements that the CFPB plans to impose on BNPL lenders, including potential obligations to investigate customer disputes, pause payments, provide refunds, and issue credits when necessary.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> would have engaged in any sketchy behavior, but the decision – if finalized – would have created a lot of potential paperwork for the company. Given the relatively small boost in sales that would have been achieved by such short-term loans, it’s likely Apple decided it simply didn’t want the headaches.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/luggage-on-american-airlines-flight-to-burbank-found-in-hollywood-homeless-encampment/">KTLA</a>) – A Southern California woman whose luggage went missing after an American Airlines flight into Hollywood Burbank Airport says she later found her bag in a Hollywood homeless encampment. </p>



<p>Aunny Grace said that after her May 29 American Airlines flight in Dallas, Texas, was canceled, she flew into Burbank on a different flight without her luggage.  </p>



<p>“Five days later, my luggage shows up at Burbank on a Sunday night,” she explained. “On Monday morning, I get a call from a carrier company that says they’ll have my luggage dropped off at my house.”  </p>







<p>However, Grace had an Apple AirTag inside her bag and could see that it was not being delivered to her home. Using the GPS tracker, she went to the area of Sunset Boulevard and Western Avenue to find her luggage.  </p>



<p>“When I arrived, my bag had slowly made its way down to Santa Monica and Western, and that is when I found my stuff, not my suitcase, but particles of my stuff in a homeless man’s shopping cart,” Grace said. “You kind of get to a point where you’re looking around the encampment and think, ‘I don’t even want my stuff back.’ I had toiletry bags that were dumped upside down. I had makeup bags. All the makeup was gone.”</p>



<p>She said she has no idea how her bag ended up at the homeless encampment but told Nexstar’s KTLA that she did see what appeared to be a lot of other stolen luggage in the area.  </p>





<p>“That day, I saw dozens of suitcases, brand new suitcases, name brand suitcases strewn across Western and Sunset,” Grace said. “Rows and rows of suitcases, bicycles, baby strollers with airline tags on them everywhere.”  </p>



<p>Now she’s demanding answers from American Airlines, filing a claim with the airline and reporting it to the police department. She has also hired an attorney. </p>



<p>Grace said the Burbank Airport area where the delayed luggage is stored is not secured and some bags are placed on the curb outside the terminal.  </p>





<p>“They showed me pictures of how American Airlines sets out luggage for people to pick up, but I don’t put this on the homeless people,” she said. “I put this on the airline. American Airlines is responsible for my bag that they practically force you to check at the gate. This is on them.”  </p>





<p>While she recovered a few personal items from her luggage, she says the things she lost, including medical equipment related to her job, were worth $6,000.  </p>



<p>So far, according to Grace, American Airlines has offered her $1,700 for her lost luggage.  </p>

<p>As anticipated, <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/china/">China</a> and its massive network of EV OEMs are not pleased with the EU Commission’s recent decision to impose tariffs on Chinese-built vehicles. In retaliation, Chinese automakers have implored their government to increase tariffs on imported European cars.</p>



<span id="more-368273"></span>



<p>Today’s automotive trade news is the latest jab thrown in an ongoing bout between China and Europe. Following <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/31/eu-delays-decision-on-chinese-ev-tariffs-european-parliament-elections/">an anti-subsidy probe</a> that began last fall, the EU Commission determined that Chinese-built EVs have an unfair advantage in European markets. </p>



<p>Even before the commission shared the results of its probe, the EU was already <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/31/eu-delays-decision-on-chinese-ev-tariffs-european-parliament-elections/">threatening tariffs on Chinese imports</a>, following the lead of the US, which recently upped tariffs to 100%. As China awaited the probe’s results, it threatened tariffs of its own against European automakers, vowing to <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/24/china-threatens-tariffs-up-to-25-imports-retaliation-eu-probe-us-tariffs/">implement upcharges up to 25%</a> on gasoline vehicles imported into China.</p>



<p>EU automakers like BMW, Volkswagen Group, and Mercedes-Benz could be directly affected by tariffs in China. As a result, <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/06/14/germany-peace-halting-softening-incoming-tariffs-chinese-evs-eu/">Germany has already publicly spoken out </a>against tariffs on Chinese EVs in hopes both sides can reach a trade resolution before they take effect.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, despite the looming tariffs, Chinese EV automakers have expressed a steeled resolve to continue expanding into European markets. Locally, however, those same OEMs are requesting the Chinese government raise the proposed tariffs on EU automakers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chinese-oems-want-higher-tariffs-on-eu-imports">Chinese OEMs want higher tariffs on EU imports</h2>



<p>According to the Chinese state-backed <em>Global Times</em> newspaper, local EV automakers have urged Beijing to hike its tariffs on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-automakers-urge-beijing-raise-tariffs-large-gasoline-vehicles-imported-eu-2024-06-19/">combustion vehicles imported from Europe</a> in retaliation for the EU Commission’s recent actions to deter Chinese-made EVs in markets overseas.</p>



<p>The report states that China’s Ministry of Commerce held a meeting in Beijing on Tuesday with big names in automotive, such as SAIC, BYD, BMW, Volkswagen, and Porsche. During the meeting, Chinese OEMs called on their government to “adopt firm countermeasures (and) suggested that positive consideration be given to raising the provisional tariff on gasoline cars with large-displacement engines.”</p>



<p>Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, and Renault were reportedly also present. The meeting appears to have been a rallying attempt to get EU automakers to help pressure the Commission in Brussels to at least ease tariffs, if not nix them altogether. </p>



<p>German automakers have a lot of skin in the game in markets on both sides of the world, and their attendance in Beijing proves that Europe’s automotive leader is, at the very least, trying to ease trade tensions.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the EU Commission acknowledged the retaliatory threat of Chinese tariffs and appeared open to negotiating, stating it is monitoring the situation “with a view to discussing if a mutually agreeable solution can be found.”</p>



<p>The EU’s tariffs on Chinese-made EVs are currently slated to take effect on July 4, 2024, so there’s still time for the two regions to reach a solution.</p>

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><p>The pessimism that has gripped the global oil market for weeks as traders suspect weakening demand growth this week began to dissipate, replaced by signs of emerging optimism. All because OPEC repeated what it had said at its June 2 meeting.</p><p>At that meeting, the cartel’s leaders announced they may consider rolling back some of the production cuts they agreed upon last year, possibly later in 2024, if market conditions are favorable. What traders heard, however, was that they would for sure roll back those cuts. Prices slumped. OPEC had to say what it had said again, more emphatically.
</p>

<p></p><p>“Those funds who thought we were heading into a production battle, had their concerns quickly assuaged when OPEC+ members went on a PR campaign to assure the world their changes to production would be market dependent,” StoneX oil analyst Alex Hodes <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-prices-inch-down-weaker-us-consumer-demand-ahead-china-data-2024-06-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Reuters on Monday.</p><p>The emerging sentiment also got a boost from expectations for strong fuel demand this driving season in the United States. The reversal in prices, as they snapped a three-week losing streak, comes despite sub-expectation industrial activity data from China. The country reported factory output growth of 5.6% which would normally be a solid enough figure. However, analysts had expected growth of 6%, so the actual reading was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/chinas-may-industrial-output-misses-forecasts-retail-sales-bright-spot-2024-06-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dubbed</a> disappointing by Reuters. <span><strong class="related"> <a href="/Metals/Commodities/Brazil-Looks-To-Challenge-Chinas-Dominance-in-Rare-Earth-Minerals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Related: Brazil Looks To Challenge China’s Dominance in Rare Earth Minerals</a></strong></span></p><div>

</div><p>Yet even this could not dampen oil trader optimism once it sank in that OPEC was not going to return any supply to market unless the price was right. Reuters’ John Kemp <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/oil-funds-temper-bearishness-after-opec-reassurance-kemp-2024-06-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in his latest column that speculators had bought back some of the oil futures they’d sold immediately after the last OPEC+ meeting, with the total purchases at the equivalent of 80 million barrels over the week to June 11.</p><p>Still, Kemp wrote that overall bearishness remained the dominant sentiment among oil speculators because of the spare capacity that OPEC+ has and because of rising production from places like the United States, Guyana, and Brazil. Interestingly, energy consultancy Rystad Energy recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/oil-supply-growth-set-taper-2024-rystad-energy-says-2024-06-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted</a> that global oil supply growth will be virtually non-existent this year because of the OPEC+ cuts without mentioning spare capacity.</p><p>The firm pointed to the OPEC+ cuts and their recent extension into next year and noted that “US shale remains a trustworthy source of growth, though less elastic to price changes and more consolidated after continued rounds of mergers and acquisitions. This reduces the short-term upside potential for a surprise in US growth.”</p><p>Indeed, the Energy Information Administration recently <a href="/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/EIA-US-Crude-Oil-Production-to-Average-132-million-bpd-in-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecast</a> this year’s average oil production rate in the U.S. at 13.2 million barrels daily, which would be a modest 2% increase on the year. Next year, the EIA sees output rising by another half a million barrels daily to 13.7 million barrels daily.
</p>


<p></p><p>With the consolidation underway in U.S. shale and with the uncertainty around what direction oil prices will go into on any day, let alone over a longer horizon, drillers are not exactly eager to drill. The claim that whatever happens anywhere else U.S. shale will step in to ensure sufficient supply no longer holds true in the age of capital discipline and investor returns above all else.</p><p>Meanwhile, volatility remains heightened. One weekly EIA report is all it would take to reverse the course of prices in case it suggests fuel demand is falling short of expectations. Some believe it would take even less because a lot of the recent buying that saw prices inch higher was in fact covering of short positions, according to Mizuho Securities’ <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/crude-oil-prices-today.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bob Yawger</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, a bullish EIA report on inventories would push prices further up—and create a problem for the Biden administration, which is already considering more emergency releases from the SPR to keep gas prices lower in the months ahead of the November elections.</p><p></p><p>By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com</p><p><strong>More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:</strong></p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Five US cities are considered "impossibly unaffordable" when it comes to housing, with San Jose, California, being the least affordable housing market in the US and the 4th most unaffordable in the English-speaking world.</li>
<li>Four of the top 10 least affordable housing markets on the list were in California, with Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego also ranking in the top 10.</li>
<li>The gap between housing costs and income has widened since the pandemic, triggering a cost-of-living crisis for many American families. The report found that affordability is disappearing in high-income nations as housing costs now far outpace income growth.</li>
<li>The study blames land use policies that "artificially restrict housing supply" and drive up land prices as a major contributor to the crisis. A separate Zillow report found that the US housing shortage stands at 4.5 million homes, exacerbating the issue.</li>
<li>As a result of the crisis, home prices continue to hit record highs, with mortgage rates staying steady, making it difficult for many people to afford homes.</li>

<p>Researchers at Chapman University and the Frontier Centre for Public Policy in Canada <a href="http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analyzed 94 major cities</a> in eight countries and determined San Jose, California is the least affordable housing market in the U.S. The Silicon Valley metro was the fourth most unaffordable in the English-speaking world.</p>



<p>In fact, four of the top 10 least affordable housing markets on the list were in California: Los Angeles (5th), San Franciso (8th) and San Diego (10th). Honolulu (6th) was the only city outside the Golden State ranked near the top. </p>





<p>“Restrictive housing policies may be packaged as progressive, but in social terms, their impact could better be characterized as regressive,” Joel Kotkin, Director for Chapman’s Center for Demographics and Policy, said in the report.</p>



<p>The rankings were based on each metro’s price-to-income ratio, which is the median house price divided by the median household income. The report found the gap between housing costs and income has widened since the pandemic, triggering a cost-of-living crisis for many American families. </p>



<p>“For decades, home prices generally rose at about the same rate as income, and homeownership became more widespread,” said Wendell Cox, the study’s author. “But affordability is disappearing in high-income nations as housing costs now far outpace income growth.”</p>







<p>As for what’s driving the crisis, the report blamed land use policies that “artificially restrict housing supply” and drive up land prices.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/housing-shortage-rose-2022/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/housing-shortage-rose-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">separate Zillow report</a> out this week found the U.S. housing shortage now stands at 4.5 million homes. That deficit is one of the reasons prices continue to <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/home-sales-historic-lows-prices-record/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/home-sales-historic-lows-prices-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit record highs</a> even as mortgage rates remain elevated. </p>



<p>Even with those issues, the Chapman study did have some good news for Americans. Researchers found nine of the ten most affordable cities were in the U.S. </p>



<p>Of the nearly 100 cities analyzed, Pittsburgh’s housing market was the most affordable, followed by Rochester and St. Louis. Cleveland, Buffalo and Detroit also ranked near the top for affordability. </p>





<p>The three least affordable housing markets were all outside the U.S.: Hong Kong, China; Sydney, Australia; and Vancouver, Canada.</p>

<li><strong>The UK economy is expected to continue growing, but not all is well</strong>: While inflation has returned to target, living standards are still dropping due to a cost of living crisis, and mortgage rates are higher than they have been in years.</li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Party is hailing the news as a success for their economic plan</strong>: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called the news "great news" and said the economy has "turned a corner", but the main opposition Labour Party disagrees.</li>
<li><strong>The fall in inflation is not necessarily a cause for widespread celebration</strong>: The decline in inflation is seen as a sign of a more stable economic environment, but few economists believe the Bank of England will reduce its main interest rate on Thursday, and some policymakers remain concerned about the scale of price pressure in the economy.</li>

                                        <p>LONDON (AP) — Inflation in the U.K. returned to the Bank of England’s target rate of 2% for the first time in nearly three years, official figures showed Wednesday, a development that was seized on by the governing Conservative Party as evidence that its economic plan is “working” ahead of the July 4 election.</p><p>The Office for National Statistics said inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, fell to 2% in the year to May from <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-economy-inflation-interest-rates-090db19af939b9c532da1fb15ab40a0a">2.3% the month before</a></span>, with food prices providing the biggest downward contribution.</p><p>The decline does not mean that prices are falling — they are just rising at a slower rate than they have for the past few years during <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-election-cost-of-living-crisis-inflation-6780ffee1c3f0170ee95fc54f9d53842">a cost of living crisis</a></span> that has seen living standards drop for millions across Britain.

<p>However, Rachel Reeves, who will become Treasury chief if the main opposition Labour Party wins the election, said working people are “worse off” with mortgage rates higher than they have been for years and taxes at a 70-year high.</p><p>Sunak betted that the more stable economic environment would help his Conservatives when he surprised many and called an earlier election than expected after last month’s drop in inflation. However, opinion polls have barely budged over the past four weeks and Labour retains a clear lead in polls. The opposition party is widely expected to return to power for the first time since 2010.</p>



<p>The fall in inflation follows nearly three years of above-target inflation. The last time inflation was at 2% was in July 2021 before prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues during the coronavirus pandemic and then because of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a></span>, which pushed up energy costs.</p>
    
<p>Despite the decline, few economists think the Bank of England will reduce its main interest rate from 5.25% on Thursday. Some policymakers are still concerned over the scale of price rises in the crucial services sector and the pace of wage increases, which raise the risks of an inflation rebound if interest rates are cut too soon. The consensus in financial markets is that rates will be cut in August or September.</p>
    

<p>“Despite this landmark fall in inflation, concerns over both underlying price pressures and changing policy in the run-up to a general election means a June interest rate cut is almost certainly off the table,” said Suren Thiru, economics director at The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales</p><p>The Bank of England, like the U.S. Fed and other central banks, raised interest rates aggressively in late 2021 from near zero to counter the rapid increase in inflation, which hit a peak of above 11% in late 2022.</p><p>Higher interest rates — which cool the economy by making it more expensive to borrow — have helped ease inflation, but they’ve also weighed on the British economy, which has barely grown since the pandemic rebound.</p><p>Labour leader Keir Starmer has stressed that upping the U.K.'s economic growth will be the driving mission of his government if he becomes prime minister on July 5.</p><p>In a blow to Sunak, billionaire John Caudwell, who has been a prominent donor to the Conservative Party, said he was now supporting Labour for the first time having become convinced that Starmer was serious about wealth creation.</p>

The Big Three will likely have to take more drastic measures to shave off spending, Murphy warned, especially in the automakers' gas-engine operations, which provide the bulk of profits today.</p><p>“Very aggressively manage your core business. And it’s really some tough medicine. There's a lot of really hard work to do here,” Murphy said at the event, which was put on by the Automotive Press Association in a Detroit suburb.</p><p>China, the largest automotive market in the world, has proven inhospitable for many foreign automakers, especially in recent years.</p><p>It is difficult to overcome the strength of Chinese companies on their home turf, Murphy and other analysts noted. Buyers' loyalty to homegrown brands there is strong, and may become even stronger after the U.S. imposes a more than 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, effective Aug. 1, Murphy said.</p><p>Ford and GM’s sales in China have slipped over the last decade. The region used to be GM’s largest market, and the automaker is now fighting to post profits there. Ford, noting fierce competition from rivals such as BYD and Geely, is transforming its China business to become an export hub.</p><p>(Reporting by Nora Eckert; Editing by Marguerita Choy)</p></div></div>
