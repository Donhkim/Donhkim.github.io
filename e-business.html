<li>CDK, a software provider for car dealerships, is planning to pay a ransom to the hacking group behind the attack, which is believed to be based in eastern Europe.</li>

<p>CDK is planning to make the payment, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The hacking group behind the attack is believed to be based in eastern Europe, the person said. In the early days of any ransomware attack, discussions are fluid, and the situation could change. </p>



<p>CDK didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on Friday. </p>



<p>Since CDK discovered the breach and shut off systems on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-19/cyberattack-hits-software-provider-for-car-dealers-across-the-us" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-19/cyberattack-hits-software-provider-for-car-dealers-across-the-us" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">June 19</a>, chaos has ensued at many of the roughly 15,000 car dealerships that it counts as clients. CDK’s core product — a suite of software tools referred to as a dealership management system, or DMS — underpins virtually every element of auto retailers’ day-to-day business. So the outage hampered sales, interrupted repairs and delayed deliveries across an industry that topped <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-21/car-dealer-chaos-arises-from-cyberattack-on-1-2-trillion-market" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-21/car-dealer-chaos-arises-from-cyberattack-on-1-2-trillion-market" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">$1.2 trillion</a> in US sales last year. The disruptions also are hitting amid an end-of-quarter sales push.</p>



<p>“It’s just mass chaos at this point,” Diana Lee, the chief executive officer of Constellation, a marketing agency that works with auto dealerships across the US, said on Bloomberg Television. “The dealer’s required to actually run a DMS for sales, service, parts, for every single functionality — even stocking a vehicle, you can’t do it without the DMS system. So it is a disaster.” </p><p></p>



<p>CDK had briefly restored some services for a few hours on June 19, but was forced to deactivate them following a second cyberattack. On Thursday, the company warned dealers that their systems likely will not be available for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-20/car-dealers-are-idle-across-the-us-after-second-cyberattack" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-20/car-dealers-are-idle-across-the-us-after-second-cyberattack" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">several days</a>.</p>



<p>A demand in the tens of millions of dollars comes after hackers <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-18/uk-hospital-hackers-say-they-ve-demanded-50-million-in-ransom" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-18/uk-hospital-hackers-say-they-ve-demanded-50-million-in-ransom" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">sought $50 million</a> from a lab services company at the center of an ongoing ransomware attack that’s caused outages in London hospitals. <a href="https://fortune.com/company/unitedhealth-group/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/unitedhealth-group/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">UnitedHealth Group</a> Inc., the largest medical insurer in the US, acknowledged earlier this year <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-01/hacked-data-remains-a-mystery-after-change-healthcare-hearing" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-01/hacked-data-remains-a-mystery-after-change-healthcare-hearing" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">it paid hackers</a> a $22 million extortion fee.</p>



<p>CDK hasn’t said who or which entity is behind the intrusion, but it issued a warning to customers Thursday evening, saying that outside parties are reaching out to customers, attempting to capitalize on the confusion.</p>



<p>“We are aware that bad actors are contacting our customers, posing as members or affiliates of CDK, trying to obtain system access,” the company said. “CDK associates are not contacting customers for access to their environment or systems. Please only respond to known CDK employees and communications.”</p>



<p>There are only a handful of DMS companies for dealers to choose from after decades of consolidation within this corner of the car-retailing industry. As a result, thousands of stores are highly reliant on CDK’s services to line up financing and insurance, manage inventory of vehicles and parts, and complete sales and repairs.</p><p></p>



<p>The car dealer <a href="https://fortune.com/company/sonic-automotive/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/sonic-automotive/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sonic Automotive</a> Inc., which uses CDK to support critical dealership operations, said disruptions caused by the cyberattack are likely to have a “negative impact” on its operations until its systems have recovered, according to a Friday filing. Sonic hasn’t determined if the attack will have a material impact on its finances, and it has reopened all of its dealerships with workaround solutions to limit disruption, the company said.</p>



<p>CDK’s parent, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/brookfield-asset-management/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/brookfield-asset-management/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Brookfield</a> Business Partners LP, had its worst trading day since October — plunging 5.7% on Thursday — and extended its decline Friday.

The eldest millennials <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/typical-40-year-old-oldest-millennials-debt-net-worth-earnings-2021-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">turn 43</a> this year, according to the <a target="_blank" rel=" nofollow" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>Pew Research Center's definition</u></a>, and the majority of the generation has entered peak milestone years of homebuying and starting families.</p><p class="premium">Soon, the generation will age out of their 20s entirely and leave young adulthood behind. The youngest of the generation, born in 1995 and 1996, turn 28 and 29 this year, and just under 9 million 20-something millennials remain, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-national-detail.html" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">per the US Census</a>. This cohort falls into cusper territory, those born between generations, and are part of the larger "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spotting-zillennials-millenial-gen-z-tiktok-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Zillennial</a>" microgeneration.</p><p class="premium">Not quite millennial, not quite Gen Z, these late 20-somethings are shaped by the pandemic happening early on in their careers and initial wealth-building years. In some ways, they're actually faring better than their older millennial peers, and their struggles point to larger cracks in America's social support systems.</p><h2 id="7edd6569-b00b-494c-ac42-72ec8eefba36" data-toc-id="7edd6569-b00b-494c-ac42-72ec8eefba36" class="premium"><strong>A bridge in the workplace</strong></h2><p class="premium">Diana Elliott, vice president of programs at Population Reference Bureau (PRB), told Business Insider that one's late 20s have always been peak years to establish careers. However, these particular late 20-somethings saw the pandemic shorten their typical in-office experience more than the rest of their generation. They were only 24 and 25 at the time, in the workforce for just a few years, and they fear it gave them an uneven footing in the labor force.</p><p class="premium">"They feel this has negatively affected their ability to learn the soft skills that come from working in an office and may lead to missing out on growth opportunities," Gabby Davis, a career expert at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indeed.com/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">Indeed</a> and younger millennial herself, told Business Insider. But Davis said Indeed research shows they don't want to go back into an office full-time. While return-to-office mandates have the potential to push them away, she says the youngest millennials are more likely to stick around in a job than Gen Z, who view their jobs with more dispensability.</p><p class="premium">Cuspers often act as a bridge in the workplace, but younger millennials may find it challenging to bridge this generational gap when reporting to older colleagues and managing younger ones, Davis said. But they've already pushed for greater flexibility, communication, and transparency at work, which she thinks can help them ease that transition. Millennials, now the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/04/28/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers-as-americas-largest-generation/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">largest generation</a>, will continue to move into leadership roles as they age into their 30s and 40s which Davis believes will help "foster diversity, accountability, and more meaningful workplaces."</p><p class="premium">As the generation ages, Elliott predicts they'll start taking over boomers' roles as they retire. "We're going to see a lot of exits from the labor force, not just now but into the next decade or so," she says. "So it could be a really interesting time for opportunities for young millennials in the labor market."</p><h2 id="8157dcf1-280c-4073-80a1-e4aa7cceef67" data-toc-id="8157dcf1-280c-4073-80a1-e4aa7cceef67" class="premium"><strong>Rollin' in the dough</strong></h2><p class="premium">At first glance, it seemed the pandemic might also jeopardize the wealth trajectory of the youngest millennials and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-class-of-2020-a-look-at-gen-z-as-it-graduates-into-chaos" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">oldest Gen Zers</a>. Older millennials struggled with the aftermath of the Great Recession and 2008 financial crisis, the rising cost of living, and $1.2 trillion in student loan debt.</p><p class="premium">In 2018, the St. Louis Fed predicted that those born in the 1980s were at risk of being a "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/1980s-millennials-wealth-the-great-recession-2018-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">lost generation</a>" when it came to wealth accumulation. Fortunately, that didn't come to pass: By 2022, their wealth levels were 37% above expectations. But the wealth of younger millennials and older Gen Zers made an even sharper swing at 39%.</p><p class="premium">That wealth is even more striking when compared to their older peers at the same age. In 2013, 24- to 33-year-olds had a typical wealth level of $16,567, per data the St. Louis Fed provided Business Insider. That's more than doubled (even accounting for inflation) for those aged 26 to 32 in 2022, who have a typical wealth level of $55,760.</p><p class="premium">It shows how much the macroeconomic context can change even within a generation. St. Louis Fed data scientist Lowell Ricketts told Business Insider at the end of May, "you have these older millennials still grappling with some of the aftermath of the Great Recession, a subdued economy in which employment outcomes languish for some time," he said. "Younger millennials have made it by 2022 through much of the pandemic disruptions and found themselves with a much higher amount of wealth accumulated."</p><p class="premium">Ricketts said the coronavirus recession's shorter duration and more aggressive federal policy response saved them. A government cash infusion and a lockdown that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/henrys-millennials-pandemic-reopening-financial-challenges-2020-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">prevented us from spending on trips and dinners out</a> "buoyed a lot of financial outcomes across the wealth spectrum," making 2022 an overall high-water mark for wealth accumulation.</p><h2 id="0b639908-5cdb-46ab-a460-2f9c4335c4e3" data-toc-id="0b639908-5cdb-46ab-a460-2f9c4335c4e3" class="premium"><strong>Creatively becoming homeowners</strong></h2><p class="premium">The Fed finds that real estate was a primary driver for younger millennials' wealth gains, as a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/housing-market-forecast-millennials-buying-homes-crisis-2021-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">hot pandemic housing market</a> hiked up home values. But aren't millennials <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/first-time-homebuyer-challenges-starter-home-shortage-millennials-gen-z-2021-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">unable to buy homes</a>, especially those who've had less time to save? Ricketts said that despite affordability issues, some have managed to make it work.</p><p class="premium">Younger millennials are getting creative about becoming homeowners, explained Jessica Lautz, deputy chief economist and vice president of research at the National Association of Realtors. They're living at home first to save money or partnering up — 19% of those aged 25 to 33, which includes the youngest millennials, are unmarried couples, the highest NAR sees among any generation in its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/home-buyer-and-seller-generational-trends" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">Generational Trends Report</a>.</p><p class="premium">They're also the most likely to get down payment transfers, often from family members helping out with the purchase. Maybe that's why 55% of them prefer to live near friends and family; the only other generation that comes close to this preference is retirees. "They're moving from their family members' homes, before purchasing at higher rates, so perhaps they have that strong family connection already," Lautz said. "During COVID, a lot of people reprioritized what's important to them, and family is more important."</p><h2 id="b73814ff-9863-435b-9c94-4ec056a32a92" data-toc-id="b73814ff-9863-435b-9c94-4ec056a32a92" class="premium"><strong>A mixed bag for women</strong></h2><p class="premium">Young millennial women have especially seen their economic well-being improve; the rise of educational opportunities has them outearning what their mothers and grandmothers did relative to men, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prb.org/resources/losing-more-ground/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">PRB research</a>. "The pay gap is closing with every successive cohort," Elliott said.</p><p class="premium">Because younger millennial women are focused on their careers, they're continuing the overall millennial trend of delaying family formation. The US fertility rate decreased by 3% between 2022 and 2023, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2024/20240525.htm" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">reaching a historic</a> low. "What this suggests is that younger millennials will likely have smaller families," Elliott said. This is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/birth-rate-decline-pandemic-millennials-change-reshaped-economy-infrastructure-2021-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">neither good nor bad</a>, but interplays with other economic factors such as housing affordability, getting a foothold in the work world, and student debt.</p><p class="premium">Of course, generations are nuanced. Not everyone is faring well; some millennials are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-typical-alice-middle-class-poverty-housing-food-benefits-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">stuck in poverty</a>, and young millennial women have lost ground in terms of health and safety. "Systems and supports are not in place to understand how to best help people," Elliott said. "We need that right now. In terms of maternal mortality, it reflects a lot of the ways in which the U.S. does not do as well as its peer countries."</p><p class="premium">And some of younger millennials' accumulated wealth has faded thanks to inflation, Ricketts said. Still, he's hopeful that "the wealth outcomes we see in 2022 might be an optimistic note and a source of strength going forward."</p><p class="premium">He pointed out that younger millennials who invest their wealth well are more likely to consume and drive economic growth. "Having entrepreneurial aspirations while having wealth on hand lets you pursue those dreams," he said. So, by investing in oneself and one's passions, this can benefit the broader economy as well."</p></div>

Announcements of cancellations for certain trains continued throughout the afternoon.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The changes come after a disastrous day of rail service disruptions and cancelations <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/amtrak-njtransit-rail-service-delayed-penn-station-due-overhead-wire/14981317/" target="_blank">on Thursday afternoon</a> on the Northeast Corridor.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">NJ Transit and Amtrak service was suspended just before 3 p.m. on Thursday due to power issues. A malfunctioning circuit breaker caused the widespread issue, resulting in a loss of power on the tracks between New York Penn Station and Newark Penn Station.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy"><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/nj-traffic-brush-fire-secaucus-impacting-traffic-new/14981424/" target="_blank">An unrelated brush fire in the area</a> complicated the repairs, according to NJ Transit.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">This was the latest in a string of incidents that have adversely impacted rail commuters.  <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/overhead-wire-issues-suspend-service-new-york-penn/14969643/" target="_blank">On Tuesday, NJ Transit and Amtrak commuters experienced delays and cancelations</a> due to overhead wire problems in the morning and later a stalled train outside Penn Station.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">NJ Transit and CEO Kevin Corbett released the following statement Friday afternoon, and called the issues "unacceptable."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"We are as frustrated as our customers, and the frequency and impact these issues are having on our customers' quality of life is clearly unacceptable. Regarding today's incident specifically, we've had rail maintenance supervisors positioned at Newark Penn Station to inspect trains in light of the recent incidents. The train involved was inspected thoroughly before leaving Newark, including the pantograph, and no defects were found," Corbett said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Corbett went on to say that they are working with Amtrak to identify root causes of the recent spate of incidents.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"For instance, Amtrak reported that yesterday's incident was caused by one of their circuit breakers impacting power between Philadelphia and New Haven," Corbett said. "What we can say is that we operate approximately 700 trains every weekday along hundreds of miles of track on 11 rail lines with the same equipment and these incidents are mainly occurring on just this one stretch of track on the NEC between Newark and New York. We continue to offer Amtrak our assistance to resolve the issue."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">But perhaps a piece of good news to emerge from the difficult transportation week in the Garden State, New Jersey has a <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/nj-transit-funding-new-jersey-has-tentative-tax/14986070/" target="_blank">tentative agreement in place</a> with the state's most profitable companies to temporarily pay higher taxes to fund NJ Transit.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Under the plan, the 600 corporations in the state that make at least $10 million a year in profits will pay a 2.5% tax on all earnings for five years.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In return, the state will not pursue restoring the sales tax to 7% from to 6.625%, a major point of contention for the businesses, who strongly oppose increasing the corporate tax rate.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Both the "transit tax" and a final state budget still need to be approved by the Legislature next week.

<ol>
<li>In April 2019, David Ginsberg, a Meta executive, emailed Mark Zuckerberg with a proposal to study and mitigate loneliness and compulsive use on Instagram and Facebook.</li>
<li>Ginsberg highlighted the company's concerns about the impact of its products, particularly on teen mental health and addiction.</li>
<li>The proposal requested 24 engineers, researchers, and other staff to address these issues on Instagram, which was seen as having a "deficit" in this area.</li>
<li>The project was initially rejected due to staffing constraints by Susan Li, then Meta's finance chief.</li>
<li>Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, subsequently also declined to fund the project, ultimately killing the initiative to address loneliness and compulsive use on the platform.</li>

<ol>
<li>A three-bedroom, two-bathroom home in San Francisco's Russian Hill neighborhood has been listed for sale at a surprisingly low price of $488,000, despite being valued at over $1.5 million just last month.</li>
<li>The catch is that the home currently has a tenant living there who is paying only $416.67 in monthly rent and is not expected to leave for at least another 30 years, until 2053.</li>
<li>The tenant's lease is reportedly so strong that it grants them rent rate amount restrictions, an unconventional method of payment, and possible occupancy rights until 2053.</li>
<li>The seller is selling the home "as-is" and is not guaranteeing access to the property, which is why buyers are warned to review the seller's disclosure package and consult with a lawyer before making an offer.</li>
<li>The home's value has declined by over 60% in just the past month, from $1.5 million to $488,000, according to Zillow's Zestimate.</li>

    <div><p>A three-bedroom, two-bathroom home built in 1924 in an upscale San Francisco neighborhood saw its value tumble after the recently listed property came with a major catch.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>The single-family house on North View Court in Russian Hill <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/30-N-View-Ct-San-Francisco-CA-94109/15070477_zpid/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/30-N-View-Ct-San-Francisco-CA-94109/15070477_zpid/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/30-N-View-Ct-San-Francisco-CA-94109/15070477_zpid/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">went on the market for $488,000 on Zillow</a> two weeks ago. That looks like a steal considering other homes on the cul-de-sac are valued at well above $1 million, with one approaching $3 million.</p>



<p>But any buyer would have to wait decades to actually move in because there’s a tenant living there who’s only paying $416.67 in monthly rent and isn’t going anywhere for a while.</p>



<p>“Tenant’s current lease appears to grant tenants strong long term rent rate amount restrictions, unconventional method of rental payment, and possible occupancy rights until 2053,” the <a href="https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Zillow</a> listing says. “This is an AS-IS sale and seller hereby reserves the right to reject, counter and/or accept any offer. Seller &amp; listing agent do not guarantee access to the home and STRONGLY recommend buyers review the seller disclosure package/addenda and confer with a San Francisco landlord/tenant attorney BEFORE making offer.”</p>



<p>The home’s previous owner was more than 100 years old and died by natural causes in the home, the listing adds.</p><p></p>



<p>Despite the home’s “nice curb appeal” and Edwardian-style design, its $488,000 list price is well below Zillow’s $526,500 “<a href="https://www.zillow.com/z/zestimate/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.zillow.com/z/zestimate/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.zillow.com/z/zestimate/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Zestimate</a>” and down sharply from its value of $1.5 million just last month, according to the <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/22/real-estate/san-francisco-home-hits-market-for-488k-but-buyers-have-to-wait-30-years-to-move-in/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://nypost.com/2024/06/22/real-estate/san-francisco-home-hits-market-for-488k-but-buyers-have-to-wait-30-years-to-move-in/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://nypost.com/2024/06/22/real-estate/san-francisco-home-hits-market-for-488k-but-buyers-have-to-wait-30-years-to-move-in/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">New York Post</a></em>, representing a decline of more than 60%.</p>



<p>The house still drew a drew long line of prospective buyers last week, <a href="https://abc30.com/post/san-francisco-russian-hill-home-sale-cant-move-in/14982412/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://abc30.com/post/san-francisco-russian-hill-home-sale-cant-move-in/14982412/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://abc30.com/post/san-francisco-russian-hill-home-sale-cant-move-in/14982412/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">local TV reports</a> said. That may be because the listing advertises the home as “an excellent investment opportunity for just the right buyer.”</p>



<p>Douglas Lee, a real estate agent with <a href="https://fortune.com/company/compass/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/compass/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Compass</a>, told the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-06-21/a-house-under-500k-in-the-bay-area-catch-is-theres-a-tenant-until-2053" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-06-21/a-house-under-500k-in-the-bay-area-catch-is-theres-a-tenant-until-2053" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a> that the home is an opportunity to “land bank,” or defer using the property for long time.</p>



<p>“You sit and wait until that tenant either dies, vacates or the lease ends,” he told the <em>Times</em>. “Once that happens, you realize a ton of your potential. That’s a really good purchase for trust fund people. If you’re buying it for your kid who is like zero or 1, in 18 years you know that this thing will be about ready to realize.”</p>



<p>The relatively cheap property is contrast with the overall housing market, which has grown increasingly unaffordable, especially in places like California.</p><p></p>



<p>Nationwide, the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/21/housing-market-crisis-home-prices-record-high-existing-sales-inventory/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/21/housing-market-crisis-home-prices-record-high-existing-sales-inventory/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/06/21/housing-market-crisis-home-prices-record-high-existing-sales-inventory/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">price on sales of existing homes</a> jumped to a fresh record high in May even as the supply increased. In addition, Zillow says <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/16/housing-market-crisis-impossibly-unaffordable-cities-california-feudalizing-land-home-prices/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/16/housing-market-crisis-impossibly-unaffordable-cities-california-feudalizing-land-home-prices/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/06/16/housing-market-crisis-impossibly-unaffordable-cities-california-feudalizing-land-home-prices/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">buyers must now put down roughly 35%</a>, or almost $128,000, to afford a typical home.</p>

<li>The US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has imposed sanctions on 12 individuals serving executive and senior leadership roles at Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity company.</li>

<li>The OFAC sanctions do not extend to Kaspersky Lab, its parent or subsidiary companies, or the company's founder and CEO, Eugene Kaspersky. The 12 individuals sanctioned are high-level executives and board members.</li>

<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions against a dozen individuals serving executive and senior leadership roles at Kaspersky Lab, a day after the Russian company was <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/06/us-bans-kaspersky-software-citing.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">banned</a> by the Commerce Department.</p>
<p>The move "underscores our commitment to ensure the integrity of our cyber domain and to protect our citizens against malicious cyber threats," Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian E. Nelson, said.</p>
<p>"The United States will take action where necessary to hold accountable those who would seek to facilitate or otherwise enable these activities."</p>

<p>The sanctions, however, do not extend to Kaspersky Lab, its parent or subsidiary companies, nor the company's founder and chief executive officer (CEO), Eugene Kaspersky, OFAC noted. The 12 C-suite and senior-level executives sanctioned are listed below -</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrei Gennadyevich Tikhonov, Chief Operating Officer (COO) and board member</li>
<li>Daniil Sergeyevich Borshchev, Deputy CEO and board member</li>
<li>Andrei Anatolyevich Efremov, Chief Business Development Officer (CBDO) and board member</li>
<li>Igor Gennadyevich Chekunov, Chief Legal Officer (CLO) and board member</li>
<li>Andrey Petrovich Dukhvalov, Vice President and Director of Future Technologies</li>
<li>Andrei Anatolyevich Suvorov, Head of Kaspersky Operating System Business Unit</li>
<li>Denis Vladimirovich Zenkin, Head of Corporate Communications</li>
<li>Marina Mikhaylovna Alekseeva, Chief Human Resources (HR) Officer</li>
<li>Mikhail Yuryevich Gerber, Executive Vice President of Consumer Business</li>

<li>Kirill Aleksandrovich Astrakhan, Executive Vice President for Corporate Business</li>
<li>Anna Vladimirovna Kulashova, Managing Director for Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)</li>
</ul>
<p>The development follows actions by the Commerce Department prohibiting Kaspersky from providing its software and other security services in America starting July 20, 2024, citing national security concerns. The company has also been placed on the Entity List.</p>

<p>Russia has said the sales ban on Kaspersky software was a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/kremlin-says-us-decision-ban-kaspersky-software-designed-stifle-competition-2024-06-21/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">typical move</a> by the U.S. to stifle foreign competition with American products. Kaspersky has maintained that it has no links to the Russian government.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Culdesac is a car-free neighborhood</strong>: Culdesac is the first car-free neighborhood built from scratch in the US, and it is located in Tempe, Arizona. Cars are not allowed on the streets, and residents are offered discounts on transportation services like Waymo, a self-driving car.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No parking on site</strong>: Unlike traditional neighborhoods, Cars are not allowed on site, and residents can't park their own vehicles on site. This encourages residents to use alternative modes of transportation, such as biking, walking, and transit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Affordable housing</strong>: The community has 180 residents with plans to grow to over 1,000. Apartments range from studios to three-bedroom units, and prices start at around $1,400 a month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unique live-work spaces</strong>: One resident, Jada Stratman, moved into a live-work space in February, where she has a retail front-facing shop to the public and also lives in the back. Her rent is $1,472 per month, and she pays an additional $140 for utilities and Internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Redefined car dependency</strong>: The community's focus on biking, walking, and transit rather than cars and parking has had a positive impact on Stratman. She feels like she has gotten out of her comfort zone and is more excited to interact with her customers.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposed rule to restrict US investments in China</strong>: The US Treasury Department has proposed a rule to restrict and monitor US investments in China for artificial intelligence, computer chips, and quantum computing. The rule is aimed at preventing China from using US funds to develop advanced technologies that could enhance its military capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Background: President Biden's executive order</strong>: The proposed rule stems from President Joe Biden's August 2023 executive order that restricts access to American dollars funding advanced technologies that could enhance the military capabilities of "countries of concern", specifically China, Hong Kong, and Macau.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Restrictions on funding AI systems in China</strong>: The proposed rule prohibits American investors from funding AI systems in China that could be used for military applications, such as weapons targeting, combat, and location tracking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact on investors and companies</strong>: The proposal requires US citizens and permanent residents to provide specific information when engaging in transactions related to these technologies. It also places compliance burdens on the private sector, which will need to conduct due diligence and ensure compliance with the new outbound investment program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support from business organizations</strong>: The US-China Business Council, a nonprofit organization of American firms that do business in China, supports the Biden administration's efforts to protect US national security while also promoting robust commercial exchange with China.</p>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Treasury Department on Friday fleshed out a proposed rule that would restrict and monitor U.S. investments in China for artificial intelligence, computer chips and quantum computing.</p><p>The proposed rule stems from President Joe Biden’s August 2023 executive order <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-china-investment-ai-national-security-dd6a5b138e6c7cba31468dc89f776e8d">regarding the access that “countries of concern”</a></span> have to American dollars that fund advanced technologies, which the U.S. government says would enhance their military, intelligence, surveillance and cyber capabilities. The order identified China, Hong Kong and Macau as countries of concern.</p><p>The Biden administration has sought to stymie the development of technologies by China, the world’s second-largest economy, that could give it a military edge or enable it to dominate emerging sectors such as electric vehicles.</p><p>In addition to the proposed rule, Democrat Biden has also placed <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-byd-auto-seagull-auto-ev-cae20c92432b74e95c234d93ec1df400">a stiff tariff on Chinese EVs</a></span>, an issue with political implications as the president and Republican Donald Trump are both trying to show voters who can best stand up to China, a geopolitical rival and major trading partner.</p>
    

<p>The proposed rule outlines the required information that U.S. citizens and permanent residents must provide when engaging in transactions in this area, as well as what would be considered a violation of the restrictions.</p>



<p>It specifically would prohibit American investors from funding AI systems in China that could be used for weapons targeting, combat and location tracking, among other military applications, according to a senior Treasury official who previewed the rule for reporters on the condition of anonymity.</p>
    
<p>J. Philip Ludvigson, a partner at King &amp; Spalding and a former Treasury official for Investment Security, said “companies and investors are now getting a much better look at what will be expected of them” under the new outbound investment program. “These added details are particularly important because the private sector will be shouldering the many due diligence and compliance burdens associated with making new investments,” he said.</p>
    

<p>Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, a nonprofit organization of American firms that do business in China, said his organization “supports the Biden administration’s efforts to protect U.S. national security while also ensuring robust commercial exchange with China for the benefit of American companies, workers and our economy.”</p><p>Treasury is seeking comment on the proposal through Aug. 4, 2024, and after that is expected to issue a final rule.</p><p>Biden administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have insisted that they have no interest in “decoupling” from China — however, tensions between the two nations have increased in recent years. </p><p>After the U.S. military in February 2023 <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-china-antony-blinken-51e49202f2a0a50541cde059934c4cfb">shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the Carolina coast</a></span> after it traversed sensitive military sites across North America, China threatened repercussions. </p><p>Since then, incidents between the two nations based on national security concerns have regularly occurred.</p><p>For instance, Biden in May issued an order blocking a Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining firm from owning land near a Wyoming nuclear missile base, calling its proximity to the base a “national security risk.”</p>

<li>Apple is concerned that the Digital Markets Act (DMA) may force them to compromise the integrity of their products, which could risk user privacy and data security.</li>
<li>The company is willing to collaborate with the European Commission to find a solution that would allow them to deliver these features to EU customers without compromising their safety.</li>

<li><strong>U.S. bank regulators have ordered Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase to improve their plans for resolving their businesses in bankruptcy</strong>. The regulators want the banks to refine their "living wills" to show how they can safely unwind their derivatives portfolios.</li>
<li><strong>The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are concerned about the banks' ability to manage the risk, liquidity, or contingent liabilities on their derivatives portfolios</strong>, which are worth trillions of dollars in notional value.</li>
<li><strong>The banks will be required to detail how they will address these shortcomings by September</strong>. Bank of America, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs have declined to comment, while the FDIC has escalated its concerns with Citi's plan.</li>
<li><strong>Citi's plan has been deemed "deficient" by the FDIC</strong>, meaning the regulator found it not credible. If both regulators had found Citi's plan deficient, it would have been required to resubmit an improved plan and could have potentially faced additional regulatory restrictions.</li>
<li><strong>The regulators' actions are aimed at ensuring that big banks can be safely resolved in bankruptcy if needed</strong>, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the government's subsequent intervention. The goal is to prevent a similar crisis from occurring again.</li>

"It just tells us today that the Fed is not happy with the end result, and there's still work to be done."</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">What's happening with Citi?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The FDIC also escalated its concerns with Citi's plan to a "deficiency," meaning the regulator found it not credible, but the Fed did not follow suit. If both regulators had found Citi's plan deficient, it would have been required to resubmit an improved plan and could have potentially faced additional regulatory restrictions. Reuters previously reported the FDIC would issue the deficiency.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The split between regulators on the severity of Citi's deficiencies means the bank is on notice to make improvements, but not at risk of forced divestitures, TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a note.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, big banks were ordered to regularly submit resolution plans to regulators, detailing how they could be safely unwound without requiring government assistance. Those plans are assessed by regulators for credibility and feasibility.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Nearly all large banks have faced some sort of critique from regulators on their living wills and been ordered to beef up their plans. For example, in 2016, regulators found road maps from Bank of America, BNY, JP Morgan Chase, State Street, and Wells Fargo deficient, and flagged shortcomings for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Banks typically are able to address those concerns by submitting amended documents.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In a letter to Citi, regulators said weaknesses in its data and controls contributed to inaccurate calculations of the liquidity and capital needed to unwind derivatives positions.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The problems relate to issues identified in its 2021 living will, regulators said. They also directed the bank to provide "independent confirmation" that the issues are addressed, controls are functioning and results are reliable when it submits its 2025 plan.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Regulators also required Citi to outline its resolution plans for operations outside the U.S.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Citi has spent several years working to address regulatory concerns around its data management. Reuters reported in February that the bank received fresh regulatory directives to fix problems in late 2023.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We are fully committed to addressing the issues identified by our regulators," Citi said in a statement. "While we’ve made substantial progress on our transformation, we’ve acknowledged that we have had to accelerate our work in certain areas, including improving data quality and regulatory processes."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We continue to have confidence that Citi could be resolved without an adverse systemic impact or the need for taxpayer funds,” Citi said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Shares of JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup all fell about 1% in afternoon trading.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When banks next submit plans, the agencies also said they must address contingency planning and obtaining foreign government actions necessary to execute their plans, an apparent nod to struggles regulators faced safely unwinding Credit Suisse when it collapsed last year.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Instead of executing its living will, Swiss authorities engineered a takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, raising questions over problems with such resolution plans.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Regulators did not identify problems in plans submitted by <a href="/money/blueprint/banking/wells-fargo-vs-bank-of-america/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</a>., Bank of New York Mellon, State Street or Morgan Stanley.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><em>Reporting by Pete Schroeder, Saeed Azhar, Tatiana Bautzer and Lananh Nguyen; additional reporting by Sinead Carew; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Rod Nickel</em></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"></p></div></div>

In January, a divided U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ordered the FDA to reconsider its decision prohibiting two companies from marketing their e-cigarette products. In a stinging decision, the majority said the agency’s application process sent manufacturers on a “wild goose chase” of requirements.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JOFUHKJW7RFYBMJOHYK5Z2APBY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">The FDA has come under increasing pressure to finish reviewing applications from companies seeking to market e-cigarette products.
