    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- Stocks hit all-time highs as bets the Federal Reserve will soon start cutting rates fueled a rush into riskier corners of the market.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>Wall Street extended a pattern of money rotating into small caps and out of the megacap “safety” since last week’s soft inflation data. Over the past four sessions, the Russell 2000 has beaten the Nasdaq 100 by almost 12 percentage points — a feat not seen since 2011. An equal-weighted version of the S&amp;P 500 — where the likes of Nvidia Corp. carry the same heft as Dollar Tree Inc. — outpaced the US equity benchmark. That index is less sensitive to gains from the biggest companies — providing a glimpse of hope the rally will broaden out.</p><p>“Rotation is the name of the game,” said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. “This is consistent with the increased perception of cutting rates.”</p><p>Brenner highlighted the fact that around 4 a.m. New York time, Russell 2000 futures spiked — while contracts on the Nasdaq 100 slipped. “This means that overseas money, big money, made a very large rotation trade overnight,” he said.</p><p>To Solita Marcelli, at UBS Global Wealth Management, if the Federal Reserve can cut rates significantly in the context of a soft landing, there will be better prospects for a re-acceleration in earnings growth for lower quality and cyclical segments of the market. At Interactive Brokers, Jose Torres cited another potential reason for the rally in smaller firms: they tend to be domestically oriented and perceived to benefit “disproportionately” if Donald Trump wins the election.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 rose to 5,667 — its 38th record this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.85%. The Russell 2000 gained 3.5%, notching its biggest five-day run since 2020. The Nasdaq 100 was little changed. US 10-year yields fell seven basis points to 4.16%. Gold hit a record high.</p><p>Traders also waded through earnings. Bank of America Corp. gave a forecast for net interest income that exceeded expectations. Morgan Stanley’s traders joined the party across Wall Street in the second quarter even as the firm’s larger wealth business fell short of expectations. Charles Schwab Corp. warned it will have to shrink itself in order to protect profits.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="20"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>While the broadening out in the US stock rally is seen as a positive sign, the surge in small caps in such a short span is showing signs of overheating. In only five days, the Russell 2000 has jumped almost 12% — hitting the most-overbought level since 2017.</p><p>“History was made today as the Russell 2000 closed 4.4 standard deviations above its 50-DMA,” according to Bespoke Investment Group. “No other major US index (Dow since 1900, S&amp;P 500 since 1928, and Nasdaq since 1971) has ever closed at that much of an extreme.”</p><p>Matt Maley at Miller Tabak says the gauge has reached the kind of overbought condition that has been followed by declines over the past two years.</p><p>“Thus, this could be signaling that the small-cap sector is due for some sort of short-term breather,” he noted. “At the very least, investors should be careful about chasing these stocks over the near-term.”</p><p>In such case, he says it will be interesting to see if there’s a reversal of the “rotation” move. Tech stocks are coming off their own overbought condition, so there’s no guarantee they will advance during a pullback in the small-cap names, he said.</p><p>The bottom line? If both tech stocks and small caps decline at the same time, it could cause “some problems for the overall market,” he noted.</p><p>The move on the Russell 2000 is bullish, but investors should be ready for a potential potential profit-taking or consolidation in the sessions ahead, according to Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott.</p><p>“The longer-term monthly chart on the Russell shows a better picture of its potential,” he noted. “We believe the Russell 2000 can trade back toward its all-time highs as mean reversion in relative strength highlights further bandwidth for the sector against this year’s leadership (tech/AI/Mag7).”</p><p>Wantrobski also pointed out that broader market breadth/participation has been improving since the CPI rally last week.</p><p>“The battle between the broader markets and 2024 leadership is set to continue over the short run in our view, as relative strength disparities between these groups show the potential for more rotation ahead,” Wantrobski said. “This cannot be confirmed as a long-term trend/investment theme at this time. So for now, we continue to treat this as a trading opportunity (mean reversion move).”</p><p>Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler says it is too early to determine whether a sustainable rotation can be maintained. More time and technical evidence are needed to confirm sustainable broadening participation that can lift the market higher is underway.</p><p>“The current (and long-awaited) broadening of equity gains is welcome, but elevated valuations will limit further market upside to low single digits overall for the remainder of the year,” said Robert Teeter at Silvercrest Asset Management.</p><p>To Lori Calvasina at RBC Capital Markets, the earnings season will be a “key test” for the rotation trade. She added that valuations and positioning have set the stage for an eventual shift to a new leadership, but there have been several false starts.</p><p>The relative performance of the Nasdaq versus the Russell 2000 has been on a wild ride since 2020, with each besting the other by more than 40 percentage points over different one-year holding periods since the pandemic crisis, according to Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research. Dramatic small-cap outperformance has only occurred after a tech stock crash or when retail investors created a small-cap bubble, he said.</p><p>“Neither setup is relevant now. We believe the Nasdaq will outperform the Russell by its 2003–2019 average of two points over the next year,” he noted.</p><p>As for whether the S&amp;P 500 or Russell 2000 will outperform over the rest of the year, his view is that both will now do equally well — but not at the same time due to their low correlation.</p><p>“For the moment, small caps have the better momentum because money managers cannot afford to stay as underweight as they have been forced to be over the last 18 months,” Colas said. “Once their reweighting is done, the S&amp;P should be able to play catch-up.”</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has gone 351 sessions through Tuesday without a 2% decline. If the equity benchmark reaches 352 by Wednesday’s close, it will be the longest stretch since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007. The index went roughly 950 sessions from May 2003 to February 2007 without such a slide.</p><p>The strength of the equity market has been underpinned by optimism the economy has withstood the worst of Fed tightening. In this regard, Tuesday’s better-than-estimated retail sales report was a “healthy” development, according to Bret Kenwell at eToro. It’s better to see the Fed cutting rates on falling inflation than to see the central bank rushing to bolster a weakened economy, he noted.</p><p>The Dow Average also had an “outstanding day” on hopes of rate cuts and lower taxes and regulations — which may be on the horizon, according to Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance. He also cited hopes the market rally will broaden from a narrow set of technology shares into “an array of companies.”</p><p>Corporate Highlights:</p><ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"><li><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. joined rival JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. in the tapping the US investment-grade market after reporting second-quarter earnings.</p></li><li><p>PNC Financial Services Group Inc. notched its first increase in net interest income since the end of 2022, setting itself up for what it expects to be a record year of NII growth in 2025.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft Corp.’s investment into Inflection AI will get a full-blown UK antitrust probe, after the watchdog said it needed to take a closer look at the hiring of former employees from the artificial intelligence startup.</p></li><li><p>Philip Morris International Inc. is expanding production of Zyn in the US as the popular oral nicotine pouch becomes increasingly hard to find because of soaring demand.</p></li><li><p>Starboard Value became the third activist investor this year to take a stake in Match Group Inc., the owner of the dating app Tinder whose paying customer base has shrunk for six straight quarters.</p></li><li><p>Adidas AG raised its annual profit target for the second time in three months amid soaring demand for classic sneakers like the Samba and more sales from the shrinking stockpile of Yeezy footwear.</p></li></ul><p>Key events this week:</p><ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"><li><p>Eurozone CPI, Wednesday</p></li><li><p>US housing starts, industrial production, Wednesday</p></li><li><p>Fed Beige Book, Wednesday</p></li><li><p>Fed’s Thomas Barkin speaks, Wednesday</p></li><li><p>ECB rate decision, Thursday</p></li><li><p>US initial jobless claims, Philadelphia Fed manufacturing, Conference Board LEI, Thursday</p></li><li><p>Fed’s Mary Daly, Lorie Logan and Michelle Bowman speak, Thursday</p></li><li><p>Fed’s John Williams, Raphael Bostic speak, Friday</p></li></ul><p>Some of the main moves in markets:</p><p>Stocks</p><ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"><li><p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6% as of 4 p.m. New York time</p></li><li><p>The Nasdaq 100 was little changed</p></li><li><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.85%</p></li><li><p>The MSCI World Index rose 0.4%</p></li><li><p>The Russell 2000 Index rose 3.5%</p></li></ul><p>Currencies</p><ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"><li><p>The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed</p></li><li><p>The euro was little changed at $1.0901</p></li><li><p>The British pound was little changed at $1.2974</p></li><li><p>The Japanese yen fell 0.2% to 158.39 per dollar</p></li></ul><p>Cryptocurrencies</p><ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"><li><p>Bitcoin rose 2.2% to $65,153.51</p></li><li><p>Ether rose 1.1% to $3,474.43</p></li></ul><p>Bonds</p><ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"><li><p>The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined seven basis points to 4.16%</p></li><li><p>Germany’s 10-year yield declined five basis points to 2.43%</p></li><li><p>Britain’s 10-year yield declined five basis points to 4.05%</p></li></ul><p>Commodities</p><p>This story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.</p><p>--With assistance from Lu Wang, Esha Dey, Jessica Menton and Sophie Caronello.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Former investment partner James Anderson estimates that Nvidia's market capitalization could reach up to $49 trillion in the next decade, which is more than the entire value of every company in the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>Nvidia's rise is attributed to the AI boom, which has created half-a-million new millionaires who invested in the tech that is revolutionizing the workplace and media consumption.</li>
<li>Nvidia is one of the companies behind the AI boom, along with other tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple, which are worth a combined $14.5 trillion and make up 32% of the S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>The company's data center revenue is growing at about 60%, and if this pattern continues, Nvidia could have a market capitalization of $49 trillion in the next decade.</li>
<li>Anderson estimates a 10% to 15% probability of this outcome, but notes that the potential scale of Nvidia's growth is unprecedented and could lead to a market capitalization of double-digit trillions if AI continues to work for customers and Nvidia maintains its lead in the field.</li>

<p>“The potential scale of Nvidia in the most optimistic outcome is both way higher than I’ve ever seen before and could lead to a market cap of double-digit trillions,” James Anderson, former partner at investment giant Baillie Gifford, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4c9b009f-7d33-4975-b4be-a36c714bf1a8" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.ft.com/content/4c9b009f-7d33-4975-b4be-a36c714bf1a8" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">told the <em>Financial Times</em></a>. “This isn’t a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia’s lead is intact.” </p>

Nvidia, along with tech giants Amazon, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">Google</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/apple/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/apple/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">Apple</a>, are worth $14.5 trillion and make up <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/07/nvidia-win-race-4-trillion-market-cap-big-tech-outlook-google-microsoft-amazon-apple/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/07/07/nvidia-win-race-4-trillion-market-cap-big-tech-outlook-google-microsoft-amazon-apple/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">about 32% of the S&amp;P 500</a>. With the AI darling’s data center revenue growing at about 60%, Anderson calculated, should the pattern continue over the next decade, the company would have a market capitalization of about $49 trillion. That’s more than the entire value of every company in the S&amp;P 500, <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_market_cap" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_market_cap" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">which is roughly $45.84 trillion</a>. Anderson estimated a 10% to 15% probability of this outcome.</p>



<p>Anderson’s projection is a lofty one, but his hunches have proved correct before. With a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-08-18/tesla-amazon-visionary-leaves-uk-fund-firm-baillie-gifford-down-100-billion" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-08-18/tesla-amazon-visionary-leaves-uk-fund-firm-baillie-gifford-down-100-billion" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">go-big-or-go-home mentality</a>, he was one of Amazon’s and Tesla’s biggest champions (for the EV giant, Anderson’s investments were second only to CEO Elon Musk’s). From 2005 to 2021, Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, managed by Baillie Gifford, saw returns of 2,240%. It invested in Nvidia in 2016. Lingotto Investment Management, where Anderson is now an investor, has <a href="https://qz.com/nvidia-market-cap-james-anderson-amazon-tesla-1851592353" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://qz.com/nvidia-market-cap-james-anderson-amazon-tesla-1851592353" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">a $650 million fund</a> with Nvidia as its largest position.</p>



<p>Nvidia didn’t have a clear path to success when Anderson first began investing in the company, he said. It remained to be seen if it would be a gaming, crypto, or AI company. But it did have the advantage of early success, unlike Amazon and Tesla, which “didn’t start from highly profitable and dominant positions but had to get there.” In some ways, Anderson still sees Nvidia as a nimble company.</p><p></p>



<p>“It is the long duration of the development of [graphic processing units] usage in AI—and not just AI—from excitement, through potential pauses, to transformation of industries that is most important to us,” Anderson said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Not so fast</strong></h2>



<p>Other finance experts don’t share Anderson’s bullish take on Nvidia. Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, argues Nvidia is riding a wave of early AI optimism.</p>



<p>“The momentum is clearly with Nvidia,” Damodaran <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG-tfDsVfao" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG-tfDsVfao" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">told CNBC</a> in May. “They can do nothing wrong. Everything they touch turns to gold.”</p>



<p>Damodaran said Tesla experienced a <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/03/03/nvidia-stock-surge-echoes-tesla-rally-2020-investors-ponder-ai-evs-comparison/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/03/03/nvidia-stock-surge-echoes-tesla-rally-2020-investors-ponder-ai-evs-comparison/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">similar rally in 2020</a>, when its market cap soared, peaking in 2021 at $1.2 trillion, only for shares to plummet about 30% this year alone. Meta and Google also grappled with increased competition that have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4ff64604-a421-422c-9239-0ca8e5133042" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.ft.com/content/4ff64604-a421-422c-9239-0ca8e5133042" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">loosened their grip</a> on the tech world. While Nvidia has the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-earnings-stock-split-jensen-huang-blackwell-ai/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-earnings-stock-split-jensen-huang-blackwell-ai/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">earnings</a> to back up its sky-high value, the expectations for the future of the company may be too steep, he argued. Damodaran said the AI chip market is not worth $1 trillion alone, and the AI market more broadly is worth about $2 trillion or $3 trillion, meaning Nvidia would have to tap into several big AI markets to maintain and grow its value.</p>



<p>“It’s clearly a possibility,” Damodaran said. “But is it plausible? I don’t think so.”</p><p></p>



<p>It’s too early to say if Nvidia has the juice to lead Big Tech into the AI frontier in the long term, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Doug Clinton said. Nvidia’s colossal growth may appear scary, but it’s sustainable, particularly as the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/tech-companies-ai-nuclear-power-plants/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/tech-companies-ai-nuclear-power-plants/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">demand for AI</a> is expected to increase.</p>



<p>“Despite all of us worrying that eventually this demand for chips will slow down, we haven’t really seen that slowdown happen yet,” Clinton <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQXjNPAZ9aE" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQXjNPAZ9aE" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">told Yahoo Finance</a> last month. “And it may take longer to slow down than we think.”</p>



<p>With Nvidia making up over <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2024/03/08/what-you-need-to-know-about-nvidia-and-the-ai-chip-arms-race/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.marketplace.org/2024/03/08/what-you-need-to-know-about-nvidia-and-the-ai-chip-arms-race/" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">80% of the global GPU semiconductor market</a>, the company will likely continue to ride high in the foreseeable future, Clinton said.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“Can Nvidia maintain its dominant position providing the brains to these artificial intelligence models?” he said. “I think they can for the next three to five years.”</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><strong>Recommended Newsletter: </strong><p>CEO Daily provides key context for the news leaders need to know from across the world of business.

UNH said the cyberattack has cost it $1.1 billion in earnings in the second quarter alone. UHG previously estimated a total impact of $1.6 billion for the entire year; it has now pushed the estimate as high as $2.3 billion for 2024.</p><p>CEO Andrew Witty said on UHG's second quarter earnings call Tuesday that the company did not correctly predict the impact of the attack.</p><p>"I think we were a little optimistic, in hindsight, at the pace at which we thought people would come back" once the system was safely reconnected, Witty said.</p><p>He added that the pace of business has recovered in the past several weeks to a more normal level.</p><p>Change Healthcare is one of UHG's payments processing systems, handling payments for providers as well as health information for patients.</p><p>A ransomware group identified as BlackCat, or ALPHV, infiltrated Change's systems and stole potentially millions of its patients' data in February — the exact figure hasn't been revealed. UHG became aware of the attack a couple of days later and shut down the system.

            Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/09/business/fed-chair-powell-talks-up-progress-on-inflation-but-says-rate-cuts-not-imminent-yet/index.html">said</a> central bank officials in the United States needed “greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably” toward their 2% target before going ahead with the first interest rate cut.

            The Bank of England, meanwhile, held off on cutting rates last month even though UK inflation <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/19/economy/uk-inflation-target-interest-rate-cuts/index.html#:~:text=According%20to%20Jake%20Finney%2C%20an,rise%20at%20their%20current%20pace.">slowed</a> to the central bank’s 2% target in May.

            The Bank of England emphasized that “monetary policy needs to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipates.”

            In its report Tuesday, the IMF said it still expected major central banks to reduce<em> </em>borrowing costs in the second half of the year. It anticipates one cut by the Fed before the end of the year, chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told journalists.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyoho4eu000e3b6jnwo63dr0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The IMF thinks<em> </em>global inflation will slow to 5.9% this year, from 6.7% last year, in line with its<em> </em>forecast in April.
    </p>

            The agency blamed sticky services price inflation — partly driven by higher wages — for “holding up progress” on reducing overall inflation.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyohob4r000g3b6j898zmgvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “Energy and food price inflation are now almost back to pre-pandemic levels in many countries, while overall inflation is not,” Gourinchas said. “Rising services prices and wages may keep overall inflation higher than desired,” posing a “significant risk” to economic growth, he added.

            The IMF also noted that rising<em> </em>trade tensions “could further raise near-term risks to inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods.”
    </p>

            The US and the European Union have in recent months hiked tariffs on electric cars made in China, driven by concerns that local jobs and strategic industries could be wiped out by cheap Chinese imports. The US has also increased tariffs on a raft of other products from the world’s no. 2 economy, including steel, batteries, semiconductors and critical minerals.

            Gourinchas said the “surge in unilateral measures,” including tariffs, was a “key concern” for the IMF.

            “If anything, it will distort trade and resource allocation, spur retaliation, weaken growth, diminish living standards and make it harder to coordinate policies that address global challenges, such as the climate transition,” he added.

            The IMF sees the global economy expanding 3.2% this year, as it forecast in April. But the agency downgraded its forecast for US growth to 2.6% — 0.1 percentage point lower than projected in April.
    </p>

            The economy encompassing the 20 countries that use the euro is seen expanding by a “modest” 0.9%, 0.1 percentage point higher than predicted in April.

            The IMF also made upward revisions to its 2024 growth forecasts for India and China, which it now expects to expand by 7% and 5% respectively — up from forecasts of 6.8% and 4.6% in April. The projected growth in the two countries would account for half of global expansion.

            “Asia’s emerging market economies remain the main engine for the global economy,” Gourinchas said.

<ol>
<li><strong>North Shore University Hospital and NYU Langone-Long Island were named among the top hospitals in the country</strong> for the second consecutive year by U.S. News &amp; World Report, a publication that specializes in rankings and consumer advice.</li>
<li><strong>Several Long Island institutions were highlighted in the annual hospital rankings</strong>, with Northwell Health having five of its facilities make the New York state list, including North Shore University Hospital, which tied for first place.</li>
<li><strong>The rankings are based on a comprehensive assessment of hospitals</strong>, including clinical outcomes, staffing and technology, and patient and physician surveys. However, experts note that the rankings may not be as relevant for the average patient who is considering a hospital based on factors such as doctor recommendations and insurance coverage.</li>
<li><strong>NYU Langone Hospital also made the national honor roll and tied for first place in New York State</strong>, with its data for its Mineola, Manhattan, and Brooklyn hospitals evaluated collectively.</li>
<li><strong>The rankings can provide confidence for patients and communities, but hospitals should not rely solely on them</strong>, according to Dr. Peter Silver, senior vice president and chief quality officer at Northwell Health. Instead, patients should consider multiple factors when choosing a hospital.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, founders of Andreessen Horowitz, are set to announce their plans to make donations in support of former President Trump's presidential campaign</strong>. This is a significant decision, as the duo had not previously made donations to political campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>The donations are linked to Andreessen Horowitz's plan to back political candidates that favor regulatory policies that enable the growth of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency</strong>. The firm believes that these technologies have the potential to drive economic growth and create new opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Andreessen Horowitz's decision to back Trump's campaign is seen as a nod to Trump's perceived support for technology and innovation</strong>. Trump has previously expressed support for emerging technologies and has taken steps to promote their development.</li>
<li><strong>Senator J.D. Vance, who has been mentioned as a potential running mate for Trump, has a Netflix movie about his life</strong>. Vance, a venture capitalist and Ohio Senate candidate, has been touted as a potential VP pick for Trump due to his business experience and conservative views.</li>
<li><strong>Andreessen Horowitz's decision to back Trump's campaign is seen as a departure from the firm's previously stated goal of opposing candidates who "want to choke off important technologies"</strong>. The firm's co-founder Ben Horowitz wrote a blog post in December stating that the firm would back candidates who support an "optimistic technology-enabled future".</li>

<li><strong>CMA concerns over competition</strong>: The CMA is concerned that the hiring of Inflection staff could lessen competition in the AI market and is investigating whether the deal constitutes a merger.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft's response</strong>: Microsoft has said it is "confident that the hiring of talent promotes competition and should not be treated as a merger".</li>

<li><strong>Higher interest rates impacted expenses</strong>: The Federal Reserve's rate hike led to higher interest expenses for Bank of America, which had to finance its shorter-term securities at the higher rate, offsetting some of the gains from loan growth and higher return on assets.</li>
<li><strong>Investment banking division performed well</strong>: Bank of America's investment banking division saw higher sales and trading revenue from its stock and bond trading desks and more advisory revenue from its bankers, helping to make up for the sluggish performance in the consumer bank.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer banking franchise was impacted</strong>: The bank's large consumer banking franchise was affected by higher interest rates, which reduced lending activity and slowed growth.</li>
<li><strong>Shares rally</strong>: Despite the decline in profits, Bank of America's shares rallied 5.2% to $44.09 in morning trading, likely due to the bank's better-than-expected earnings performance and the resurgence in activity in its investment banking division.</li>

Prime Day began nine years ago as a way to highlight the value of a Prime membership by offering deals and benefits for members.</p><p>"When it comes to Prime Day, Amazon still sets the agenda and takes the majority of sales," eMarketer analyst Sky Canaves told Yahoo Finance (video above).

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Kaspersky said it will “gradually wind down” its U.S. operations beginning July 20, when the ban comes into effect, adding that its U.S. business is “no longer viable.”</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Independent journalist Kim Zetter <a href="https://www.zetter-zeroday.com/kaspersky-lab-closing-u-s-division-laying-off-workers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-mrf-link="https://www.zetter-zeroday.com/kaspersky-lab-closing-u-s-division-laying-off-workers-2/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="1" mrfobservableid="095ad407-c921-4d2c-8277-edc2ee6cc966">first broke the news</a> on Monday of the company shutting down its stateside business. Zetter said the number of employees affected by the layoffs is “less than 50” in the United States. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Kaspersky spokesperson Sawyer VanHorn confirmed the company’s statement and layoffs to TechCrunch in an email Tuesday. The spokesperson was also part of the layoffs, said VanHorn.  </p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Kaspersky initially planned to challenge the ban, saying at the time the ban was announced that it “does not engage in activities which threaten U.S. national security,” and that it would “pursue all legally available options to preserve its current operations and relationships.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In June, the U.S. Commerce Department announced the “first of its kind” ban on the sale of Kaspersky’s antivirus software to U.S. consumers, citing increased security and privacy risks because the company is headquartered in Russia. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“Russia has shown it has the capacity, and even more than that, the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans,” U.S. Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo, said in a call with reporters at the time.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Once the ban comes into effect, Kaspersky will no longer be allowed to sell its software to U.S. consumers directly or through U.S.-based resellers of Kaspersky software, some of whom have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/26/how-the-kaspersky-ban-will-hit-resellers-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/26/how-the-kaspersky-ban-will-hit-resellers-in-the-us/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="2" mrfobservableid="f4099866-9c6a-4614-9d2a-82b1c5dd9813">criticized the ban for affecting their businesses</a>. After September 29, Kaspersky will no longer be allowed to push software or security updates to U.S. customers. That will result in degraded protection from the antivirus software.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Commerce Department said it took a staggered approach to the ban to allow U.S. consumers to find an alternative to Kaspersky software.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The U.S. Treasury also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/21/u-s-government-sanctions-kaspersky-executives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/21/u-s-government-sanctions-kaspersky-executives/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="3" mrfobservableid="84dffc0d-3c6b-4cab-a943-153543a8e3fd">sanctioned several senior Kaspersky executives</a>, effectively barring U.S. customers from paying Kaspersky for its software or transacting with any future company run by its executives. Chief executive Eugene Kaspersky was not sanctioned, the Treasury said. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The U.S. government has acted against Kaspersky during both the Trump and Biden administrations. In 2017, the Trump administration <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/13/kaspersky-executive-branch-ban-dhs-homeland-security/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/13/kaspersky-executive-branch-ban-dhs-homeland-security/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="4" mrfobservableid="f2156790-0fcf-4102-954e-3b5ee0e28268">banned the use of Kaspersky software across the federal government</a> after Russian government hackers earlier that year stole U.S. classified documents from an intelligence contractor’s home computer, which was running Kaspersky software at the time.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">By their nature, antivirus products typically have broad, if not complete, access to the devices they are installed on to identify malicious cyber threats. </p>

	
	


	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">When seen by TechCrunch on Tuesday, Kaspersky’s products were unavailable for purchase on its U.S. website. “For legal compliance purposes, Kaspersky products cannot be purchased from your country,” its website reads.</p>
