<ol>
<li>Norway's sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank Investment Management, will vote against Elon Musk's CEO compensation package at Tesla's annual meeting on Thursday.</li>
<li>The fund had initially voted against the package in 2018 and is concerned about the total size of the award, the structure of the performance triggers, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk.</li>
<li>The fund, which has a 0.98% stake in Tesla worth $7.72 billion, will also vote in favor of several shareholder policies that management has recommended against, including proposals to adopt a noninterference policy, adopt a simple majority vote, declassify the board of directors, and publish reports on harassment and discrimination prevention efforts.</li>
<li>The fund's opposition to Musk's compensation package is not new, as ISS and Glass Lewis, two big shareholder advisory firms, had also recommended voting against the package in January.</li>
<li>The fund is managed by Norges Bank Investment Management on behalf of the Government Pension Fund Global, which has a portfolio worth 17.80 trillion Norwegian Krone ($1.67 trillion) and invests in 72 countries worldwide.</li>

<p><em>Updated 6:15 p.m. Eastern with comments from post-flight press conference.</em></p>



<p>SPACEPORT AMERICA, N.M. — Virgin Galactic’s VSS Unity spaceplane conducted its final commercial mission June 8, taking a Turkish researcher and three private astronauts on a suborbital spaceflight.</p>



<p>VSS Unity, attached to its VMS Eve mothership aircraft, took off from Spaceport America in southern New Mexico at 10:31 a.m. Eastern. Unity released from Eve at 11:26 a.m. Eastern, flying its typical suborbital trajectory to an altitude of 87.5 kilometers before gliding to a landing back at the spaceport at 11:41 a.m. Eastern.</p>



<p>Galactic 07 featured a Turkish research astronaut, Tuva Atasever. His flight was arranged through Axiom Space, which flew another Turkish astronaut, Alper Gezeravcı, <a href="https://spacenews.com/spacex-launches-third-axiom-mission-to-iss/">on the Ax-3 private astronaut mission to the International Space Station in January</a>. Atasever was the backup for that mission.</p>



<p>Atasever planned to conduct seven experiments during the suborbital flight. “The experimental side of the flight was a huge success,” he said at a press conference after the flight. Those experiments included sensors to monitor brain activity, radiation dosimeters and insulin pens designed to operate in microgravity. The brain activity experiment, he noted, included tests to try and capture any changes in brain activity linked to the perspective-altering “Overview Effect” caused by seeing the Earth from space.</p>



<p>He said that testing of the insulin pens, an experiment developed by Axiom Space, during tests in the week leading up to the flight revealed they were not working as expected. “We iterated, we changed a couple of things, and this time around worked perfectly in microgravity.”</p>



<p>The vehicle also carried a rack with automated payloads from Purdue University to study propellant slosh in microgravity and from the University of California Berkeley to test 3D printing. Those payloads were flown through NASA’s Flight Opportunities program.</p>



<p>The other three customers were private astronauts, whose identities were disclosed by Virgin Galactic only after the vehicle landed. They were</p>

<li>Irving Pergament, a New York real estate developer and private pilot; and</li>



<li>Giorgio Manenti, an Italian investment manager living in London.</li>

<p>This was the seventh commercial flight for VSS Unity and the 12<sup>th</sup> flight overall. It will also be the last for VSS Unity, the second SpaceShipTwo vehicle built for Virgin Galactic, as the company shifts its focus to completing work on the new Delta series of vehicles.</p>



<p>“This is the final flight for Unity, but that’s not the end of the story,” Mike Moses, Virgin Galactic spaceline president, told reporters at the spaceport June 7. “A whole new chapter is about to start with us.”</p>



<p>The company announced last November <a href="https://spacenews.com/virgin-galactic-to-halt-unity-suborbital-flights-by-mid-2024/">it would retire Unity by the middle of 2024</a> so that could conserve its cash, about $1 billion at the time, to complete work on the Delta class of vehicles, which promise much higher flight rates and lower operating costs required for the company’s business case to close.</p>



<p>The Delta-class vehicle will look “exactly the same” as Unity, Moses said. “But the real change is what’s under the hood, so to speak, in how it was designed, how it was built and how it’s operated.”</p>



<p>“We want to take advantage of all the maturation work that has been done on the Unity spaceship for Delta,” said Steve Justice, senior vice president of spaceline programs and engineering at Virgin Galactic. “We only want to invent that which really need to invent.”</p>



<p>That invention primarily involves use of different composite materials and manufacturing techniques to enable production of vehicles at higher rates and lower costs. There is also a greater reliance of contractors to build key elements of the vehicle, which Virgin Galactic will then assemble at a new facility in Mesa, Arizona, near Phoenix.</p>



<p>Moses said components for the first two Delta-class vehicles will start arriving at the Arizona facility late this year and early next year, where Virgin will perform final assembly and ground tests. The company plans to start flight tests in late 2025 and begin commercial service in 2026.</p>



<p>“Unity broke ground and demonstrated what is possible,” he said. “Delta is going to be revolutionary.”</p>

<p>“It is kind of sad to see Unity fly on its last commercial flight,” acknowledged Pecile in remarks after landing, noting this flight took place almost exactly 20 years after Unity’s predecessor, SpaceShipOne, made its first flight. “But our efforts are really working on the next generation.”</p>



<p>In attendance for Galactic 07 was Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Galactic who flew on Unity in July 2021. He said after the flight he was still committed to the company’s vision of enabling “thousands and thousands of people” to experience spaceflight.</p>



<p>“That’s the aim of Virgin Galactic. Other people have aims of going to Mars, which is equally absolutely and utterly extraordinary,” he said. “But what we want to do is enable many people to experience what our astronauts experienced today.”</p>

																										<p>The top U.S. safety regulator has officially launched more relaxed fuel economy standards, following a similar move from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made a few months ago.</p>

<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has officially announced new fuel standards requiring an average fleet fuel economy of 50.4 mpg by 2031 for the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules, as detailed in a report from <a href="https://www.autonews.com/regulation-safety/504-mpg-cafe-standard-new-vehicles-2031-finalized" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Automotive News</i></a>. The new standard is down from the original requirement, which stated that vehicles and light trucks to reach a fuel economy average of 58 mpg by 2032.</p>
<p>In addition, the new standards require just a 2 percent improvement in fuel efficiency per year for cars, while light trucks will need to see a 4 percent improvement between the 2027 and 2032 model years.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="nlYChYVcgP"><p><a href="https://www.teslarati.com/ev-sales-slowdown-us-overstated/">EV sales slowdown in the U.S. may not last long: Bloomberg</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The NHTSA rule shift comes as a means to accommodate and comply with recent standard changes from the EPA, which doesn’t require as many <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/u-s-bev-sales-milestone-2023-state-adoption-rates/">electric vehicles (EVs) sold</a> as the previous rules. Under the <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/biden-administration-pulls-back-rule-ev-mileage-rating/">new EPA rules, which went into effect in March</a>, EVs must now make up between 30 and 56 percent of automakers’ light-vehicle sales between 2030 and 2032, coming down from the previous proposal of reaching 67 percent by 2032.</p>
<p>The EPA is typically able to set stricter standards than the NHTSA, given that the latter agency is not allowed to use the fuel economy of EVs when determining maximum possible standards for a given year, though it does have to use them when figuring out compliance.</p>
<p>“Because we have a market that has an increasing number of electric vehicles, it just becomes more difficult for NHTSA to set standards that are as strong as EPA’s emission standards,” said Chris Harto, Consumer Reports Senior Policy Analyst.</p>
<p>The Alliance for Automotive Innovation has argued that the newly revised standards bring the NHTSA’s rules into alignment with those from the EPA.</p>
<p>“Should an automaker be considered in violation of CAFE rules (and subject to billions of dollars in civil penalties) if it complies with the standards established by EPA’s new greenhouse gas rules? No, they shouldn’t,” said alliance CEO John Bozzella. “And … at first glance, the final CAFE rule seems to say as much!”</p>
<p>The alliance also notes that as the automotive industry moves toward EVs, fuel economy standards will become increasingly irrelevant.</p>
<p>“CAFE’s a relic of the 1970s — a policy to promote energy conservation and energy independence by making internal combustion vehicles more efficient,” Bozzella adds. “But those vehicles are already very efficient. And EVs? They don’t combust anything. They don’t even have a tailpipe.”</p>
<p>The NHTSA says the new regulations were developed alongside the EPA, with the two agencies working in tandem to “optimize the effectiveness of its standards while minimizing compliance costs.”</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Bark Air</strong>, a charter flight service, launched in May and offers flights to New York's Westchester County Airport (HPN), Los Angeles, and London.</li>
<li><strong>Legal issue</strong>: Westchester County is suing Bark Air and Talon Air, the company that operates the flights, claiming that the airline violates county law by using the private jet area instead of the commercial terminal.</li>
<li><strong>County law</strong>: The law requires charter flights with more than 9 seats to use the commercial terminal, but multiple air charter companies, including Bark Air, are challenging this law in federal court, arguing that federal laws preempt county laws.</li>
<li><strong>Potential impact</strong>: If the court rules in favor of the county, it could impact Bark Air's operations, but a spokesperson for the airline says they don't comment on litigation and don't believe the lawsuit will impact their operations.</li>
<li><strong>Flight operations</strong>: Despite the legal battle, Bark Air has already launched flights, including a recent trip from New York to London, and has released its flight schedule and booking process on its website.</li>

<p>Kia America is recalling more than 460,000 Telluride SUVs and urging people to park their cars away from structures that could catch fire.</p>



<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued the “park outside” recall on behalf of the manufacturer Friday. The notice affects 462,869 Telluride vehicles from model years 2020-2024.</p>



<p>The front power seat motor on the vehicles could overheat due to a stuck power seat slide knob and could potentially result in a fire, <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/kia-telluride-recall-fire-risk">NHTSA said.</a></p>



<p>Owners of recalled vehicles will be notified by mail starting July 30 and can contact Kia customer service for more information.</p>



<p>NHTSA said dealers will install a bracket for the power seat and replace it free of charge to fix the issue.</p>



<p>The car manufacturer made the decision to recall the vehicles on May 29 after one report of a fire under a seat and six reports of melting spanning August 2022 to March 2024, documents show.</p>





<p>People driving vehicles with the issue might find it difficult to adjust the power seat or may notice a burning or melting smell or see smoke, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-business/ap-kia-recalls-nearly-463000-telluride-suvs-due-to-fire-risk-urges-impacted-consumers-to-park-outside/">The Associated Press reported.</a></p>



<p>The AP also noted that it’s not the first recall affecting those vehicles. In March, Kia said it would recall more than 427,000 cars of the same model and year due to a defect that may cause them to roll away while parked.</p>

which also sells a huge range of beauty and home products - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/702223df-2e52-4e62-8f7c-93695a100d9b" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">doubled its profits to more than $2bn</a> (£1.6bn) last year, making more than the Swedish fashion group H&amp;M and the UK’s Primark and Next.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Today, it ships to customers in 150 countries across the world.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">However, as the company explores a plan to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange, it remains dogged by controversy over its environmental impact and <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg67w73nxqxo" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">working practices</a> - including <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65452976" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">allegations of forced labour</a> in its supply chain. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Michaela is aware of the backlash and particularly concerned by the amount of plastic Shein uses in its packaging. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But she feels most fashion brands face similar criticism and that "not everyone can afford high-end clothing".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"So at the back of my mind I feel quite bad when I purchase things, but at the same time it’s convenient," she tells the BBC.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dOZXmm"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-13b8515c-1 bbjeKz"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1a10/live/f0641e10-24ad-11ef-8fcf-bdfddcab4264.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1a10/live/f0641e10-24ad-11ef-8fcf-bdfddcab4264.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1a10/live/f0641e10-24ad-11ef-8fcf-bdfddcab4264.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1a10/live/f0641e10-24ad-11ef-8fcf-bdfddcab4264.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1a10/live/f0641e10-24ad-11ef-8fcf-bdfddcab4264.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1a10/live/f0641e10-24ad-11ef-8fcf-bdfddcab4264.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1a10/live/f0641e10-24ad-11ef-8fcf-bdfddcab4264.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1a10/live/f0641e10-24ad-11ef-8fcf-bdfddcab4264.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Natalia Zoppa standing in front of a Shein sign" class="sc-13b8515c-0 hbOWRP"><span class="sc-13b8515c-2 iuvLSH">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Shein partners with influencers and reality TV stars, like Natalia Zoppa, to promote the brand</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Shein, pronounced "she-in", was set up in China in 2008 by entrepreneur Xu Yangtian and started out selling wedding dresses online.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Since then it has grown into a global behemoth, best known for selling on-trend clothing, mostly to a Gen Z customer base.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A big part of the appeal? The price. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The average cost of a Shein-branded clothing item is just £7.90 and at any one time, it has as many as 600,000 items for sale on its online platform, dwarfing rivals like Zara or Boohoo.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It's also snapped up competitors like Missguided, while Xu Yangtian, who rarely gives interviews, is now said to be one of China's richest men.  </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The real turning point for the brand came during the pandemic, when online shopping took off and Shein's sales soared, says Louise Déglise-Favre from analysts GlobalData.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The firm has also made smart use of social media, recruiting popular influencers and university students to promote its clothing on TikTok and Instagram.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"The brand’s success coincided with a boom in TikTok usage in Europe and the US," says Ms Déglise-Favre. "The Chinese social media platform participated greatly in spreading awareness about the Shein’s ultra-affordable proposition." </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It has drawn in shoppers by getting pop stars like Rita Ora and Katy Perry to perform at its virtual concerts, but it also attracts a vast amount of organic user-generated content.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">You might well have scrolled past so-called "haul" videos of young women emptying out their newly-arrived packages and giving their frank reviews of crop tops, dresses or beauty blenders from the site.</p></div><p

bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Shein's business model is similar to Amazon's, in that it partners with thousands of third-party suppliers - many of them in China, Brazil and Turkey - to manufacture its clothes and then ships them from giant, centralised warehouses.  </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It has also sped up the "test and repeat" model made famous by other fast fashion giants including H&amp;M and Zara owner Inditex. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">This sees Shein suppliers produce items in small numbers, of between 100-200 pieces, and then produce more of any style that is a hit.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The brand can turn around a new item in just 25 days - something that would take other retailers months. </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It also uses "gamification" strategies to boost customer engagement on its shopping app which is used by millions of people worldwide.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Users get points and discounts for logging in daily, sharing purchases on social media and referring friends.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"That encourages users to repeat such behaviours to earn more rewards and, as a result, they keep coming back, engaging with the app, and making purchases," says Vilma Todri, an associate professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business School in the US.   </p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 cgtasL"><div data-testid="image"

conduct, which all of its suppliers must sign up to.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It has also launched a resale platform for shoppers in the US and France to boost its green credentials, while it says producing clothes in smaller batches means very little material goes to waste.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But some say it is not enough.</p></div><figure><div

<p>I've read far too many books on ChatGPT and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p>Almost all of them are a waste of time when it comes to applying them to education.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p class="article_paragraph_2"></p>
<p>But, there are five books educators on LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook have recommended. And it's these five books I recommend to every educator exploring AI.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>
<p>I've authored a best-seller for educators on artificial intelligence, "<a href="https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" aria-label="The AI Classroom: The Ultimate Guide to Artificial Intelligence in Education">The AI Classroom: The Ultimate Guide to Artificial Intelligence in Education</a>," and I'm currently working on a practical guide for leaders on AI strategy. Being deeply immersed in the world of AI books for educators, I can confidently say that whether you are new to AI, experimenting with it, or already incorporating it into your practices, these are books worth your time:</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p>


<p>AI for Educators is a readable guide that translates AI through a teacher lens.</p>
<p>It offers practical ideas you can use in class right away. It unlocks powerful ways to streamline teaching, save time and paints a picture of the future our students will face, providing questions you can help them grapple with.</p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" class="inread-active" display-called=""></fbs-ad>
<p>Dana Leonardo, a technology integration educator from Gilbert, Arizona, praises the book for its clarity and practical advice: "Miller's book gets at the heart of what educators need to know about AI, including practical applications, benefits, and cautions. This text brilliantly explains how and why we need to use AI as a tool, while leveraging our most valuable asset—our humanity."</p>








<p>Salman Khan, the visionary behind Khan Academy, explores how AI and GPT technology will transform learning.</p>
<p>Khan offers a road map for teachers, parents and students to navigate this exciting new world. Beyond technology, Khan delves into the ethical and social implications of AI, providing insights on how administrators, guidance counselors and hiring managers can harness AI to build a more accessible education system.</p>

<p>Kevin Soli, a homeschooling parent from Papua New Guinea, highlights the book's value: "I homeschool my children so this book is very encouraging for me as a parent. ChatGPT is like your tech-buddy—not just to answer your prompts but to prompt you too, asking probing questions that challenge assumptions, clarify concepts and encourage deeper dialogue."</p>

<p>Furze explores the opportunities and challenges of AI in education.</p>
<p>He offers insights into its workings and ethical considerations. The book guides readers through the construction and ethics of generative AI, navigates policy landscapes and provides practical strategies. It has detailed sections on text and image generation and preparations for multimodal technologies like video, audio and 3D generation.</p>
<p>Al Kingsley, chair of Hampton Academies Trust in the UK, emphasizes the book’s approach: “This is an excellent book. It’s highly accessible, evidence informed and structured to step you through AI basics, ethics and assessment.”</p>

Edward Watson</h2>
<p>Bowen and Watson present emerging and powerful research on the seismic changes AI is already creating in schools and the workplace, providing invaluable insights into what AI can accomplish in the classroom and beyond.</p>
<p>Dr. Heather M. Brown, an instructional designer from Virginia, shared, “The book resonates with me because it adopts a holistic view of AI's potential, challenging us to embrace this revolution as an opportunity to reimagine education.”</p>

<p>The key to successfully integrating any digital tool, according to Clark, is to focus on the deep learning and masterful pedagogy teachers can achieve amidst educational shifts.</p>
<p><em>The AI Infused Classroom</em> emphasizes that AI will bring about changes, but it does not replace the need for well-trained and highly qualified teachers in the classroom. Students need educators’ guidance now more than ever to prepare for the world of AI. With the right mindset, questions and strategies, educators can use AI to create and broaden meaningful learning experiences for every student.</p>

But educators always welcome more guidance on this topic. That's why I’m looking forward to the upcoming book, "The Promises and Perils of AI in Education" by Ken Shelton and Dee Lanier. It’s not published yet, but it should be available soon.</p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">One Reminder Before You Go</h2>
<p>Reading is great, but applying what you read is better.</p>
<p>Reading books on AI in education feels productive. And it is! Until a certain point. Then, it turns into procrastination disguised as "research." How do you avoid falling into this trap?</p>
<p>Easy—start integrating AI into your educational practices every day.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Timing is everything</strong>: The article emphasizes the importance of acting quickly when interest rates are favorable, citing the example of homebuyers who would have locked in ultra-low mortgage rates in 2020 or 2021.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation and interest rates</strong>: Inflation has surged, and interest rates have more than doubled, currently hovering near their highest point since 2000. This makes it critical to take advantage of favorable rates when they present themselves.</li>
<li><strong>High-yield savings accounts</strong>: The article suggests opening a high-yield savings account to take advantage of today's high-rate climate.</li>
<li><strong>Certificates of deposit (CDs)</strong>: The article also mentions certificates of deposit (CDs) as another option for savers to take advantage of high interest rates.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunity to prepare</strong>: The article concludes by advising savers to start preparing to open a CD now, as there may be rate changes coming in mid-June.</li>

              </figcaption></figure><p>As homebuyers in today's market know, timing is everything. If they had acted in 2020 or 2021, for example, they'd have locked in an ultra-low <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-todays-mortgage-and-mortgage-refinance-interest-rates/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">mortgage or mortgage refinance rate</a></span>. Over the next few years, however, <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-june-cpi-report-hit-new-high-40-years-9-1-percent/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">inflation</a></span> surged and <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/interest-rate-mortgage-highest-since-2000/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">rates</a></span> more than doubled, currently hovering near their highest point since 2000. So it's critical to act when the opportunity presents itself.</p><p>That's also true for savers and those looking to exploit today's high-rate climate. By opening a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/high-yield-savings-account/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">high-yield savings</a></span> or <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whats-a-certificate-of-deposit-cd/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">certificate of deposit (CD)</a></span> account in the last few years, savers were able to earn exponentially more than if they had acted when rates were low. </p><p>The timing surrounding a CD opening, however, is also critical to get right. And despite some cooling in the inflation rate, now is still an opportune time to get started. And there are a few compelling reasons why savers may want to be prepared to open an account next week, in mid-June. Below, we'll break down two of them.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-cd-in-mid-june&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-cd-in-mid-june%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=9902d69b-3a63-4f86-8af2-6f42e09c682c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See how much more you could be earning with a top CD account here now</a>.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Why you should open a CD in mid-June</strong></h2><p>If you've been considering opening a CD this inflationary cycle, the timing could be right to act next week, specifically on June 12 and June 13. Here's why:</p>

    
<p id="leader-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="leader-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-leader-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"leader-plus-outstream-middle"'>
    </p>
<h3><strong>The next inflation report will be released</strong></h3><p>Inflation reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics have been mixed so far in 2024, with most showing little progress in further reducing the inflation rate. After <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-cpi-consumer-price-index-march-2024/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">rising in March</a></span> inflation <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-cpi-report-april-2024/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">barely fell in April</a></span>, moving from 3.5% to 3.4%. That's more than a full percentage point above the Federal Reserve's target 2% goal. </p><p>But a new inflation report will be released on June 12, revealing the latest progress toward taming inflation. If that report is as disappointing as many of the others releases this year, it could indicate a "higher rates for longer" approach taken by the Federal Reserve. And if the report is particularly problematic, it could result in the Fed raising rates — <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-hikes-interest-rate-to-22-year-high-july-2023/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">already at a 23-year high</a></span> — even higher to complete the cooling of this inflationary cycle.</p><p>If either happens, then, savers should be prepared to take advantage of the rate climate (<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-todays-cd-interest-rates/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">CD rates</a></span> change often) by locking in the highest CD rate they can find. Since rates on these types of accounts are locked, savers could earn high returns for months and even years to come, even if inflation and interest rates were to fall in the future.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-cd-in-mid-june&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-cd-in-mid-june%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=9902d69b-3a63-4f86-8af2-6f42e09c682c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Start shopping for the right CD online today</a>.</p><h3><strong>The next Fed rate announcement will be released</strong></h3><p>In an ironic twist, the Federal Reserve will release its latest announcement on the future of interest rates on the same day the newest inflation report comes out. But a formal hike to the federal funds rate — currently at a range between 5.25% and 5.50% — doesn't necessarily have to occur for rates on CDs to head upward. </p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'>
    </p>
<p>Even a simple indication that rate cuts will be put off to later in the year or be pushed off into 2025 and beyond, could cause a slight increase in what lenders offer on savings vehicles. So those looking for a CD should be prepared to act, both on June 12 and June 13, after the revelation of the inflation numbers and Fed announcement have had a chance to reverberate throughout the wider economy.</p><p>Plus, even if the Fed announces an imminent cut — which appears unlikely at this stage — it will almost certainly be a minimal one (25 basis points to start). While that may potentially reduce what you can earn with a CD, considering that many come with <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/best-cds-to-open-for-june-2024-up-to-5-30/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">rates over 5%</a></span> right now, it's still worth opening for many savers.</p><h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>This June offers a rare opportunity for savers to take advantage of both inflation and the Fed's interest rate actions — on the same day. However, it will take some time to research your options and understand which lenders are offering the best rates and terms. So consider starting now so you're prepared to act when the opportunity arises. And be sure to carefully consider the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/short-term-cds-pros-and-cons-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">pros and cons of CDs</a></span> right now as depositing too much into one could ultimately result in paying an <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cd-early-withdrawal-penalties-what-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">early withdrawal penalty</a></span> to get your money back.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-cd-in-mid-june&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-cd-in-mid-june%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=9902d69b-3a63-4f86-8af2-6f42e09c682c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more about today's top CDs here now</a>.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>TJX, the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, has started using body cameras for its security employees</strong>, known as loss prevention associates, to deter shoplifting and reduce the risk of violence in its stores.</li>
<li><strong>The body camera program aims to reduce shoplifting and theft</strong> by making potential thieves aware that they are being recorded and monitored. TJX Finance Chief John Klinger has stated that the cameras will help "de-escalate" situations and reduce the likelihood of theft.</li>
<li><strong>Loss prevention associates undergo specific training on how to use and wear the cameras</strong>, and the footage can be shared with law enforcement if needed. They are unarmed and instructed not to chase after suspected shoplifters, but rather serve as a visual deterrent and observe suspicious behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Shoppers can identify loss prevention associates by their uniform</strong>, which includes a company-approved black vest, pants, and shoes. These associates are responsible for observing and reporting suspicious behavior and acting as a main witness if a shoplifting incident occurs.</li>
<li><strong>The implementation of body cameras is part of a larger effort to combat shoplifting and organized retail crime</strong>, which has been reported to be at an all-time high across the retail sector. The hope is that the use of body cameras will help reduce the threat of violence and loss in stores.</li>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Seriously overdue credit card debt is at the highest level in more than a decade, and people 35 and under are struggling more than other age groups <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/off-charts-credit-card-delinquencies-1eb685347b091ff53361e141d80405ad">to pay their bills.</a></span></p><p>The share of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/debt-credit-cards-delinquencies-scores-renters-85aab5e510f531df140f99629a4f60c3">credit card debt</a></span> that’s severely delinquent, defined as being more than 90 days overdue, rose to 10.7% during the first quarter of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A year ago, just 8.2% of credit card debt was severely delinquent.</p><p>If you’re experiencing delinquency, or at risk of it, experts advise speaking with a nonprofit credit counselor and negotiating with your creditors directly. Here’s what you should know:</p><h2>WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I’M AT RISK OF DELINQUENCY?</h2><p>Bruce McClary, senior vice president at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, says that anyone at risk of delinquency should reach out as soon as possible for help from a nonprofit credit counselor, some of whom can be <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nfcc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found through his organization</a></span>. The consultation is free, and a non-judgmental counselor can give guidance towards a long-term solution.</p>
    

<p>Nonprofits can also help create debt management plans that have lower interest rates, no late fees, and a single payment each month, McClary said. These plans may come with maintenance fees, which vary, but the fees are offset by the overall savings on the debt. McClary urged borrowers to be careful of scammers and for-profit debt consolidation companies, which often charge much higher fees than nonprofit organizations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-credit-counseling-en-1451/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a helpful breakdown comparing the two</a></span>.</p>



<p>Martin Lynch, president of the Financial Counseling Association of America, echoed this advice.</p>
    
<p>“Taking that first step and contacting a counselor is difficult for many people,” Lynch said. He emphasized that consumers in debt should do their best to “first, relax,” and then to be as forthcoming as possible about their circumstances with the counselor.</p>
    

<p>“You’ll be talking to someone for free, who will listen to you describe your situation,” he said. “You can share your concerns without being judged for falling into difficulty.” </p><h2>WHAT ABOUT NEGOTIATING WITH CREDITORS?</h2><p>Both Lynch and McClary urge borrowers to reach out directly to credit card companies to negotiate interest rates, fees, and long-term payment plans, noting that it’s in the companies’ best interests if you pay before the debt goes into collections.</p><p>“The best thing to do is to reach out, give an honest assessment of your ability to pay over time, and ask what options are available to you both ‘on and off-the-menu,’” McClary said. This kind of phrasing can give creditors an opening to offer more flexibility, he said. </p><p>McClary and other experts stress that most credit card companies and other lenders have hardship programs available for cases like these. Such options gained visibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, when more companies publicly advertised that consumers facing difficulty may skip or defer payments without penalties. </p><h2>WHY ARE DELINQUENCIES INCREASING?</h2><p>The average annual interest rate on a new credit card is 24.71%, according to LendingTree, the highest since the company began tracking in 2019. That’s in part because the Federal Reserve has raised its key interest rate rate to a 23-year high to combat <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-rates-economy-federal-reserve-biden-d86c5a3a91a61687496f4a985e6bf362">the highest inflation</a></span> in four decades, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. </p>
    

<p>Simultaneously, pandemic-era aid such as stimulus payments, the child tax credit, increased unemployment benefits, and a moratorium on student loan payments has ended. Wage gains haven’t all kept up with inflation, which hits lower-income consumers harder, and rent increases have eaten into savings some consumers may have built up during the early years of the pandemic. </p><p>Silvio Tavares, CEO of VantageScore, a credit score modeling and analytics company, said that delinquencies have now exceeded their pre-pandemic levels, and that <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/affordable-housing-rent-eviction-price-harvard-congress-f5411012e10fa78d0257c137e60c1be3">renters are especially vulnerable to falling behind</a></span>.</p><p>“Younger and less affluent people are experiencing challenges,” he said. “And high interest rates are having an effect.”</p><p>Tavares said the most important thing a borrower can do is to know their credit score and keep up with payments to avoid paying additional interest on revolving balances and debt. He cautioned consumers not to over-extend themselves with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/buy-now-pay-later-holiday-loans-3d66d38295868c03b686577dff85f912">“buy now, pay later” loans</a></span>, which are increasingly available “at every checkout.”</p>
    

<h2>HOW WORRISOME IS THE INCREASE IN DELINQUENCIES?</h2><p>Credit cards only make up about 6.5% of consumer debt, according to a Bank of America Global Research report, but the increase in delinquencies appears to be outpacing <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/jobs-hiring-unemployment-economy-inflation-federal-reserve-d1d73005dbc40b081a555850a44e73d1">income growth</a></span>. </p><p>According to McClary, there’s also likely a large group of consumers paying minimum balances and staying out of delinquency for now but who are too financially stressed to pay their balances in full. A worsening of the economy could push those consumers into severe delinquency, he said.</p><p>On top of increasing credit card delinquencies, retail spending stalled in April. Walmart has said its customers are spending more on necessities and less on discretionary goods. Starbucks lowered its sales expectations, and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mcdonalds-value-meal-deal-bda434c5a939b610a9c1fc09446a38d1">McDonald’s is offering</a></span> more deals as people cut back.</p>

<p>(WJW) — <a href="http://fox8.com/tag/red-lobster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Lobster</a> plans to close eight Ohio locations, including three in Northeast Ohio, amid its Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring, court filings show.</p>



<p>The seafood restaurant chain <a href="https://www.redlobster.com/news-press/press/2024/05/19/red_lobster-files-voluntary-chapter-11-petitions-to-strengthen-financial-position-and-maximize-value-for-stakeholders/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.redlobster.com/news-press/press/2024/05/19/red_lobster-files-voluntary-chapter-11-petitions-to-strengthen-financial-position-and-maximize-value-for-stakeholders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a news release last month</a> announced it would sell off “substantially all of its assets” as it looks to streamline following financial losses.</p>



<p>In all, nearly 100 locations across the country may shut down if the company can’t renegotiate their leases. </p>



<p>According to bankruptcy court filings in Florida, Red Lobster has rejected unexpired leases at eight of its Ohio locations:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Columbus</strong>: 1691 Dublin-Granville Road</li>



<li><strong>Dayton</strong>: 6500 Miller Lane</li>



<li><strong>Findlay</strong>: 2340 Tiffin Ave.</li>



<li><strong>Maumee</strong>: 1422 Reynolds Road</li>



<li><strong>New Philadelphia</strong>: 255 Graff Road SE</li>



<li><strong>Parma</strong>: 7607 Day Drive</li>



<li><strong>Strongsville</strong>: 17227 Southpark Center</li>



<li><strong>Toledo</strong>: 4990 Monroe St.</li>
</ul>



<p>Filings show the restaurant chain has also rejected the lease for its former Orange Village location at 3655 Orange Place, which closed in 2022 after 45 years, according to reports.</p>



<p>The company closed dozens of locations last month before filing for bankruptcy, and planned to auction off those eateries’ kitchen equipment and furniture, <a href="https://fox8.com/news/red-lobster-is-closing-dozens-of-restaurants-and-auctioning-off-furniture-equipment/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fox8.com/news/red-lobster-is-closing-dozens-of-restaurants-and-auctioning-off-furniture-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexstar reported</a>.</p>





<p>The company endured an executive shakeup between 2021 and 2022. Though the addition of the company’s “Ultimate Endless Shrimp” limited special to its regular menu drove business in 2023, it ultimately backfired, leading to an $11 million operating loss in one quarter, <a href="https://fox8.com/news/red-lobster-is-closing-dozens-of-restaurants-and-auctioning-off-furniture-equipment/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fox8.com/news/red-lobster-is-closing-dozens-of-restaurants-and-auctioning-off-furniture-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexstar reported</a>.</p>



<p>Several other Northeast Ohio locations are still open, according to its website, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Akron</strong>: 3901 Medina Road</li>



<li><strong>Ashtabula</strong>: 3013 N. Ridge Road E</li>



<li><strong>Canton</strong>: 4600 Belden Village St. NW</li>



<li><strong>Cuyahoga Falls</strong>: 1090 Graham Road</li>



<li><strong>Elyria</strong>: 6935 Midway Mall Blvd.</li>



<li><strong>Mansfield</strong>: 2322 W. 4th St.</li>



<li><strong>Mentor</strong>: 7744 Reynolds Road</li>



<li><strong>North Olmsted</strong>: 25615 Brookpark Road</li>



<li><strong>Sandusky</strong>: 4016 Milan Road</li>



<li><strong>Wooster</strong>: 3805 Burbank Road</li>



<li><strong>Youngstown</strong>: 1410 Boardman-Poland Road</li>

<p>Huang hit another milestone on Friday, passing personal computer pioneer Michael <a href="https://fortune.com/company/dell-technologies/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/dell-technologies/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Dell</a> to become the world’s 13th-richest person with a net worth of $106.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His wealth has surged more than $62 billion this year as demand for Nvidia chips used to power artificial intelligence tasks remains insatiable.</p>



<p>Huang, 61, is leading a new wave of tech billionaires as AI-fueled “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/nvidia-s-rise-to-3-trillion-fuels-jensanity-across-tech-world" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/nvidia-s-rise-to-3-trillion-fuels-jensanity-across-tech-world" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Jensanity,</a>” as one analyst termed it, takes over Silicon Valley. Other beneficiaries include Lisa Su, chief executive officer of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/advanced-micro-devices/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/advanced-micro-devices/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Advanced Micro Devices</a> Inc., as well as <a href="https://fortune.com/company/super-micro-computer/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/super-micro-computer/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Super Micro Computer</a> Inc.’s Charles Liang. Last month, Huang’s fortune <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-23/nvidia-s-huang-is-richer-than-every-walton-as-ai-surge-continues" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-23/nvidia-s-huang-is-richer-than-every-walton-as-ai-surge-continues" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">surpassed</a> each individual member of the Waltons, America’s richest family, following another blowout quarter from the chipmaker. </p>



<p>Huang’s wealth is derived from his 3.5% stake in Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia, which he co-founded in 1993 with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Nvidia became the first computer-chip company to hit <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-05/nvidia-nvda-tops-3-trillion-in-market-value-as-ai-rally-steams-ahead" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-05/nvidia-nvda-tops-3-trillion-in-market-value-as-ai-rally-steams-ahead" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">$3 trillion</a> in market capitalization on Wednesday, surpassing the value of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/apple/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/apple/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Apple</a> Inc., and was flirting with that benchmark again on Friday. </p>



<p>Dell, 59, with a net worth of $105.9 billion, has been a computer hardware-industry outlier among the tech super-rich, who often owe their wealth to software companies. Dell made much of his fortune through his namesake firm, which sells personal computers and servers.</p><p></p>



<p>Still, Dell Technologies Inc. has been a beneficiary of the recent AI success as corporations need servers and other infrastructure to utilize advanced chips from Nvidia. Investors have increasingly seen Dell, along with Super Micro, as Nvidia’s chosen partner for this business line.</p>



<p>In early March, Dell joined the small group of people with fortunes exceeding <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-01/michael-dell-joins-100-billion-club-as-ai-driven-shares-surge" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-01/michael-dell-joins-100-billion-club-as-ai-driven-shares-surge" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">$100 billion</a> as the company’s shares rose to a record high. The stock has since retreated after posting results that disappointed investors, reducing its founder’s wealth almost $12 billion in a single day. </p>



<p>Nvidia today commands an ecosystem of hardware and software solutions that rivals from AMD to <a href="https://fortune.com/company/intel/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/intel/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Intel</a> Corp. are trying hard to break up or replicate, thanks to its dominant share of the market for the high-end accelerators used to train AI.</p>



<p>And it has shown no signs of slowing down or letting its rivals catch up. Huang <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-02/jensen-huang-computex-keynote-nvidia-reveals-new-ai-software-and-services" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-02/jensen-huang-computex-keynote-nvidia-reveals-new-ai-software-and-services" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">said</a> the firm plans to upgrade its so-called AI accelerators every year. </p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the future of business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/eye-on-ai?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=eye_on_ai" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/eye-on-ai?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=eye_on_ai" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nvidia's stock has risen by about 20% in less than two weeks, and is expected to continue to rise after a 10-for-1 stock split scheduled for June 7.</li>
<li>The stock split is seen as a positive sign from management that they expect the share price to keep moving up, and it acts as a reset for the share price, signaling that it has reached a certain milestone and is ready to run up again.</li>
<li>The stock split makes individual shares cheaper, making them more accessible to retail investors, which can help boost demand, and there is evidence that stock splits are correlated with outperformance over the next year.</li>
<li>Some investors believe that Nvidia could replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, establishing it as a blue chip tech stock, and Nvidia's upcoming split has made investors even more bullish.</li>
<li>Nvidia's inclusion in the Dow Jones is important because the index is a price-weighted index, which means that the degree to which each stock impacts the index is based on its share price, and Nvidia's post-split share price is expected to be around $110 to $120, which would put it near the median price of current Dow components.</li>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>Shares of <strong>Nvidia </strong><span class="ticker">(NASDAQ: NVDA)</span> have soared since the company reported a strong first-quarter earnings report on May 22 and announced a 10-for-1 stock split.</p><p>Since then, the stock has jumped roughly 20% in less than two weeks, and its momentum seems to be continuing into the <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/s/stock-split/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4decf920-c903-4d67-a9ba-243aba7d145a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stock split;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="0">stock split</a>, which is scheduled to go into effect after hours on June 7. Shares have climbed nearly 10% after the initial bounce on those announcements.</p><p>There are a number of reasons investors are reacting favorably to Nvidia's upcoming split. First, even though stock splits don't change the fundamentals of a stock or the business, investors seem to believe that splits are a positive sign from management that it expects the share price to keep moving up.</p><p>A stock split also acts as a reset for the share price, effectively signaling that it has reached a certain milestone and is ready to run up again.</p><p>Splits also make individual shares cheaper, leaving them more accessible to retail investors, which can help boost demand. And there's also evidence that stock splits are correlated with outperformance over the next year, which could be due to a combination of both the momentum in the business that led to the stock split in the first place and enthusiasm from investors resulting from the split.</p><p>However, in the case of Nvidia's upcoming split, there's an added reason investors have become even more bullish.</p><p>Some investors believe that Nvidia could replace <strong>Intel </strong><span class="ticker">(NASDAQ: INTC)</span> in the <strong>Dow Jones Industrial Average </strong><span class="ticker">(DJINDICES: ^DJI)</span>, fully establishing it as a blue chip tech stock.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">Image source: Getty Images.</figcaption></p></figure><h2>Why Nvidia isn't in the Dow yet</h2><p>The Dow Jones is a price-weighted index, which means that the degree to which each stock impacts the index is based on its share price. That's an important difference from the <strong>S&amp;P 500 </strong>and the <strong>Nasdaq </strong>indexes, which are weighted based on market cap.</p><p>If Nvidia were to be added to the Dow at its pre-split share price, it would have by far the highest weight and distort the index, which is based on 30 blue chip stocks from diverse industries and meant to reflect the broad market.</p><p>However, the stock should have a share price of around $110 to $120 after the split, which puts it near the median price of current Dow companies.</p><h2>Why Intel could get booted from the Dow</h2><p>There aren't strict criteria for stocks to be admitted or kicked out of the Dow Jones, but according to <strong>S&amp;P Global</strong>, which manages the index, a Dow stock should be a blue chip company; have an excellent reputation, sustained growth, and wide investor interest, and contribute to sector balance.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>At this point, it's fair to question Intel's ability to deliver sustained growth because it has long been a laggard in the <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/semiconductor-stocks/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4decf920-c903-4d67-a9ba-243aba7d145a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:semiconductor industry;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="0">semiconductor industry</a>. Over the last decade, the stock has gained just 11%, trailing the Dow Jones by a wide margin, and Intel hasn't posted a quarter with double-digit revenue growth in nearly four years even as peers like Nvidia report much faster growth.</p><p>The last stock to be removed from the Dow Jones was <strong>Walgreens Boots Alliance</strong>, which came after several quarters of underperformance and weak results, similar to what Intel has been experiencing.</p><p>If Intel were to be dropped from the Dow, Nvidia would be a logical replacement -- both stocks represent the semiconductor industry. Nvidia is also now much larger than Intel, with a market cap of $2.8 trillion, compared to Intel's $129 billion.</p><h2>What joining the Dow would mean for Nvidia stock</h2><p>Being admitted to the Dow likely wouldn't have a huge effect on Nvidia's stock price. Unlike the S&amp;P 500, the Dow isn't widely tracked by ETFs, meaning that investors don't generally invest in it directly the way they do with the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>In fact, only one ETF, the <strong>SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF</strong>, offers a way to get direct exposure to the Dow Jones index and only the Dow Jones.</p><p>Still, it would be a psychological win for Nvidia to gain entry to the hallowed blue chip index. And it would make sense because Nvidia is now the third most-valuable company in the world -- and the most valuable not to be included in the Dow because both <strong>Apple </strong>and <strong>Microsoft </strong>are members.</p><p>It would also act as a stamp of approval from the committee that Nvidia's success isn't seen as a fleeting phenomenon or a bubble.</p><p>At the same time, removal would be the latest setback for Intel, but it seems to be deserved, given its long-term underperformance. At this point, there are clearly better representatives from the semiconductor industry to include in the index.</p><p>Reviews and rebalancing are rare for the Dow Jones, but it makes sense here. Don't be surprised to see Nvidia replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average once the stock split goes through, though the timing of such a decision will remain a mystery.</p><h2>Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?</h2><p>Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:</p><p>The <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the <strong><a href="https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=6b978bfe-bb56-4585-b831-ed1aa2a583ee&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-foolcom-sa-bbn-dyn%3Faid%3D8867%26amp%253Bsource%3Disaeditxt0010895%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D13885&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4decf920-c903-4d67-a9ba-243aba7d145a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 best stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="0">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Red Lobster is closing around 100 US restaurants, with up to 135 more closures looming, which will result in a loss of beloved menu items such as cheddar bay biscuits and all-you-can-eat seafood deals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, the decline of Red Lobster is particularly significant for many Black diners, who have historically formed a loyal base for the brand and still account for a higher share of customers than other major casual chain restaurants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red Lobster has cultivated a strong relationship with Black customers and has not shied away from catering to that demographic, unlike some other brands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clarence Otis Jr., former CEO of Darden Restaurants from 2004 to 2014, notes that Red Lobster has consistently courted the Black customer base, which is a key part of the brand's identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to Mardeio Cannon, a columnist at the Sacramento Observer, it is fitting that Red Lobster had a Black CEO (Otis) because of the strong affection African Americans have for the brand.</p>

            Red Lobster attracted both working-class and affluent Black diners during the 1970s and 1980s at a time when many sit-down restaurants were unwelcoming of Black patrons, said Marcia Chatelain, a professor of Africana studies at the University of Pennsylvania and author of “Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America,” which explores the relationship between McDonald’s and Black consumers.

            Hiring and serving Black people was not a revolutionary step by Darden, and he certainly was far from the first to leap at the opportunity. But it was another marker of racial progress for Black people in Lakeland and the changing South. In Lakeland during the early 1960s, local civil rights activists <a href="https://www.theledger.com/in-depth/news/special-reports/2020/09/19/black-polk-civil-rights-activists-showed-courage-push-equality/5621673002/" target="_blank">picketed</a> businesses and movie theaters that denied entry to Black patrons, forcing them to integrate.

            Red Lobster was not a “place we frequented a whole lot” in its early days, said Harold Dwight, who graduated two years after Boatwright in 1968. Most Black residents did not have the means to go out to eat, Dwight said. When they did, they went to establishments run by Black owners and Morrison’s Cafeteria, the largest cafeteria chain in the South, which had been integrated for several years and had more Black employees.

            Walter King, who was hired in 1971 to manage a Red Lobster restaurant, was one of the company’s earliest Black employees and stayed with the chain for 36 years. Red Lobster later named one of its signature dishes after King: “Walt’s Favorite Shrimp.” King died last year.
