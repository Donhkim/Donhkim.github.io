<li>The United Automobile Workers (UAW) union faced a setback in its effort to organize Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama, with 56% of workers rejecting the union in an election.</li>
<li>This defeat is likely to slow down the UAW's efforts to organize other auto factories in the South.</li>
<li>Despite this setback, the UAW has had some successes recently, including a major win at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee and a new contract with significant pay and benefit improvements for its members at several North Carolina factories owned by Daimler Truck.</li>
<li>According to an expert, losing this election may not be a death blow to the UAW's efforts, but rather a temporary setback that may affect their confidence going forward.</li>
<li>The UAW is committed to the long-term effort to organize auto workers in the South and is unlikely to give up following this defeat.</li>

They shared the same mission as us, they lived and breathed EV charging,” he adds.</p><p>One of those was George Bahadue, formerly senior manager for site acquisition and business development at Tesla.</p><p>“To my network, you've hit the jackpot—Tesla charging employees are a special breed, resilient and the best in the business. I highly encourage you to consider them as you build your teams and carry on the charging mission,” he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7191028675516018688/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:posted;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="0">posted</a> to <a href="https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LinkedIn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0">LinkedIn</a> earlier this month.</p><h2>Quick-thinking founders seize the moment</h2><p>Luque’s wife seized the moment—reaching out to Bahadue on LinkedIn to say EnviroSpark was hiring for multiple roles and setting up an email hotline for Tesla employees.</p><p>The EnviroSpark <a href="https://green.envirosparkenergy.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:homepage;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="0">homepage</a> also added a pop-up banner urging former Tesla Supercharger staff to apply for their open positions.</p><p>According to Aaron, the company's CEO, over 100 resumes have been received since then.

Even Tesla won’t suffer since the company is so far ahead when it comes to the Supercharger network that there is no threat in sight.</p><p>According to figures from the website EVAdoption, Tesla operates over 12,580 fast charging ports across well over 1,000 locations in the United States, compared to number two Electrify America, which has just 3,112 ports.</p><p>“Anybody looking to scale something that would be able to compete with Tesla, it would take a significant amount of time to catch up, and they would be able to see that coming in advance and adjust accordingly,” Aaron Luque says.</p><h2>No need to replace every gas station with fast chargers</h2><p>EnviroSpark isn’t looking to take on Tesla directly, either.</p><p>In fact, Aaron Luque is likely to agree with Musk to a degree since the former is convinced that replacing every gas station with fast chargers is for birds.</p><p>That’s because EV owners plug in when they get home in the evening and wake up to a full battery.</p><p>Luque argues that rolling out the far less expensive slow chargers in apartment complexes and other multi-unit housing, where the true gap in charging infrastructure can be found, is the real value to be had.</p><p>Not only would the added convenience spur EV adoption, as owners would no longer need to drive to a fast charger, but it would also benefit utilities. That is because it shifts the load away from daylight hours to off-peak nighttime charging, which puts less strain on the grid.</p><p>But Musk’s decision to release all of Tesla’s charging talent into the wild in one fell swoop did come with some downsides for Luque.</p><p>EnviroSpark's work for Tesla has ground to a halt, confirming other <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/03/read-the-wild-email-tesla-is-sending-to-suppliers-amid-supercharger-chaos/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:similar instances;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="0">similar instances</a> reported in the press.</p><p>“We had 26 open projects with Tesla at the time this happened, and we’ve received no communication since then about what we need to be doing,” he says.</p><p>"We’re in a holding pattern until somebody takes over there.”</p><p>Given the chaos, it’s perhaps no surprise that Musk is hiring back a number of his previous Supercharging staff before companies like EnviroSpark offer them gainful employment elsewhere.</p><p><em>Bloomberg</em> learned that Tesla’s CEO has already convinced its former North America director of charging, Max de Zegher, to <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/13/tesla-supercharger-workers-rehired-elon-musk-layoff-entire-team-max-dezegher/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:return;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="0">return</a>.</p><h2>Amid blowback, Musk forced to walk back his hardline stance</h2><p>Speculation as to why Musk sacked his senior director for charging Rebecca Tinucci in the first place has centered around reports she had pushed back against deeper cuts.</p><p>Tesla watchers reason that, on the warpath, Musk decided to make an example of her and everyone who worked for her.</p><p>Tesla couldn’t be reached for comment, as Musk fired everyone in his public relations team years ago.</p><p>However, the speculation around Tinucci's departure seems plausible as the leaked email announcing her exit explicitly warned managers not to disappoint regarding radical headcount reductions.</p><p>Following the subsequent blowback among worried Tesla owners, Musk last week began walking back <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1785406795814510785" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:comments;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="0">comments</a> made in the immediate aftermath of the team’s sacking—ones in which he stated Tesla would now slow the expansion of its charging footprint and concentrate on existing locations.</p><p>First, the Tesla CEO promised to invest well over $500 million in the network that would add thousands of new charge ports before then launching a new Supercharger community on his social media platform <a href="https://fortune.com/company/twitter/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="30" data-v9y="0">X</a> as a show of support.</p><p>For EnviroSpark, Musk’s sudden layoffs came at the perfect moment.</p><p>Now that the company has the means to grow its business, the Luques' biggest challenge is how to fill all the headcount it needs.</p><p>“I honestly believe the timing could not have been any better,” Aaron Luque says.</p><p>"Right after we closed a financing round that gave us the resources, the very next day, the single greatest talent acquisition opportunity in the industry opens up.”</p><p>As his brand new SVP for business development will attest, some sad stories do have a happy ending.</p><p>This story was originally featured on <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/18/elon-musk-tesla-superchargers-workers-talent-acquisition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="31" data-v9y="0">Fortune.com</a></p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Robin Denholm, the chair of Tesla's board, has denied being "lackadaisical" in her oversight of the company, after a Delaware judge voided Elon Musk's historic compensation package worth more than $50 billion.</li>
<li>Denholm sold Tesla stock options in 2021 and 2022, making a "life-changing" gain of $280 million, which the judge suggested might have clouded her objectivity.</li>
<li>Denholm has justified her stock awards by citing the company's improved performance and performance-based compensation.</li>
<li>Denholm has rejected the notion that her immense wealth has compromised her independence, claiming that it has actually given her more financial independence.</li>
<li>Denholm has also rejected the idea that she is too close to Musk, calling the claim "absolute BS", emphasizing that her role is to ensure a good relationship between the board and the CEO, and to ensure management is doing its job to grow the company.</li>

    <div><div class="paywall paywallActive">



<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/aa5464fd-c7c5-4f38-a2df-374a07439d88" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.ft.com/content/aa5464fd-c7c5-4f38-a2df-374a07439d88" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.ft.com/content/aa5464fd-c7c5-4f38-a2df-374a07439d88" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL"><em>Financial Times</em></a>, she addressed Musk’s historic compensation package that’s worth more than $50 billion and a Delaware court’s January ruling that voided it, with the judge calling the board’s oversight “lackadaisical.” </p>



<p>The judge also singled out Australia-based Denholm, saying she too was “lackadaisical” and suggesting she wasn’t objective enough due to the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/16/elon-musk-pay-package-delaware-tesla-chair-robyn-denholm/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/16/elon-musk-pay-package-delaware-tesla-chair-robyn-denholm/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/02/16/elon-musk-pay-package-delaware-tesla-chair-robyn-denholm/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">“life-changing” windfall of $280 million</a> she made by selling Tesla stock options in 2021 and 2022.</p>



<p>“That is crap,” Denholm told the <em>FT</em>. “I had to look up that word . . . I will tell you, anybody who knows me, knows that I am not lackadaisical, now that I know what that word means. It is probably the furthest from the truth. I am really intense and very diligent in what I do.”</p>



<p>She justified her stock awards by echoing the defense of Musk’s compensation package, saying shares have climbed as the company’s performance improved.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>Denholm added that rather than clouding her objectivity, the immense wealth from the sale of her stock options has boosted her independence.</p>



<p>“If I didn’t agree with something that was going on at the company, I could walk away tomorrow,” she said. “The fact that you’ve sold shares makes you more financially independent.”</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>And for good measure, she called the Delaware judge’s claim that she’s too close to Musk “absolute BS.”</p>



<p>Tesla named Denholm to the board in 2014 and tapped her as chair in 2018, after Musk’s infamous “funding secured” tweet that said he was taking the company private at $420 a share. </p>



<p>In a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the tweet, Musk had to step down as chair, pay a fine, and get approval for tweets from a Tesla lawyer.</p>



<p>Denholm acknowledged to the <em>FT</em> that “we have tough conversations about tweets” but rejected the notion that she is Musk’s babysitter.</p>



<p>“To me, the role of the chair is really to make sure the board has a good relationship with the CEO and the executive team,” she said. “We’re there on behalf of shareholders to make sure that management is doing their job, and their job is primarily to grow shareholder value over time.”</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>More recently, she and other board members have been trying to win over shareholders ahead of Tesla’s annual meeting on June 13, which could prove critical to the future of the company. In fact, despite Musk’s aversion to marketing, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/tesla-elon-musk-ceo-compensation-pay-shareholder-vote-agm-advertising/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/tesla-elon-musk-ceo-compensation-pay-shareholder-vote-agm-advertising/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/tesla-elon-musk-ceo-compensation-pay-shareholder-vote-agm-advertising/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">Tesla has even bought ads</a> to persuade shareholders to support Tesla’s move to reincorporate in Texas—and <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/17/elon-musk-compensation-package-tesla-proxy-shareholders/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/17/elon-musk-compensation-package-tesla-proxy-shareholders/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">ratify Musk’s record pay package</a> from 2018.   </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/17/elon-musk-compensation-package-tesla-proxy-shareholders/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/17/elon-musk-compensation-package-tesla-proxy-shareholders/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">proxy statement inviting</a> shareholders to the meeting, Denholm wrote last month that a “yea” vote on the pay package would “restore Tesla’s stockholder democracy.”</p>



<p>“Because the Delaware court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value,” she added, arguing it was a “matter of fundamental fairness and respect to our CEO.”</p>



<p>The meeting comes during a difficult stretch for Tesla as EV sales have slowed amid cutthroat competition, while shares have tumbled from pandemic-era highs and the company lays off employees. </p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the future of business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/eye-on-ai?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=eye_on_ai" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/eye-on-ai?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=eye_on_ai" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Earlier this week, the Biden Administration implemented new </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.teslarati.com/white-house-hike-tariffs-chinese-ev-fend-off-cheap-imports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and other products from China. The White House placed the largest tariffs on Chinese EVs, with over a 100% increase. The Biden Administration is also considering penalties on Chinese EV automakers moving production to Mexico. </span></p>



<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the United States takes a bolder stance against Chinese EVs and other products to protect local companies, Europe is still mulling over the potential consequences of setting tariffs on Chinese EVs.</span></p>







<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-teslarati wp-block-embed-teslarati"></figure>



<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Europe is also concerned about Chinese EVs undercutting local automakers in the region. European car manufacturers are having difficulty offering vehicles at the same prices as Chinese-made EVs. </span></p>



<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The EU Commission initiated an </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.teslarati.com/eu-anti-subsidy-electric-vehicle-probe-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">anti-subsidy probe into Chinese EVs</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and their effect on the European EV market. Europe is also considering placing higher tariffs on Chinese EVs. According to Rhodium Group, however, tariffs on Chinese EVs must be more than 50% higher to affect the current EV market in Europe and give European automakers a chance against China’s electric vehicle offerings. </span></p>



<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stellantis has approached the competition a little differently. It has partnered with Chinese automaker Leapmotor. </span></p>



<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Earlier this week, Stellantis and Leapmotor announced they would launch a sub-€20,000 electric hatchback in Europe. The pair plan to launch the affordable Stellantis-Leapmotor electric hatchback in at least 9 European countries by September 2024. </span></p>



<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Whether I like it or not, they are grabbing share. What I can do is leverage that dynamic,” said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares, reported The Guardian.</span></p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The meme coins GameStop (GME) and AMC entertainment saw significant surges and declines, sparking discussions on market behavior. GME, which was trading at its peak, has now declined 29.51% in the past 24 hours.</li>
<li>Robert Leshner, CEO of Superstate, stated that the market was irrational and inefficient, expressing disappointment for hedge funds and individuals who were short GameStop and AMC.</li>
<li>Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton expressed concerns over market manipulation, stating that the movement of stocks based on tweets and social media posts resembled more like gambling than investing.</li>
<li>The article highlights the significant influence of social media on market dynamics, with Leshner and Clayton encouraging caution and scrutiny of market movements driven by social media trends.</li>
<li>Despite the recent decline of GME, the article suggests that memecoins may still have a bright future, with the potential to surpass meme stocks due to perceived advantages.</li>

<ul>
<li><em>GameStop and AMC saw surges and declines, prompting discussions on market behavior.</em></li>
<li><em>Memecoins may surpass meme stocks due to perceived advantages.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The surge was short-lived. GameStop (GME), a <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/category/solana-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Solana [SOL]</a> -based memecoin that spiked after the resurgence of Roaring Kitty, is now bleeding in reds.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">CoinMarketCap</a>, GME saw a notable decline of 29.51% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://in.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AMC/" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="exclude">TradingView</a> data indicates a 5.17% drop for AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC).</p>
<p>These developments have sparked intense debates among investors and analysts, particularly in light of GME and AMC’s staggering 75% and 89% spikes on the 15th of May.</p>
<h4><strong>Why are the execs disappointed? </strong></h4>
<p>Providing insights on the same, Robert Leshner, CEO of Superstate in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzCshFRClv8" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">conversation</a> at “The Chopping Block” podcast said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I feel bad for any hedge funds or individuals that were short GameStop and AMC. This was a market being irrational and inefficient, I don’t think anyone is calling this an efficient or rational market.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Adding to the disappointment, Former SEC Chair, Jay Clayton in a separate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZxvqE6NIo" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">conversation</a> with CNBC said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“It bothers me on many levels— It’s a lot closer to gambling than trading and it is certainly not investing.”</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Shocking social media trends </strong></h4>
<p>Well, the story doesn’t end here, as it raises questions about how a tweet can have such a significant influence on market dynamics.</p>
<p>Replying to the above concerns, Leshner said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The fact that meme on Twitter can move a stock from $15 to $80 in two days of trading should continue to scare people about the irrationality of financial markets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Reflecting similar opinions, Clayton added,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Is a Tweet really investment advice? We’ve learned over the last five years that a Tweet is not investment advice.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Amid such uncertainty, analysts remain divided on whether investors will persist or be delisted due to market manipulation concerns.</p>
<h4><strong>The future still looks bright for memecoins </strong></h4>
<p>Despite such FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt), Tom Schmidt, partner at Dragonfly added,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The memecoin markets are more orderly, there’s no circuit breaker, you can always log in and you’re not going to get blocked out.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Echoing a similar sentiment, Haseeb Qureshi, Managing Partner at Dragonfly, noted,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Over time people will just converge on trading memecoins rather than trading meme stocks because they’re just better.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/meme-token" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">CoinGecko’s</a> data further confirmed this statement, indicating a $57.5 billion meme market cap with a 3.4% change in the past 24 hours.</p>

But requests for a fraction of that compute were often denied, blocking the team from doing their work.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">That issue, among others, pushed several team members to resign this week, including co-lead Jan Leike, a former DeepMind researcher who while at OpenAI was involved with the development of ChatGPT, GPT-4 and ChatGPT’s predecessor, InstructGPT.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Leike went public with some reasons for his resignation on Friday morning. “I have been disagreeing with OpenAI leadership about the company’s core priorities for quite some time, until we finally reached a breaking point,” Leike wrote in a series of posts on X. “I believe much more of our bandwidth should be spent getting ready for the next generations of models, on security, monitoring, preparedness, safety, adversarial robustness, (super)alignment, confidentiality, societal impact, and related topics. These problems are quite hard to get right, and I am concerned we aren’t on a trajectory to get there.”</p>

	
	


	
	




<p class="wp-block-paragraph">OpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment about the resources promised and allocated to that team. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">OpenAI formed the Superalignment team last July, and it was led by Leike and OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/ilya-sutskever-openai-co-founder-and-longtime-chief-scientist-departs/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/ilya-sutskever-openai-co-founder-and-longtime-chief-scientist-departs/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="1" mrfobservableid="d7ece169-9ba7-44bd-9859-afd0435301e2">who also resigned from the company this week</a>. It had the ambitious goal of solving the core technical challenges of controlling superintelligent AI in the next four years. Joined by scientists and engineers from OpenAI’s previous alignment division as well as researchers from other orgs across the company, the team was to contribute research informing the safety of both in-house and non-OpenAI models, and, through initiatives including a research grant program, solicit from and share work with the broader AI industry.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Superalignment team did manage to publish a body of safety research and funnel millions of dollars in grants to outside researchers. But, as product launches began to take up an increasing amount of OpenAI leadership’s bandwidth, the Superalignment team found itself having to fight for more upfront investments — investments it believed were critical to the company’s stated mission of developing superintelligent AI for the benefit of all humanity.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor,” Leike continued. “But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Sutskever’s battle with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman served as a major added distraction.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Sutskever, along with OpenAI’s old board of directors, moved to abruptly fire Altman late last year over concerns that Altman hadn’t been “consistently candid” with the board’s members. Under pressure from OpenAI’s investors, including Microsoft, and many of the company’s own employees, Altman was eventually reinstated, much of the board resigned and Sutskever <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/technology/ilya-sutskever-leaving-openai.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-mrf-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/technology/ilya-sutskever-leaving-openai.html" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="2" mrfobservableid="802c5bec-b41c-4e83-a5e3-08659437b69c">reportedly</a> never returned to work.</p>

	
	


	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">According to the source, Sutskever was instrumental to the Superalignment team — not only contributing research but serving as a bridge to other divisions within OpenAI. He would also serve as an ambassador of sorts, impressing the importance of the team’s work on key OpenAI decision makers.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After Leike’s departure, Altman wrote in X that he agreed there is “a lot more to do,” and that they are “committed to doing it.” He hinted at a longer explanation, which co-founder Greg Brockman supplied Saturday morning:</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Though there is little concrete in Brockman’s response as far as policies or commitments, he said that “we need to have a very tight feedback loop, rigorous testing, careful consideration at every step, world-class security, and harmony of safety and capabilities.”</p>

	
	


	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Following the departures of Leike and Sutskever, John Schulman, another OpenAI co-founder, has moved to head up the type of work the Superalignment team was doing, but there will no longer be a dedicated team — instead, it will be a loosely associated group of researchers embedded in divisions throughout the company. An OpenAI spokesperson described it as “integrating [the team] more deeply.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The fear is that, as a result, OpenAI’s AI development won’t be as safety-focused as it could’ve been.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for April showed that inflation remained under control, with the overall rate of inflation declining.</li>
<li>However, the core services component of the CPI, which includes housing costs and medical care, rose 3.15% over the prior year, slightly higher than the previous month.</li>
<li>Housing costs, specifically, rose 5.5% over the prior year, accounting for two-thirds of the increase in core inflation. Energy costs also played a significant role in pushing prices higher.</li>
<li>Bank of America expects services inflation to moderate as the year progresses, with shelter costs expected to decrease in August. However, the Fed may be cautious about declaring victory too soon, given its previous mistakes in assessing the severity of the inflation problem.</li>
<li>The strong labor market and wage growth have driven consumer spending out of goods and into services, which may contribute to the persistence of services inflation.</li>

<li>
<p>A Russian court has ordered the seizure of Deutsche Bank's and Commerzbank's assets, accounts, property, and shares in Russia as part of a lawsuit involving the German banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lawsuit is related to a contract for the construction of a gas processing plant in Russia with Linde, which was terminated due to Western sanctions. The construction project was a joint venture between Gazprom and RusChemAlliance, a 50/50 joint venture owned by Gazprom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court has imposed a seizure on up to €238.6 million in securities, real estate, and bank accounts of Deutsche Bank, as well as its Russian subsidiary and Deutsche Bank Technology Center. Deutsche Bank has already provisioned around €260 million for the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commerzbank's assets worth €93.7 million have also been seized, along with securities and the bank's building in central Moscow. Commerzbank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deutsche Bank said it would need to see how the claim is implemented by the Russian courts and assess the immediate operational impact in Russia. The bank's statement did not provide further details on the impact on its operations in Russia.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Jito collected large amounts of daily fees, surpassing a vast majority of DeFi protocols.</em></li>
<li><em>The Solana ecosystem continued to see growth as activity on the network soared.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://ambcrypto.com/category/solana-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Solana [SOL]</a> has been able to attract numerous users to its ecosystem over the last few months. Primarily, this growth in activity has been initiated by memecoins being attracted to the network.</p>
<h4>Jito shows growth</h4>
<p>However, other elements of the Solana ecosystem have also seen growth over the last few days. One of them was the Jito protocol.</p>
<p>At press time, Jito was generating $1.5 million in daily fees, surpassing all but a few DeFi protocols. For comparison, Lido collected $2.58 million and Uniswap collected $2.09 million in fees over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Jito’s success has several potential implications for Solana. Firstly, it demonstrates the growing DeFi landscape on Solana.</p>
<p>Jito’s ability to compete with established DeFi giants like Uniswap and Lido showcases Solana’s ecosystem’s potential to create highly competitive dApps.</p>
<p>This could attract more developers and users to the platform, further accelerating DeFi growth within the Solana ecosystem.</p>
<p>Secondly, Jito’s high fees indicate a healthy level of network activity on Solana. This activity could translate to increased network security and potentially higher value for SOL in the near future.</p>
<p>However, a large part of Jito’s fees are derived from MEV (maximum extractable value), which can sometimes lead to negative user experiences like sandwich attacks.</p>
<p>Solana will need to find ways to mitigate these potential drawbacks to ensure sustainable growth. Overall, Jito’s performance is a positive sign for Solana.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Social Security faces insolvency</strong>: The Social Security program is expected to face reduced monthly checks as early as 2033 if not addressed, according to a report.</li>
<li><strong>Political pressure is mounting</strong>: Lawmakers are facing increasing political pressure to reform the program to avoid insolvency, but recent history suggests that procrastination may win out and reforms may come at the last minute, potentially leading to increased costs.</li>
<li>** Lessons from the past**: A similar crisis was averted in 1983 when President Reagan signed a bill to reform Social Security, but lawmakers only acted at the last minute. A historian suggests that it may take a crisis to prompt action.</li>
<li><strong>Delayed action has consequences</strong>: Economists warn that delayed action to reform Social Security can lead to increased worry among program participants and make it harder to solve the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Lawmakers must act sooner rather than later</strong>: Experts like Jason Fichtner, a former chief economist at the Bipartisan Policy Center, are urging lawmakers to act sooner rather than later to avoid a crisis and ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security.</li>

              </figcaption></figure><p>While the rate climate in recent years has hurt all types of borrowers, it's been a boost for savers with select accounts. With rates on <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/high-yield-savings-account/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">high-yield savings</a></span> and <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whats-a-certificate-of-deposit-cd/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">certificates of deposit (CD) accounts</a></span> less than 1% in 2020 and 2021, savers had no real way to grow their funds with these vehicles. But as the pandemic faded and <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-june-cpi-report-hit-new-high-40-years-9-1-percent/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">inflation surged</a></span>, the federal funds rate rose in tandem. That caused rates on both savings accounts to rise exponentially. As of May 2024, savers can now earn upward of <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-todays-cd-interest-rates/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">5%</a></span> with either (<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-you-should-open-cd-and-high-yield-savings-account-this-week/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">or both</a></span>) of these accounts. That said, 5% may not seem like a substantial amount but when viewed as dollars and cents, savers can gain a better perspective on what they stand to earn.</p><p>Right now, the very best rates are typically offered on CDs. And you won't need to deposit an exorbitant amount or keep your money locked away forever to realize a significant return. Still, before getting started, it helps to see what your bottom line will be after the account <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-to-do-when-your-cd-matures-according-to-experts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">matures</a></span>. To that end, below we've broken down exactly how much a $10,000 deposit into a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/best-6-month-cd-rates/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">6-month CD</a></span> would earn at today's elevated rates.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhow-much-interest-would-a-10000-6-month-cd-earn-now&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhow-much-interest-would-a-10000-6-month-cd-earn-now%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=ab4a4ea6-2290-4971-afd7-0b3623f78e86" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See how much more you could be earning with a top CD account here now</a>.</p><p></p><h2><strong>How much interest would a $10,000 6-month CD earn now?</strong></h2><p>To determine precisely how much a $10,000 6-month CD will earn if opened this month, you'll have to know the interest rate it's opened with. Since different lenders offer different rates based on the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cd-terms-everything-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">term</a></span> (or length) of the CD, this could vary. That understood, here's what the account will earn based off of some common 6-month CDs rates available online now:</p><ul><li><strong>5.35%:</strong> $264.01 in interest for a total amount of $10,264.01 after six months. </li><li><strong>5.30%:</strong> $261.58 in interest for a total amount of $10,261.58 after six months. </li><li><strong>5.25%:</strong> $259.14 for a total amount of $10,259.14 after six months.</li><li><strong>5.00%:</strong> $246.95 for a total amount of $10,246.95 after six months. </li></ul><p>As can be seen, rates on six-month CDs are in the same range right now across lenders. But if you're truly after the highest rate possible, consider opening a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/should-you-open-a-cd-account-online/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">CD with an online bank</a></span> versus one with physical branches. Since online banks often don't have the overhead costs of maintaining physical locations, they can frequently offer higher rates to customers than their counterparts with banks in different parts of the country.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhow-much-interest-would-a-10000-6-month-cd-earn-now&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhow-much-interest-would-a-10000-6-month-cd-earn-now%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=ab4a4ea6-2290-4971-afd7-0b3623f78e86" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Start exploring your 6-month CD account options online today</a>.</p><h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>While the above returns are substantial, savers stand to earn even more if they make a larger deposit or extend the term past six months. By doing either, savers can potentially earn <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-make-hundreds-of-dollars-with-a-cd-now/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">hundreds of dollars</a></span> more than illustrated and even <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-earn-thousands-of-dollars-with-a-cd-now/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">thousands</a></span> with the right strategic approach. </p>

    </p>
<p>But it's important to remember that <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cd-early-withdrawal-penalties-what-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">early withdrawal penalties</a></span> will apply if you take your money out of the account before it matures, so only deposit an amount you're comfortable parting with for the full term. And be cognizant of tax implications as you may have to pay <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-you-avoid-taxes-on-cd-account-interest/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">taxes</a></span> if the interest you earn on a CD surpasses a certain threshold. But if you understand these nuances - and account for them in advance - you can earn a few hundred dollars right now simply by transferring some money into one of today's top 6-month CD accounts.</p>

<li>Nearly 20,000 businesses have warned that they are at risk of closing if President Joe Biden is elected to a second term.</li>

"All of the government reports and happy-talk from Washington DC doesn't change that Americans continue wrestling with <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/us-inflation-records-biggest-increase-40-years-prices-skyrocket-1677985" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="multivariate">inflation</a>, and a majority of small business owners now predict we'll slip into stagflation."</p><p>While inflation stood at 3.4 percent in April, not everyone believes Biden's presidency is directly related to the economic turmoil many businesses face.</p><p>HR consultant Bryan Driscoll questioned whether any of Biden's actual economic policies were the reason for the small business's troubled finances.</p><p>"The discussion today simply happens to occur when a Democrat is in the White House. The same conversation could also happen with a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican" data-sys="1" class="multivariate">Republican</a> but rarely does because <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republicans" data-sys="1" class="multivariate">Republicans</a> have better messaging about how they're better for small business," Driscoll said. "Spoiler: they're not."</p><p>For some businesses, Biden's pro-worker policies could create temporary financial stress for businesses that "fail to innovate or manage their finances effectively," Driscoll said.</p><p>"If a business can't afford to pay its workers fairly or handle economic fluctuations, it might indicate inefficiencies within the business itself rather than flaws in national economic policy," Driscoll said.</p><p>And when it comes to a second Biden or Trump presidency, Driscoll said both would have significantly different implications for the small business owners both long and short term.</p><p>"Biden's approach is more likely to lead to long-term stability and growth by focusing on the workforce," Driscoll said. "While some businesses might feel immediate pressure, those that adapt will ultimately thrive in a fairer economic landscape. Conversely, a Trump presidency could lead to short-term gains for businesses but potentially at the cost of worker welfare and long-term sustainability. After all, if a business can't afford to pay its workers fairly, how does it expect those same workers to afford the products and services they help create?"</p><p>A separate survey from CNBC last year showed only 30 percent of small business owners approved of Biden's policies, and 56 percent said they "strongly disapprove" of the way he's handled his presidency.</p><div class="uncommon-knowledge"><div class="logo-text">
