    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- Nike Inc. shares sank after the sneaker company’s full-year outlook missed expectations, stoking investor concerns about waning demand and competition from upstarts On and Hoka, as well as rival Adidas AG.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>The world’s largest sportswear company sees revenue declining in the mid-single digits in the company’s current fiscal year, which began this month. Analysts had expected growth of about 2% this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.</p><p>The shares fell as much as 18% on Friday morning — Nike’s biggest fall since 2001. As of 9:35 a.m., the drop had wiped out about $23 billion in market value. The stock had already declined 17% over the past 12 months.</p><p>Other athletic retailers including JD Sports Fashion Plc and Puma SE were dragged down. Adidas gained early Friday in Frankfurt, but the stock later erased the gain.</p><p>After years of dominance, Nike is struggling to churn out hot-selling footwear to replace top sellers such as Air Force 1 and Dunk sneakers. The worsening performance raises the pressure on Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe. Donahoe has resorted to layoffs and other belt-tightening measures after a move to prioritize Nike’s own sales channels failed to produce the promised levels of profits and growth.</p><p>Nike also curtailed its reliance on retail partners in recent years, which in turn have begun pushing rival brands. The wave of competition from newer brands such as On Holding AG and Deckers Outdoor Corp.’s Hoka pushed Nike to vow to prioritize sports, new products and wholesale partners.</p><p>The trajectory contrasts with that of Adidas, whose new Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Gulden has embraced retail partners again and sped up the introduction of new products like the retro Samba sneaker, which has become a hit and fueled a new era of growth. He’s also sharpened the company’s focus on athletic performance.</p><p>Nike’s revenue in the fourth quarter fell 1.7% to $12.6 billion, missing the average of analyst estimates. A notable laggard was the Converse subsidiary, known for its Chuck Taylor sneakers, where revenue plummeted 18% due to soft sales in both North America and Western Europe.</p><p>Donahoe took over as Nike’s CEO in January 2020, following many years leading tech companies including ServiceNow Inc. and eBay Inc. Before that, he had spent nearly two decades at the management consulting firm Bain &amp; Company Inc., where in 1999 he became CEO.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="18"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Some analysts have criticized Donahoe’s leadership approach, with Sam Poser of Williams Trading recently arguing that Nike’s current senior executives lack the “instinct and experience that the prior team had.” That’s left Nike in a “push model” situation, Poser said, whereby a company has to try to convince consumers to buy its products rather than the opposite scenario, where people are struggling to get their hands on a company’s shoes and apparel.</p><p>That’s a marked difference from what Nike was experiencing for much of the past decade, during which it has basically doubled revenue from $25 billion in 2013 to more than $50 billion today. While annual sales dipped during the onset of the Covid pandemic in 2020, the growth has otherwise been remarkable until recent quarters.</p><p>Now, Nike leaders are asking for patience as the company looks to accelerate the release of new franchises in the fitness and lifestyle categories in the second half of this fiscal year and then bring on more new products over the next couple of years.</p><p>“A comeback at this scale takes time,” Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said during the company’s call with analysts. But he cautioned that shifting the product lineup will erode sales in the short term.</p><p>Nike executives blamed the slowdown in part on lifestyle brands, including Air Force 1 and Nike Dunks. The category’s sales fell for the first time since the start of the pandemic, when demand for casual attire took off.</p><p>The issues could prompt double-digit downgrades to analysts’ earnings expectations for the company during this year and next, according to analyst James Grzinic of Jefferies. Moreover, the era of European shoe companies’ stock reactions tracking Nike’s is breaking down.</p><p>Adidas is now the “preferred sporting brand for global investors” as Nike and Lululemon Athletica Inc. lose momentum, Grzinic said in a note.</p><p>Weakness in Nike’s own sales channels is also a “reason for concern, as the activewear giant could be turning its core shoppers away due to lack of newness,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Poonam Goyal.</p><p>--With assistance from Daniela Wei and Isolde MacDonogh.</p><p>(Updates share trading)</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

know what their dividends will be and what their stock buyback plans will be.</p><p>So let me give you the headlines first and then explain what's going on here and why we're learning about this right now.</p><p>Citigroup.</p><p>Let's start.</p><p>There is, uh, planning a quarterly dividend of 56 cents a share here.</p><p>That is an increase in the company's, uh, dividend here by, uh, a few cents here we've got JP.</p><p>Morgan says it's going to boost its quarterly dividend to a buck 25 from a dollar 15 and JP.</p><p>Morgan is also planning, um, a new buyback plan of up to $30

all of these right now?</p><p>Well, as you know, because our Jennifer Schomer covered it every year.</p><p>The banks have to go through this stress testing from the Federal Reserve.</p><p>This was something enacted during the financial crisis.</p><p>As you know, that made sure that the banks had adequate capital in the event of an emergency.</p><p>So they sort of model the fed, models it out.</p><p>Everything goes to hell like it did, uh, during the financial crisis.</p><p>How would these banks look?</p><p>Would they have enough capital to cover their losses?</p><p>Once they pass

<p>Friday could be the busiest day in LAX’s history as the TSA says it’s preparing for a massive summer travel season.</p>



<p>As reported by KTLA’s Carlos Herrera, LAX was calm just before 6 a.m. Friday but that wasn’t expected to last.</p>



<p>“Don’t let the [slow morning] fool you because today will be the busiest day ever here at LAX,” Herrera said. “Well, not only here at LAX in fact, at airports all across the United States.”</p>



<p>The TSA predicted that it could screen more than 3 million on Friday and more than 32 million through July 8, which would be a nearly 5% increase over last year. </p>

<p>“We expect this summer to be our busiest ever,” TSA Administrator David Pekoske <a href="https://apnews.com/article/july-4th-travel-best-days-to-fly-57eb68567b9665bd8b2cbbd78ca024b6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told the Associated Press</a>.</p>



<p>Lower costs for domestic flight tickets are likely contributing to the high travel day, Herrera reported.</p>





<p>With the heightened travel figures, getting to your travel gate could provide a challenge at LAX and other airports. Experts recommend arriving early for a flight as it could be tough navigating through traffic outside the airport and security lines may be longer than typical.</p>



<p>In addition to busier airports, AAA says as many as 60 million will take to the roads for their travel plans through the Fourth of July holiday. The most popular driving destinations for Southern California residents included Las Vegas, San Diego and Phoenix.</p>

    </div><div class="content article-descr news-text">
    <div><div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow">
<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">The blockbuster <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/vw-to-invest-up-to-5b-into-rivian-in-software-deal/">$5 billion deal</a> between Volkswagen Group and Rivian is just days old. But it turns out, VW Group was tapping into Rivian’s software expertise months before the partnership was announced. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">VW Group’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/30/layoffs-at-vws-cariad-further-delay-software-launch-in-porsche-audi-models/">struggling software arm</a> Cariad has hired at least 23 of the startup’s top employees over the past several months, a TechCrunch review of LinkedIn data reveals. Cariad’s chief software officer, chief product security officer, two of its vice presidents and two principal engineers have all been hired from Rivian. Nearly all of the other hires came from senior software roles at Rivian, many of them this year.  </p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The hires pre-date any deal between VW and Rivian. The joint venture, which would allow the German giant to leverage Rivian’s software and electrical architecture chops, is still being formed. The JV isn’t expected to be formalized until the fourth quarter — a detail that VW and Rivian spokespeople pointed out. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Still, the wave of new hires illustrates VW’s — and, more specifically, Cariad’s — desire to tap software talent. And those early hires could prove fruitful as the joint venture comes together. </p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The hires have bolstered Cariad’s effort to build up a Silicon Valley outpost in Mountain View called the SDV Hub — an acronym that gives a nod to the so-called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/wtf-is-a-software-defined-vehicle/">software-defined vehicle</a> that every automaker is chasing. The SDV hub is ground zero for Cariad’s next-generation software architecture known as “software 2.0.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In fall 2023, Cariad hired Sanjay Lal, who most recently led the development of Rivian’s infotainment and next-gen middleware across the vehicle and cloud, to lead the establishment of the SDV hub. The focus of the engineers at the SDV hub in California — as well as some German-based workers under Lal — is on the software 2.0 architecture that is supposed to be an operating system designed for all VW Group brands. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The hub’s focus suggests those same employees could be part of the eventual VW-Rivian joint venture. It should be noted that both Rivian and VW spokespeople said that speculation was premature.</p>
<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">
</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“We are initially focusing together on the smooth start-up of our joint venture with Rivian, and will comment on everything else at a later time,” an emailed statement from VW reads.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While Cariad has more than 7,000 employees worldwide, its footprint in North America is much smaller. The SDV hub currently has around 230 employees, according to LinkedIn. That means recent Rivian expats now make up around 10% of Cariad’s employee base in the region. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">These hires come as Cariad is in the middle of restructuring after years of struggles. Created in 2020, Cariad was supposed to speed up development of advanced software and electrical architecture for Volkswagen Group’s big push into EVs. As Cariad grew in size, its problems compounded. Its software 1.2 platform, which was being developed for Audi and Porsche cars, was originally scheduled for completion in 2022. The constant delays and other internal problems led to several executive shakeups and is considered one of the reasons <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/22/vw-group-ceo-herbert-diess-is-out/">VW Group CEO Herbert Diess</a> was dismissed in 2022. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Cariad, now under the direction of Peter Bosch, has successfully completed the 1.2 software architecture that will be in the upcoming Porsche Macan EV. But it’s the 2.0 architecture that is meant to catapult all of the group’s brands in the same sphere as Tesla. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Tapping talent from the likes of Rivian bucks how Cariad was building out its North American workforce over the last two years. Prior to the last few months, most Cariad employees in the region came from other places inside the Volkswagen Group, from automotive or software suppliers. Far fewer came from tech companies, like Cariad’s director of software engineering, who spent almost a decade at Google.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">VW and Cariad are not the only ones looking to startups like Rivian to build out talent. Ford’s own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/12/fords-secretive-low-cost-ev-team-is-growing-with-talent-from-rivian-tesla-and-apple/">secretive low-cost EV project has been snapping up workers</a> from Rivian, Tesla, Lucid Motors and even Apple’s disbanded Project Titan, as TechCrunch first reported earlier this month.</p>

<p>“This has the potential to affect millions of California consumers and the integrity of our residential property insurance market,” California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement provided to KQED.</p>
<p>The department will closely examine State Farm’s financial stability, Lara said.</p>
<p>“Using my authority under Prop. 103, I will investigate State Farm’s financial situation, including a rate hearing on these applications if necessary. My Department’s experts and I have serious questions.”</p>
<p>For the last year, State Farm has not written new policies in California, and it has not renewed tens of thousands of existing policies.</p>
<p>Documents from AM Best, a company that rates insurance companies’ financial solvency, show a troubled situation for State Farm. Its financial strength was downgraded this spring, and its long-term outlook is considered negative.</p>
<p>“Financially speaking, State Farm is very, very much apparently in trouble. And I think that their request for rate increases will be met with a lot of frustration by consumers because the last thing anybody wants is to be paying more money right now,” said Karl Susman, an insurance broker. “And since there’s still not the ability for people to shop around for other options, what are they going to do but pay that higher rate? But I think that it’s probably going to show pretty quickly that it’s necessary to keep State Farm from literally going insolvent.”</p>
<p>Lara sought to reassure State Farm policyholders that nothing would change immediately as a result of these filings. Under California’s regulatory process, rate filings should take two months to be reviewed, although they have dragged on for years in some cases — a process set for a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/26/nx-s1-5015738/california-hopes-to-lure-insurance-companies-back-with-extreme-regulation-overhaul">major overhaul by regulators</a> this year.</p>
<p>Lara also said the Department of Insurance had already made tough decisions in approving significant State Farm rate increases recently, including a March hike averaging 20% across the state.</p>
<p>He continued by inviting the public to get involved <a href="https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/150-other-prog/01-intervenor/">via the intervenor process</a>, which allows the public to weigh in on changes to their insurance.</p>
<p>Susman predicts the Department of Insurance will have no choice but to approve the requested rate increases.</p>
<p>“Because the alternative is literally — what’s the point of having a carrier with lower rates that can’t pay claims?” he said. “And they are basically at that place right now where if they’re not able to get this rate and they’re already in such a bad place financially, I don’t see how we can expect them to possibly weather the storm.”</p>

    <div><div class="body__inner-container"><p>Amazon’s cloud division has launched an investigation into Perplexity AI. At issue is whether the AI search startup is violating <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/aws/">Amazon Web Services</a> rules by scraping websites that attempted to prevent it from doing so, WIRED has learned.</p><p class="paywall">AWS spokesperson Patrick Neighorn confirmed the company's investigation of Perplexity following a WIRED inquiry about the startup's apparent scraping practices. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/">WIRED had previously found</a> that the Perplexity—which has <a data-offer-url="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/perplexity-raises-series-b-funding-round" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/perplexity-raises-series-b-funding-round"}' href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/perplexity-raises-series-b-funding-round" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">backing</a> from the Jeff Bezos family fund and Nvidia, and was recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-27/softbank-to-invest-in-perplexity-in-ai-race-against-google-rivals">valued</a> at $3 billion—appears to rely on content from scraped websites that had forbidden access through the Robots Exclusion Protocol, a common web standard. While the Robots Exclusion Protocol is not legally binding, terms of service generally are.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p><p class="paywall"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24067997/robots-txt-ai-text-file-web-crawlers-spiders">The Robots Exclusion Protocol</a> is a decades-old web standard that involves placing a plaintext file (like wired.com/robots.txt) on a domain to indicate which pages should not be accessed by automated bots and crawlers. While companies that use scrapers can choose to ignore this protocol, most have traditionally respected it. Neighorn told WIRED that AWS customers must adhere to the robots.txt standard while crawling websites.</p><p class="paywall">“AWS’s terms of service prohibit abusive and illegal activities and our customers are responsible for complying with those terms," Neighorn said in a statement. “We routinely receive reports of alleged abuse from a variety of sources and engage our customers to understand those reports.”</p><p class="paywall">Scrutiny of Perplexity’s practices follows <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/randalllane/2024/06/11/why-perplexitys-cynical-theft-represents-everything-that-could-go-wrong-with-ai/">a June 11 report from Forbes</a> that accused the startup of stealing at least one of its articles. WIRED investigations confirmed the practice and found further evidence of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/">scraping abuse</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-plagiarized-our-story-about-how-perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/">plagiarism</a> by systems linked to Perplexity’s AI-powered search chatbot. Engineers for Condé Nast, WIRED’s parent company, block Perplexity’s crawler across all its websites using a robots.txt file. But WIRED found the company had access to a server using an unpublished IP address—44.221.181.252—which visited Condé Nast properties at least hundreds of times in the past three months, apparently to scrape Condé Nast websites.</p><p class="paywall">The machine associated with Perplexity appears to be engaged in widespread crawling of news websites that forbid bots from accessing their content. Spokespeople for The Guardian, Forbes, and The New York Times also say they detected the IP address repeatedly visiting their servers.</p><p class="paywall">WIRED traced the IP address to a virtual machine known as an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance hosted on AWS, which launched its investigation after we asked whether using AWS infrastructure to scrape websites that forbade it violated the company’s terms of service.</p><p data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-1 viewport-monitor-anchor" data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"InlineRecirc"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"InlineRecirc"}' data-include-experiments="true"></p><p class="paywall">Last week, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas responded to WIRED’s investigation first by saying the questions we posed to the company “reflect a deep and fundamental misunderstanding of how Perplexity and the Internet work.” Srinivas then <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91144894/perplexity-ai-ceo-aravind-srinivas-on-plagiarism-accusations">told Fast Company</a> that the secret IP address WIRED observed scraping Condé Nast websites and a test site we created was operated by a third-party company that performs web crawling and indexing services. He refused to name the company, citing a nondisclosure agreement. When asked if he would tell the third party to stop crawling WIRED, Srinivas replied, “It’s complicated.”</p></div></div>

This lets their dealership software, installed on their computers, access CDK's platform. Since the CDK software has permission to update itself (like admin privileges) automatically, it makes sense why CDK recommended disconnecting from their data centers during the security incident.</p><p>CDK reported restoring some services on June 20 and told CyberGuy that its systems were again offline due to another cyberattack.</p><p>"Late in the evening of June 19, we experienced an additional cyberincident and proactively shut down most of our systems. In partnership with third-party experts, we are assessing the impact and providing regular updates to our customers," said Lisa Finney, senior external communications manager at CDK Global.</p><p>"We remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible," Finney added.</p><p>CDK Global announced on June 24 that the breach was, in fact, a ransomware attack, meaning the company’s systems won’t be back online until it pays the hackers a ransom.

This incident underscores several key security considerations you should take into account:</p><h3><strong>1. Ransomware awareness and prevention</strong></h3><p>The revelation that the attack involved <a href="https://cyberguy.com/privacy/ransomware-reality-check-as-us-is-top-target-of-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ransomware</a> highlights the ongoing threat posed by this type of malware. It's a reminder that you need to be vigilant about the security of your personal devices. Here are some steps you can take:</p><p><strong>Regular backups:</strong> Ensure that you regularly back up important data to an <a href="https://cyberguy.com/kurts-picks/best-external-hard-drives/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>external hard drive</u></a> or a <a href="https://cyberguy.com/kurts-picks/space-running-low-securely-store-heavy-files-free-cloud-storage-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>secure cloud service</u></a>. This can help you recover your data without paying a ransom if your device is compromised.</p><p><strong>Update software:</strong> Keep your operating system, antivirus software and all applications <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/how-to-update-your-devices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>up to date</u></a> to protect against known vulnerabilities.</p><p><strong>Email caution:</strong> Be wary of <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/outsmart-spammers-to-finally-end-unsolicited-emails/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>unsolicited emails</u></a>, especially those with attachments or links. <a href="https://cyberguy.com/privacy/dont-fall-for-these-7-fake-phishing-emails/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Phishing emails</u></a> are a common method for delivering ransomware. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any phishing emails or ransomware scams. <a href="https://cyberguy.com/security/best-antivirus-protection/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices</u></a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE U.S. NEWS</strong></a></p><h3><strong>2. Strong authentication and access controls</strong></h3><p>While the CDK attack involved always-on VPN connections, the principle of strong authentication applies to you as well. Protect your accounts with:</p><p><strong>Two-factor authentication (2FA):</strong> Enable <a href="https://cyberguy.com/how-to/what-is-two-factor-authentication-and-why-should-i-enable-it/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>2FA</u></a> on all accounts that offer it. This adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password.</p><p><strong>Unique passwords:</strong> Use unique, complex passwords for different accounts. Consider using a <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/best-password-managers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>password manager</u></a> to keep track of them.</p><h3><strong>3. Incident response and personal data protection</strong></h3><p>The prolonged outage and its impact on dealership operations underscore the need for you to have your own incident response plan:</p><p><strong>Know your recovery steps:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the steps to take if your device is compromised, such as disconnecting from the internet, <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/how-to-install-antivirus-software-onto-your-devices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>running antivirus scans</u></a> and <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/how-to-back-up-and-restore-your-mobile-device/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>restoring from backups</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Protect personal information:</strong> Be cautious about sharing personal information online. Use privacy settings on social media and be mindful of the data you share with various services.</p><h3><strong>4. Regular security audits</strong></h3><p>Just as businesses need to assess their security regularly, you should also:</p><p><strong>Review account activity:</strong> Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorized transactions.</p><p><strong>Security settings:</strong> Periodically review and update the security settings on your devices and online accounts.</p><p>By taking these proactive steps, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to cyberattacks. The CDK Global incident serves as a powerful reminder that cybersecurity is not just a concern for businesses but for you and everyone in our increasingly digital world.</p><h2><strong>Kurt’s key takeaways</strong></h2><p>When a company of CDK’s scale is affected by a ransomware attack, it disrupts the whole market, which is something we are witnessing right now.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, wants schools to prepare students better for the workforce</strong>: Dimon believes that schools should focus on giving students the skills and training they need to succeed in the workforce, rather than leaving it to businesses to bridge the gap.</li>
<li><strong>Dimon advocates for measured outcomes in education</strong>: He thinks that schools should be held accountable for whether their students are successful in launching careers after graduation, rather than only focusing on college admissions.</li>
<li><strong>Dimon argues that the current system is challenging for companies</strong>: With the increasing demand for skilled workers, Dimon believes that businesses are being burdened with the task of training and hiring new employees, which is making it harder for companies to thrive.</li>
<li><strong>Dimon proposes certificates and training programs</strong>: He believes that many workers need formal certifications and training programs to compete for good jobs, and that schools should be providing these opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Dimon pushes back on the notion that his efforts are solely about diversity, equity, and inclusion</strong>: While he acknowledges the importance of including underrepresented communities in the workforce, Dimon argues that his efforts are primarily focused on getting more workers into well-paying jobs and preparing them for the workforce.</li>

    <p>Here are five key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The writer, Amil Niazi, is reflecting on the challenges of summer child care for school-age kids. She jokes that death, taxes, and the yearly scramble for summer child care are the only guarantees in a parent's life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Niazi recalls her experience of trying to find day camps for her son during his first summer off from school. She thought she could simply log on to the city's YMCA portal at the last minute, but learned that spots fill up quickly and are often reserved by parents who start planning in January or February.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The writer notes that finding suitable summer care for kids can be a stressful and time-consuming process. Many parents have to wake up early to snag the best spots at camps or programs, and are often left praying for a decent option for their child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Niazi acknowledges that she doesn't enjoy the arrangement either. She prefers an unstructured, slow summer with her kids, but often has to settle for a patchwork of care arrangements that can be chaotic and stressful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The article is part of a series of "the hard part" meditations by Niazi, which explore the highs and lows of parenting and everyday challenges that parents face.</p>

And here it is, almost July again and I’m thinking, <em>Shit, is school already over? Where are the kids gonna go?</em> Just like I did this time last year. Just like I’ll probably do a year from now. If you have <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2023/06/leave-that-screaming-kid-alone.html">school-age kids</a> then you already know that the patchwork of care that you managed to assemble at the start of the year — the before- and after-school stuff you essentially duct taped together in September — completely falls apart as soon as <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/brooding-summer-travel-with-another-family.html">summer break</a> rolls around.</p>

  <p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxw9x1p500163b81x5k3rbo6@published" data-word-count="99">I remember the first summer that my son had off from school. I logged on to the city’s YMCA portal on the last day of kindergarten thinking I could get some day-camp spots for him for the weeks after. Ha! What a fool I was then. After asking around, I learned that, actually, you have to sign up for those in January or February, waking up at 5 a.m. to snag even the most basic of spots while praying you might get a week here or there at something slightly more desirable, a camp your kid might even enjoy.</p>

  <p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxw9x1uc00173b81qt9xhuzk@published" data-word-count="113">Not that I enjoy this arrangement either. There’s nothing I love more than an unstructured, slow summer, one where the biggest plan of the day is a <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/07/let-your-kids-eat-treats-on-vacation.html">long-anticipated ice cream</a> or a dip in a cold lake. If it were entirely up to me, we’d all be spending our days drifting from the pool to the playground and back. But with two young kids and a baby, that lack of structure feels like a trap once the heat hits, because the kids want to be moving and playing and doing while I, unfortunately, have to be working. Nothing makes it more glaringly obvious that capitalism is at odds with kids like summer vacation.</p>

  <p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxw9x1yk00183b81wmsxp7tg@published" data-word-count="189">That first summer with no care I was mostly freelancing and my daughter was in full-time day care, so I was able to spend most of my days hauling my son from the splash pad to the wading pool to whatever free activity we could find. We made pinch pots at the contemporary art gallery and bookmarks at the library. I squeezed in work where I could and it was grueling trying to manage all those deadlines, but for the most part we made it through. The next summer I got on it early and registered my son for a slew of the most “affordable” day camps (which still ate up a significant chunk of my earnings) and cobbled together some before-and-after care, too, because I had to be in an office for most of those days. My son hated the camps so every morning he screamed and held on to my leg before I would drive away gutted, reminding myself that I was paying for him to be miserable every day. And that was a <em>good</em> summer because I’d managed to find spots for every week I needed.</p>

  <p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxw9x20i00193b816pnsvn9z@published" data-word-count="76">When I broached the chaos of summer care on X, the response from parents included words like “mental breakdown,” “overwhelmed crying,” “state of panic,” and “brutal.” Parents said they were already dreading the perpetual scrambling, and one even said more than the stress of her job or housing or her elderly cat, the No. 1 thing causing her to break down was that child care, particularly in the summer, was impossible to find in her city.</p>

  <p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxw9x22k001a3b81yqlhyxer@published" data-word-count="125">All of this is made worse by the fact that there are less and less free places for families to hang out, so even cobbling together something outside the camp chaos feels increasingly impossible. One mom, Olivia, told me she brings her laptop to the community pool so she can work while her kids swim. Another offered that she designed and edited an entire magazine while her kids rode horses at a nearby stable, having to get creative when a colleague heard a horse neighing in the background of a call. Other parents told me about dragging their kids around to work and errands in a pinch over the summer or employing a bored teen to supervise their kids, neither feeling like a great choice.</p>

  <p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxw9x26u001b3b81aaijirua@published" data-word-count="77">My husband’s job has a generous parental-leave plan, and when we were trying to figure out the best time for him to take time off to help with our baby who was born in February, we agreed that it would make most sense to do it over the summer because with our daughter heading to kindergarten in the fall, it would be easier and cheaper to focus on spreading out care between us for the older kids.</p>

  <p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxw9x28j001c3b81i5pe9dsg@published" data-word-count="73">As much as it would be great to have one parent taking off every summer to hang with the kids, this is obviously not a permanent solution to an ongoing issue. I’ve often thought about starting a workweek co-op with other parents where we could take turns watching each other’s kids while another took a meeting or plowed through some emails. Come July, we could do it from a park or a pool.</p>

  <p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxw9x2c1001d3b81rwwr2987@published" data-word-count="111">It’s obvious we need a summer-care revolution, to nationalize the camps or, I don’t know, offer a form of summer leave from work? Because clearly whatever we’re doing now just doesn’t work. And is anyone even productive at the office in July and August? We’re fooling ourselves about the amount of work that’s really getting done between camp drop-off and pick-up and some radical transparency would greatly benefit everyone. We all need a break to recharge and prepare ourselves for the chaos that the start of a new school year brings. But in the meantime, if anyone’s looking for me, I’ll be taking my Zoom calls by the inflatable pool until September.</p>

<li><strong>Uber and Lyft agree to settle lawsuit</strong>: The two companies have agreed to adopt a $32.50 hourly minimum pay standard for Massachusetts drivers and pay $175 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the state's attorney general.</li>
<li><strong>New benefits for drivers</strong>: As part of the settlement, drivers will also receive paid sick leave, accident insurance, and healthcare stipends. Additionally, the companies will stop funding a ballot initiative that would have cemented app-based drivers' status as contractors.</li>
<li><strong>Uber and Lyft justify arrangement</strong>: The companies claimed that the agreement reflects the desire of most drivers to work on their own terms while receiving benefits similar to those guaranteed to employees.</li>
<li><strong>New operating model</strong>: Uber's chief legal officer, Tony West, stated that the agreement represents a new operating model that balances flexibility and benefits, which allows the company to "resolve historical liabilities."</li>
<li><strong>Massachusetts drivers benefit</strong>: The settlement specifically benefits drivers in Massachusetts, but it may also set a precedent for similar settlements and policies in other states where Uber and Lyft operate.</li>

            Uber Technologies and Lyft on Thursday agreed to adopt a $32.50 hourly minimum pay standard for Massachusetts drivers and pay $175 million to settle a lawsuit by the state’s attorney general alleging they improperly treated drivers as independent contractors who can legally receive lower compensation than employees.

            The companies also agreed to give drivers paid sick leave, accident insurance, and healthcare stipends and to stop funding or supporting a ballot initiative that would have asked voters in November to cement app-based drivers’ status as contractors, Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell said.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Despite Republican politicians who don't believe in climate change, many US states with booming renewable power (wind and solar) are governed by Republicans, including Wyoming, Iowa, and Texas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until about 2020, there was broad support for expanding renewable power among both Republicans and Democrats, with support above 75% among both parties. However, since then, support among Republicans has dropped to around 50%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Republican Party's current leadership has made claims that wind turbines cause cancer and offshore wind is killing whales, which has contributed to a decline in support for renewable power among Republicans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022, has driven significant investments in renewable power, particularly in red states, which has also contributed to the decline in support for renewable power among Republicans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decline in support for renewable power among Republicans is particularly noticeable among older age groups, with those under 30 favoring renewable power by a 2-to-1 margin, while those in the 65-and-over age group favor fossil fuels by a 3-to-1 margin.</p>

<p>One of the most striking things about the explosion of renewable power that's happening in the US is that much of it is going on in states governed by politicians who don't believe in the problem wind and solar are meant to address. Acceptance of the evidence for climate change tends to be lowest among Republicans, yet many of the states where renewable power has boomed—wind in Wyoming and Iowa, solar in Texas—are governed by Republicans.</p>
<p>That's partly because, up until about 2020, there was a strong bipartisan consensus in favor of expanding wind and solar power, with support above 75 percent among both parties. Since then, however, support among Republicans has dropped dramatically, approaching 50 percent, according to polling data released this week.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<figure class="image shortcode-img center full"><img alt="Renewables enjoyed solid Republican support until recently." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-3.png"><figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption-text">Renewables enjoyed solid Republican support until recently.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>To a certain extent, none of this should be surprising. The current leader of the Republican Party has been saying that wind turbines <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2019/04/trumps-faulty-wind-power-claims/">cause cancer</a> and offshore wind is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66928305">killing whales</a>. And conservative-backed groups have been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/18/1154867064/solar-power-misinformation-activists-rural-america">spreading misinformation</a> in order to drum up opposition to solar power facilities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, since 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act has been promoted as one of the Biden administration's signature accomplishments and has driven significant investments in renewable power, much of it in red states. Negative partisanship is undoubtedly contributing to this drop in support.</p>
<p>One striking thing about the new polling data, gathered by the Pew Research Center, is how dramatically it skews with age. When given a choice between expanding fossil fuel production or expanding renewable power, Republicans under the age of 30 favored renewables by a 2-to-1 margin. Republicans over 30, in contrast, favored fossil fuels by margins that increased with age, topping out at a three-to-one margin in favor of fossil fuels among those in the 65-and-over age group. The decline in support occurred in those over 50 starting in 2020; support held steady among younger groups until 2024, when the 30–49 age group started moving in favor of fossil fuels.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure class="image shortcode-img full full-width"><img alt="Among younger Republicans, support for renewable energy remains high." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-4.png"><figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption-text">Among younger Republicans, support for renewable energy remains high.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Democrats, by contrast, break in favor of renewables by 75 points, with little difference across age groups and no indication of significant change over time. They're also twice as likely to think a solar farm will help the local economy than Republicans are.</p>
<p>Similar differences were apparent when Pew asked about policies meant to encourage the sale of electric vehicles, with 83 percent of Republicans opposed to having half of cars sold be electric in 2032. By contrast, nearly two-thirds of Democrats favored this policy.</p>
<p>There's also a rural/urban divide apparent (consistent with Republicans getting more support from rural voters). Forty percent of urban residents felt that a solar farm would improve the local economy; only 25 percent of rural residents agreed. Rural residents were also more likely to say solar farms made the landscape unattractive and take up too much space. (Suburban participants were consistently in between rural and urban participants.)</p>
<p>What's behind these changes? The single biggest factor appears to be negative partisanship combined with the election of Joe Biden.</p>
<figure class="image shortcode-img center full"><img alt="For Republicans, 2020 represented an inflection point in terms of support for different types of energy. That wasn't true for Democrats." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-5.png"><figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption-text">For Republicans, 2020 represented an inflection point in terms of support for different types of energy. That wasn't true for Democrats.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Among Republicans, support for every single form of power started to change in 2020—fossil fuels, renewables, and nuclear. Among Democrats, that's largely untrue. Their high level of support for renewable power and aversion to fossil fuels remained largely unchanged. The lone exception is nuclear power, where support rose among both Democrats and Republicans (the Biden administration has adopted a number of pro-nuclear policies).</p>
<p>This isn't to say that non-political factors are playing no role. The rapid expansion of renewable power means that many more people are seeing facilities open near them, and viewing that as an indication of a changing society. Some degree of backlash was almost inevitable and, in this case, the close ties between conservative lobbyists and fossil fuel interests were ready to take advantage of it.</p>
