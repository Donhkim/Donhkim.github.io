The achievement caps Nvidia’s rise from a respected maker of video game hardware to the purveyor of one of tech’s hottest commodities: specialized AI chips. The pivot has seen Nvidia dramatically transform its fortunes in a matter of years, growing from a <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/" aria-label="market capitalization">market capitalization </a>of around $16 billion in 2016 to just under $800 billion towards the end of 2021 before dropping to around $300 billion in 2022 amid <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-is-down-57-should-you-buy-right-now" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-is-down-57-should-you-buy-right-now" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-is-down-57-should-you-buy-right-now" aria-label="poor demand">poor demand</a> for gaming chips and a wider rout on U.S. stock markets. The boom in generative artificial intelligence, kickstarted by the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022, has helped propel Nvidia to new heights as demand for its specialized AI chips soared. Since then, the company’s value has multiplied from around $400 billion in late 2022 to $1 trillion by mid 2023, $2 trillion by early 2024 and $3 trillion by the middle of 2024 on a near vertical climb. Nvidia shares are up more than 170% this year alone and its stratospheric growth shows little sign of stopping as tech firms duel it out to dominate the nascent market for AI.</p>

<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Forbes Valuation</h2>
<p>The AI boom has not only catapulted Nvidia into a rare position of wealth and power.

<li><strong>Retail sales data shows a slowdown</strong>: Retail sales in May showed a cooling down of consumer spending, easing concerns about an economy running too hot and contributing to high inflation.</li>

<li><strong>Inflation data is more promising</strong>: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased at its slowest pace since July 2022, and economists believe the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, also increased at its slowest pace of the year in May.</li>
<li><strong>Interest rate cut prediction</strong>: Economist Neil Dutta from Renaissance Macro believes the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates soon to protect its maximum employment mandate, as the momentum behind core inflation is likely to continue softening.</li>

It's not like the risk at this point is for the unemployment rate to unexpectedly go down. The most likely distribution of outcomes is that it's stable or it goes higher."</p><p>To be clear, Dutta and other economists are more concerned about how the economic data could spiral from here rather than where it sits today. Many aren't overly concerned about the current trends quite yet.</p><p>Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti told Yahoo Finance the "risks" in the labor market are there. But at this point, it looks more like the spending power of the US consumer is slowing toward a normal pace, not trending toward a drop-off.</p><p>"While there are some strains, particularly for parts of the households, I would be surprised if you saw a slowing in the labor market and a slowing in the consumer that was enough to get them to cut by September," Luzzetti said.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell takes questions during a news conference at the Federal Reserve in Washington, Wednesday, June 12, 2024.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>WestJet, a Canadian airline, has begun canceling flights in anticipation of a potential strike by aircraft maintenance technicians. The airline expects to cancel about 40 flights from Tuesday to Wednesday, affecting 6,500 passengers.</li>
<li>The cancellations are intended to avoid having passengers and planes stranded if a strike occurs. The airline is trying to find alternate arrangements for customers whose flights are dropped.</li>
<li>The airline and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association are in negotiations for an initial collective-bargaining agreement covering about 680 mechanics. However, negotiations have stalled, and the union has notified the airline of its intention to strike as soon as Thursday night unless the company returns to the bargaining table this week in Calgary.</li>
<li>The union is seeking higher pay for maintenance engineers, who are currently paid lower than their counterparts at other Canadian airlines. The airline has offered a contract that would raise pay 30% to 40% within a year, but the union has rejected it by a 97.5% vote.</li>
<li>WestJet is Canada's second-largest airline, founded in the 1990s and modeled after Southwest Airlines in the US.</li>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>January 1</strong> — Fisker remained far from meeting its publicly stated goal of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/04/ev-startup-fisker-sales-goals-dealerships/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/04/ev-startup-fisker-sales-goals-dealerships/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="3" mrfobservableid="1851280e-aa4f-499e-bcc0-685702ae62fe">delivering 300 electric SUVs per day globally</a>. The EV startup spent much of December aiming to meet an internal sales goal of between 100 and 200 vehicles a day in North America, where the bulk of its inventory and sales efforts are. Fisker fell well below that target, often selling just one to two dozen of its Ocean SUVs a day here.</p>

The company told TechCrunch it believes these problems are rare, and that it has resolved “almost all the issues” with software updates. Customers have also reported sudden loss of braking power, problematic key fobs causing them to get locked inside or outside of the vehicle, seat sensors that don’t detect the driver’s presence and the SUV’s front hood suddenly flying up at high speeds.</p>

Fisker also said that its accounts payable balance is up to $182 million and that there is “substantial doubt” that it can continue operations without raising new capital.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apple Pay Later was withdrawn</strong>: Apple Pay Later, a "Buy Now, Pay Later" (BNPL) service, was withdrawn from the US market, and it is believed that the decision was driven by a desire to avoid upcoming legislation related to credit cards.</li>
<li><strong>Trivia In Lending Act (TiLA) applies</strong>: The Truth in Lending Act, passed in 1968, regulates the credit card industry, sets out obligations for card companies, and specifies consumer rights for purchases made with credit cards.</li>
<li><strong>BNPL loans fall under TiLA scope</strong>: The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is considering that BNPL loans, like Apple Pay Later, fall within the scope of the TiLA, which means they would need to comply with the act's regulations.</li>
<li><strong>CFPB proposed interpretive rule</strong>: The CFPB proposed an interpretive rule to clarify how digital user accounts, like BNPL loans, meet the criteria for being "card issuers" for purposes of Regulation Z.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory scrutiny</strong>: The withdrawal of Apple Pay Later may be a result of the regulatory scrutiny of BNPL loans, as lawmakers and regulators are increasingly focusing on the consumer protections and risks associated with these types of loans.</li>

<p>We speculated at the time that the decision to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/17/apple-pay-later-united-states-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">withdraw Apple Pay Later</a> was probably driven by a desire to get ahead of upcoming legislation, and a piece today suggests that it’s actually a new interpretation of a very old law.</p>



<p>The Truth in Lending Act was passed in 1968, and grants consumers a number of protections when it comes to credit cards – and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/apple-pay-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple Pay Later</a> seemed set to fall within scope …</p>



<span id="more-954790"></span>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apple-pay-later-would-be-subject-to-tila">Apple Pay Later would be subject to TiLA</h2>



<p>The Truth in Lending Act (TiLA) is a federal law passed in 1968 which regulates the credit card industry. It sets out a range of obligations card companies have to meet, and sets out consumer rights which apply to purchase made with a credit card.</p>



<p>None of it applied to Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) loans like Apple Pay Later – but that’s changing. </p>



<p>The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) launched an investigation into these loans back in 2021, and <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_bnpl-interpretive-rule_2024-05.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last month proposed</a> that they fall within the scope of the TiLA.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>[The Bureau] is issuing this interpretive rule to address the applicability of subpart B of Regulation Z to lenders that issue digital user accounts used to access credit, including to those lenders that market loans as “Buy Now, Pay Later” (BNPL). This interpretive rule describes how these lenders meet the criteria for being “card issuers” for purposes of Regulation Z. Such lenders that extend credit are also “creditors” subject to subpart B of Regulation Z, including those provisions governing periodic statements and billing disputes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Essentially, this means that BNPL lenders have to be much more careful about their lending decisions, as <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/apple-abruptly-abandons-buy-now-pay-later-service-amid-regulatory-scrutiny/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arstechnica</a></em> reports.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“When consumers check out and choose Buy Now, Pay Later, they don’t know if they will get a refund if they return their product or whether the lender will help them if they didn’t get what was promised,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “Regardless of whether a shopper swipes a credit card or uses Buy Now, Pay Later, they are entitled to important consumer protections under longstanding laws and regulations already on the books.”</p>



<p>By getting out of the BNPL game, Apple can avoid requirements that the CFPB plans to impose on BNPL lenders, including potential obligations to investigate customer disputes, pause payments, provide refunds, and issue credits when necessary.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> would have engaged in any sketchy behavior, but the decision – if finalized – would have created a lot of potential paperwork for the company. Given the relatively small boost in sales that would have been achieved by such short-term loans, it’s likely Apple decided it simply didn’t want the headaches.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG) has declared effective additional shares registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</strong>, allowing early investors to exercise warrants and potentially raising up to $247 million in proceeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The registration statement marks a "milestone" for Truth Social, the social media platform owned by TMTG</strong>, with CEO Devin Nunes stating that the company will focus on TV streaming, platform enhancements, and potential mergers and acquisitions.</p>

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><p>The pessimism that has gripped the global oil market for weeks as traders suspect weakening demand growth this week began to dissipate, replaced by signs of emerging optimism. All because OPEC repeated what it had said at its June 2 meeting.</p><p>At that meeting, the cartel’s leaders announced they may consider rolling back some of the production cuts they agreed upon last year, possibly later in 2024, if market conditions are favorable. What traders heard, however, was that they would for sure roll back those cuts. Prices slumped. OPEC had to say what it had said again, more emphatically.
</p>

<p></p><p>“Those funds who thought we were heading into a production battle, had their concerns quickly assuaged when OPEC+ members went on a PR campaign to assure the world their changes to production would be market dependent,” StoneX oil analyst Alex Hodes <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-prices-inch-down-weaker-us-consumer-demand-ahead-china-data-2024-06-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Reuters on Monday.</p><p>The emerging sentiment also got a boost from expectations for strong fuel demand this driving season in the United States. The reversal in prices, as they snapped a three-week losing streak, comes despite sub-expectation industrial activity data from China. The country reported factory output growth of 5.6% which would normally be a solid enough figure. However, analysts had expected growth of 6%, so the actual reading was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/chinas-may-industrial-output-misses-forecasts-retail-sales-bright-spot-2024-06-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dubbed</a> disappointing by Reuters. <span><strong class="related"> <a href="/Metals/Commodities/Brazil-Looks-To-Challenge-Chinas-Dominance-in-Rare-Earth-Minerals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Related: Brazil Looks To Challenge China’s Dominance in Rare Earth Minerals</a></strong></span></p><div>
    <div class="ad-holder video_ad_holder"><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><div><div id="FreeStarVideoAdContainer_Home_page_incontent-to-float_mobile"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"><div><div id="primisPlayerContainerDiv" class="primisslate"><div id="primis_container_div"><div id="primis_playerSekindoSPlayer6673414d7f6db"><div id="Player-Div-SekindoSPlayer6673414d7f6db"><div id="Video-Div-SekindoSPlayer6673414d7f6db"><div id="Video-iFrame-SekindoSPlayer6673414d7f6db"><div id="layoutContainerDiv"><div id="layoutDesign"><p id="adCover"></p><div id="topLeftElements"><div id="titleObj"><p id="titleTxt">U.S. Could Accelerate Refill Rate of Strategic Petroleum Reserve</p></div></div><p id="primisVastIconsContainer"></p></div><p id="dcAdCover"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
</div><p>Yet even this could not dampen oil trader optimism once it sank in that OPEC was not going to return any supply to market unless the price was right. Reuters’ John Kemp <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/oil-funds-temper-bearishness-after-opec-reassurance-kemp-2024-06-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in his latest column that speculators had bought back some of the oil futures they’d sold immediately after the last OPEC+ meeting, with the total purchases at the equivalent of 80 million barrels over the week to June 11.</p><p>Still, Kemp wrote that overall bearishness remained the dominant sentiment among oil speculators because of the spare capacity that OPEC+ has and because of rising production from places like the United States, Guyana, and Brazil. Interestingly, energy consultancy Rystad Energy recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/oil-supply-growth-set-taper-2024-rystad-energy-says-2024-06-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted</a> that global oil supply growth will be virtually non-existent this year because of the OPEC+ cuts without mentioning spare capacity.</p><p>The firm pointed to the OPEC+ cuts and their recent extension into next year and noted that “US shale remains a trustworthy source of growth, though less elastic to price changes and more consolidated after continued rounds of mergers and acquisitions. This reduces the short-term upside potential for a surprise in US growth.”</p><p>Indeed, the Energy Information Administration recently <a href="/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/EIA-US-Crude-Oil-Production-to-Average-132-million-bpd-in-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecast</a> this year’s average oil production rate in the U.S. at 13.2 million barrels daily, which would be a modest 2% increase on the year. Next year, the EIA sees output rising by another half a million barrels daily to 13.7 million barrels daily.
</p>


<p></p><p>With the consolidation underway in U.S. shale and with the uncertainty around what direction oil prices will go into on any day, let alone over a longer horizon, drillers are not exactly eager to drill. The claim that whatever happens anywhere else U.S. shale will step in to ensure sufficient supply no longer holds true in the age of capital discipline and investor returns above all else.</p><p>Meanwhile, volatility remains heightened. One weekly EIA report is all it would take to reverse the course of prices in case it suggests fuel demand is falling short of expectations. Some believe it would take even less because a lot of the recent buying that saw prices inch higher was in fact covering of short positions, according to Mizuho Securities’ <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/crude-oil-prices-today.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bob Yawger</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, a bullish EIA report on inventories would push prices further up—and create a problem for the Biden administration, which is already considering more emergency releases from the SPR to keep gas prices lower in the months ahead of the November elections.</p><p></p><p>By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com</p><p><strong>More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:</strong></p>

<li><strong>Nvidia has become the biggest business in the world</strong>, thanks to the growth of AI technology. However, AI is still relatively useless in most circumstances.</li>
<li><strong>McDonald's has abandoned its AI experiment</strong> in its drive-thru restaurants, which was launched in 2022. The technology was intended to improve customer service and efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>The AI technology was used in around 100 McDonald's stores</strong>, but it ultimately proved to be ineffective. The company cited low demand for AI-driven bacon ice cream as a major factor in its decision to abandon the technology.</li>
<li><strong>The AI technology was intended to be a futuristic solution</strong> to improve customer service and efficiency in McDonald's restaurants. However, it failed to deliver on its promises.</li>
<li><strong>The failure of McDonald's AI experiment highlights the challenges</strong> of implementing AI technology in real-world settings. Despite the hype surrounding AI, its practical applications are still limited in many cases.</li>

wires fell on the tracks a few miles from New York Penn Station, halting trains along the nation's busiest stretch of rail at the worst possible time — 5:05 p.m.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Chatham resident, who commutes daily on the Morris &amp; Essex line to her Manhattan job, waited an hour at New York Penn Station on May 22 before finding out all trains were canceled. She and hordes of others made their way to the nearest PATH station, where every train car was 10 to 20 people deep. So she had to wait for the next train.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Amid pushing and shoving, she eventually boarded another packed train out of Hoboken — after almost getting smacked in the face by another rider's backpack — only to have it stop at the next station because of a medical emergency.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">She was at the three-hour mark by then.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong><em>Story continues below photo gallery</em></strong></p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/new-york/2024/05/21/gateway-hudson-tunnel-photos/73788136007/" data-t-l=":l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project on track for 2038 completion" data-g-r="nav_mo" data-g-tn="pgcss" data-g-mtn="pg73788136007" data-g-moh="hpgm" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" data-c-id="73788136007"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/21/PNJM/73788138007-050924-gateway-tunnell-002.JPG?crop=4971,2797,x0,y258&amp;width=660&amp;height=372&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/21/PNJM/73788138007-050924-gateway-tunnell-002.JPG?crop=4971,2797,x0,y258&amp;width=1320&amp;height=744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt=""><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="25"><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg__ca"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"></use></svg><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_expand"></use></svg></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project on track for 2038 completion" aria-label="Scenes from the Manhattan side of the Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project, Thursday, May 9, 2024."></p></a><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Her 10-mile journey home ultimately took four hours.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Over the course of just three days, NJ Transit and Amtrak commuters endured a litany of hours-long, haphazard commutes because of equipment failures along three bridges or tunnels whose average age is 105 and overhead wires, or catenary, that predates the 1950s. Journeying on aging, deteriorated and long-neglected infrastructure to get to and from New York Penn Station has — yet again — become a predictably unpredictable odyssey. And the end isn’t near.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Michelle's commute the morning before took three hours as trains were delayed and canceled because NJ Transit’s pantograph, the equipment atop the train that distributes power, became ensnared with the overhead wire.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That week’s commuting problems didn’t end there.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">May 23, the day after the downed wires, was little better as customers dealt with residual delays and cancellations because train equipment was not where it needed to be. Crews were also short because they worked too many hours the day before and couldn’t work the next day. Before noon, there were new wire versus pantograph issues and signal problems cropped up at the 89-year-old Dock Bridge outside Newark Penn Station, causing new layers of delays and travel chaos.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And the night cap? During the evening rush hour, the 114-year-old Portal Bridge, which carries trains over the Hackensack River, had to open for marine traffic, causing more delays.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Déjà vu from ‘Summer of Hell’ circa 2017?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">NJ Transit and Amtrak customers are trapped in this commuting purgatory for at least another 10 years as the decades-old assets on the notorious 10-mile stretch of rail between Newark Penn Station and New York Penn Station slowly get replaced, repaired and reinforced.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">As the northeast endures an extreme heat wave this week, wire versus pantograph issues have already cropped up, forcing New York Penn Station to close during the morning rush Tuesday. Delays and commuting headaches were felt up and down the corridor all day, with an Amtrak train breaking down in Penn during the evening rush hour.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Michelle, a veteran commuter who has endured the far-reaching effects of the erratic Northeast Corridor for a decade, said the recent problems are reminiscent of 2017, when delays and cancellations snowballed in the first few months of the year. (She didn't provide her last name because of her employer's corporate media policy.)</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong><em>Story continues below video</em></strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">By the end of April that year, there were two minor derailments in New York Penn Station and Amtrak officials decided to accelerate more than three years of planned work into eight weeks, a period known as the “Summer of Hell” because it required cancellations and train diversions to other stations.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The problems unfolding today are not a direct comparison to 2017. Today’s issues are largely related to signals, wires and NJ Transit’s pantographs, while the major problems that led to the emergency work in 2017 were derailments due to track problems in New York Penn Station.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In the first four months of 2017, NJ Transit canceled 708 trains because of Amtrak-related issues, according to the agency — NJ Transit shares the use of Amtrak-owned rail routes on the busiest stretch of track in the state between Philadelphia and New York. In the first four months of this year, NJ Transit says 329 of its trains were canceled because of Amtrak.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The May 22 incident alone impacted 155 NJ Transit and 29 Amtrak trains over two days.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Michelle remembers 2017 being a long, painful summer as the repairs were completed, but said she would endure another weeks-long period of repairs — if it meant getting improved service faster.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/-mm-/ec24e72fa705b4d2b09163c69be434c3cc037b01/c=0-0-2400-1356/local/-/media/2017/07/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636353093280579110-commute001.JPG?width=660&amp;height=373&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/-mm-/ec24e72fa705b4d2b09163c69be434c3cc037b01/c=0-0-2400-1356/local/-/media/2017/07/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636353093280579110-commute001.JPG?width=1320&amp;height=746&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Commuters arrive at the 33rd St. Path in Manhattan from Hoboken during the height of Monday morning's commute.

Stick to the deadline. Keep the delays in the realm of reasonable. Let us plan accordingly.”</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Preventing an Amtrak versus NJ Transit war</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Amtrak and NJ Transit officials met earlier this month to discuss short- and long-term plans to prevent another May 22 problem from happening, but both agencies said a “Summer of Hell”-style work plan doesn’t make sense right now.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Kevin Corbett, president and CEO of NJ Transit, said they’re trying to take a “surgical approach versus a generic approach,” but admitted the agency is open to that as a last resort.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/28/PNJM/73880606007-052824-fta-presser-005.JPG?width=660&amp;height=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/28/PNJM/73880606007-052824-fta-presser-005.JPG?width=1320&amp;height=880&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Kevin Corbett, president and CEO of NJ Transit, said they’re trying to take a “surgical approach versus a generic approach,” but admitted the agency is open to that as a last resort."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Kevin Corbett, president and CEO of NJ Transit, said they’re trying to take a “surgical approach versus a generic approach,” but admitted the agency is open to that as a last resort." data-c-credit="Anne-Marie Caruso-NorthJersey.com"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“I don’t think we’re looking at a wholesale thing at this point,” Corbett said. “But we need to look at weekends, canceling some trains, early trains or late trains" to give Amtrak a wider window "if they show the benefit of doing that and how much they can accelerate.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Gery Williams, Amtrak’s executive vice president of service delivery and operations, said, “We’ve got a strong partnership, the teams have worked together after these incidents" since May 22 figuring out what has to be done "to prevent any further reoccurrences.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The four-decade-old landlord-tenant relationship between Amtrak and NJ Transit can be tense. Meetings like the one earlier this month were frank, but productive, according to Corbett. Both sides tried to communicate to the other their biggest challenges and problems on the Northeast Corridor, including the May 22 incident — the cause of which Amtrak says it could not determine — and what solutions can be accommodated by both agencies.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/11/PNJM/73286529007-041124-clifton-njt-tz-17613.JPG?width=660&amp;height=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/11/PNJM/73286529007-041124-clifton-njt-tz-17613.JPG?width=1320&amp;height=880&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="The four-decade-old landlord-tenant relationship between Amtrak and NJ Transit can be tense."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="The four-decade-old landlord-tenant relationship between Amtrak and NJ Transit can be tense." data-c-credit="Tariq Zehawi/NorthJersey.com"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">They aim to avoid a repeat of 2017.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The relationship between Amtrak and NJ Transit soured when then-New Jersey Gov.

Phil Murphy sent a sternly worded letter to Amtrak’s board Chair Anthony Coscia the day after the overhead wire problems to put those feelings on the public record.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“I refuse to accept these Amtrak infrastructure challenges as an inevitable part of operating integrated mass transit systems,” Murphy wrote. “Amtrak needs to make immediate short-term and long-term investments to address infrastructure vulnerabilities and updated emergency management plans to provide more robust alternative modes of transportation when equipment failure occurs.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Amtrak has increased investments on repairs on the Northeast Corridor between Trenton and New York Penn Station. This year, Amtrak will spend 71% more on railroad track, catenary, bridges, signals, and other infrastructure on that stretch of track when compared to 2021.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Stephen Gardner, Amtrak’s CEO, responded to Murphy’s letter apologizing for the incidents that unfolded the week of May 20, though he noted they believe two of the five were Amtrak’s fault, while three were attributed to NJ Transit’s pantographs.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/14/PNJM/74104328007-amtrak-ridealong-081715-nwk-amtk-09.jpg?width=660&amp;height=426&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/14/PNJM/74104328007-amtrak-ridealong-081715-nwk-amtk-09.jpg?width=1320&amp;height=852&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Stephen Gardner, Amtrak’s CEO, at right, responded to Gov.

Wexler/NorthJersey.com"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">While the teams from both agencies are reviewing plans to accelerate catenary and signal system upgrades, Gardner said Amtrak needs firmer financial commitments from New Jersey to capitalize on hundreds of millions in federal grants for larger-scale projects to replace, modernize or support the aging infrastructure, including the <a href="/story/news/transportation/2023/11/06/nj-gets-675m-from-feds-for-rail-improvements-to-cut-delays/71475576007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Sawtooth and Dock bridges</a>, a new Kearny substation and catenary upgrades.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Drilling down to root causes</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Among the ideas that came out of the meeting between Amtrak and NJ Transit is a new working group. It will be headed by Amtrak's Williams and Jim Sincaglia, NJ Transit’s senior vice president of rail, but Corbett said the most important thing is it will bring together the people underneath them, the ones who are “going to make a difference” to prevent and respond to the incidents that affect commuters.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This is in addition to weekly updates Amtrak provides NJ Transit on progress regarding routine upgrades and repairs, the result of another fiasco last July when <a href="/story/news/transportation/2023/07/20/amtrak-explains-why-400-nj-trains-were-canceled-or-delayed-in-july/70435525007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">three Amtrak wire incidents led to days of outages</a> and more than 400 trains cancelled or delayed.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“We’re going to be outlining, with NJT, how to increase the level of maintenance, but also more importantly the programmatic work or basically the production work where we would actually replace wire and things like that,” Williams said. “Unfortunately, to really get the ability and the productivity to do that, you've got to have time on the railroad at night.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This new group will help ensure more repair work can get done on the Northeast Corridor by bringing together the people who can work out four essential things: the most urgent problems in need of fixing; overnights or weekends when some trains may get canceled so more work can get done; ensuring there are enough people to complete the work; and identifying root causes of problems “and solve it without trying to nail anybody, but just to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Corbett said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Corbett hopes this group will be able to take project ideas to replace catenary or bury signal wires, which were expected to take place in at least five years, and accelerate them — or prioritize them over other projects — so they can reap benefits in the near-term.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Dock Bridge is not a major cause of delays," Corbett said as an example. "It’s much more important that they accelerate the catenary and signal projects than prioritizing a <a href="/story/news/transportation/2023/05/01/gateway-projects-nj-ny-need-money/70154830007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">project like Dock Bridge</a> — so that’s the kind of issues we’re working through.”</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/presto/2023/04/27/PNJM/564b340c-403c-4d16-928e-e0eafaa07a34-042723_Newark_rail_TZ_53857.JPG?width=660&amp;height=372&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/presto/2023/04/27/PNJM/564b340c-403c-4d16-928e-e0eafaa07a34-042723_Newark_rail_TZ_53857.JPG?width=1320&amp;height=744&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Dock Bridge next to Newark Penn Station over the Passaic River in Newark, NJ on Thursday April 27, 2023."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Dock Bridge next to Newark Penn Station over the Passaic River in Newark, NJ on Thursday April 27, 2023. " data-c-credit="Tariq Zehawi/NorthJersey.com"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Having the manpower to take full advantage of planned outages has been a challenge for Amtrak. Though they’ve made strides in hiring, extensive training must take place before certain skilled workers can be on a high-voltage railroad job site, so those who are qualified end up on large-scale projects rather than routine outages for repairs.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">NJ Transit is developing a pilot program to lend Amtrak some of their workforce to assist with some repairs during outages.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">If Amtrak and NJ Transit can come to agreements on outages, manpower and prioritizing new projects, the final hurdle will be paying for it, which will lead to a different debate: money<strong>.</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Should NJ Transit’s annual payments to Amtrak be used for what it considers to be state-of-good-repair work, like upgrading catenary and signals? Or, as Amtrak’s Gardner and Williams have said, will more money be needed from New Jersey because some of NJ Transit’s annual state-of-good-repair money is going to <a href="/story/news/transportation/2024/05/13/portal-bridge-project-50-finished-date-on-budget/73677227007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">construction payments on Portal North Bridge</a>?</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Improving trickle-up communication</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">One critical area everyone agrees needs work is to improve communications to customers when unexpected outages occur.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">For Amtrak, it’s getting information from the ground-level once a problem is identified and into the devices of customers on stalled trains or waiting on platforms.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Until we get people at these locations and can verify what occurred and are actually starting to fix it, we don’t have a good feel for how long this is going to be,” Williams said. “We have to figure out how to communicate despite that and give our customers as much information as we can.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">NJ Transit is also often in the dark during incidents like what occurred on May 22. That delays agency officials from communicating to their customers about whether delayed trains get canceled, making plans for cross-honoring with PATH, preparing staff at Hoboken or Port Authority Bus Terminal for a deluge of customers, or setting up emergency bus service between stops.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Corbett said the working group will also try to develop a system so NJ Transit can send people out with Amtrak when an incident occurs so they can get information up the chain faster.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“We want to be in there with them at the incident so we can communicate out,” Corbett said. “We’re having further meetings about how to really drill that down so that it’s not just ad hoc response, but to be ahead of the curve, rather than us waiting and pressing them usually under a heated sense of urgency.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Without information, Michelle said, tempers rise as crowds swell in overcrowded New York Penn Station or when frustrated commuters are racing one another to board packed buses and PATH trains.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“If they don’t improve communication, I’m genuinely concerned for the welfare of the public-facing NJ Transit employees that have to deal with the worst complainers and don’t get home for hours right along with us — especially when the fare hikes go into effect, people are going to be fuming,” she said.</p></div></div>
