It reported results that fell shy of forecasts and cut its outlook. The company said it could close hundreds more stores in the next three years.</p>
    

<p>Jeans maker Levi Strauss sank 15.4% after its latest quarterly revenue results fell short of analysts’ expectations, along with its current earnings forecast for the year.</p><p>Spice maker McCormick rose 4.3% for one of the biggest gains in the market after beating analysts’ earnings forecasts.</p>



<p>Chipmaker Micron Technology fell 7.1% after its latest forecast left investors disappointed. </p><p>Treasury yields fell in the bond market.

<p>An update from the government said <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/economy-growth-inflation-gdp-consumers-federal-reserve-869a27c99459a1ad10d0db89718f725d">the American economy expanded</a></span> at a 1.4% annual pace from January through March. The figure is a slight revision from a prior estimate of 1.3%. It marks the slowest quarterly growth since spring 2022.</p><p>The report also backed data from previous economic reports that show consumers are getting squeezed by persistent inflation and high interest rates. Consumer spending, which has been fueling economic growth, grew at just a 1.5% rate, down from an initial estimate of 2%, according to the report.</p>
    

<p>The main upshot from the report is that “the economy remained resilient in the first quarter but that private sector demand growth was cooling led by more consumer prudence,” said Gregory Daco, EY chief economist, in a note.</p><p>The slowdown in consumer spending could help further ease inflation, but too much of a slowdown could result in a more painful hit to the economy. The Federal Reserve is trying to time its efforts tame inflation back to its 2% target without slowing the economy so much that it slips into a recession.</p><p>The stock market has been listless this week in the lead up to Friday’s release of the next influential inflation report from the government. The personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE, is the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation.</p><p>Economists expect the report to show a modest easing of inflation to 2.6% in May, following a 2.7% reading in April. That’s down from the PCE’s peak of 7.1% in the middle of 2022. Other measures of inflation, including the consumer price index, have also eased significantly over the last two years.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>US Pending Existing-Home Sales Reach Record Low</strong>: An index of US pending existing-home sales unexpectedly fell in May to the lowest level on record, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The index decreased by 2.1% to 70.8, a record low in data going back to 2001.</li>
<li><strong>Mortgage Rates and High Prices Discourage Buyers</strong>: Elevated mortgage rates, currently hovering around 7%, and high prices, which hit a record $419,300 in May, are discouraging prospective buyers. The NAR's Chief Economist, Lawrence Yun, attributed the decline to a combination of factors, including rising inventory and lower demand.</li>
<li><strong>Supply and Demand Imbalance Signals Easing Home Price Appreciation</strong>: Yun believes that the market is at an interesting point, with rising inventory and lower demand, which may lead to easing home price appreciation in upcoming months. He also expects that more inventory in a job-creating economy will lead to greater home buying, especially when mortgage rates descend.</li>
<li><strong>Mortgage Rate Cuts Expected to Support Sales</strong>: A sustained easing in borrowing costs would help support sales. However, the Federal Reserve has tied its hands due to lingering inflation above its 2% target, and officials have only penciled in one rate reduction this year, down from three cuts expected in March.</li>
<li><strong>Regional Variations and Pendings-Sales Figures</strong>: The NAR reported that the Northeast and West saw slight gains in May contract signings, while the pending sales indexes for the South and Midwest each fell to their lowest levels since 2010. The pendings-sales figures tend to be a leading indicator of sales of previously owned homes.</li>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- An index of US pending existing-home sales unexpectedly fell in May to the lowest level on record as elevated mortgage rates and high prices discouraged prospective buyers.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>A gauge of contract signings from the National Association of Realtors decreased 2.1% to 70.8 last month, the lowest reading in data going back to 2001, the group said Thursday. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.5% gain.</p><p>“The market is at an interesting point with rising inventory and lower demand,” NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement. “Supply and demand movements suggest easing home price appreciation in upcoming months. Inevitably, more inventory in a job-creating economy will lead to greater home buying, especially when mortgage rates descend.”</p><p>Closings on previously owned homes have been stuck near an annualized 4 million for more than a year, partly because of the so-called lock-in effect, whereby sellers are unwilling to list their homes and part with their current low mortgage rates.</p><p>Potential homebuyers are turned off by high selling prices, which hit a record $419,300 in May, although the market is gradually seeing a pickup in listings. On a call with reporters last week, Yun noted optimistically that the supply of existing homes was up more than 18% from a year ago.</p><p>“Let’s wait to see if this leads to more home sales,” he said.</p><p>Mortgage Rates</p><p>A sustained easing in borrowing costs would help support sales. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is hovering around 7%, more than twice as high as at the end of 2021. While many had hoped the Federal Reserve would begin cutting interest rates soon, inflation that’s lingering above the Fed’s 2% target has tied the central bank’s hands.</p><p>Officials have penciled in just one reduction this year, down from the three cuts they expected in March.</p><p>Among US regions, the Northeast and West saw slight gains in May contract signings on previously owned homes, while the pending sales indexes for the South and Midwest each fell to their lowest levels since 2010.</p><p>The pendings-sales figures tend to be a leading indicator of sales of previously owned homes, because houses typically go under contract a month or two before they’re sold.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>--With assistance from Chris Middleton.</p><p>(Adds chart)</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

<li><strong>Sam's Club revamps Member's Mark brand</strong>: The company is trying to raise the bar for its private brand, Member's Mark, as it opens more locations and competes with Costco's popular Kirkland Signature brand.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration from Costco</strong>: Sam's Club CEO Chris Nicholas says the brand's revamp was inspired by Costco's success with Kirkland Signature, which has been a key factor in Costco's higher annual revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Gaps to close</strong>: Sam's Club's net sales totaled $86.2 billion in its most recent fiscal year, compared to $176.63 billion for Costco's U.S. clubs, making it a priority for the company to close the gap with its rival.</li>
<li><strong>Expansion plans</strong>: Sam's Club has plans to open more than 30 stores over the next four years, with some stores in regions where potential customers belong to a competing club like Costco.</li>
<li><strong>Megan Crozier's story</strong>: The article's author, Megan Crozier, recounts her own experience with a defective inflatable pool she purchased from Sam's Club, which was a disappointing experience that helped motivate her to become a chief merchant at Walmart, the parent company of Sam's Club, and contribute to the brand's revamp.</li>

The label’s makeover has become critical for Sam’s Club as it aims to close the gap with Costco, which has roughly the same number of U.S. clubs but about twice as much annual revenue.

Consumers experimented with new brands during the Covid pandemic when they couldn’t find their typical purchases on shelves. Some fast-growing grocers, including Trader Joe’s, Aldi and Lidl, have fueled growth almost entirely through their own brands. And stubborn inflation also pushed more consumers to buy a store’s own brand to save some bucks.</p><p>Sales of private label increased 34% between 2019 and 2023 to $236.3 billion, according to the annual report by the Private Label Manufacturers Association, which is conducted by market research firm Circana.</p><p>Exclusive offerings, such as products you can’t find anywhere else, are even more essential for clubs, which require shoppers to pay a membership fee. Annual fees cost $60 at Costco and $50 at Sam’s Club. Each also has a higher-tier membership: $120 at Costco and $110 at Sam’s Club. (Costco is widely expected to raise its annual fee soon, based on its history of doing so.)</p><p>At Sam’s Club, Member’s Mark accounts for roughly 30% of sales in terms of dollars and more than one-third of sales in terms of units. Kirkland accounts for about 28% of Costco’s annual sales.</p><p>Costco declined interview requests for this story.</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107433604" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">Sam’s Club is trying to raise the quality of Member’s Mark.

It announced new goals for food and merchandise standards that it aims to reach in 2025, such as switching to antibiotic-free poultry and fair trade certified coffee beans.</p><p>And it recently launched a program that allows customers to help co-create Member’s Mark items by giving feedback on flavors, design and more before the retailer green lights an item for the shelf.</p><p>Nicholas said customers don’t hold back. “They are exacting, like, ‘Hey, this seam is not good enough or the stitching here needs to be better or this needs to be double stitched or you haven’t got enough lobster in your lobster mac [and cheese],’” he said.</p><p>Myron Frazier, Sam’s Club senior vice president of private brands and sourcing, said the company wants to turn Member’s Mark into a well-respected lifestyle brand. He said the store brand plans to go deeper in home categories, such as offering more indoor furniture and making its own line of small appliances.</p><p>To come up with popular items, he said merchants have sought out products that solve customers’ problems, such as easy meals like chicken rotisserie bites and mix-and-match kids’ clothing sets that can help parents on a hectic morning before school.</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107433598" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">Like Costco’s Kirkland Signature, Sam’s Club has a private brand that cuts across categories including grocery, home decor and apparel. Its private brand, Member’s Mark, also carries seasonal items like patio sets and beach towels.</p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Melissa Repko | CNBC</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>Some signs indicate the moves are paying off. Sam’s Club does not share its membership number, but it has reported a record number of members in each consecutive quarter for more than a year.</p><p>Customer transactions rose 5.4% and the average ticket declined about 1% in the most recent quarter, which could point to shoppers opting more for Member’s Mark items. The products tend to cost less than national brands.</p><p>Nicholas said sales growth of the private brand has outpaced the rest of the store. He added that as its items gain popularity, the club gains leverage to push suppliers to lower prices or step up innovation.</p><p>On an earnings call last month, Walmart finance chief John David Rainey credited Member’s Mark for driving the quarter’s high single-digit growth and said it is “a growing reason why members join and renew.”</p><p>Product quality will help to determine whether the growth continues.</p><p>Since 2020, the year when Crozier’s pool broke, Member’s Mark has launched, tweaked and upgraded more than 1,200 items.</p><p>One of those reformulated items? Its inflatable pool.</p><p>Crozier said it works well now. And she added that Sam’s Club sells a lot of them.</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-collapsibleContainer RelatedContent-collapsed"><div class="RelatedContent-collapsibleContent"><div><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO</h2></div><p class="RelatedContent-fadingGradient"></p></div></div></div></div></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

To address the resulting change in the company’s demographics, Lund said, it’s reinforcing its peer mentoring program.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“We knew we brought in thousands of new employees,” she said, “We have really strengthened on-the-job training. That’s the really hands-on part … you go to the floor and you really learn how to do your job.” </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Before on-the-job training, however, Boeing factory employees undergo a reinvigorated foundational training regime where they learn the basics of their factory tasks before moving to the production line. According to Lund, every employee who comes out of foundational training gets assigned a mentor with more experience on the factory floor. </p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Simplifying processes</h2><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221665007-boeing-renton-15.JPG?width=980&amp;height=654&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221665007-boeing-renton-15.JPG?width=1960&amp;height=1308&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality at Boeing, speaks to the media at the Boeing 737 factory on June 25 in Renton, Wash."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality at Boeing, speaks to the media at the Boeing 737 factory on June 25 in Renton, Wash." data-c-credit="Jennifer Buchanan, The Seattle Times"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Lund said that Boeing is also trying to streamline its production processes and instruction documents to make them easier for new hires to learn. </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Lund explained that because of Boeing’s multigeneration fleet types, like the 737, the first version of which was produced in the 1960s, some documents and production standards are amalgamations of previous best practices. Now, the company is evaluating many of its existing workflows, starting with the most safety-critical aspects, to ensure that they are efficient and easier to replicate. </p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Eliminating defects</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Another key part of Boeing’s safety updates is trying to identify and address defects as soon as possible in the production chain. Part of that work includes sending more Boeing inspectors to its own suppliers to ensure that parts, like the fuselage produced by Spirit AeroSystems that was implicated in the Alaska Airlines incident in January, are defect-free before they even reach Boeing property. </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It also means being more prepared to stop the production line when a defect is identified if it’s not easily remedied.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221671007-boeing-renton-23.JPG?width=980&amp;height=654&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221671007-boeing-renton-23.JPG?width=1960&amp;height=1308&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="737 MAX aircraft are seen in various states of assembly at the Boeing 737 factory on June 25 in Renton, Wash."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="737 MAX aircraft are seen in various states of assembly at the Boeing 737 factory on June 25 in Renton, Wash." data-c-credit="Jennifer Buchanan, The Seattle Times"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Get quality right, via quality control, quality assurance, root cause identification and resolution, and it resolves the rest of the present issues,” Mann said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Boeing’s 737 fuselages go through a 10-day production workflow on the factory floor. They move ahead day by day from the moment they enter the factory to the day they’re ready to roll out to the paint shop. </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">During the tour, a Boeing employee pointed out that the day-five slot was empty on the production line. A few days earlier, employees had identified an issue with a fuselage that was being worked on. Under Boeing’s previous practices, the semi-built aircraft may have moved ahead and the defects would have been addressed literally down the line. But now Boeing is putting greater emphasis on keeping airplanes in place until they pass a quality inspection each day that aims to guarantee they won’t need major retroactive fixes.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“We have seen up to an 80% reduction in defects” since implementing these changes, Lund said.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/travel/airline-news/2024/06/27/boeing-pulls-back-the-curtain-on-safety-changes/74223445007/" data-t-l=":l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - Behind the scenes at Boeing production facility" data-g-r="nav_mo" data-g-tn="pgcss" data-g-mtn="pg74223445007" data-g-moh="hpgm" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" data-c-id="74223445007"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74223321007-3417.JPG?crop=1199,675,x0,y62&amp;width=660&amp;height=372&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt=""><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="27"><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg__ca"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"></use></svg><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_expand"></use></svg></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="Behind the scenes at Boeing production facility" aria-label="In a tightly choreographed media open house of its Renton, Washington, manufacturing facility, Boeing said it’s facing its safety challenges head-on."></p></a><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Strengthening Boeing’s safety culture</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Lund acknowledged that Boeing only began implementing an official safety management system in 2019. The FAA defines a safety management system as “the formal, top-down, organization-wide approach to managing safety risk and assuring the effectiveness of safety risk controls. It includes systematic procedures, practices, and policies for the management of safety risk,” and it’s a standard practice at many airlines and other companies in the aviation industry.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Boeing still has not fully rolled out its safety management system, but Lund said the company is committed to finalizing that work, echoing promises the airframer made in the wake of the 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“How do we make sure we’re not doing anything that could cause an airplane safety issue later on? We’re documenting it, we’re reviewing it,” Lund said. </p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221669007-boeing-renton-35.JPG?width=980&amp;height=654&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221669007-boeing-renton-35.JPG?width=1960&amp;height=1308&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="737 MAX aircraft are seen in various states of assembly at the Boeing 737 factory on June 25 in Renton, Wash."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="737 MAX aircraft are seen in various states of assembly at the Boeing 737 factory on June 25 in Renton, Wash." data-c-credit="Jennifer Buchanan, The Seattle Times"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Boeing has also been in the spotlight for its handling of whistleblower complaints. Several current and former employees have come forward alleging safety lapses at the company, and saying they were retaliated against for reporting their concerns.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">While testifying on Capitol Hill earlier this month, <a href="/story/travel/news/2024/06/18/boeing-ceo-dave-calhoun-testomony-takeaways/74140822007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said he had not met with any of the whistleblowers directly</a>. </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Lund said that Boeing takes these complaints seriously. While she couldn’t say for sure how involved the whistleblowers were in working with Boeing to update its safety procedures, she said they were certainly invited to participate in company-wide meetings that focused on safety, including recent “safety stand-downs” that gave employees across the company an opportunity to address their concerns to management directly. </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Family members of victims killed in the Boeing crashes asked a U.S. judge to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-737-max-crash-victim-families-ask-judge-name-corporate-monitor-2024-06-24/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">name a corporate monitor</a> to examine the company’s safety and corporate compliance procedures. </p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Is it working?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Of course, by inviting members of the media, Boeing was always planning to highlight its progress toward safety. The steps it’s taking are in line with what Mann, the industry consultant, would recommend.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“A focus on quality creates the improved output and financial results that go with reduced traveled work, product rework, and the associated wasted effort, cost, time, and lost productivity,” Mann said. Traveled work refers to fuselages with defects moving down the production line that then require fixes out of phase with the regular workflow. </p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221667007-boeing-renton-60.JPG?width=980&amp;height=654&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221667007-boeing-renton-60.JPG?width=1960&amp;height=1308&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="The top half of a 737 aircraft is seen at Boeing's Foundational Training Center on June 25 in Renton, Wash."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="The top half of a 737 aircraft is seen at Boeing's Foundational Training Center on June 25 in Renton, Wash." data-c-credit="Jennifer Buchanan, The Seattle Times"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The feedback of one of its employees on the tour underscored the fact that this time, Boeing may actually be succeeding in making changes.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">David Prigg, one of the Boeing-appointed tour guides for the media group, has been with the company for 13 years and told a group of journalists that his father worked for Boeing as well. He said he’s been involved in mentoring new hires on the production line and has recently seen a subtle shift in the company’s culture.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Now, he said, factory employees, including his mentees, are more assertive about speaking up about safety concerns. They’re even more open to offering suggestions to help make their workflow more efficient.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“We’re very proud of what we do and we take (safety) seriously,” Prigg said. </p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"></p></div></div>

But the damage has been done: Lost sales and service revenue could be substantial.</p><p>On Wednesday night, CDK Global issued a statement with the first positive news from the company since the cyberattack began on June 19.</p><p>“We have successfully brought a small initial test group of dealers live on the Dealer Management System (DMS), and once validation is complete, we will begin phasing in other dealers,” the company said in a statement to Yahoo Finance. “We are also actively working to bring live additional applications — including our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Service solutions — and our Customer Care channels.”</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">Sales hit?

CDK subsequently admitted that the perpetrators were demanding a ransom to restore services; Bloomberg separately reported that the group behind the attack, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blacksuit-cybercrime-gang-blamed-cdk-150359457.html" data-ylk="slk:BlackSuit, is based in Eastern Europe and was demanding tens of millions of dollars.;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="0">BlackSuit, is based in Eastern Europe and was demanding tens of millions of dollars.</a> Currently, it is unclear if CDK Global paid any ransom; when asked by Yahoo Finance about payment, the company declined to comment.</p><p>Still, the new staged rollout of its DMS seems to be a step in the right direction.

Instead, a significant number of sales that would have occurred in June are now likely to occur in July,” said Thomas King, JD Power’s president of data and analytics, in a statement.</p><p>King and JD Power project overall June sales will dip from an initial 1.41 million unit projection to between 1.27 to 1.33 million unit sales for the month, or a 2.6% to 7.2% decrease in sales compared to a year ago.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>A positive: Those lost sales could reappear in July. But even a lost week, or slow week of sales, in June could affect overall second quarter sales for the dealer groups and automakers too, due to the historically strong end-of-June period.</p><p>“The CDK cyberattacks have thrown a monkey wrench into sales during the second half of June, affecting what is arguably one of the most lucrative and busiest times of the month and quarter for dealerships,” said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’s head of insights. “Although the impact of these attacks will be different from dealer to dealer, this event is another speed bump on the automotive industry’s long road to recovery.”</p><p>Caldwell noted that despite high interest rates and other headwinds, new vehicle sales were poised to be strong in Q2 due to healthier inventory levels and return of summertime incentives. However, like JD Power, Edmunds now expects sales to be pushed to Q3, meaning sales losses could be recovered.</p><p>With Q2 earnings season coming up next month, investors will get a clearer picture of the cyberattack’s impact on dealership group-level sales and overall quarterly deliveries for volume automakers like Ford, GM, and Toyota.</p><p><em>Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

Taco Bell's move comes at a time when more Americans are <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mcdonalds-price-increases-fast-food-cost-popeyes-wendys/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">recoiling from fast-food dining in response to soaring menu prices</a></span>. </p><p>With the Cravings Box, Taco Bell will be "giving consumers our most craveable items at an affordable price point," Taylor Montgomery, Taco Bell North America's chief marketing officer said in a <a href="https://www.tacobell.com/news/taco-bells-luxe-cravings-box-delivers-craveability-and-affordability" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">statement</a>. </p>

<p>Restaurant chains point to rising labor costs and food costs as the reason for price hikes to their menus in recent years. Across the U.S., 22 states raised their <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/minimum-wage-increase-2024-states/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">minimum wages in January</a></span>, even as the federal baseline pay languishes at $7.25 an hour. </p><p>However, labor advocates dispute that argument, saying the fast-food behemoths can more than afford the wage increases. The industry recorded profit margins in March, according to an <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/fast-food-industry-profiteering/#:~:text=Between%202014%20and%202023%2C%20fast,the%20average%20of%20all%20prices" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">analysis</a> of California fast-food restaurants by the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank.</p><p>Price hikes to fast-food menu options appear to be particularly harmful to low-income Americans. A January <a href="https://www.revenuemanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Feb24-RMS-RestaurantConsumers-General.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">poll</a> by consulting firm Revenue Management Solutions found that about 25% of people who make under $50,000 were cutting back on fast food, citing cost as a main concern.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Unemployment claims hit a 14-month high</strong>: The weekly number of initial claims for unemployment benefits reached 1.84 million, the highest level since November 2021.</li>
<li><strong>Labor market cooling</strong>: The increase in claims suggests that the labor market is cooling, with unemployed workers struggling to find new jobs, furthering signs that the market is softening.</li>
<li><strong>Fed's attention</strong>: The Federal Reserve is paying close attention to this trend, as it tries to determine whether the softening is a sign of normalization in the labor market or a sign of harm to the economy from rising interest rates.</li>
<li><strong>Economists' concerns</strong>: Some economists, such as Oxford Economics' Nancy Vanden Houten, believe that if the trend of weekly jobless claims continues to rise, it could signal more weakness in the labor market and support the Fed's decision to lower interest rates sooner rather than later.</li>
<li><strong>Fed's stance</strong>: The Fed has maintained that it needs to gain "greater confidence" in inflation's path lower before cutting interest rates, and the recent trend in unemployment claims will likely influence their decision.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Real GDP increased by 1.4% in the first quarter of 2024</strong>: The Bureau of Economic Analysis released its third estimate, showing a slight revision from the previous estimate of 1.3% growth. This growth is attributed to increases in consumer spending, residential fixed investment, nonresidential fixed investment, and state and local government spending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The main drivers of growth were consumer spending and investment</strong>: The deceleration in real GDP was primarily due to decelerations in consumer spending, exports, and state and local government spending, and a downturn in federal government spending. However, residential fixed investment accelerated, which helped offset these decreases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Current-dollar GDP increased by 4.5% in the first quarter</strong>: This represents an upward revision of $13.2 billion from the previous estimate, with the current-dollar GDP increasing to $28.27 trillion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Price indexes showed a slight increase</strong>: The price index for gross domestic purchases increased by 3.1%, while the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased by 3.4%. Excluding food and energy prices, the PCE price index increased by 3.7%.</p>
</li>

    <div><div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item"><p><strong>Real gross domestic product</strong> (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the first quarter of 2024 (table 1), according to the "third" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the fourth quarter of 2023, real GDP increased 3.4 percent.</p>

<p>The GDP estimate released today is based on more complete source data than were available for the "second" estimate issued last month.  In the second estimate, the increase in real GDP was 1.3 percent. The upward revision primarily reflected a downward revision to imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, and upward revisions to nonresidential fixed investment and government spending. These revisions were partly offset by a downward revision to consumer spending (refer to "Updates to GDP").</p>



<p>The increase in <strong>real GDP</strong> primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, residential fixed investment, nonresidential fixed investment, and state and local government spending that were partly offset by a decrease in private inventory investment. Imports increased (table 2).</p>

<p>Compared to the fourth quarter, the deceleration in <strong>real GDP </strong>primarily<strong> </strong>reflected decelerations in consumer spending, exports, and state and local government spending, and a downturn in federal government spending. These movements were partly offset by an acceleration in residential fixed investment. Imports accelerated.</p>

<p><strong>Current‑dollar GDP</strong> increased 4.5 percent at an annual rate, or $312.2 billion, in the first quarter to a level of $28.27 trillion, an upward revision of $13.2 billion from the previous estimate (tables 1 and 3). More information on the source data that underlie the estimates is available in the "<a href="/sites/default/files/2024-06/gdpkeysource-1q24-3rd.xlsx">Key Source Data and Assumptions</a>" file on BEA's website.</p>

<p>The <strong>price index for gross domestic purchases</strong> increased 3.1 percent in the first quarter, an upward revision of 0.1 percentage point from the previous estimate (table 4). <strong>The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index </strong>increased 3.4 percent, an upward revision of 0.1 percentage point. Excluding food and energy prices, the PCE price index increased 3.7 percent, an upward revision of 0.1 percentage point.</p>

<h3>Personal Income</h3>

<p><strong>Current-dollar personal income</strong> increased $396.8 billion in the first quarter, a downward revision of $7.7 billion from the previous estimate. The increase primarily reflected increases in compensation (led by private wages and salaries) and personal current transfer receipts (led by government social benefits to persons) (table 8).</p>

<p><strong>Disposable personal income</strong> increased $240.2 billion, or 4.8 percent, in the first quarter, a downward revision of $26.6 billion from the previous estimate. <strong>Real disposable personal income</strong> increased 1.3 percent, a downward revision of 0.6 percentage point.</p>

<p><strong>Personal saving</strong> was $777.3 billion in the first quarter, a downward revision of $19.3 billion from the previous estimate. The <strong>personal saving rate</strong>—personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income—was 3.8 percent in the first quarter, the same as the previous estimate.</p>

<h3>Gross Domestic Income and Corporate Profits</h3>

<p><strong>Real gross domestic income</strong> (GDI) increased 1.3 percent in the first quarter, a downward revision of 0.2 percentage point from the previous estimate. The <strong>average of real GDP and real GDI</strong>, a supplemental measure of U.S. economic activity that equally weights GDP and GDI, increased 1.4 percent in the first quarter, the same as the previous estimate (table 1).</p>

<p><strong>Profits from current production </strong>(corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments) decreased $47.1 billion in the first quarter, a downward revision of $26.0 billion from the previous estimate (table 10).</p>

<p><strong>Profits of domestic financial corporations</strong> increased $65.0 billion in the first quarter, a downward revision of $8.7 billion from the previous estimate. <strong>Profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations</strong> decreased $114.5 billion, a downward revision of $0.3 billion. <strong>Rest-of-the-world profits</strong> increased $2.3 billion, a downward revision of $17.0 billion. In the first quarter, receipts increased $25.7 billion, and payments increased $23.4 billion.</p>

<h3>Updates to GDP</h3>

<p>With the third estimate, a downward revision to imports and upward revisions to nonresidential fixed investment, state and local government spending, exports, federal government spending, private inventory investment, and residential fixed investment were partly offset by a downward revision to consumer spending.

<h3>Real GDP by Industry</h3>

<p>Today's release includes estimates of <strong>GDP by industry</strong>, or value added—a measure of an industry's contribution to GDP. Private goods-producing industries decreased 1.1 percent, private services-producing industries increased 1.9 percent, and government increased 2.3 percent (table 12). Overall, 15 of 22 industry groups contributed to the first-quarter increase in real GDP.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
<ul><li>Within private goods-producing industries, the leading contributors to the decrease were durable goods manufacturing (led by primary metals) and nondurable goods manufacturing (led by petroleum and coal products). These decreases were partly offset by an increase in construction (table 13).</li>
	<li>Within private services-producing industries, the leading contributors to the increase were retail trade (led by motor vehicle and parts dealers), finance and insurance (led by Federal Reserve banks, credit intermediation, and related activities), and health care and social assistance (led by ambulatory health care services).</li>
	<li>The increase in government reflected increases in both state and local as well as federal government.</li>
</ul></div>





<h3>Gross Output by Industry</h3>

<p><strong>Real gross output</strong>—principally a measure of an industry's sales or receipts, which includes sales to final users in the economy (GDP) and sales to other industries (intermediate inputs)— increased 2.5 percent in the first quarter. Private goods-producing industries increased 1.2 percent, private services-producing industries increased 3.1 percent, and government increased 1.7 percent (table 16). Overall, 14 of 22 industry groups contributed to the increase in real gross output.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chewy shares surge then fall</strong>: Chewy's stock price rose as much as 34% after Roaring Kitty, a popular meme stock influencer, posted an image resembling Chewy's logo on X. However, the gains were quickly erased, and the stock dipped 0.5% by the end of the session.</li>
<li><strong>Connection between Chewy and GameStop</strong>: GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen, a co-founder and former CEO of Chewy, joined the GameStop board in 2021 and took over as CEO in 2023. This connection has fueled interest in both companies among meme stock enthusiasts.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of the pandemic on pet retail</strong>: During the pandemic, pet retailers like Chewy and Petco saw significant demand for pet food and accessories as people adopted pets and stayed at home. However, as the pandemic subsided, pet adoption rates slowed, and demand for discretionary pet items decreased.</li>
<li><strong>Pet food sales remain strong</strong>: Despite the decline in demand for higher-margin pet products, Chewy and Petco have reported consistently strong sales in the pet food category.</li>
<li><strong>Roaring Kitty's influence</strong>: Roaring Kitty, whose real name is Keith Gill, has gained a significant following online for his cryptic images and memes, which have influenced trading in various meme stock names, including GameStop and now Chewy.</li>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- Big swings in Nvidia Corp. shares have reignited debate about the staying power of the chipmaker’s rally. While the stock’s valuation and threat of competition are major concerns, one variable is key: durability of demand.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>For more than a year, Nvidia’s customers have been snatching up all of the AI accelerator chips the company can produce. That fueled a doubling in Nvidia’s revenue in its last fiscal year to $61 billion and sales are projected to nearly double again in the current period.</p><p>To bullish investors, that spending is only just beginning as more companies seek ways to utilize artificial intelligence to help expand their businesses, create new products and improve efficiency. Nvidia’s resulting revenue and profit growth in that scenario would power the stock higher.</p><p>For bears, there’s still plenty of uncertainty about whether AI can live up to the hype and start delivering sufficient returns on investment. If not, demand is destined to cool and lead to a reckoning for Nvidia’s lofty valuation, which at 22 times projected sales is the most expensive in the S&amp;P 500 Index.</p><p>It’s that scenario which Michael Kirkbride, partner and portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management, says is his biggest fear about Nvidia, even though he remains bullish on the stock.</p><p>“The longer term risk for all of this — and this is a multi-year risk — is that AI turns out to be a bust,” he said. “If AI turns out to be not the next internet and turns out to be the next telco, this will be a lot of ill money spent.”</p><p>Kirkbride is referring to the costly build-out of telecommunications networks in the 1990s in anticipation of a rapid internet traffic increase, which ultimately materialized at a much slower pace. Heavy spending and overly optimistic projections helped propel stocks like Cisco Systems Inc. to levels it still hasn’t surpassed more than two decades later.</p><p>Investors got a taste of what a reckoning for Nvidia shares might look like when the chipmaker, seemingly out of the blue, plunged 13% over the span of just three days, erasing $430 billion in market value. The shares snapped back on Tuesday and after edging higher again on Wednesday, have recouped about half their losses from the selloff. Nvidia shares fell 1.3% on Thursday after results from fellow chipmaker Micron Technology Inc. underlined how AI-related expectations have in some cases proved to be excessive.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Nvidia’s biggest customers — Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Alphabet Inc. — have collectively plowed more than $150 billion into capital expenditures in the past four quarters. A big chunk of that is going to Nvidia, which dominates the market for chips that do the heavy lifting in AI computing.</p><p>Not only have those companies pledged to keep buying this year, many of them say they plan to spend even more.</p><p>For Steve Eisman, the Neuberger Berman senior portfolio manager who correctly bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis, that spending outlook gives Nvidia shares plenty of runway to keep rallying.</p><p>D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria is less certain. One of the few analysts on Wall Street with a hold rating on Nvidia, Luria acknowledges that cloud services providers like Microsoft and Amazon are likely to remain “insatiable” for the next year or two but after that he sees more uncertainty.</p><p>“Those customers will have to deliver a very significant return on investment to justify more data center equipment and data center spending,” Luria said. “Until that happens the expectations for Nvidia for 2026 and beyond look very, very ambitious,” he added, noting that so far, their returns are paltry in comparison to spending.</p><p>John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, acknowledges that insufficient return on investment from customers could become a problem for Nvidia down the road, but he sees no reason to bail on the stock now.</p><p>“We are cognizant of the long-term dynamics and we do monitor them, but we’re not going to sell a name with such strong fundamental momentum, where we think things are going to get even better in the near term.”</p><p>Tech Chart of the Day</p><p>Shares in Micron Technology Inc., the largest US maker of computer memory chips, declined 5.8% after its forecast disappointed investors. Though Micron is getting a boost from the AI computing boom, demand is still sluggish in its traditional markets, such as personal computers and smartphones. Those areas are only beginning to recover from a historic slump last year.</p><p>Top Tech News</p><ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"><li><p>Amazon.com Inc. plans to launch an online storefront for low-priced apparel and home goods, the company’s biggest move to date to counter the rise of discount upstarts like Temu and Shein.</p></li><li><p>China became a world leader in electric vehicles by showering companies with public cash.
