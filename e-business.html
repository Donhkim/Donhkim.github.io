<ol>
<li>GameStop's (GME) stock surged as much as 110% on Monday before paring gains, and was halted multiple times due to volatility.</li>
<li>The surge was attributed to "Roaring Kitty" (Keith Gill) posting online for the first time since 2021, which sparked a wave of enthusiasm and speculation among retail traders.</li>
<li>GameStop's stock has been on an upward trend, rising about 60% over the past two weeks, and crossed above $30 per share on Monday.</li>
<li>Short sellers are taking a hit, with GameStop shorts down $1.34 billion in May so far and $952 million for the year, according to S3 Partners data.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Grid Expansion Rule</strong>: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has issued a new rule that requires transmission providers to plan for the transmission infrastructure needed to meet future energy demands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Long-term planning</strong>: The rule requires each transmission operator to produce a regional transmission plan that outlines long-term needs and the facilities needed to meet them, with a minimum planning horizon of 20 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consideration of benefits</strong>: The rule requires operators to consider a broad set of benefits when planning new transmission facilities, including cost-effectiveness, reliability, and environmental impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial responsibility</strong>: The rule allows customers to only pay for transmission projects that directly benefit them, promoting a more efficient allocation of resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>State involvement</strong>: The rule expands the role of states throughout the planning, selecting, and paying for transmission facilities process, recognizing their pivotal role in ensuring a reliable and efficient grid.</p>

<hr>
<p><span><span><span><span>FERC’s new Grid Expansion Rule continues the essential work of the Commission – ensuring a reliable grid – by requiring the nation’s transmission providers to plan for the transmission we know we will need in the future.  </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>This rule adopts specific requirements addressing how transmission providers must conduct long-term planning for regional transmission facilities and determine how to pay for them, so needed transmission is built. The final rule reflects more than 15,000 pages of comments from nearly 200 stakeholders representing all sectors of the electric power industry; environmental, consumer and other advocacy groups; and state and other government entities.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<h2><span><span><span>The Grid Expansion Rule contains these major elements:</span></span></span></h2>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Requirement to conduct and periodically update long-term transmission planning to anticipate future needs.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Requirement to consider a broad set of benefits when planning new facilities.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Requirement to identify opportunities to modify in-kind replacement of existing transmission facilities to increase their transfer capability, known as “right-sizing.”</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Customers pay only for projects from which they benefit. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Expands states’ pivotal role throughout the process of planning, selecting, and determining how to pay for transmission facilities. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h3><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Long-Term Regional Transmission Planning</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>More specifically, the Grid Expansion Rule requires each transmission operator to:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Produce a regional transmission plan of at least 20 years to identify long-term needs and the facilities to meet them.</span> </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Conduct this long-term planning at least once every five years using a plausible and diverse set of at least three scenarios that incorporate specific factors and use best available data.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Apply seven specific benefits to determine whether any identified regional proposals will efficiently and cost-effectively address long-term transmission needs</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Include an evaluation process to identify long-term regional transmission facilities for potential selection in the regional plan.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Include a process giving states and interconnection customers the opportunity to fund all, or a portion, of the cost of a long-term regional transmission facilities that otherwise would not meet the transmission provider’s selection criteria.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>In the event of delays or cost overruns, reevaluate long-term regional transmission facilities that previously were selected in a regional transmission plan.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Consider transmission facilities that address interconnection-related needs identified multiple times in existing generator interconnection processes, but that have not been built.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Consider the use of Grid Enhancing Technologies such as dynamic line ratings, advanced power flow control devices, advanced conductors and transmission switching.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><span>How to Pay for Transmission </span></span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>The Grid Expansion Rule contains these cost-allocation provisions: </span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Before applicants submit compliance filings, they must open a six-month engagement period with relevant state entities.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Applicants must propose a default method of cost allocation to pay for selected long-term regional transmission facilities.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Applicants may propose, a state agreement process that lasts for up to six months after a project is selected for participants to determine, and transmission providers to file, a cost allocation method for the selected facilities. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><span>Enhanced Transparency, “Right-Sizing” and Interregional Transmission Coordination </span></span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>The Grid Expansion Rule requires transmission providers to: </span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Be transparent regarding local transmission planning information and conduct stakeholder meetings during the regional transmission planning cycle about the local process.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Identify opportunities to modify in-kind replacement of existing transmission facilities to increase their transfer capability, known as “right-sizing,” when needed. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Give incumbent transmission owners a right of first refusal to develop these “right-sized” replacement facilities. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Revise existing interregional transmission coordination processes to reflect the new long-term regional transmission planning reforms.  </span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>The Grid Expansion Rule takes effect 60 days after publication in the <em>Federal Register</em>.</span>  <span>Compliance filings with respect to most of the rule’s requirements are due within 10 months of the effective date, while filings to comply with the interregional transmission coordination requirements are due within 12 months of the effective date.</span></span></span></span></p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey, Americans expect high inflation to persist over the next few years, with the median forecast suggesting an inflation rate of 3.3% one year from now.</li>
<li>The survey also projects that inflation will hover around 2.8% three years from now and remain at 2.8% five years from now, above the Fed's 2% target.</li>
<li>The survey's findings indicate that sticky inflation could be here to stay, with inflation expected to remain high for the next several years.</li>
<li>The survey suggests that Americans expect prices to rise across various categories, including gasoline, food, medical care, college, and rent, with median home price growth also expected to rise to 3.3%, the highest reading in the series since July 2022.</li>
<li>The survey's findings have implications for the Federal Reserve's policies, as actual inflation is influenced by what consumers expect it to be. If consumers expect high inflation, businesses and workers may adjust their behavior accordingly, contributing to higher actual inflation.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Major airlines and an industry trade association are challenging a new Department of Transportation rule</strong>: The rule requires airlines to disclose add-on fees earlier during flight booking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The rule aims to increase transparency for consumers</strong>: The aim is to enable travelers to better understand the total cost of their flight ticket, including any additional fees for services like checked bags, seat selection, and food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The airlines challenging the rule include Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Hawaiian Airlines</strong>: The Airlines for America trade group is also joining the challenge, representing the interests of the four airlines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The airlines argue that the rule is unnecessary and would create unwarranted regulatory burdens</strong>: They argue that the rule would add complexity and cost to their operations without providing any meaningful benefits to consumers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The challenge is currently pending before a federal appeals court</strong>, and a decision on the matter is expected in the near future.</p>

Today, we enter a new and exciting chapter in the history of Novavax. This morning, we announced that we have signed a global co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Sanofi. This agreement is both material and strategically important for Novavax. It is a further validation of our technology platform and provides significant opportunity to drive value creation and benefit global public health. The agreement represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity over time for Novavax. Via this agreement, we generate significant near-term cash flow, a strengthened balance sheet as well as the opportunity to strategically pivot to a new lean operating model, focusing more on our strength in research and development and pipeline expansion to accelerate our growth and generate long-term value for our shareholders.</p><p>First, the upfront and near-term milestones associated with this agreement are anticipated to equate to approximately $1.3 billion in cash of which approximately half is expected within 10 days of signing. These cash payments provide us with a significant capital infusion to help us manage our business. And this in turn, also enables us to remove the going concern status for Novavax. Second, beginning in 2025, it allows us to leverage one of the largest proven global leaders in the vaccine business to commercialize Nuvaxovid in the U.S., U.K. and Europe initially and worldwide over time. Affording hundreds of millions of dollars in potential cost synergies, enabling us to drive toward a new, more lean operating model with total costs anticipated to be well below our prior stated cost reduction targets.</p><p>And we expect our royalties and milestones from Sanofi's efforts with Nuvaxovid to exceed the value of what our own efforts might have yielded, if we had kept the product ourselves exclusively. By licensing Sanofi to use our Nuvaxovid to develop their own combination Flu and COVID products, and to use Matrix-M as a component of other vaccines across their portfolio. We expect to realize substantial additional royalties and milestones valued potentially in the billions of dollars, driven by Sanofi's product development and commercialization efforts over the years and decades to come. The royalties and milestones associated with potential new vaccines, Sanofi may develop using Matrix-M as well as those royalties and milestones anticipated from sales of our COVID-19 vaccine and the development of Sanofi's combination flu COVID and other potential combination vaccines, should help us to sustain cash flow as we invest in our own R&amp;D in an efficient and thoughtful manner for years to come.</p><p>In fact, we have done all of this, while retaining the ability to broaden and accelerate development of our own wholly owned pipeline. This includes the modification of our planned 2024 pivotal trial for our combination flu and COVID vaccine to now also include the potential to yield pivot results -- for pivotal results for our stand-alone flu vaccine, and we now anticipate readouts for both the combination and our stand-alone flu vaccine in mid-2025. In addition to our late-stage CIC and flu stand-alone programs, we will now be able to assess and contemplate the addition of some new early-stage programs to our pipeline and do so within the cost structure of a new lean operating model. For both our late-stage CIC and stand-alone flu programs and any early-stage programs we may choose to add to our pipeline in the coming quarters, we will be pragmatic, shareholder-focused and market aware about how to bring these assets forward.</p><p>For example, through partnering, out-licensing co-development, co-commercialization or commercializing on our own. And we would consider commercializing on our own only for the right asset and with the benefit of our learnings from the COVID experience. The key here is that we intend to have multiple organic opportunities from our own pipeline, with optionality on how we decide to optimize value from them. We look forward to providing additional details and updates on our new pipeline and future growth strategy for Novavax in the coming months as we operationalize our partnership with Sanofi. And finally, this transaction further validates both Novavax's product development capability and the extraordinary value of our Matrix-M adjuvant technology, potentially enhancing our future licensing and business development opportunities across our tech platform.</p><p>In fact, we intend as part of our go-forward strategy to seek additional business development opportunities with our organic pipeline, new pipeline assets we intend to add and our Matrix-M and nanoparticle technology platforms. So in summary, this transaction capitalizes our current business, seeks to increase our future anticipated value from Nuvaxovid, while enabling us to significantly reduce our operating costs and complexity, creates a future stream of royalties and milestones from multiple potential new products to be developed by Sanofi, broadens and accelerates our own development pipeline and enhances our future deal-making capabilities, leveraging Matrix-M our late and early stage pipeline and our product development capabilities.</p><p>Jim Kelly will now walk you through the financial terms. Jim?</p><p><strong>James Kelly:</strong> Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide #5. This new agreement with Sanofi provides for a multibillion-dollar potential across upfronts, equity investment, milestone and royalties. The anticipated present value of the royalties on Sanofi's Nuvaxovid and CIC sales are expected to be the largest individual component of value in this transaction. The COVID-19-related terms include the potential for up to approximately $1.3 billion in cash payments and equity investments. Plus Novavax is eligible to receive two royalties on related product sales. In addition, were eligible to receive up to $200 million in milestones plus ongoing royalties for each new vaccine developed utilizing Novavax' Matrix-M adjuvant. For example, if Sanofi develops five products with our Matrix-M each with $1 billion in sales, this would represent hundreds of millions in royalties per year plus up to $1 billion in onetime milestones.</p><p>During the second quarter of 2024, the initial cash payments include the $500 million upfront and the approximately $70 million equity investment in Novavax stock. Near-term Nuvaxovid COVID-19 milestones of $350 million and CIC milestones of another $350 million should provide important future cash flow to the company. In addition, Novavax is eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales in each of the COVID-19 related product categories, that enable Novavax' meaningful participation and future economics from the current and future products under this agreement.

New vaccines developed with Matrix-M by Sanofi, create a broad opportunity to advance this technology and provide Novavax with multiple revenue generation sources.</p><p>Novavax will support Sanofi as it prepares to advance all programs associated with this agreement, and Novavax will be eligible for cost reimbursement across a host of spend categories. John will now walk you through the first quarter commentary. John?</p><p><strong>John Jacobs:</strong> Thank you, Jim. Please turn to Slide 7. It took a lot of hard work over the past 15 months to get here, and a determined focus on the strategic priorities we identified when I first joined the company. To better position Novavax to execute significant business development opportunities like this partnership with Sanofi. In fact, since early 2023, the management team and I have been making significant progress on our three priorities: Priority one, delivering an updated product for the fall vaccination season, priority two, reducing our rate of spend, managing our cash flow and evolving our scale and structure. And finally, priority three, leveraging our technology platform, our capabilities and our assets to drive additional value beyond Nuvaxovid alone.</p><p>Importantly, we had to make significant progress on the first two priorities in order to optimize the potential of our third priority. And over the last 15 months by strengthening our balance sheet, reducing significant onetime legacy liabilities, including Gavi, and proving that we could streamline our strain selection process and update our vaccine to align with regulatory requirements, we put Novavax in a position to be able to execute meaningful business development agreements. The Sanofi agreement is strategically important for our company, as it enables a pivot to a new growth strategy, a new lean operating model and a new chapter in the history of Novavax. With that in mind, we have made appropriate adjustments to our priorities for the remainder of 2024.</p><p>For the remainder of this year, we will be focusing on the following: #1, prioritizing the successful transition of our new partnership with Sanofi. #2, continuing to expand and diversify organic opportunities and create additional value from our technology platform. #3, preparing to initiate an additional cost reduction program to reduce 2025 R&amp;D plus SG&amp;A expenses, net of Sanofi cost reimbursement to below $500 million. And #4, delivering an updated product for the '24-'25 fall vaccination season. As our strategy, vision and new expanded pipeline for the company evolved, we intend to share more with you about the new path forward for Novavax. We will spend the next several months analyzing and crystallizing our future pipeline and our strategic focus with the goal of sharing our updated plans for Novavax in more detail towards the end of this year.</p><p>And now I would like to hand it over to the team to discuss our results from the quarter in more detail, beginning with John Trizzino for our commercial updates. John?</p><p><strong>John Trizzino:</strong> Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 8. We are very excited about the potential of the Sanofi agreement for our business. And as John mentioned, our first priority is operationalizing the agreement to enable Sanofi to commence co-commercialization activities starting January 1 of next year. This collaboration agreement with Sanofi is a validation of the significant investment made in the Novavax technology platform to date and of the dedicated and passionate effort of the many people that have contributed along the way. While we are steadfast in our belief that our COVID vaccine is the best one approved for use, it has been challenging to transition from being an innovator focused on developing vaccines for infectious diseases to being a commercial business focused on operational execution.</p><p>Now, partnered with Sanofi, we see very clearly the opportunity to leverage their brand and global infrastructure for the benefit of public health, revenue generation and increased return to our investors. The burden of disease for COVID remains clear and well documented. Vaccination continues to be recommended as the best defense for the prevention of severe disease, hospitalization and death. Advisory committees like the CDC ACIP and other health policy bodies around the globe continue to recognize this need. The COVID virus for now continues to circulate throughout the year, but with concentrated disease burden during the typical winter respiratory disease season from late Fall to early spring. The ongoing need for both a COVID and influenza annual seasonal vaccination leads to the public health benefit for a single combination vaccine.</p><p>A single visit and vaccination creates a convenience that we believe will translate into improved vaccination rates, especially in older adults who are most at risk. Sanofi is well recognized -- Sanofi is the well-recognized leader in influenza vaccines, and this collaboration agreement creates the opportunity for COVID-influenza combination vaccine with their existing licensed product. In parallel with preparing for Sanofi's '25 commercialization activities for the upcoming '24-'25 season, we intend to support our key markets of the U.S., Europe and U.K. but to do so in an increasingly streamlined, targeted and cost-efficient manner during our last season commercializing on our own. Recently, both WHO and EMA recommended the use of a monovalent JN1 lineage COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>Novavax plans to be ready to deliver our JN1 protein based vaccine globally this Fall, and we have been developing and manufacturing this vaccine candidate as we anticipate the VRBPAC meeting for U.S. strain selection on June 5. Please turn to Slide 9. In the U.S., we intend to build upon our efforts from the '23 season by offering our vaccine in a more competitive, single-dose prefilled syringe presentation and we intend to have product at distribution centers in the U.S. no later than mid-August, and ready for the season start in early September pending FDA release. We expect that the CDC and competitors will do preseason disease awareness campaigns to drive vaccination rates. And we will focus our efforts on building upon our increased healthcare provider awareness of Novavax, which we achieved last season, and we intend to focus our marketing efforts and investment on the retail and 60-plus age group, where we foresee the highest potential for conversion to Novavax's vaccine given their historically higher vaccination rates.</p><p>In retail, we are having encouraging discussions which increase our optimism that we will have improved retail access for the season. As John mentioned, we have completed the submission of our BLA. While we are pleased with this progress, we have decided in consultation with the FDA to seek emergency use authorization for our updated vaccine, targeting JN1 in order to be available by early September at the start of the season in a prefilled syringe. This pathway has been mapped out together with the FDA to enable an expedited review time frame, and a more straightforward review process. This effort will occur in parallel with the BLA review process, with the goal of having the potential for full BLA approval sometime this year. Though the BLA is indeed important, we intend to achieve BLA approval, the most important factors for a successful campaign are a timely launch at the beginning of the season, broad availability in retail, high levels of awareness, which we already have from last year and a competitive product presentation in a prefilled syringe.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">A closeup of a vial of the biotechnology company's vaccines.</figcaption></p></figure><p>We believe we can more effectively achieve these parameters this year by choosing the EUA option in parallel to the BLA pathway. Please turn to Slide 10. With our pandemic error APA complete in Europe, we are entering a commercial and tender market for the first time in the region and are prioritizing our goal of timely delivery of an updated COVID-19 vaccine in several key European countries. In our major APA markets in Australia, New Zealand and Canada we are seeing a more formal, non-pandemic consumer demand pattern, and we are seeking to optimize the value of these contracts, while doing what is in the best interest of public health for these customers. We are in discussions regarding potential adjustments to dose volumes, pricing per dose and timing of delivery schedules that should better reflect market demand.</p><p>And where we can, we are seeking cash prepayment in exchange for moving to future delivery of doses. Due to significant reductions in demand since the pandemic, awaiting regulatory approvals and ongoing contract renegotiations, we are lowering total revenue guidance for 2024. Jim will discuss guidance on revenue and expenses in more detail shortly. Though we have remaining value on our APAs and intend to optimize the value where we can. Over the next two to three years, we are moving from a pandemic-based APA period and toward a fully normalized vaccine market. We look forward to working with our new partner to optimize our commercial opportunity. Now to discuss our combination and influenza vaccines and other key R&amp;D updates, I want to hand the call to Filip.</p><p><strong>Filip Dubovsky:</strong> Thanks, John. Please turn to Slide 12. Today, I want to cover several topics. First, I want to share data on our JN1 candidate before I touch base on our revised CIC and influenza Phase 3 plans. Then I will show you some preclinical data on our optimized RSV vaccine candidate that we evaluate for future development. Finally, I want to introduce you to two innovative expansions of our technology, mucosal vaccination and the development of a novel nanoparticle format, which we are exploring is an avian H5N1 pandemic vaccine. As John mentioned, these innovations are examples of work we've been doing over the past year, to generate additional value from our technology platform. Please turn to Slide 13 and 14. The World Health Organization and EMA have recommended the JN1 line vaccines for the '24-'25 season.</p><p>This is a variant we've previously advanced in the commercial development. Here, I'm showing neutralizing responses in nonhuman primates that were vaccinated with XBB.1.5 vaccine and boosted with a single dose of JN1. On the left-hand side, you can see the responses to the JN1 variants were low prior to boosting. On the right-hand side, the responses to JN1 and JN1 drift variants are robust following a boost. These data provide us confidence our vaccine has utility against the currently circulating strains, such as KP2 as well as potentially future proofing our vaccine against other variants that evolve from JN-1. The strain selection will be confirmed by VRBPAC on June 5, and we plan on submitting our string change filing shortly after that.</p><p>Okay. Let's go to Slide 15 and 16. We've modified our plans for the upcoming Phase 3 study to include the valuation of a stand-alone seasonal influenza vaccine in addition to our COVID influenza combination vaccine in adults, greater than six years of age. As depicted on the right-hand side of the slide, this is planned to be an immunologic noninferiority superiority study with our vaccine compared to age recommended licensed comparators. Although we have previously received supportive regulatory guidance for the stand-alone influenza program, we will reconfirm the acceptability of this design for the flu influenza portion of the study. The study is still on track for the second half of this year and data for decision-making will be available in mid-'25.</p><p>Okay. Let's move to Slide 17 and 18. We have optimized our RSV F nanoparticle vaccine antigen with a specific goal of maximizing the breadth of neutralizing responses. Here, I'm showing the immune responses in mice, vaccinated with our RSV antigen with Matrix compared to the licensed GSK vaccine with the AS01E [ph] adjuvant. We used competitive bidding against a panel of monoclonal antibodies, known to bind neutralizing epitopes, including Side 0,2,4,5 and P27. On the left-hand side, our bidding results on our antigen. On the right-hand side are bidding results on the GSK antigen. In both cases, a favorable breadth of response is demonstrated for our vaccine. It's interesting to note, on the right-hand panel that the P27 neutralizing sequence is not present on the GSK antigen.</p><p>Okay. Let's go to Slide 19, and look at RSV neutralizing responses. Here, I'm showing new responses for our RSV A on the left and RSV B on the right. We have driven six fold increase for RSV A compared to the licensed GSK-vaccine, which represents the difference of titers from 3,700 to over 23,000. And for RSV B, a titer difference from 440 to over 1,500. This antigen can be used as a stand-alone vaccine or as part of a broader combination vaccine program. Based on our previous clinical experience with a related construct, we are evaluating whether additional preclinical or toxicology studies are required. Partnering discussions for this antigen are ongoing. Okay, please shift to Slide 20 and 21 to look at our early progress in expanding our core technology into mucosal vaccinations.</p><p>We've developed an intranasal formulation that includes our PS80 nanoparticle antigen with our Matrix in adjuvant. In this experiment, we explore this technology with our COVID antigen, we've primed these mice with bivalent vaccine containing prototype in BA 5 and boosted them with intramuscular or intranasal XBB.1.5 vaccine formulations. On the far left side, you can see the initial priming sequence induces no XBB.1.5 specific Mucosal IgA antibody. In the middle, after intramuscular boosting, eligible mucosal IgA was detected. However, when the mice were boosted with intranasal vaccine, there was a very large IgA signal. This is important because mucosal IgA is the first line of defense against respiratory viruses and has implications for prevention of infection and potentially impacting transmission.</p><p>Let's move to Slide 22 for additional characterization of immune response. Here we're displaying XBB.1.5 new responses in the blood on the left and mucosal neutralizing responses on the right. On the left-hand side, unsurprisingly, there was little evidence of SERUM XBB.1.5 neutralizing response after priming with bivalent BA5 vaccine. However, XBB.1.5 responses were increased 27-fold with intramuscular boosting, and surprisingly, intranasal vaccination boosted these central responses over 10x. When we looked at mucosal on the right-hand panel, once again, there was no response after priming, but a profound response was seen after intranasal boosting supporting the hypothesis, this approach may have utility and blocking infections. We believe the small rise in mucosal neutralizing responses following intramuscular boosting represents antibody transited from blood compartment.</p><p>These results are being prepared for publication, and we are evaluating this approach with different antigens in different preclinical models. If these findings are validated in the clinic, this opens the door for a needle-free vaccination, and the potential to block infection and potentially transmission, specifically for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections whose point of entry is through the mucosa. Please turn to Slide 23 and 24 to look at the development of Matrix as a core for a new class of nanoparticles. We've identified transmembrane domains in service in molecular anchors and can link antigens directly into the Matrix adjuvant. On the left-hand, image shows a model and an electronic photomicrograph of a classic PS80 nanoparticle.</p><p>You can see the antigens decorating the polysorbate core. On the right-hand side, we have the novel matrix antiparticle where the antigens shown in blue are anchored directly into the vertices of the matrix structure. This model is confirmed by the EM image on the right. This new format is larger than the PS80 nanoparticle, and we hypothesize to facilitate antigen recognition and phagocytosis. This also increases antigen density with up to 40 to 60 copies per nanoparticle, which may increase activation of antigen processing cells. And finally, linking to antigen at an adjuvant assures co-delivery into a single endosome in antigen processing cells and may increase T cell responses. And this format is amenable to intramuscular and intranasal administration.</p><p>Okay. Let's go to Slide 25 and with how this performs in nonhuman primates. In this experiment, we used a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 2344b antigen, specifically American wigeon as a model antigen. This is the influenza clade, the devastating wild in domestic birds globally and is spread into our mammalian food chain. Here we're prime resets with our quadrivalent seasonal vaccine to more closely mimic the immulogic background in humans. We then boosted them with a single dose of H5N1 matrix nanoparticle vaccine intramuscularly or intranasally in measured neutralizing responses. On the left-hand side, a single 60-microgram intramuscular dose boost H5N1 neutral responses to a very high level in all animals. And on the right, you can see a single intranasal dose results in a 100% seroconversion with a geometric mean titer of 263.</p><p>I have a marked level of 1 to 40, which has been used in the literature as a level relevant for protection. Single-dose pandemic influenza vaccination has been elusive. So certainly, these results caught our attention. If these results are validated in the clinic, it could lead to a game-changing approach because a single-dose vaccination in a pandemic setting would be much easier to deploy and could have a huge public health impact. We're in discussion with government agencies on the best way to advance these candidates into the clinic, so we can evaluate them and this approach can be validated. Okay. I covered a lot of territory today. As a summary, we're in commercial production of JN1 vaccine, which has shown good results in preclinical evaluation and our goal is to have this product available at the beginning of the vaccination season.</p><p>We've expanded our Phase 3 study to include stand-alone influenza, in addition to our combination vaccine and the study is on track to begin in the second half of this year, consistent with its original timeline. We've optimized our RSV construct and we're evaluating additional work needs to be done before we decide on advancing the candidate into future development. Finally, we developed two different derivatives of our core technology, the ability to vaccinate intranasally, with adjuvanted PS80 nanoparticles which in preclinical models induce mucosal immune response, while boosting serum-neutralizing responses. And finally, we've identified molecular anchors, which can attach Amgen directly on to Matrix, and in nonhuman primates, prior to the seasonal vaccine, this has resulted in unprecedented immune response with a single dose for H5 pandemic vaccine.</p><p>Okay, let me hand it over to Jim.</p><p><strong>James Kelly:</strong> All right. Thank you, Filip. Please turn to Slides 26 and 27. We're focused on improving the financial health and performance of Novavax to enable long-term value creation. Today, we announced the strategically important Sanofi agreement and have removed our going concern disclosure that evidence this progress. I will now share a few of the key themes for the first quarter of 2024, and a look towards full-year 2024 and beyond. For the first quarter of 2024, Novavax recorded total revenue of $94 million and significantly improved our balance sheet profile, by reducing current liabilities by $831 million. The Gavi and Fuji Film settlements continue our efforts to address legacy contractual matters. As we continue to transform Novavax into a more lean and agile organization, we reduced our Q1 2024 R&amp;D and SG&amp;A by 50% compared to prior year.</p><p>As we look to 2024, we are updating our targeted guidance for R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses of between $700 million and $750 million, as we continue to resize our organization. For 2025, Novavax is prepared to initiate an additional cost reduction program to reduce R&amp;D plus SG&amp;A expenses, to below $500 million. A portion of which we expect to be reimbursed by Sanofi under today's announced agreement. We ended the first quarter of 2024 with cash and accounts receivable of $570 million, and have over $600 million in potential dose deliveries under our APAs over the next three years. With the Sanofi agreement announced today, we have approximately $570 million in cash payments for the second quarter of 2024 that further improved our financial position.</p><p>Please turn to Slide 28. Turning to a more detailed view of our first quarter 2024 financial results, where I'll provide commentary with specific focus on revenue, COGS and combined R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. For the first quarter of 2024, we recorded total revenue of $94 million compared to $81 million in the same period of 2023. Our product sales of $82 million in the first quarter of 2024 were primarily related to the APA deliveries to Europe, and reflect the successful completion of the European APA agreement. Royalties and other of $12 million for the first quarter of 2024 include license fees and Matrix-M reimbursement under our agreements with Takeda and SK Biosciences. Our cost of sales for the first quarter of 2024 were $59 million as compared to $34 million in the same period of 2023, these periods include $15 million and $25 million, respectively, related to excess obsolete or expired inventory, losses on firm purchase commitments and unutilized manufacturing capacity.</p><p>As previously noted, for the first quarter of 2024, Novavax's R&amp;D plus SG&amp;A of $175 million reflects a 50% and $180 million reduction from the same period in 2023. Please turn to Slide 29. We're committed to creating a more lean and agile organization to align the company with our market opportunities. To advance that goal. Over the past year, we've reduced our workforce by over 30% compared to the first quarter of 2023. For 2024, we're updating our targeted combined R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expense guidance to $700 million to $750 million our prior stated target of $700 million to $800 million, as we continue to push to find savings in our cost structure. Novavax is prepared to initiate an additional cost reduction program to reduce 2025, R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses to below $500 million as noted, a portion of which is expected to be reimbursed by Sanofi under the agreement.</p><p>In addition, we're prioritizing improvements to long-term supply chain efficiency, including exploring the sale of our Czech Republic manufacturing facility. Please turn to Slide 30, where I'd like to discuss progress on our balance sheet and liability management. Since December 31, 2022, we have reduced the company's current liabilities by $1.7 billion, including an additional $831 million reduction in the first quarter of 2024, and primarily driven by the Gavi and Fuji settlements. Please turn to Slide 31. Now turning to financial guidance with an emphasis on our combined revenue and initial Sanofi payments that totaled $970 million to $1.170 billion. This reflects a material improvement to our sources of cash flow for 2024. Beginning with the $570 million of initial payments under the Sanofi agreement, they'll be received in the second quarter of 2024, and reflect just the beginning of a potential multibillion economics across upfront equity investments, milestones and royalties under this agreement.</p><p>For 2024, we are updating our total revenue and now expect to achieve total revenue of $400 million to $600 million. Our projected total revenue includes $150 million to $250 million of APA sales based on expected dose delivery schedules, and non-APA revenue of $250 million to $350 million from a combination of our commercial market product sales plus royalties and other revenues from our partner-related activities. The $400 million reduction to our full-year 2024 expected product sales guidance reflects the following: $100 million from the Canada APA as we await the Canadian order for 2024. It's our intent to add this back when we have clarity on this order. $250 million related to Australia, New Zealand and Israel APAs as we work with those country on revised dose delivery schedules for later periods, and where possible are seeking potential prepayments in 2024.</p><p>Importantly, these updates reflect our goal of working in partnership with these key customers to adjust dose delivery schedules and volumes to better meet current demand, while optimizing the remaining contract value through their completion. And finally, $50 million from EU commercial sales as we reduced commercial investments in select markets for the 2024-'25 vaccination season, post the Sanofi agreement. We look forward to sharing additional updates as we seek to improve Novavax's financial performance, cost structure and strength to deliver shareholder value. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to John for some closing remarks.</p><p><strong>John Jacobs:</strong> Thank you, Jim, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before we take your questions, I would like to reiterate our key priorities for the remainder of this year. Priority one, prioritizing the successful transition of our new partnership with Sanofi. Priority two, continuing to expand and diversify our organic opportunities and create additional value via our technology platform. Priority three, preparing to initiate an additional cost reduction program to reduce 2025 R&amp;D plus SG&amp;A expenses, net of Sanofi cost reimbursement to below $500 million and priority four, delivering our updated product for the '24-'25 Fall vaccination season. I would now like to turn the call over to our operator for Q&amp;A. Operator?</p><p><strong>Operator:</strong> Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].

    Western sanctions on Russian oil sent tker value soaring and helped boost the fortunes of Greek shippers to new highs Forbes now counts of Record 12 greek shipping billionaires seven of them making their debut for the first time hi everybody I'm Britney Lewis with Forbes breaking news joining me now is my Forbes colleague Joo tonini Joo thanks so much for joining me thanks for having me to you wrote about Greek shipping magnetes who have become billionaires in the industry as you pointed out in your reporting Greece has always had a presence in the shipping industry but there's been a boom really in the past few years so can you talk about why yeah so Greece has a really long history with shipping going back centuries obviously that's due to its location right along strategic trade routes and in the Mediterranean um close to the Black Sea as well and one really important point for Greek shipping today is after the second world war really the pioneers of oil tankers and trading oil by sea were uh Greek shippers you know famous names like Aristotle anasis right which everyone knows and they've really been able to continue that leading position for decades since the 1950s and 40s and today we have you know a lot of you know some of the largest shipping firms in the world are Greek not just with tankers but sort of looking across different types of of ships and shipping so why were they able to capitalize so much so more than anyone else what are they shipping so if you look at the sort of global Shipping Fleet uh the largest sort of size of Fleet is owned by Greek companies they they're also the value of their sort of combined Fleet owned by Greeks is around 150 billion um according to data from 2022 it's the largest in the world um they own the largest Fleet of oil tankers the largest Fleet of um liquified natural gas carriers but it's also uh if you look at bulk shipping so that's kind of like any other commodity they're the largest uh it really goes sort of across everything and they benefit from obviously like the the history and the strategy we've talked about um a lot of them are privately owned companies familyowned that have been in this for Generations so they have a long history of knowing how to go around the business uh they're also sort of very smart about when to buy new ships and sell them and timing the market it's really sort of this institutional knowledge and the history of shipping in the country um that has helped them sort of solidify this over the years and it's not just sort of a couple firms it's you know dozens of companies obviously some are much larger than others but it's it's a really important part of the Greek economy and um and on a global scale they managed to keep this position and can you talk about specifically what they are shipping that's making them so rich uh it's all kinds of things I think a lot of the focus in the last couple years has been on oil obviously with the disruption caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and then the subsequent Western sanctions um and specifically with oil uh there's a price cap on Russian oil imposed by Western countries so Russian Oil Can can be traded but to you know if you're following this Western price cap it can't be traded above $60 per barrel and then there's other price gaps for other oil products like Diesel and fuel oil um obviously non you know countries that aren't in the west and companies that aren't based in the west don't have to follow that um Greek companies do um so the focus has really been on oil um but like I was saying before um you know a lot of other Commodities so you know you could look at grain um Iron Ore um things that we don't really tend to think about a lot but that are really important to the global economy um if you look also container shipping so like during the pandemic right when everyone was ordering stuff from home um they're really you know the Greeks are really active across the board in shipping our billionaires list came out in April and one of the most interesting s bars was that the war in Ukraine were it's making some of the ultra wealthy even wealthier and as you pointed out Russia faced sanctions after waging its war on Ukraine so did these ship owners hesitate to carry Russian oil at all once the war was launched and what changed their minds because now they are carrying it so it really depends on who you're looking at um one of the uh so the wealthiest person in Greece according to our list U Mar Angela cusa she came out soon after the invasion saying they would not car car any Russian oil um this was before the sanctions and before the price cap I mentioned and um other firm said that they wouldn't and then eventually did and it's important to note first of all that it is not illegal under Western sanctions to trade Russian oil you have to follow this price cap um and as long as you do it is legal to do so because when the West imposed this the idea was to um impose an economic cost on Putin but to not sort of cause a huge um problem for the global oil market and so a lot of Greek ship Greek shipping firms do and did trade Russian oil um according to an analysis by the KF School of Economics um KSC Institute that we've been looking at a lot um if you look at between you know early 2022 and uh the spring of this year Greek firms shipped close to 30% of all Russian oil exports over that period and that's the second out of any country the number one was the UAE but those firms were firms that are set up there but owned by the Russian state-owned oil company so if you're looking at sort of outside of Russia their Greeks are the largest shippers and over that time period if you look at sort of the top five companies that ship the most Russian oil three out of five are Greek so it really varies right some of the larger companies decided not to do it and haven't done it really others sort of really um really did take that opportunity to ship the Russian oil in your story you have a quote from that someone said in an event that kind of talked about the ethical dilemma people were facing ship owners in particular can you talk about that yeah I think the quote you're referring to is sort of looking at you know the fact that this war is a tragedy but it opens opportunities and when they elaborated on it this was um George brok upu at a shipping conference in the summer of 2022 that to sort of explain it simply um before the war most Russian oil went to Europe it was traded you know largely by pipeline some by ships what happened after that when the EU banned Russian oil all that o had to go somewhere and a lot of it was redirected to India largely and also to China and so if you think about it right like getting oil from the northern part of Russia like the Baltic Sea all the way to India takes I think like around 25 days it's a much much longer Journey so that means for a shipper um they can make a lot more money on that Journey right because it's 25 days now it also means that if you're doing that a lot okay it now means you have fewer tankers because a lot of them are busy on those Journeys and so what happened was this sort of kind of like reoriented the whole tanker industry in the world um and two impacts are important to keep note of one is it sent the value of tanker soaring because there was like a huge demand so um it sent the prices of new tankers um to sort of record highs um and another thing it h that happened was there was just a a sort of larger need for tankers so older tankers say like 15 you know 10 to 15 years old which before might have been scrapped because they weren't really needed they were older now have a lot of use or you know have had the last two years and so resale prices went through the roof to sort of record highs um and related to that price Gap I mentioned before um a lot of these companies in obscure places started popping up um that would buy these old tankers for sort of really high prices and then trade Russian oil in violation of that price cap not the Greeks these are sort of other companies but they were buying these ships from a lot of people including the Greeks and so that sent up the value of old tankers up so if you're a Greek ship owner or really any ship owner uh regardless of whether you're trading Russian oil you've seen that the value of your own ships has gone up um you can get rid of older ships for you know way more I think more than double the price you would have gotten before the war um and that's really what we're we're looking at in this story is that you know none of these you know new billionaires that we're putting on and and talking about are you like they've been in their industry for decades but the value of their fleets their tankers and also their other ships has gone up tremendously in the last two years so let's talk about specifically who these shippers are who these new billionaires are and how much their net worths are so we looked at 13 Greek shipping billionaires um um you know they're they range from and this is you know generally speaking in Greece um the wealthiest is mar Angela cusa who I mentioned before uh she was already on our list from a couple years ago but she's worth more this year in our 2024 World billionaires list we also have eight new entries this year um from Greek shipping uh also one who's returning after uh uh you know since 2008 was the last time they were on the list and collectively we think they're worth more than $30 billion and that's more than 12% of the Greek GDP so um largely this is composed of the value of their fleets um but as I think we're going to talk about you know they also invested in in all kinds of different um Industries over time so we will talk about that shortly but talk about first what the local incentives are for these Greek shippers yeah so it's interesting like we said before Greece has a really long history in shipping um and they there is you know there's a lot of incentives for Greek ship owners to make sure that they would stay in the country and not sort of move their companies elsewhere and so there's actually an article that was enshrined in Greece's constitution in the 50s that exempts ship owners from um you know income tax from the income from their shipping companies instead they pay what's called a tonnage tax which is basically a tax based on the size of their ships like how much they can carry uh which means that generally speaking they're able to um you know it's it's a really advantageous tax system for them and um in two years ago in 2022 the Greek government also passed a new law that reduced the voluntary tax on their dividend and capital gains from shipping companies down to 5% from 10% so you know as long as they um keep a management office in Greece they can take advantage of these these tax benefits so these rules really must be music to Greek shippers ears I mean it sounds like a really good time to be a Greek shipper right now obviously so how are they spending this virtually tax-free money so they you know some of them do just sort of stay within shipping um others have really gone into other directions so for example the three most successful uh soccer teams in in Greece olympas Panos and AK Athens are all owned by Greek uh ship owners as well um also if you look at um internationally um evangelos marinakis who owns olympos he also owns a team in uh the English Premier League um and has you know recently invested in a soccer team in Portugal uh outside of that some of the largest media conglomerates in Greece um TV channels and newspapers are also owned by Greek shipping billionaires and um you know that's looking at sort of media and sports right which we know billionaires all over the world regardless of their industry like to invest in um and then also on the personal side you know some of these uh shipping billionaires have enormous you know real estate Empires so um one person who we added to our list again this year George eamu uh he has an estimated $50 million real estate collection homes in um London New York St Barts south of France and um of course where would we be without Yachts right you know these are ship owners classic billionaire purchase yachts so um George procopio for example owns a yach called dream uh which has two uh outdoor swimming pools a helipad um so if you're looking across across the board they' really invested in in all these different kinds of areas a lot of IND industries spanning from Sports to Media everything in between I know we talked about sanctions earlier and how other companies not these Greek billionaires were kind of flouting those sanctions have they shipped these Greek billionaires shipped to any other countries that were under sanctions so it kind of depends when you sort of what time period you're looking at um there was one example you know in 2020 when the US had sanctions on Venezuela Venezuelan oil um the US Treasury Department uh blocked two um ships that were owned by uh two Greek ship owners who who are now on our billionaires list um and then what happened was they came out and said they would no longer ship Venezuelan oil and a few weeks later the treasury Department um removed the sanctions on those ships um historically speaking if you go further back um there was a famous example in the 1960s when um rhia which is now Zimbabwe when it was ruled by white minority regime was under un sanctions and a un embargo um one Greek shaoning family had attempted to uh ship oil to mosm Beque which was then ruled by Portugal and it was going to Beed supposedly shipped by pipeline to Rhodesia they were stopped from doing so and they didn't so it you know one good quote I think the T story is about how you know they will not violate sanctions they will not um they will not sort of break the law and take that kind of risk but sort of within the parameters of what can be done they will always try to find Opportunities to make money so they will definitely tow that line without Crossing it so have they faced any con quences for towing that line well the the example I mentioned Venezuela is sort of one where the the ships were briefly sanctioned sort blocked and then that was removed so far not really I mean if we're looking at Russia for example um the companies that are shipping Russian oil would say we are not breaking the law we have not been subject to any um enforcement by Western countries and we're um complying with the price cap um and that appears to be the case right there's no indication that they have broken any sanctions so they are you know benefiting from the impact that the wars had on sort of the tanker Market as anyone else has whether or not they're trading Russian oil um but there's no indication that they've broken any sanctions or broken any laws so I want to go back to the quote you pointed out earlier where it essentially was the Russia Ukraine war is obviously bad for Humanity but good for business we saw the two-year Mark of the war come and go do you think we're going to continue to see this boom when it comes to Greek shipping yeah I think it's hard to say now I mean like taking a a step back from the Greek ship owners um there's a lot of reports out now that say that you know for this year and probably next year um the values and sort of prices of new tankers is going to keep Rising um on the resale Market you know for the older tankers uh it's sort of decreased a little bit recently but the you know the impact is still there right so these longer Journeys are still happening um what we may see more of going forward is Russia using the so-called Shadow Fleet so older ships owned by obscure companies um that do not follow Western sanctions and the US has sanctioned these um these companies like the ones in BAS Dubai that I mentioned before that are tied to the Russian government so the more they do that um and the Russian oil is traded more by those firms obviously the less it's going to be traded by companies in Greece or anywhere else um that do follow the Western um that they do follow through the Western regulations um but you know I don't think anyone knows how long this war is going to keep going and the impact has really changed a lot over time so I think it's still too early to say jockamo thanks for your reporting I appreciate the conversation thanks Brandy for having me

<p>Authorities have noted that activists’ “days of action” against Giga Berlin-Brandenburg ended with 23 people being arrested, 76 criminal complaints being filed, and 27 police officers being injured. </p>



<p>Anti-Tesla group Disrupt Alliance claimed last Friday that about 800 participants took part in demonstrations against the electric vehicle maker, and the protest size exceeded 1,000 people. Videos shared online showed numerous protesters running towards Giga Berlin-Brandenburg, and photos on social media showed some Model Y units being vandalized. </p>



 




<p>Despite the chaos of the day, Tesla and law enforcement authorities have claimed that protesters were unable to break into Giga Berlin-Brandenburg’s premises. And as noted in an <em><a href="https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2024/05/tesla-gruenheide-protest-aktionstage-beendet-weitere-aktionen.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rbb24</a></em> report, during the entire duration of the protesters’ “days of action” against Tesla, 23 people were apprehended by the police. A total of 76 criminal complaints have been filed as well, with five being brought before a judge. </p>



<p>A total of 27 police officers were also injured during the anti-Tesla protesters’ “days of action” against the EV maker. The authorities, however, did not provide any information about injuries on the side of the anti-Tesla protesters. </p>



<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk initially responded on Friday to news about the protesters’ demonstrations against Giga Berlin-Brandenburg, stating on X that the activists <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/anti-tesla-protesters-swarm-giga-berlin-brandenburg-arrests-reported/">did not manage to break into the facility’s fenceline</a>. Later posts from Musk, however, showed that the CEO was quite surprised at the focus of the activists on Tesla Giga Berlin-Brandenburg. “Something very strange is happening since Tesla was the *only* car company to be attacked!” Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1788981576375648491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in a post</a> on X. </p>



 



<p>With the “days of action” against Tesla done for now, all eyes are now on the Grünheide municipal council’s planned discussion on Giga Berlin-Brandenburg’s proposed expansion on Thursday. Anti-Tesla groups such as the “Turn off the tap from Tesla” alliance, the “Stop Tesla” group, and the “Disrupt Tesla” initiative, among others, have noted that they intend to be present at the municipal council’s upcoming meeting. </p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>In 2023 and early 2024, it was believed that the US economy was heading towards a growth period with manageable inflation, allowing the Federal Reserve to ease up on interest rates or even cut them.</li>
<li>However, recent data has revealed a surprise development: the economy is experiencing an "inflationary boom" with strong growth, a resilient labor market, and accelerating inflation.</li>
<li>Inflation, as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures index, has accelerated, undoing progress made in previous months.</li>
<li>The unexpected rise in inflation has caused some analysts to predict a return to high inflation and even suggest a recession, while others wonder if the Federal Reserve may need to raise interest rates instead of cutting them.</li>
<li>It is now necessary to reevaluate expectations in light of new data, and it is unclear what the Federal Reserve's next move will be, possibly including rate hikes instead of cuts.</li>

    <div><p class="drop-cap preview">What a difference three months makes.</p><p class="preview">At the end of 2023 and the start of 2024, it appeared that the US was on a glide path to what I termed "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/2024-outlook-us-economy-stock-market-jobs-inflation-interest-rates-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">economic nirvana</a>": Growth would stay steady, if not spectacular, as inflation cooled off to a more manageable pace. This combination would not only let America continue its four-year expansion but also allow the Federal Reserve to ease up on its attempts to rein in the economy — and maybe even cut interest rates.</p><div class="premium-content"><p class="premium">The data released over the past couple of months has forced me to reconsider my expectations for that nirvana, or at least the timing of its arrival. Recent signs point instead to an inflationary boom: a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fed-interest-rate-cuts-jobs-growth-low-inflation-paul-krugman-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">slightly hotter economy</a> in which growth has stayed strong while inflation has sped back up. The labor market has been resilient, with recent jobs reports mostly coming in ahead of expectations and the Employment Cost Index, a widely followed measure of employee-compensation growth, picking up.</p><p class="premium">But perhaps the most eye-catching development has been the persistence of inflation, which caught economists, analysts, and, most importantly, members of the Federal Reserve by surprise. The core personal consumption expenditures index — the Fed's favored inflation gauge that excludes volatile categories such as food and energy — has accelerated, undoing much of the progress from the previous six months. This inflationary-boom dynamic has pushed out expectations for rate cuts, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stagflation-recession-us-economy-outlook-gdp-dimon-inflation-rate-cuts-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">caused some more alarmist analysts</a> to suggest that the US is about to be gripped by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stagflation-us-economy-gdp-growth-outlook-recession-forecast-inflation-rates-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">another bout of high inflation</a>, and left some wondering whether the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/when-will-fed-cut-interest-rates-powell-fomc-inflation-relief-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Fed's next move will instead be to hike rates</a>.</p><p class="premium">It is, of course, fair to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-economist-us-economy-recession-federal-reserve-interest-rates-inflation-2022-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">reevaluate one's expectations when new data</a> is presented. Sticking with one's projection <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-scaremonger-economists-stock-market-analysts-cost-investors-money-2023-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">just to avoid being wrong</a> is a sign of poor analysis. But after carefully examining the underlying inflation dynamics that have driven the recent freak-out about renewed overheating, I estimate the worries are overdone.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">In the lead-up to 2024, the pace of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inflation-consumer-price-index-economic-outlook-food-gas-prices-october-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">price hikes was falling back to earth </a>— or at least the Fed's goal of 2% year over year. Core PCE rose at an annually adjusted rate of 1.9% in the six months ending in December. It seemed like "mission accomplished." But in the first three months of this year, the measure heated back up: Core PCE surged to 4.4%. Typically, price increases are a slow-moving process, so it is rare to see core <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inflation-cpi-consumer-price-index-food-gas-housing-prices-february-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">inflation accelerate this much this quickly</a>. When I started digging into the data, however, I had a hard time explaining the reversal based on the fundamentals.</p><p class="premium">I think of inflation as a triangle: Each leg helps explain our overall price picture. The first leg is expectations — various surveys help gauge the degree to which inflation has become embedded in the minds of consumers and businesses. If these expectations start to creep up, that could be an indication that inflation is soon to follow. The second element is aggregate demand: If people suddenly have more to spend, that can push up spending and cause prices to rise along with it. One way to measure this is unemployment — if there is a sudden surge in Americans getting new jobs, demand is likely to jump as well. The final piece is supply shocks: How much have one-off disruptions helped raise prices on things like imported consumer goods or oil? Using this framework, it's difficult to pinpoint why inflation has strengthened so much.</p><p class="premium">The Survey of Professional Forecasters has found longer-run expectations for inflation have leveled out at 2% — the Fed's target. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/job-market-layoffs-recession-outlook-us-economy-hiring-unemployment-slowdown-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">unemployment rate is up modestly</a> from 12 months ago, which suggests that price hikes aren't being driven by a sudden surge in consumer or household demand. And there have been no widespread supply bottlenecks to speak of. The ISM vendor-deliveries index, which measures the amount of time purchasing managers have to wait to get the goods they need, indicates that the supply chain is running smoothly.</p><p id="1715273244525" data-styles="breakout-width" data-embed-type="custom" data-script="" class="insider-raw-embed breakout premium" data-type="embed"></p><p class="premium">On a deeper level, it appears that the acceleration in inflation is somewhat random, with much of the recent pickup being driven by industry-specific factors as opposed to overall economic conditions. Healthcare-services inflation is a notable example. PCE inflation includes both what consumers pay out of pocket for their care and payments made on behalf of individuals by employers or the government. Well, because of government rule adjustments in the first quarter, Medicaid payments surged, helping to drive up the overall index. Similarly, the cost of financial services went up as fees paid to financial advisors increased, but this is simply a lagged response to the <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-ai-inflation-federal-reserve-rally-bull-market-2023-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">strong performance of the stock market</a> at the end of 2023. Since fees are a set percentage of a person's portfolio, the big run-up in equities at the end of last year meant that people may have paid more in total dollars to their advisor, but that's only because the value of their investments was also soaring.</p><p class="premium">These one-offs have had an outsize impact on the overall inflation picture. Ahead of 2024, the contribution from acyclical components to core inflation was essentially zero. Over the past three months, it has swelled to 4.4%. By contrast, the impact of cyclical components — those elements that are correlated to the overall health of the economy — on inflation has slowed marginally since last year.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">Given the nature of the recent hot inflation readings, the fundamental case for a return to the path of nirvana is strong.</p><p class="premium">For one thing, economic growth is not getting away from the Fed. If growth were materially accelerating, it would drive up the demand leg of the inflation stool, increasing prices as Americans went out and threw around their newfound cash. But that's not what's happening. Real GDP rose at a 1.6% annualized pace in the first quarter, with private demand — which excludes company inventory buildups, government spending, and net exports — climbing 3.1%. The strong growth in private demand suggests that second-quarter GDP could be even more robust. Rather than a sudden reignition of the economy, the under-the-hood data suggests that this is simply the US settling into a steady-state economy.</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-quote="Bringing inflation down from multidecade highs was never going to be a simple or straightforward task — the start of the year has proved as much." data-quote-updated="true" data-source="Add source (optional)" data-source-updated="false" class="premium">

But with borrowing rates rising and building permits declining, that kind of housing contribution is unlikely to repeat. Second, the rise in consumption over the past two months was driven almost entirely by declines in the savings rate. Put another way, Americans were fueling their purchases by dipping into their cash reserves. I would not expect households to dip into their savings quite as much going forward, especially since wage growth is still moderating. The Indeed Wage Tracker, a measure of changes in wages and salaries advertised in job postings on Indeed, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/goldilocks-job-market-openings-quitting-unemployed-wage-growth-job-seekers-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">has been steadily slowing</a> — down to 3.1% growth over the past year. This measure tends to move ahead of the more widely followed Wage Growth Tracker from the Atlanta Fed by roughly eight months. Add all this up, and it paints a picture of a resilient but certainly not red-hot economy.</p><p id="1715273244525" data-styles="breakout-width" data-embed-type="custom" data-script="" class="insider-raw-embed breakout premium" data-type="embed"></p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">I've been surprised at how quickly equity markets have shrugged off the inflation news. If inflation persists as it has, it introduces real downside risks to growth. Real incomes will slow as inflation remains strong, which will weigh on household consumption and, in turn, corporate earnings. This is not like last year. The labor markets are not in the same place. Thus, instead of reinforcing the inflationary-boom narrative, stronger inflation today implies more of a downside risk to the economy.</p><p class="premium">The good news is that there are strong reasons to expect the recent pickup in US inflation to fade. Expectations are steady, labor-market turnover remains low, and inflation continues to moderate in many parts of the developed world.</p><p class="premium">In terms of an outlook for the market, the upshot is that if my analysis is right, the slowing in core inflation and stability in economic growth ought to renew some of the enthusiasm for the prospects of a soft landing. If that's right, I'd take bonds over stocks for the time being, though they should both do well.</p><p class="premium">Bringing inflation down from multidecade highs was never going to be a simple or straightforward task — the start of the year has proved as much. Expecting inflation to continue its downward trend is not a matter of keeping the faith.

</ul>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Other TOP500 Highlights</strong></p>

<p>The 63<sup>rd</sup> edition of the TOP500 once again shows that Intel, AMD, and IBM processors are the preferred choices for the top HPC systems. Out of the Top 10, five systems use Intel Xeon processors (Aurora, Eagle, Leonardo, MareNostrum 5 ACC, and Eos NVIDIA DGX SuperPod), two use AMD processors (Frontier and LUMI) and one system uses IBM processors (Summit). While Fugaku continues to use the A64FX processor, a new development comes from the Alps machine. This system uses an NVIDIA Grace 72C processor.</p>

<p>Once again, China and the United States were the specific countries that earned most of the entries on the entire TOP500 list. The United States added 7 systems over the previous list, bringing its total number of systems to 168. China once again dropped its number of representative machines on the list from 104 to 80 systems. In fact, China did not report a single new machine for this new list.</p>

<p>However, the 63<sup>rd</sup> edition of the TOP500 shows an upset in terms of representation from entire continents. North America kept the top spot by increasing from 160 machines on the previous list to 171 on this list, but Asia dropped from 169 machines to 148. Europe, on the other hand, increased from 143 systems to 160, officially overtaking Asia and putting Europe in second place behind North America.</p>

<p><strong>GREEN500 Results</strong></p>

<p>This edition of the GREEN500 saw a major shakeup, as all of the Top 3 machines are new to the list.</p>

<p>The No. 1 spot on the GREEN500 was claimed by JEDI - JUPITER Exascale Development Instrument, a new system from EuroHPC/FZJ in Germany. Taking the No. 190 spot on the TOP500, JEDI achieved an energy efficiency rating of 72.73 GFlops/Watt while producing an HPL score of 4.5 PFlop/s. JEDI is a BullSequana XH3000 machine with a Grace Hopper Superchip 72C. It has 19,584 total cores.</p>

<p>The Isambard-AI machine out of the University of Bristol in the U.K. claimed the No. 2 spot with an energy efficiency rating of 68.83 GFlops/Watt and an HPL score of 7.42 PFLop/s. Isambard-AI achieved the No. 129 spot on the TOP500 and has 34,272 total cores.</p>

<p>The No. 3 spot was claimed by the Helios system from Cyfronet out of Poland. The machine achieved an energy efficiency score of 66.95 GFlops/Watt and an HPL score of 19.14 PFlop/s.</p>

<p>Like the last list, the Frontier system deserves an honorable mention when discussing energy efficiency. Frontier achieved an exascale HPL score of 1.206 EFlop/s while also earning an energy efficiency score of 56.97 GFlops/Watt. This places the system at No. 11 on the GREEN500 in addition to its No. 1 spot on the TOP500.</p>

<p><strong>HPCG Results</strong></p>

<p>The TOP500 list has incorporated the High-Performance Conjugate Gradient (HPCG) benchmark results, which provide an alternative metric for assessing supercomputer performance. This score is meant to complement the HPL measurement to give a fuller understanding of the machine.</p>

<p>Supercomputer Fugaku is the leader on the HPCG benchmark with an impressive score of 16 HPCG-PFlop/s.</p>

<p>Frontier came in second with a score of 14.1 HPCG-PFlop/s.</p>

<p>Aurora came in third with a score of 5.6 HPCG-PFlop/s. However, it is important to note that Aurora only used about 40% of its nodes for the HPCG run. The Aurora team plans to get a full system run for the next TOP500 list.</p>

<p><strong>HPL-MxP Results (Formerly HPL-AI)</strong></p>

<p>The HPL-MxP benchmark seeks to highlight the use of mixed precision computations.  Traditional HPC uses 64-bit floating point computations. Today, we see hardware with various levels of floating-point precisions – 32-bit, 16-bit, and even 8-bit. The HPL-MxP benchmark demonstrates that by using mixed precision during computation, much higher performance is possible. By using mathematical techniques, the same accuracy can be computed with a mixed-precision technique when compared with straight 64-bit precision.</p>

<p>This year’s winner of the HPL-MxP category is the Aurora system with 10.6 EFlop/s. Frontier has been pushed from the top spot on the last list to the No. 2 spot with a score of 10.2 EFlop/s, and LUMI is now in third place with a score of 2.35 EFlop/s.</p>

<p><strong>About the TOP500 List</strong></p>

<p>The first version of what became today’s TOP500 list started as an exercise for a small conference in Germany in June 1993. A second version of the list was compiled in November 1993 for the SC93 conference. Comparing both editions to see how things had changed the authors realized how valuable this information was and continued to compile statistics about the market for HPC systems based on it. The TOP500 is now a much-anticipated, much-watched and much-debated twice-yearly event.</p></div>

<p>President Joe Biden is expected to levy new 100 percent tariffs targeted at specific Chinese industries, including electric vehicles, on Tuesday. The announcement follows growing calls from automakers, unions, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/ban-chinese-electric-vehicles-now-demands-us-senator/">bipartisan efforts in Congress</a> to address the problem of China unfairly subsidizing its own industries to undermine foreign competitors.</p>
<h2>Why are Chinese EVs so cheap?</h2>
<p>The Chinese government has been giving its green industries heavy direct subsidies for some time now, <a href="https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/news/chinas-massive-subsidies-for-green-technologies/">far in excess of those handed out by US or European governments</a>. For EV makers like BYD, this has meant billions of dollars a year, in addition to the consumer-facing tax benefit for car buyers, similar to how EV sales are incentivized in the US.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>Brands like BYD have concentrated on <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/small-built-chinese-ev-called-seagull-poses-big-110158506">making their cars cheaper to build</a>—only using one windshield wiper instead of two, for example—but also through vertical integration. Other than Tesla, automakers in the US, Europe, Japan, and Korea instead rely heavily on multiple tiers of suppliers, most of whom supply parts to more than one automaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://insideevs.com/features/719015/china-is-ahead-of-west/">Chinese EV makers have also embraced technology</a> to a degree still not matched by other brands, with screens stretching across entire dashboards and online connected services (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18120148/car-companies-china-location-data-electric-cars-mercedes-tesla">plus the associated government tracking</a>) that are anathema to many Ars readers. (Indeed, in February, the US Department of Commerce opened an investigation into whether imported Chinese-connected <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/29/us-says-to-investigate-national-security-data-risks-from-chinese-vehicles.html">cars pose a national security threat</a>. <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Supply-Chain/Tesla-cars-face-more-entry-bans-in-China-as-security-concerns-accelerate">The Chinese government has repeatedly restricted</a> the places that Tesla drivers are allowed take their cars, as it considers them a threat to its own security.)</p>
<p>That has allowed Chinese automakers to sell their products in foreign markets at prices no one else can hope to compete with, undermining local industries in the process. This has been most relevant in Europe, where Chinese automakers like BYD and MG have already set up shop. Last year, 1 in 5 EVs sold in Europe were made in China; this year, it's expected this number will rise to 1 in 4.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>What’s everyone doing about it?</h2>
<p>Last year, the European Union began an investigation into anticompetitive behavior by Chinese OEMs, and stronger EU tariffs on Chinese EVs <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/probe-into-chinese-subsidies-for-evs-advancing-eu-says/">are expected to be levied in the next few weeks</a>.</p>
<p>Chinese car imports to the US are already subject to an additional 25 percent import tariff on top of the 2.5 percent tariff <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/basic-import-export/importing-car">that applies to any car imported to the US</a>. And Chinese brands have yet to enter the US market. If enacted this week, the new 102.5 percent tariffs <a href="https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/polestar-lotus-the-big-losers-as-us-plans-huge-tariffs-for-chinese-evs">would apply to Polestar and Lotus</a>, both of which currently build their US-market EVs in China. But that doesn't mean the industry isn't terrified.</p>
<p>"If there are no trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world," <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-ceo-musk-chinese-ev-firms-will-demolish-rivals-without-trade-barriers-2024-01-25/">said Tesla CEO Elon Musk</a> in January.</p>
<p>"If you cannot compete fair and square with the Chinese around the world, then 20 percent to 30 percent of your revenue is at risk," <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-ceo-worrying-china-ev-210427890.html">said Ford CEO Jim Farley</a> in February.</p>
<p>It probably goes without saying that the United Auto Workers also thinks protecting the US auto industry is worthwhile. "The transition to cleaner technologies cannot be used to intensify the global race to the bottom through offshoring and low wages. We need to see movement by the administration to protect these jobs. The nascent EV industry needs tariff protections—otherwise we are going to be awash in imports. The stakes of the transition are high for American workers," <a href="https://uaw.org/uaw-statement-on-the-epas-new-greenhouse-gas-emissions-rule/">the union said in a statement in March</a>.</p>
<p>US politicians have already passed laws to counter the threat of China dumping EVs here. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-ev-tax-credit-for-2023/">revised how the IRS clean vehicle tax credit works</a>; the consumer subsidy is now only eligible on vehicles assembled in North America. Each year, an increasing amount of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/heres-how-the-irss-clean-vehicle-tax-credit-will-change-on-april-18/">battery pack's content and value must also have originated in the US</a> or a country with which we have a free trade agreement in order to be eligible, and EVs with Chinese batteries are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/tesla-model-3-may-lose-7500-tax-credit-in-2024-under-new-battery-rules/">explicitly not eligible</a>.</p>
<p>This year, senators on both sides of the aisle—most recently Sherrod Brown (D–Ohio)—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/ban-chinese-electric-vehicles-now-demands-us-senator/">have called for a ban on Chinese EV imports</a>. And <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/chinese-ev-makers-wont-get-subsidies-from-mexico-after-us-pressure/">pressure from the US Trade Representative</a> has seen the Mexican government promise not to offer incentives to Chinese EV makers looking to establish a beachhead inside the United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Voting begins</strong>: Voting began today at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Alabama, where 6,000 employees are deciding whether to be represented by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.</li>
<li><strong>Historic election</strong>: This election is historic because the plant has traditionally been resistant to union activity, making it a significant victory for the UAW if it is successful.</li>
<li><strong>UAW momentum</strong>: The UAW is hoping to build on momentum from last month's successful union vote at Volkswagen's Chattanooga plant and its "Stand Up" strike against the Big Three of the U.S. automotive industry last year.</li>
<li><strong>Mercedes-Benz's presence in Alabama</strong>: Mercedes-Benz was the first auto plant to locate in Alabama more than 30 years ago, and the state has since become the No. 1 automotive exporting state in the U.S.</li>
<li><strong>Previous union attempts</strong>: In 2014, the UAW called off an unsuccessful union campaign at the same Mercedes-Benz plant after workers requested it.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The speaker, Mark Tepper, expects $800 billion in defaults in the commercial real estate industry due to the difficulties in the office space market.</li>
<li>The office space market is highly challenged, with notable examples including a building in Fort Worth, Texas, that sold for one-third of its original value, and another building in St. Louis that sold for $3.6 million, down from its original value of $200 million.</li>
<li>43% of small businesses in April struggled to pay their rent, indicating significant financial challenges for small businesses.</li>
<li>The commercial real estate industry is facing two major challenges: the shift towards virtual work, which has reduced the need for large office spaces, and the struggles of small businesses to pay rent.</li>
<li>A trillion dollars in commercial real estate loans are expected to be refinanced, but many properties are worth less than their original loan value, creating uncertainty about who will be impacted by the expected defaults.</li>

    CHANGES TO CONTINUE, ACTUALLY. THANK YOU. MARK TEPPER, YOU'VE BEEN ON THIS FROM DAY ONE IN TERMS OF THE EXPECTATIONS FOR OFFICE SPACE TO CONTINUE TO GET DIRE. HOWARD LUTNICK WAS ON THE PROGRAM LAST YEAR, SAYING HE'S EXPECTING $800 BILLION IN DEFAULTS. >> YOU KNOW, IT'S POSSIBLE. I MEAN, LOOK, COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE SPECIFICALLY OFFICE SPACE IS HIGHLY CHALLENGED RIGHT NOW. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE THIS BUILDING IN FORT WORTH, TEXAS BUT MARIA, I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE SECOND LARGEST BUILDING IN CLEVELAND SELLING FOR ONE-THIRD OF WHAT WAS OWED TO THE BANK. THERE WAS A BUILDING IN ST. LOUIS, I THINK WITHIN THE LAST MONTH OR SO, THAT IN 2006 SOLD FOR $200 MILLION THEY JUST SOLD FOR $3.6 MILLION A MONTH AGO. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, YOU'VE REALLY GOT TWO MAJOR CHALLENGES. NUMBER ONE, IF YOU'RE A BUSINESS THAT PRE-PANDEMIC NEEDED 10,000 SQUARE FEET OF SPACE, YOU PROBABLY NEED 3 TO THE 5,000 NOWADAYS BECAUSE OF THE VIRTUAL WORK THING. SECONDLY, I MENTIONED THIS LAST WEEK, BUT 43% OF SMALL BUSINESSES IN APRIL STRUGGLED TO PAY THEIR RENT. THEY COULD NOT AFFORD TO PAY THEIR FULL RENT SO YOU'VE GOT THOSE TWO HUGE CHALLENGES WHICH ARE WEIGHING ON THE OWNERS OF THESE BUILDINGS. MARIA:  THAT IS CRAZY, 43% COULDN'T PAY THEIR RENT. >>  YEAH. I MEAN, THAT'S -- UNFORTUNATELY, SMALL BUSINESSES ARE NOT DOING VERY WELL. THEY'VE GOT SOME CHALLENGES. PEOPLE REALLY ONLY SEE WHAT FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES ARE DOING. YOU FOLLOW THE STOCK MARKET. BUT MAN OH, MAN, SMALL BUSINESSES, THAT'S 45% OF OUR ECONOMY, 45% OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS. THEY MEAN A LOT. MARIA:  YEAH. AND THEY'VE GOT THE DOUBLE PUNCH OF NOT JUST THE INTEREST RATE STORY AND IMPACT OF HIGHER RATES, LIZ, BUT ALSO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER REGULATION FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION. >>  YEAH. ALL OF THAT IS REALLY HURTING SMALL BUSINESSES AND BY THE WAY, BIG BUSINESSES, MARIA. BUT I THINK WHAT'S TROUBLING ABOUT THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW, ALMOST EVERY -- I THINK THERE'S A TRILLION DOLLARS IN LOANS THAT HAVE TO BE REFINANCED. ALMOST NONE OF THOSE PROPERTIES ARE PROBABLY WORTH WHAT THEY WERE WHEN THEY INITIALLY WERE FINANCED. THE PROBLEM IS, IT'S VERY IDIOSYNCRATIC. YOU COULD HAVE ONE BUILDING THAT'S WORTH 75% OF ITS LOAN VALUE, ANOTHER MAYBE 20% AND THE PROBLEM IS, FOR WALL STREET, YOU LOOK AT THIS AND YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHO IS GOING TO BE IMPACTED. I MEAN, SOME SMALL BANKS, CLEARLY THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME PROBLEMS BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A BLACK CLOUD OUT THERE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO FALL OUT. MARIA:  CHERYL. >>  I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE EXAMPLES OF THE ONE I BROUGHT YOU JUST THIS MORNING FROM TEXAS. EVEN JUST SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WE TALKED ABOUT TWO LARGE OFFICE BUILDINGS DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES AND THOSE WENT INTO BANKRUPTCY. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE OF THAT AND LIZ MENTIONED THE SMALL BANKS. THAT IS WHERE THE SHOES I THINK ARE STILL GOING TO CONTINUE TO FALL UNFORTUNATELY. IF YOU LACK AT THE EARNINGS REPORTS WE GOT FROM THE SMALLER FIRMS, THEY SAY THAT DARK CLOUD IS STILL HANGING OVER THEM AND IF INTEREST RATES IN GENERAL WHICH ARE STILL ABOVE 7% RIGHT NOW CONTINUE IN THAT AREA AND WE DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO, THAT FURTHER COMPOUNDS THE PROBLEMS FOR THE

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>LIVONIA, Mich. (AP) — A tiny, low-priced electric car called the Seagull has American automakers and politicians trembling.</p><p>The car, launched last year by Chinese automaker BYD, sells for around $12,000 in China, but drives well and is put together with craftsmanship that rivals U.S. electric vehicles that cost three times as much. A shorter-range version costs under $10,000.</p><p>Tariffs on imported Chinese vehicles will keep the Seagull out of America for now, and it likely would sell for more than 12 grand if imported.</p><p>But the rapid emergence of low-priced EVs from China could shake up the global auto industry in ways not seen since Japanese makers arrived during the oil crises of the 1970s. BYD, which stands for “Build Your Dreams,” could be a nightmare for the U.S. auto industry.</p><p>“Any car company that’s not paying attention to them as a competitor is going to be lost when they hit their market,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions near Philadelphia. “BYD’s entry into the U.S. market isn’t an if. It's a when.”</p><p>U.S. politicians and manufacturers already see Chinese EVs as a serious threat. The Biden administration on Tuesday is expected to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-electric-vehicles-imports-3d1f4ef984b18bb6e86274e65bcfdf2e" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:announce 100% tariffs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="11" data-v9y="0">announce 100% tariffs</a> on electric vehicles imported from China, saying they pose a threat to U.S. jobs and national security.</p><p><a href="https://www.americanmanufacturing.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/On-a-Collision-Course-FINAL-22024.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Alliance for American Manufacturing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="12" data-v9y="0">The Alliance for American Manufacturing</a> says in a paper that government subsidized Chinese EVs “could end up being an extinction-level event for the U.S. auto sector.”</p><p>Earlier this year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Chinese EVs are so good that without trade barriers, “they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.”</p><p>Outside of China, EVs are often pricey, aimed at higher-income buyers. But Chinese brands offer affordable options for the masses — just as many governments are encouraging a shift away from gasoline vehicles to fight climate change.</p><p>Inside a huge garage near Detroit, a company called Caresoft Global tore apart a Seagull that its China office purchased and shipped to the U.S.</p><p>Company President Terry Woychowski, a former chief engineer on General Motors' pickup trucks, said the car is a “clarion call” for the U.S. industry, which is years behind China in designing low-cost EVs.</p><p>After the teardown, Woychowski said he was left wondering if U.S. automakers can adjust. “Things will have to change in some radical ways in order to be able to compete,” he said.</p><p>There's no single miracle that explains how BYD can manufacture the Seagull for so little. Instead, Woychowski said the entire car, which can go 252 miles (405 kilometers) per charge, is “an exercise in efficiency.”</p><p>Higher U.S. labor costs are a part of the equation. BYD also can keep costs down because of its battery-making expertise — largely lithium iron phosphate chemistry used in consumer products. The batteries cost less but have lower range than most current lithium-ion batteries.</p><p>Americans are still learning to make cheaper batteries, Woychowski said.</p><p>BYD also makes many of its own parts, including electric motors, dashboards, and bodies, using its huge scale — 3 million vehicles sold worldwide last year — for cost savings.</p><p>It designs vehicles with cost and efficiency in mind, he said. For instance, the Seagull has only one windshield wiper, eliminating one motor and one arm, saving on weight, cost and labor to install.</p><p>U.S. automakers don't often design vehicles this way and incur excess engineering costs, Woychowski said.</p><p>The efficiency means weight savings that add up, allowing the Seagull to travel farther per charge on a smaller battery.</p><p>So Detroit needs to quickly re-learn a lot of design and engineering to keep up while shedding practices from a century of building vehicles, Woychowski said.</p><p>The Seagull still has a quality feel. Doors close solidly. The gray synthetic leather seats have stitching that matches the bright green body color, a feature usually found in more expensive cars. The Seagull tested by Caresoft has six air bags and electronic stability control.</p><p>A brief drive through some connected parking lots by a reporter showed that it runs quietly and handles curves and bumps as well as more costly EVs</p><p>While acceleration isn't head-snapping like other EVs, the Seagull is peppy and would have no problems entering a freeway.</p><p>BYD would have to modify its cars to meet U.S. safety standards, which are more stringent than in China. Woychowski says Caresoft hasn't done crash tests, but he estimated that would add a couple thousand dollars to the cost.</p><p>BYD sells the Seagull, also called the Dolphin Mini, in four Latin American countries for about $21,000. The higher price includes transportation and reflects higher profits possible in less cutthroat markets than China.</p><p>BYD told The Associated Press last year it is “still in the process” of deciding whether to sell autos in the U.S. It is weighing factory sites in Mexico for the Mexican market. The company’s CEO said at a conference in May that it has no plans to sell EVs in the U.S.</p><p>BYD EVs aren’t being sold in the U.S. now largely because of 27.5% tariffs on the sale price of Chinese vehicles when they arrive. Donald Trump slapped on the bulk of the tariff, 25%, when he was president, and it was kept in place under Joe Biden. Trump contends that the rise of EVs backed by Biden will cost U.S. factory jobs, sending the work to China.</p><p>The Biden administration has backed legislation and policies to build a U.S. EV manufacturing base.</p><p>Some members of Congress are urging Biden to ban imports of Chinese vehicles altogether, including those made in Mexico by Chinese companies that now would come in largely without tariffs.</p><p>Ford CEO Jim Farley, has seen Caresoft's work on the Seagull and BYD’s rapid growth, especially in Europe. He's moving to change his company. A small “skunkworks” team is designing a new, small EV to keep costs down and quality high, he said earlier this year.</p><p>Chinese makers, Farley said, sold almost no EVs in Europe two years ago, but now have 10% of the EV market. It's likely they'll export around the globe and possibly sell in the U.S.</p><p>Ford is preparing to counter that. “Don't take anything for granted,” Farley said. “This CEO doesn't.”</p><p>____</p><p>Associated Press writers Paul Wiseman and Didi Tang in Washington contributed to this report.

They happened during daytime hours, and the agency confirmed that each of the Amazon vehicles was operating in autonomous mode leading up to the crashes. In one crash a motorcyclist suffered minor injuries, and a Zoox driver reported minor injuries in the other, according to reports. Both happened last month, one in San Francisco and the other in Spring Valley, Nevada.</p><p>The agency said the probe will focus on the performance of the company’s automated driving system during the crashes, as well as how it behaves in crosswalks around pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p>
    

<p>In a statement, Zoox said it is committed to working with NHTSA to answer its questions. “Transparency and collaboration with regulators is of utmost importance,” the company said. Zoox said the vehicles had human safety drivers on board. </p>

<p>The company has launched a shuttle service exclusively for its employees. Analysts say they expect Amazon to use the Zoox system for autonomous deliveries. </p><p>Zoox shuttles don’t have a steering wheel or pedals. The carriage-style interior of the vehicle has two benches that face each other. It measures just under 12 feet (3.7 meters) long, about a foot (a third of a meter) shorter than a standard Mini Cooper. It is capable of going up to 75 mph (121 kilometers per hour), although it started running on public roads at up to 35 mph, the company said. </p>

In March of 2022 the agency began looking into the company’s certification that its vehicle met federal safety standards for motor vehicles.</p><p>The agency said at the time that it would look into whether Zoox used its own test procedures to determine that certain federal standards weren’t applicable because of the robotaxi’s unique configuration.</p>
