<ol>
<li><strong>Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley strategist, predicts a significant stock market pullback</strong>: Wilson believes there's a high likelihood of a 10% correction in the stock market between now and the election, citing uncertainty around the presidential campaign, corporate earnings, and Federal Reserve policy.</li>
<li><strong>Third quarter is expected to be "choppy"</strong>: Wilson's warning comes as the S&amp;P 500 Index is set to hit its 35th closing record this year and the third quarter is known for being a seasonally turbulent period.</li>
<li><strong>Wall Street pros are growing cautious</strong>: Other strategists at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Citigroup, such as Scott Rubner, Andrew Tyler, and Scott Chronert, have also expressed caution and concerns about the market's overheating and potential earnings disappointments.</li>
<li><strong>Morgan Stanley's Wilson has tempered his tone</strong>: Wilson, a long-time bear, has revised his outlook from previous years and now expects the S&amp;P 500 to end the year higher, but only with a probability of 20% to 25%.</li>
<li><strong>Bearish views are becoming unpopular</strong>: As the market continues to set records, bearish views from equity strategists are becoming increasingly unpopular, with some, like Marko Kolanovic, losing their jobs as a result.</li>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) — Traders should brace for a significant pullback in the stock market as uncertainty swirls around the US presidential campaign, corporate earnings and Federal Reserve policy, according to Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>“I think the chance of a 10% correction is highly likely sometime between now and the election,” Wilson said in an interview with Bloomberg Television Monday. The third quarter is “going to be choppy.”</p><p>Read: Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Capitulates on Bearish Stocks View (1)</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 Index opened the week at all-time highs and will hit its 35th closing record this year if it ends Monday in the green. Expectations that the Fed will cut rates twice this year and excitement around artificial intelligence have propelled the benchmark to a 17% gain since January after its 24% surge in 2023. Indeed, even a long-time bear like Wilson has tempered his tone from the past few years.</p><p>But a rising number of Wall Street pros have begun to grow cautious heading into the third quarter, a seasonally turbulent period, particularly amid signs the rally is overheating.</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Scott Rubner said Monday that he’s modeling a painful two-week stretch starting in August if corporate earnings disappoint. Andrew Tyler at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s trading desk said he’s bullish with “slightly less conviction” from recent weakening economic data. And Citigroup Inc.’s Scott Chronert has sounded the alarm on a potential pullback.</p><p>“Your likelihood of upside from now until year end is very low, much lower than normal,” Morgan Stanley’s Wilson said, placing the odds of stock prices closing the year higher than they are now at 20% to 25%.</p><p>The strategist — whose bearish outlook in 2023 failed to materialize — capitulated somewhat earlier this year, lifting his target for the S&amp;P 500 to 5,400 points by mid-2025 from 4,500 through December. Although the index has already eclipsed that, the shift was dramatic since at the time his outlook was among the lowest on Wall Street.</p><p>Bearish views have become dangerous for equity strategists, as US stocks keep setting records.

But at the end of the day, this is a tough gig,” Wilson said. “That’s not an excuse, it’s what we get paid to do. Sometimes we get it right, sometimes we get it wrong. It doesn’t put any pressure on me to do my job any different.”</p><p>“The way we get paid by institutional clients is give them a good analysis, a good framework, so they can make their decisions on how they should be investing and that process will never change,” he added.</p><p>In this sense, Wilson thinks investors shouldn’t be particularly concerned about a pullback from these levels. Rather, he said it could create opportunities to buy into the market. For now, he suggests focusing on individual stocks rather than indexes.</p><p>Wilson and his team continue to recommend high-quality growth names, and quality in general: large-caps, companies with good balance sheets, and those that can deliver on earnings. Momentum will continue, but the problem is it’s hard to find shares in those categories that are cheap, he said.</p><p>“If they were to come in 10%, then we’d probably get interested again,” he said.</p><p>—With assistance from Sonali Basak, Katie Greifeld and Matthew Miller.</p><p>(Adds background on Wilson’s calls, details on departure of Marko Kolanovic from JPMorgan.)</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	That’s not to mention SkyShowtime, a joint-venture streamer operated with Comcast, and a long-established program sales business that shops the likes of the <em>NCIS</em> and <em>CSI</em> franchises around the world.

<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Takeovers naturally give staffers cause for concern. The presentation accompanying the post-announcement conference call detailed $2B+ of “cost efficiencies.” <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/skydance/" id="auto-tag_skydance" data-tag="skydance">Skydance</a> does not, however, have anywhere near the international footprint or headcount of Paramount, meaning there isn’t the scope for eliminating duplicate roles in offices around the world as seen when the likes of Warner Bros. and Discovery hitched their wagons.

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	RedBird founder Gerry Cardinale said on the conference call the deal is based on the idea on “keeping all the assets intact” and it is “not predicated on any restructuring.”</p>





<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Richard Broughton, Executive Director at data and analytics outfit Ampere Analysis said this could be an international growth story. “Skydance’s history has been one of investment and rapid expansion,” he told Deadline. “Its private equity backers KKR and RedBird have previously referenced investment in sports, and investors Tencent and CJ ENM have interactive entertainment ambitions.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	“With economic recovery across most major markets now underway, production activity recovering – particularly internationally – there is likely to be an opportunity for renewed investment in both core areas of Paramount’s business, and also in diversifying the media portfolio.”</p>





<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	<strong>FAST mover advantage?</strong></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	CBS is joined by Australia’s Network Ten, Argentina’s Telefe, Chile’s Chilevision and Britain’s Channel 5 in the free-TV stable. The latter started as an upstart commercial network in the UK and is now an established player, jostling with the likes of Channel 4 for market position.

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Paramount has already aligned some of the broadcaster’s streaming properties with FAST service Pluto TV. “The ad market is a scale game, and in a complex marketplace, simplifying the consumer proposition and ensuring as many brands are available in one place should be the priority for the new entity,” Broughton said.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	FAST is certainly becoming big business. “In 2021 after only seven years after the founding of the company, we managed to become a billion-dollar advertising [revenue] business,” Pluto EVP and GM Olivier Jollet said at Deadline-moderated keynote during the Cannes Film Festival.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Skydance has talked about leaning into technology and Paramount brings both paid-for and free streaming services. “The major players in streaming will compete on having a broad stable of products and services, and Paramount certainly can claim to cover all the bases through its SVOD brands and Pluto TV for AVOD/FAST,” said Tony Gunnarsson, Principal Analyst at Omdia.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	In cable, Paramount owns a plethora of storied cable nets, including MTV and Nickelodeon, which remain staples on pay TV services around the world. Former boss Bob Bakish came through the international ranks at Viacom, securing distribution for these pay channels internationally.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	It was also Bakish who presided over the cuts to international originals at Paramount+ as it yanked a swath of originals from its service and refocused on Hollywood content. That created consternation among subscribers and hurt the streamer’s reputation among international producers.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Gunnarsson outlines the challenge in international streaming. “Paramount+ is doing relatively well domestically – Omdia puts it at over 40 million paid subscriptions in the U.S. by end of 2024,” he said. “Internationally, it’s a rather different story. While Paramount has over 70 million D2C subscriptions as of Q1 2024 (including SkyShowtime), in most international markets its market share is quite a far bit behind the major services Netflix, Amazon, Disney and WBD/HBO/Max.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Paramount+ is being bundled with other pay and streaming services in various territories. On Sky in the UK, Paramount+ is free to Sky Cinema subs, in France it is included with other streamers on a Canal+ package, and in South Korea it is bundled with the TVing SVOD service.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Bundling, partnerships or joining forces with another streamer are all possibilities. “The new leadership team have highlighted that a JV may be an option for Paramount+, which, with the right partner, could boost the scale and appeal of the offer,” said Ampere’s Broughton. “Paramount already collaborates with NBC Universal on SkyShowtime in Europe, so has a template for a JV approach to the streaming world. In Korea, it also collaborates with CJ ENM on local streaming service TVing.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Balancing longstanding revenue streams from program sales with proprietary D2C services such as Paramount+ will be another challenge. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Jack Davison, EVP at global content consultancy 3Vision said: “It has become increasingly obvious to many [studios] that they won’t scale d2c and they need to target content sales revenues and create a hybrid future, and this was especially true for Paramount. They have clearly decided that they pushed too hard towards D2C with Paramount+ and need to find more revenues from their library and pipeline.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Some market-watchers are not convinced Paramount+ has a D2C future outside the U.S. “Internationally, Paramount+ does not have necessary scale to grow profitably, and the merger with Skydance does not change that,” said Enders Analysis’ Senior Media and Telecoms Analyst, Francois Godard. “The new owners need to think hard about the only viable option: going back to a wholesale model under which they sell their content to third party platforms and give up retailing directly to consumers.”

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	The momentum already looks to have moved towards program sales or launching branded Paramount+ blocks rather than full-fledged services around the world. Lisa Kramer, President, International TV Licensing, exclusively <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/02/paramount-global-lisa-kramer-branded-multichoice-africa-ncis-origins-watson-london-tv-screenings-1235836553/" data-type="link" data-id="https://deadline.com/2024/02/paramount-global-lisa-kramer-branded-multichoice-africa-ncis-origins-watson-london-tv-screenings-1235836553/">told Deadline</a> earlier this year that the question is now: “Do we continue to roll out these very large flagship Paramount+ [services], or do we look at the markets outside of that footprint and take a different strategy.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	“Without partnerships there is no future for Paramount+,” said 3Visions’ Davison. “Even with them they need to be stronger and go deeper. Paramount are of a level in the streaming ecosystem that means they can’t go it alone and need to be supported by local partners.”</p>

    <div><p class="drop-cap preview">When I was flying back from London a few weeks ago, I slipped into a rabbit hole I haven't tunneled out of since. I knew what I had paid for my seat, how many miles I had used for the indulgence of an upgrade. But I had no idea if the woman across the aisle had spent only a few points, as I had, or paid the more than $10,000 the airline could charge for the same trip. To book a flight has long been to play a game where only the airline knows the rules, with countless booking codes, loyalty programs, and fare changes that weaponize your data against your wallet. But after I landed, I kept seeing the same rigged game everywhere: in every <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-lyft-driving-worth-it-strategies-tips-clean-car-talking-2024-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="20">Uber</a> ride, every Amazon order, every trip to the supermarket. All these businesses now know so much about me that they can see a number blinking above my head: the exact price I'd be willing to pay in a given moment. Your own number is blinking above your head right now.</p><div class="premium-content"><p class="premium">In the algorithmic age, pricing variability is increasingly creeping into digital commerce, with charges going up and down in real time.</p><p class="premium">What's far more disturbing is the rise of personalized pricing, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/retail" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="20">digital retailers'</a> practice of exploiting your own data to charge the precise price you're willing to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/credit-card-disputes-friendly-fraud-perks-chargebacks-purchases-reviews-2024-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="20">pay</a>, which might be different from what the guy next to you would pay. Personalized pricing not only bakes in bias and can drive inflation but creates a world where you never know when your apps are ripping you off.</p><p class="premium">Now, when I'm on the verge of paying for anything on my phone or laptop, I second-guess whether I'd be paying less if I were using someone else's account.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">I still remember the low-grade shock I felt a decade ago when I learned that price discrimination is often perfectly legal in the United States. In law school, my antitrust professor introduced us to the obscure Depression-era Robinson-Patman Antidiscrimination Act by quickly highlighting that this law very much failed to live up to its title. Under the long-standing law, companies can face ruinous penalties for price discrimination only if they're discriminating against other businesses. If a wholesaler overcharged a store, the store could take it to court, but there was nothing then (or now) to stop the store from doing the same thing to its customers. That is, store owners have more price protections than their customers. If a store generally charges some customers more than others because of their gender, race, or other legally protected characteristics, that's certainly illegal. But when companies want to shake down each customer for the most they're individually willing to pay, they're free to engage in highway robbery.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image  image-figure-float-left float-md-left  premium" data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

                          </figure><p class="premium">I say low-grade shock because at the time personalized pricing discrimination was far less widespread and harmful than it is today. Sure, coupon culture let companies sell the same product in the same store at the same time at different prices — but it gave customers agency. Price-sensitive shoppers took the time to scour for clippings, and less thrifty ones paid full freight. Coupons, loyalty cards, seasonal discounts — a lot of traditional price discrimination lets individual shoppers choose which price group they want to fall into.</p><p class="premium">But algorithmic price discrimination takes away that choice. And the methods to extract data to sort people into pricing groups are more invasive than you may realize. Take your latest Uber trip. When you ordered that car, you probably knew that the distance you were going and the time of day were price factors, as we've grown begrudgingly accustomed to the cold, extractive efficiency of surge pricing. But did you think about plugging in your phone before ordering the ride? If you did, it might have saved you a few bucks, because your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-03/companies-are-getting-smarter-about-raising-their-prices" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="60">battery level</a> is allegedly one of the factors Uber uses to price your trip, a charge that Uber vigorously denies. If the allegations against Uber are true, it's easy to see a rationale: Those with less battery left are more desperate, and those whose phones are minutes away from dying won't hesitate to pay nearly any price to get a car before they're stranded.</p><p class="premium">As <a target="_blank" href="https://prospect.org/economy/2024-06-04-one-person-one-price/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="60">The American Prospect recently detailed</a>, this type of individualized pricing is proliferating across nearly every sector of the economy (streaming, fast food, and even dating apps), and it can be surprising which variables will get you charged more. In the 2010s, retailers relied on somewhat crude data to perfect pricing. Customers might've paid more for a flight they booked on a Mac (versus a PC) or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/asians-nearly-twice-as-likely-to-get-higher-price-from-princeton-review" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="60">paid a higher rate for test prep in ZIP codes with larger Asian communities</a>. But in recent years companies have moved from neighborhood-level price discrimination to individualized pricing.</p><p class="premium">Retailers like Amazon know so, so much about what you buy, both on its platform and off. And you have no way of knowing when your choices are changing what you pay. In 2018, it was headline news that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-price-changes-2018-8?r=US&amp;IR=T" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="60">Amazon adjusted prices 2.5 million times a day</a>. Given Amazon's growth and the growth of AI, the number is likely an order of magnitude higher today. For retailers like Walmart, it's not enough to use our shopping history. In February, the retail behemoth agreed to buy the smart-TV maker Vizio for more than $2 billion, potentially giving Walmart a windfall of intimate consumer data. Smart TVs not only monitor what we watch with Orwellian precision but track other nearby devices with ultrasonic beacons, and can even listen in to what we say in the privacy of our own homes. Vizio specifically has been fined millions of dollars over allegations that it illegally spied on customers.</p><p class="premium">Not only do retailers know what you've bought and how much money you make, but often they know where you are, how your day is going, and what your mood is like, all of which can be neatly synthesized by AI neural networks to calculate how much you'd pay for a given item in a given moment.</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-quote="Your age, gender, and sexual orientation might determine what the AI decides you need to pay for love." data-quote-updated="true" data-source="Add source (optional)" data-source-updated="false" class="premium">

Dating apps are harvesting our romantic lives for data, but some openly brag about doing so to increase profitability. And many of those that don't disclose using personalized pricing still do it. Tinder rarely talks about its pricing technology, but Mozilla and Consumers International recently found that the dating app used dozens of variables to radically adjust pricing for users. Your age, gender, and sexual orientation might determine what the AI decides you need to pay for love.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">Left unchecked, personalized pricing will have pernicious effects across society. Nikolas Guggenberger, an assistant professor at the University of Houston Law Center, says that "hidden algorithmic price discrimination can undermine public trust in price-building mechanisms and thus undermine the marketplace." AI pricing also means that those who are the most desperate and most vulnerable will often pay the most. Even worse, people could be penalized because of their race, age, or class. Take the phone-battery allegation. Older people are more than twice as likely than younger users to have a phone that's at least three years old. Since older smartphones tend to have lower battery life, older people could end up paying more than younger people for the same Uber rides.</p><p class="premium">"Algorithmic price discrimination can basically automate usury," Guggenberger says. "If your battery is about to die and you are out in the country, a ride-sharing app may drastically raise your 'personalized price.'"</p><p class="premium">So much of AI pricing acts as a regressive tax, charging those with the most the least. For people in underserved areas, with fewer stores, fewer alternatives, there's often no choice but to click "buy now," even when it hurts. As the law professor and consumer watchdog Zephyr Teachout told The American Prospect, we shouldn't think of this practice as something as innocuous-sounding as personalized pricing — instead, she calls it surveillance pricing.</p><p class="premium">We know how to prove human discrimination. If a store in a majority-Black neighborhood charges more than its counterpart in a majority-white neighborhood, testers can go to each store, record the prices, and bring a lawsuit. This sort of testing has been at the core of consumer protections for most of a century. But how do you prove when an algorithm discriminates? There are no stores to visit, no price tags to compare, just millions of screens siloed in people's pockets. The result can be a Catch-22, where you can get enough data to prove the discrimination only by suing a company, but you can't sue the company without first having the data. We could see the rise of a perverse, bizarro legal world where companies using bias-prone AI to adjust prices in secret face less legal scrutiny than brick-and-mortar stores.</p><p class="premium">My hope is that this situation is so bleak, the potential for abuse so clear, that not even our dysfunctional democracy will accept it. Our lawmakers have been so slow to rein in the harms of novel technology, even when it becomes clear, for example, that it's undermining our democracy. But even in these polarized times, AI pickpocketing may be one of those rare issues that can unite us in outrage.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="premium"><a target="_blank" rel="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/albert-fox-cahn" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100"><em><u>Albert Fox Cahn</u></em></a><em> is the founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, or STOP, a New York-based civil-rights and privacy group.</em></p></div>

<li><strong>Fed Chair Powell suggests interest rate cuts are getting closer</strong>: Jerome Powell indicated that the Federal Reserve is making progress towards feeling comfortable about interest rate cuts, citing "good data" on cooler inflation and progress towards the 2% inflation target.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation numbers are showing modest progress</strong>: Powell noted that recent inflation readings have shown some progress, and that more "good data" would strengthen his confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards 2%.</li>
<li><strong>Next inflation reading expected to be steady</strong>: The next Consumer Price Index reading is expected to show inflation holding steady at 3.4% in June, with no significant changes expected.</li>
<li><strong>Fed will continue to make decisions meeting by meeting</strong>: Powell emphasized that the Fed will continue to make decisions on monetary policy meeting by meeting, and that lowering rates too quickly could reverse progress on bringing inflation down, while keeping rates elevated for too long could weaken the economy and job market.</li>
<li><strong>Democrats and Republicans may have different priorities</strong>: Democratic lawmakers are expected to press Powell to lower interest rates soon, while Republicans are likely to emphasize the need to keep rates stable ahead of the election in November and express concerns about bank capital rules.</li>

Last Tuesday he noted that the last two inflation readings from April and May "do suggest that we are getting back on a disinflationary path."</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-1">Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell speaks at a news conference at the Federal Reserve in Washington, June 12, 2024.

Based on “core” CPI — which excludes volatile food and energy prices the Fed can’t control — inflation is expected to hold steady at 3.4% in June from the same level in May.</p><p>Powell noted in his prepared testimony the Fed will continue to make decisions on monetary policy meeting by meeting. He reiterated that lowering rates too quickly could reverse progress on bringing inflation down, while keeping rates elevated for too long could weaken the economy and the job market.</p><p>Democrats are expected to press Powell to lower rates soon, while Republicans are likely to press Powell on bank capital rules and emphasize that rates shouldn't be cut too close to the election in November.</p><p>Powell in his testimony underscored that Congress has entrusted the Fed with the operational independence that is needed to take a “longer-term perspective” in the pursuit of its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has released a scathing 71-page report criticizing pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) for allegedly inflating drug costs and squeezing small-town pharmacies out of business.</li>
<li>The FTC report marks a significant shift in the agency's approach to policing PBMs, which has historically been hands-off.</li>
<li>The report accuses PBMs of profiteering by inflating drug costs, and the industry is now worried that the FTC may launch a formal investigation or lawsuit against them for anticompetitive conduct.</li>
<li>The report's findings could also fuel legislative efforts in Congress and state governments to impose limits on the PBM industry.</li>
<li>The FTC has not yet taken any enforcement action against a PBM, but the report's release under the leadership of Chair Lina Khan suggests a more aggressive approach to protecting consumers and small businesses.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Federal regulators ban NGL app for users under 18</strong>: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office have banned NGL, a digital platform, from serving users under 18 years old, citing concerns about cyberbullying and deceptive marketing practices.</li>
<li><strong>NGL exaggerated AI capabilities</strong>: The app, popular among children and teens, marketed itself as using artificial intelligence to curb cyberbullying, but regulators alleged that it had no such capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Deceptive marketing practices</strong>: NGL was accused of tricking users into paying for subscriptions by sending them computer-generated messages that appeared to be from real people, promising to reveal users' real identities for a fee.</li>
<li><strong>No real identities revealed</strong>: Those who signed up for the service received only "hints" about users' identities, regardless of whether they were real or not, according to enforcers.</li>
<li><strong>Groundbreaking settlement</strong>: This is the first time a digital platform has been banned from serving users under 18, marking a significant step towards protecting children's online privacy and safety.</li>

Americans had migrated to the South during the pandemic in search of cheaper housing after stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the coronavirus gave them flexibility over where they could work. That trend is slowing now, leading<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/www-newsweek-com-housing-market-change-sparks-warning-home-buyers-three-states-1919494" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="multivariate"> to waning demand for homes</a>.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/vault/mortgages/how-much-house-can-you-afford/" class="multivariate">How to Calculate How Much House You Can Afford</a></p><p>One analysts suggest that a drop in demand has left many homes in the market, creating a potential bubble.</p><p>"A massive housing bubble has developed, and is about to pop, in the South. The number of new homes for sale in the Southern Region (FL, GA, TN, TX, etc.) has spiked up to nearly 300,000," Nick Gerli, CEO of Reventure Consulting, said in a post on X, formerly <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/twitter" data-sys="1" class="multivariate">Twitter</a>.

But ultimately it's pretty simple. Home builders and investors rampantly speculated in this housing market the last 3-4 years. And prices went far above what locals can afford. And created a bubble," he <a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1810289553246208388" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="multivariate">said</a> on X. "Now that bubble is - slowly - popping. And it could start to pop pretty fast if a Recession is thrown into the mix."</p><p>Some housing economists are suggesting that the housing market may be normalizing after the volatility witnessed during the COVID when a combination of <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/vault/mortgages/current-mortgage-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="multivariate">cheap mortgage</a> rates and lower prices in the south attracted buyers to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/vault/mortgages/how-to-get-a-mortgage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="multivariate">purchase homes</a>.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/vault/mortgages/first-time-homebuyers-guide/" class="multivariate">First-Time Homebuyer Guide</a></p><p>"In our data, it is clear that the southern markets are the most normalized in Austin and San Antonio, for example, there are more homes now for sale than there were before the pandemic," Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, told <em>Newsweek</em>. "So there is greater availability in the South and we are seeing that affect pricing."</p><p>The median listing price in Austin, for example, was down 3 percent compared to a year ago, she added.</p><p>The U.S. still needed to build enough homes and the South has done a better job than other parts of the country in supplying new homes to the market, Hale said.</p><p>"It has also attracted a lot of households from other regions of the country because homes there remain affordable," she told <em>Newsweek</em>. "My expectation is that it will continue to draw in people and that its relative affordability will continue to be an advantage."</p><p>Hale added: "So I don't think we're going to see a crash, but it is the case that inventory of homes for sale are less scarce in the South now than they have been over the past few years."</p><p>Compared to the housing crash seen in the 2008 financial crisis, homeowners now boast significant equity in their homes, including in certain parts of the South.</p><p>"Historically, Florida, for example, has a high share of homeowners that own their home outright," Hale said. "It's the case that nationwide there's a lot more equity in housing right now and that does make it less likely that we'll see the kind of price declines that lead to trouble that we saw in the mid-2000s."</p><p>Gerli acknowledged that other regions of the U.S. were seeing fewer challenges than the South.</p><p>"We won't see a housing crash in the Northeast and Midwest. Home building there is at very low levels. As is speculative inventory activity," he <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1810290653365989711" target="_blank" class="multivariate">pointed</a> out on X. "Prices in these regions are also less overvalued. And inventory is much lower."</p><p>He added: "Perhaps there's a housing correction eventually in Northeast/Midwest. But for now - these markets are holding strong."</p><figure class="imageBox"><figcaption class="caption ar23-caption">

What’s less certain is whether that gridlock will tip France’s heavily indebted economy further into distress.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The turmoil has focused attention back on France’s ballooning €3 trillion debt and a deficit that has grown to more than 5 percent of economic output, and immediately prompted a warning on Monday from the Standard &amp; Poor’s ratings agency over France’s sovereign debt rating.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">“Uncertainty hangs over France’s future government architecture,” said the agency, which had already downgraded France’s debt rating on May 31, rattling the government, whose economic credibility has been one of its main political assets. Should the polarization of France’s new Parliament weaken the government’s ability to mend its finances, France’s debt could be downgraded again, it added.</p><p class="css-zry96z" aria-live="polite" role="note"><a class="css-1081t4c" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=8WXW7">Subscribe to The Times</a> to read as many articles as you like.</p></div></div></div>

<ol>
<li><strong>Job cuts at Dyson</strong>: Vacuum cleaner manufacturer Dyson is planning to cut around 1,000 jobs in the UK, where it currently employs 3,500 people.</li>
<li><strong>Reason for job cuts</strong>: The company cited the need to adapt to "increasingly fierce and competitive global markets" as the reason for the job cuts.</li>
<li><strong>Support for affected staff</strong>: Dyson has stated that staff whose jobs are at risk will be supported through the process, but it is unclear whether any global jobs will be affected at this stage.</li>

The social media company still hasn't delivered any<span class="paywall-full-content invisible"> meaningful business updates, but the business has announced a lot of share dilution and future share sales. My </span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4681719-trump-media-excitement-set-to-slump" class="paywall-full-content invisible">investment thesis</a><span class="paywall-full-content invisible"> remains ultra-Bearish on the stock, with no business to match the large stock valuation.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/8/saupload_DJTd125616345i.png" alt="Finviz Chart" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Source: Finviz</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible">Share Dilution</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Trump Media entered public life with a couple of major issues: limited cash and no real business. With the stock trading above $50 in May, the logical outcome was for warrants and other shares to be cashed in to provide extra cash for the business, while other SPACs haven't necessarily faced diluted returns from warrants being exercised.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">The media company recently announced the exercise<span class="paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible"> of warrants worth </span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4121655-trump-media-announces-over-105m-in-proceeds-through-warrant-exercise" class="paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible">$105 million</a><span class="paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible"> in cumulative proceeds. The company now has a cash balance of $350 million, but the amount is a drop in the bucket of strong balance sheets for other social media platforms.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The one actual business plan announced by the operator of Truth Social is the plan to operate a CDN network for streaming of linear TV. The company <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4122231-trump-media-buying-assets-to-power-tv-streaming-service">announced a deal</a> to acquire the assets of WorldConnect Technologies to obtain the worldwide non-exclusive licensing rights for the CDN technology from Perception Group.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The agreement is financed by 5.1 million shares of DJT stock worth ~$150 million, at current stock prices. The stock will have trading restrictions limiting immediate sales, while Trump Media will also pay $17.5 million in cash over a 3-year period.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On top of these share dilutions, TMTG announced a plan with Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $2.5 billion in shares of common stock over 3 years. The stock would be sold to Yorkville at a 2.75% discount to the market price.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The good news is that Trump Media is actually raising capital at closer to $30 now than the $10 of the SPAC price. The bad news is that the high share price allowed the Founder Shares to be granted, giving Donald Trump and others 40.0 million additional shares despite the company having no real business plan.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The company reported a Q1 share count of 137 million following the business combination. As part of the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/17667315" rel="nofollow">Yorkville S-1</a>, TMTG lists 190 million shares outstanding, plus an additional 19 million shares related to warrants and shareholder disputes.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In essence, the fully diluted share count will be around 210 million shares depending on the additional warrants being exercised, the disputed shares and the recent 5 million share deal. Any shares sold to Yorkville will add to the total outstanding share count, but these shares are more desirable due to Trump Media obtaining $30 per share in cash.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The stock has a fully diluted market cap of ~$6.3 billion, without the results to match this valuation.</p> <h4 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Another Weak Quarter Ahead</h4> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The prime bearish thesis was that once Trump Media started reporting weak quarterly results, the stock would start to slip. The company reported <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4108529-trump-media-and-technology-group-reports-q1-results">horrible Q1 '24 results</a> on May 20th, and the stock has been all downhill from the $48 level before the earnings report.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Trump Media didn't even reach $1 million in quarterly revenues despite launching Truth Social back in 2022. The new TV streaming platform doesn't really appear to drive the needle, and the company hasn't actually explained the product plans.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The company still reports shareholder totals and not Truth Social active user totals. While the 621K shareholder counts sounds impressive and indicates some level of loyal users in the future, the amount isn't useful for evaluating the business.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Truth Social will need 100+ million daily active users to scale. A shareholder base under 1 million is a drop in the bucket of the DAUs needed for the business to thrive.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Rumble</strong> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RUM" title="Rumble Inc.">RUM</a>) has seen its stock plunge after initial excitement surrounding the SPAC transaction. The online video platform has signed up numerous content creators to the platform and reached a peak of 80 million monthly active users, yet the market value is listed at only $1.6 billion, a fraction of the Trump Media valuation now.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Investors should expect Trump Media to report another quarter of sub-$1 million revenues for Q2. The company had an adjusted EBITDA loss of $12.1 million in the prior quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/7/234751-17204107298296142_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="1472" data-height="818" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="true" data-og-image-msn="true" data-og-image-facebook="true" data-og-image-google_news="true" data-og-image-google_plus="true" data-og-image-linkedin="true"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/7/234751-17204107298296142.png" alt="table" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Source: Trump Media Q1'24 earnings release </span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">A big key to the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJT/earnings">Q2 report expected</a> in mid-August is that the losses will be cleaner. Trump Media had excessive costs for stock-based compensation, or SBC, and changes in fair values of derivatives impacted by the SPAC close that won't repeat to this level during the June quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The market will have a far more clear picture of the company not having a real business yet, and management will have to address how the live-streaming TV concept will advance. Trump Media will have to ramp up costs to support a product launch and the rubber usually hits the road when investors no longer focus on pie-in-the-sky business concepts and have to deal with a dose of reality that Truth Social launched over 2 years ago and revenues are still minimal while the company isn't providing any metrics on users and usage.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Takeaway</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The key investor takeaway is that Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp. stock is starting to roll over as the market is hit with a dose of reality of the lack of a real business plan. The company is doing a good job of raising cash to provide a long runway to explore growth opportunities, but TMTG needs an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion to justify the current valuation, and the company hasn't provided any business plan supportive of such a plan.</p> <p class="before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The stock isn't necessarily worthless, but the valuation should be assigned below the cash balance.</p></div></div>
