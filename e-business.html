<li>The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) halted trading for some major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway, due to a technical issue.</li>

            The New York Stock Exchange said Monday that a technical issue that halted trading for some major stocks and caused Berkshire Hathaway to be down 99.97% has been resolved.

            NYSE noted that those price bands are published by the Consolidated Tape Association’s (CTA) Security Information Processor (SIP). CTA, an industry group, is responsible for publishing real-time trade and quote data.

            Trading data provided by Refinitiv shows that Berkshire Hathaway changed hands at $620,700 as of 9:44:32 on Monday morning. And then, without any explanation, the stock crashed to just $185.10.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>X (formerly Twitter) now allows adult content</strong>: The platform, now owned by Elon Musk, has updated its rules to allow users to post adult and graphic content, as long as it is consensually produced and distributed.</li>
<li><strong>Restrictions apply</strong>: While adult content is allowed, the platform still has restrictions in place, including prohibiting content that promotes exploitation, non-consent, objectification, sexualization, or harm to minors.</li>
<li><strong>Definition of adult content</strong>: X defines adult content as "consensually produced and distributed material depicting adult nudity or sexual behavior that is pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal."</li>
<li><strong>Transparency and clarification</strong>: A spokesperson for X stated that the updated policy is intended to increase transparency and clarify the platform's enforcement of rules around adult and violent content.</li>
<li><strong>Background context</strong>: The article mentions that Twitter (now X) had lost some of its most active users in the past, according to a Reuters report from 2022.</li>

	<a href="https://deadline.com/tag/elon-musk/" id="auto-tag_elon-musk" data-tag="elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>‘s X (fka ) is now formally allowing users to post adult and graphic content on the platform, with some restrictions. The platform has never restricted or banned adult content, but updated rules announced over the weekend reveal new caveats. Musk has previously hosted adult content with NSFW (not safe for work) communities.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	“We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality,” X’s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/adult-content" target="_blank">Adult Content page reads</a>. “We balance this freedom by restricting exposure to Adult Content for children or adult users who choose not to see it. We also prohibit content promoting exploitation, nonconsent, objectification, sexualization or harm to minors, and obscene behaviors,” the page continues. “We also do not allow sharing Adult Content in highly visible places such as profile photos or banners.”

	</p>

<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	X <a rel="nofollow" href="https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/adult-content" target="_blank">defines “adult content”</a> as any “consensually produced and distributed material depicting adult nudity or sexual behavior that is pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal.” This also applies to AI-generated, photographic or animated content such as cartoons, hentai or anime. Examples include depictions of “full or partial nudity, including closeups of genitals, buttocks or breasts” and “explicit or implied sexual behavior or simulated acts such as sexual intercourse and other sexual acts,” X says.

</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	In a statement to Deadline, a rep for X said: “We launched Adult Content and Violent Content policies — but what we enforce against has not changed – we launched these policies to clarify our Rules and increase transparency on our enforcement. These policies replace our former Sensitive Media and Violent Speech policies which means we continue to act on these types of content with the exact same philosophy.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Before Musk took over Twitter in October 2023, Reuters<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-where-did-tweeters-go-twitter-is-losing-its-most-active-users-internal-2022-10-25/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-where-did-tweeters-go-twitter-is-losing-its-most-active-users-internal-2022-10-25/" target="_blank"> reported the year previously </a>that Twitter estimated adult content constituted 13% of posts on the platform.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	According to the adult content policies, users who regularly post adult content are being asked to adjust their media settings that places all images and videos behind a content warning that needs to be acknowledged before it can be viewed. There also is an option of adding a one-time content warning on individual posts. According to the policies, failure to mark the posts will result in X adjusting the account settings for the user.

<li><strong>Controversy surrounding GameStop options trading</strong>: A prominent trader, known as "Roaring Kitty," has sparked concern about potential stock manipulation after buying a large number of GameStop options and then stock, causing the company's share price to surge.</li>
<li><strong>Trader's social media re-emergence</strong>: Roaring Kitty, whose real name is not publicly known, had not posted on social media since 2021. He re-emerged in May, shortly before buying the GameStop options, and has been sharing cryptic posts that have contributed to speculation about his trading activities.</li>
<li><strong>E*Trade investigation</strong>: The Massachusetts securities division is reportedly examining Roaring Kitty's actions, and E*Trade is considering whether to stop him from trading on the platform. The outcome of this investigation is still unclear.</li>
<li><strong>Massive GameStop position</strong>: Roaring Kitty has revealed a $116 million position in GameStop, which has triggered further speculation about his trading activities. He has since shared a screenshot of his E*Trade account, which appeared to show he still held onto his GameStop stake even as its value increased to $140 million.</li>
<li><strong>Increased scrutiny and concerns</strong>: Roaring Kitty's activities have raised concerns about potential stock manipulation and market manipulation. His fans are worried that if he is barred from trading on E*Trade, it could damage the platform's reputation and lead to customer losses.</li>

Their balloons can reach remote locations, including oceans and under-observed areas.</li>
<li><strong>Goal: Fill Global Coverage Gap</strong>: Windborne aims to close the 85% gap in weather data collection by using fewer balloons to offer global coverage. Their technology uses satellite communication to deliver data in real-time.</li>
<li><strong>Funding and Market Potential</strong>: Windborne recently closed a $15 million funding round with Khosla Ventures, and the global weather data market is projected to be worth $100 billion, making it a lucrative space for investors.</li>

The frequency and intensity of the storms are increasing. Weather prediction is more critical than ever.</p><p>Artificial intelligence has made the weather forecasting market increasingly crowded.

Windborne uses a new type of weather balloon, for example.</p><p>“We operate the most comprehensive balloon constellation on the planet,” said John Dean, CEO and co-founder of Windborne. “We also do AI-based weather modeling. And so our mission is to mitigate the most disruptive aspects of climate change.”</p><p>Windborne’s balloons can fly for weeks, as opposed to today’s government-launched weather balloons which stay aloft for just a few hours and can’t reach remote locations.</p><p>“This means that we can collect roughly 40 to 50 times more data per balloon, and we can also collect this data over oceans and over under-observed areas by launching easy-to-reach launch sites and then flying over oceans and collecting data in situations as needed,” Dean explained.</p><p>The balloons use satellite communication to deliver their data in real-time. The world currently lacks weather data for 85% of the atmosphere, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Windborne’s goal is to close this gap with its technology — using fewer balloons to offer global coverage.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>Demand for data from government and big business is driving funding. Windborne just closed a $15 million round with lead investor Khosla Ventures.</p><p>“It’s about a $100 billion market now, and it touches pretty much every industry,” Sven Strohband, partner and managing director at Khosla Ventures, said of the weather forecasting market. “It hasn’t really been meaningfully disrupted since the Weather Company in the 1990s. So that makes it a very attractive market for us.”</p><p>The World Economic Forum (WEF) recently said extreme weather and weather uncertainty present the biggest risks to businesses over the next decade. Windborne claims its technology can make a two-week forecast as accurate as today’s two-day forecast.</p><p>In addition to Khosla Ventures, Windborne is backed by Footwork VC, Pear VC, Convective Capital, Ubiquity Ventures and Susa Ventures. The company has raised $25 million to date.</p></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

    <p>Here are five key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Oil prices fell by as much as 3.5% on Monday after OPEC+ announced plans to start unwinding some of its voluntary production cuts earlier than expected, which has increased concerns over future demand heading into 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures settled at $74.27 per barrel, while Brent crude closed at $78.36 per barrel, down roughly 13% from their April peak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision by OPEC+ to extend its 3.6 million barrels per day of existing cuts until the end of next year, but also start to unwind additional reductions of 2.2 million barrels per day over the next 12 months, starting in October.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysts believe that the move may be premature, as demand is expected to slow down in 2025, and that the massive effective spare capacity of OPEC will make it difficult to accommodate further large-scale supply reductions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The downward trend in crude prices has also helped to boost natural gas prices, with analysts expecting prices to remain low due to the relatively weak demand in the short term.</p>

	<a href="https://variety.com/t/paramount-global/" id="auto-tag_paramount-global" data-tag="paramount-global">Paramount Global</a>’s months-long M&amp;A drama may soon be coming to a conclusion. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The special committee established by Paramount Global’s board of directors to evaluate M&amp;A proposals has reached an agreement with David Ellison’s <a href="https://variety.com/t/skydance-media/" id="auto-tag_skydance-media" data-tag="skydance-media">Skydance Media</a> and his private-equity backers on the terms of a complicated deal that would merge Skydance and Paramount while keeping Paramount publicly traded, <em>Variety</em> has confirmed. Skydance and its partners, RedBird Capital and KKR, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-skydance-merger-deal-sweeten-1235963443/">sweetened the original buyout offer</a> to make it more attractive to nonvoting shareholders of Paramount Global.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Now, the deal awaits approval by <a href="https://variety.com/t/shari-redstone/" id="auto-tag_shari-redstone" data-tag="shari-redstone">Shari Redstone</a>, non-executive chair of Paramount Global, whose National Amusements Inc. owns 77% of the voting shares in Paramount Global. Redstone has not officially decided whether or not to go forward on the deal, sources said — and the terms of the Skydance-NAI part of the agreement have yet to be worked out. If she does agree, it would end her family’s decades-long control over the media conglomerate and its predecessor companies.

	</p>




<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The Skydance-Paramount merger would not require approval by Paramount’s Class B shareholders.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	On word of the Skydance-Paramount deal potentially nearing the finish line, the price of Class B shares of Paramount Global were trading up 7.5% Monday to about $12.80/share. New details of Skydance’s deal terms were reported earlier by the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/revised-skydance-offer-gives-paramount-shareholders-opportunity-to-cash-out-at-15-a-share-3c2a16b1" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/03/paramount-skydance-merger-deal-update.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Reps for Skydance, Paramount Global and the Paramount board’s special committee declined to comment.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	A rep for NAI said in a statement to <em>Variety</em>, “We received the financial terms of the proposed Paramount/Skydance transaction over the weekend and we are reviewing them.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Under the new offer from Skydance-RedBird-KKR, Paramount Class B shareholders will be able to sell a bit less than half of their stock for $15 per share and the remainder of their shares would be converted into shares in the newly merged Paramount-Skydance, according to sources.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The pact proposes that Skydance will acquire the shares of NAI for roughly $2 billion in cash, thereby assuming control of Paramount Global. Skydance would merge with Paramount, valuing Skydance at less than the previous $5 billion figure under the prior offer, at which point Skydance-RedBird-KKR would own about two-thirds of the combined Paramount-Skydance (and legacy Class B Paramount Global shareholders would own the remainder). Skydance and its financial partners would also pay Paramount $1.5 billion in cash, intended to go toward reducing Paramount’s $14.6 billion in long-term debt (as of the end of March).

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	NAI and Skydance have not agreed on which party would be responsible for defending the deal against lawsuits filed by Paramount Global shareholders, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/02/business/paramount-skydance-talks-lawsuit.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> Sunday. Redstone’s NAI wants Skydance “to provide legal protection in the event of a lawsuit” but Skydance has not agreed to that deal term, per the Times.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Paramount Global is holding its 2024 annual shareholders meeting on Tuesday (June 2) starting at 9 a.m. ET, but it is unlikely that a deal with Skydance will officially be a go by then.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	After Redstone and Skydance did not clinch a deal on Skydance’s previous offer, Sony Pictures and private-equity giant Apollo Global Management <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/sony-apollo-paramount-global-acquisition-offer-cash-1235981220/">emerged as prospective bidders for Paramount Global</a> but have since backed off their $26 billion all-cash offer to buy the entire company. The Sony-Apollo bid would face a number of regulatory hurdles, including requiring a separate ownership structure for CBS’s owned TV stations.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>On Sunday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reached beyond <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">Blackwell</a> and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/computex-2024-jensen-huang/">revealed</a> the company's next-generation AI-accelerating GPU platform during his keynote at Computex 2024 in Taiwan. Huang also detailed plans for an annual <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-grace-hopper-superchips-designed-for-accelerated-generative-ai-enter-full-production">tick-tock</a>-style upgrade cycle of its AI acceleration platforms, mentioning an upcoming Blackwell Ultra chip slated for 2025 and a subsequent platform called "Rubin" set for 2026.</p>

<p>Nvidia's data center GPUs currently power a large majority of cloud-based AI models, such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>, in both development (training) and deployment (inference) phases, and investors are keeping a close watch on the company, with expectations to keep that run going.</p>
<p>During the keynote, Huang seemed somewhat hesitant to make the Rubin announcement, perhaps wary of invoking the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect">Osborne effect</a>, whereby a company's premature announcement of the next iteration of a tech product eats into the current iteration's sales. "This is the very first time that this next click as been made," Huang said, holding up his presentation remote just before the Rubin announcement. "And I'm not sure yet whether I'm going to regret this or not."</p>

<p>The Rubin AI platform, expected in 2026, will use <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/hbm4-memory-to-double-speeds-in-2026-2048-bit-interface-to-revolutionize-artificial-intelligence-and-hpc-markets-report">HBM4</a> (a new form of high-bandwidth memory) and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/">NVLink 6 Switch</a>, operating at 3,600GBps. Following that launch, Nvidia will release a tick-tock iteration called "Rubin Ultra." While Huang did not provide extensive specifications for the upcoming products, he promised cost and energy savings related to the new chipsets.</p>
<p>During the keynote, Huang also introduced a new ARM-based CPU called "Vera," which will be featured on a new accelerator board called "Vera Rubin," alongside one of the Rubin GPUs.</p>
<p>Much like Nvidia's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/nvidias-new-ai-superchip-combines-cpu-and-gpu-to-train-monster-ai-systems/">Grace Hopper architecture</a>, which combines a "Grace" CPU and a "Hopper" GPU to pay tribute to the pioneering computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">of the same name</a>, Vera Rubin refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Rubin">Vera Florence Cooper Rubin</a> (1928–2016), an American astronomer who made discoveries in the field of deep space astronomy. She is best known for her pioneering work on galaxy rotation rates, which provided strong evidence for the existence of dark matter.</p>

<p>Nvidia's reveal of Rubin is not a surprise in the sense that most big tech companies are continuously working on follow-up products well in advance of release, but it's notable because it comes just three months after the company revealed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">Blackwell</a>, which is barely out of the gate and not yet widely shipping.</p>
<p>At the moment, the company seems to be comfortable leapfrogging itself with new announcements and catching up later; Nvidia <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-grace-hopper-superchips-designed-for-accelerated-generative-ai-enter-full-production">just announced</a> that its GH200 Grace Hopper "Superchip," unveiled one year ago at Computex 2023, is now in full production.</p>

<p>With Nvidia stock <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/nvidias-split-soaring-stock-could-boost-retail-investor-appeal-dow-chances-2024-05-23/">rising</a> and the company possessing an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/02/nvidia-dominates-the-ai-chip-market-but-theres-rising-competition-.html">estimated 70–95 percent</a> of the data center GPU market share, the Rubin reveal is a calculated risk that seems to come from a place of confidence. That confidence could turn out to be misplaced if a so-called "<a href="https://theweek.com/tech/ai-bubble-deflating">AI bubble</a>" pops or if Nvidia misjudges the capabilities of its competitors. The announcement may also stem from pressure to continue Nvidia's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/nvidia-passes-googles-market-cap-now-worlds-fourth-most-valuable-company/">astronomical growth</a> in market cap with nonstop promises of improving technology.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Huang has been eager to showcase the company's plans to continue pushing silicon fabrication tech to its limits and widely broadcast that Nvidia plans to keep releasing new AI chips at a steady cadence.</p>
<p>"Our company has a one-year rhythm. Our basic philosophy is very simple: build the entire data center scale, disaggregate and sell to you parts on a one-year rhythm, and we push everything to technology limits," Huang said during Sunday's Computex keynote.</p>
<p>Despite Nvidia's recent market performance, the company's run may not continue indefinitely. With ample money pouring into the data center AI space, Nvidia isn't alone in developing accelerator chips. Competitors like AMD (with the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300.html">Instinct series</a>) and Intel (with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/intels-gaudi-3-ai-accelerator-chip-may-give-nvidias-h100-a-run-for-the-money/">Gaudi 3</a>) also want to win a slice of the data center GPU market away from Nvidia's current command of the AI-accelerator space. And <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/report-sam-altman-seeking-trillions-for-ai-chip-fabrication-from-uae-others/">OpenAI's Sam Altman</a> is trying to encourage diversified production of GPU hardware that will power the company's next generation of AI models in the years ahead.</p>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&amp;P 500 jumped nearly 13% last year, easily surpassing the gains for workers at a time when <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-rates-inflation-prices-loans-economy-aab628326f0d539c47fac53ecb5e2932">inflation was putting considerable pressure on Americans’ budgets</a></span>. </p><p>The median pay package for CEOs rose to $16.3 million, up 12.6%, according to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.equilar.com/reports/110-equilar-associated-press-ceo-pay-study-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data analyzed for The Associated Press by Equilar</a></span>. Meanwhile, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers rose 4.1% through 2023.

After navigating the pandemic, companies faced challenges from persistent inflation and higher interest rates. About two dozen CEOs in the AP’s annual survey received a pay bump of 50% or more. </p>
    

<p>“In this post-pandemic market, the desire is for boards to reward and retain CEOs when they feel like they have a good leader in place,” said Kelly Malafis, founding partner of Compensation Advisory Partners in New York. “That all combined kind of leads to increased compensation.”</p>
    
<p>But Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, believes the gap in earnings between top executives and workers plays into the overall dissatisfaction among Americans about the economy. </p>
    
<p>“Most of the focus here is on inflation, which people are really feeling, but they’re feeling the pain of inflation more because they’re not seeing their wages go up enough,” she said.</p><p>Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can’t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits. The median stock award rose almost 11% last year compared to a 2.7% increase in bonuses.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
        </div><p>Hock Tan, the CEO of Broadcom Inc., topped the AP survey with a pay package valued at about $162 million. </p><p>Broadcom granted Tan stock awards valued at $160.5 million on Oct. 31, 2022, for the company’s 2023 fiscal year. Tan was given the opportunity to earn up to 1 million shares starting in fiscal 2025, according to a securities filing, provided that Broadcom’s stock meets certain targets – and he remains CEO for five years. </p><p>At the time of the award, Broadcom’s stock was trading at $470. Tan would receive portions of the stock awards if the stock hit $825 and $950 and the the full award if the average closing price is at or above $1,125 for 20 consecutive days between October 2025 and October 2027. The targets seemed ambitious when set, but the stock has skyrocketed since, and reached an all-time closing high of $1,436.17 on May 28. </p>
    

<p>Like rival Nvidia Inc., Broadcom is riding the current artificial intelligence frenzy among tech companies. Its chips are used by businesses and public entities ranging from major banks, retailers, telecom operators and government bodies. </p><p>In granting the stock award, Broadcom noted that under Tan its market value has increased from $3.8 billion in 2009 to $645 billion (as of May 23) and that its total shareholder return during that time easily surpassed that of the S&amp;P 500. It also said Tan will not receive additional stock awards during the remainder of the five-year period.</p><p>Other CEOs at the top of AP’s survey are William Lansing of Fair Isaac Corp, ($66.3 million); Tim Cook of Apple Inc. ($63.2 million); Hamid Moghadam of Prologis Inc. ($50.9 million); and Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix ($49.8 million). </p><p>At Apple, Cook’s compensation represented a 36% decline from the year prior. Cook requested a pay cut for 2023, in response to the vote at Apple’s 2022 annual meeting, where just 64% of shareholders approved of his pay package. </p>
    

<p>The survey’s methodology excluded CEOs such as Nikesh Arora at Palo Alto Networks ($151.4 million) and Christopher Winfrey at Charter Communications ($89 million). </p><p>Although securities filings show Elon Musk received no compensation as CEO of Tesla Inc., <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-pay-package-iss-recommends-against-ad9c8875edfd7b011281113dbe45fa72">his pay is currently front and center</a></span> at the electric car company. Musk is asking shareholders to restore a pay package that was struck down by a judge in Delaware, who said the approval process for the package was “deeply flawed.” </p><p>Companies are required to assign a value to stock awards at the time they’re granted. The award given to Musk in 2018 was valued at $2.3 billion. Even if Musk were to cash out portions of those awards — he hasn’t yet — that wouldn’t count as compensation. Musk’s pay package is now estimated to be worth around $45 billion. </p>
    

<h2>CEO pay vs workers</h2><p>Workers across the country have been winning higher pay since the pandemic, with wages and benefits for private-sector employees rising 4.1% in 2023 after a 5.1% increase in 2022, according to the Labor Department. </p><p>Even with those gains, the gap between the person in the corner office and everyone else keeps getting wider. Half the CEOs in this year’s pay survey made at least 196 times what their median employee earned. That’s up from 185 times in last year’s survey.</p>
    
        
    
<p>The gap is particularly wide at companies where employees typically earn lower wages, such as retailers. At Ross Stores, for example, the company says its employee at the very middle of the pay scale was a part-time retail store associate who made $8,618. It would take 2,100 years earning that much to equal CEO Barbara Rentler’s compensation from 2023, valued at $18.1 million. A year earlier, it would have taken the median worker 1,137 years to match the CEO’s pay.</p><p>Corporate boards often feel pressure to keep upping the pay for well-performing CEOs out of fear that they’ll walk out the door and make more at a rival. They focus on paying compensation that is competitive within their industry or marketplace and not on the pay ratio, Malafis said. The better an executive performs, the more the board is willing to pay. </p><p>The disparity between what the chief executive makes and the workers earn wasn’t always so wide. </p><p>After World War II and up until the 1980s, CEOs of large publicly traded companies made about 40 to 50 times the average worker’s pay, said Brandon Rees, deputy director of corporations and capital markets for the AFL-CIO, which runs an Executive Paywatch website that tracks CEO pay.</p><p>“The (current) pay ratio signals a sort of a winner take all culture, that companies are treating their CEOs as, you know, as superstars as opposed to, team players,” Rees said. </p><h2>Say on pay</h2><p>Despite the criticism, shareholders tend to give overwhelming support to pay packages for company leaders. From 2019 to 2023, companies typically received just under 90% of the vote for their executive compensation plans, according to data from Equilar. </p>
    
<p>Shareholders do, however, occasionally reject a compensation plan, although the votes are non-binding. In 2023, shareholders at 13 companies in the S&amp;P 500 gave the executive pay packages less than 50% support. </p><p>After its investors gave another resounding thumbs down to the pay packages for its top executives, Netflix met with many of its biggest shareholders last year to discuss their concerns. It also talked with major proxy-advisory firms, which are influential because they recommend how investors should vote at companies’ annual meetings.</p><p>Following the talks, Netflix announced several changes to redesign its pay policies. For one, it eliminated executives’ option to allocate their compensation between cash and options. It will no longer give out stock options, which can give executives a payday as long as the stock price stays above a certain level. Instead, the company will give restricted stock that executives can profit from only after a certain amount of time or after certain performance measures are met.</p><p>The changes will take effect in 2024. For last year, co-CEO Ted Sarandos received options valued at $28.3 million and a cash bonus of $16.5 million. Co-CEO Greg Peters received options valued at $22.7 million and a cash bonus of $13.9 million. </p><p>Anderson, of the Institute for Policy Studies, said Say on Pay votes are important because they “shine a spotlight on some of the most egregious cases of executive access, and it can lead to negotiations over pay and other issues that shareholders might want to raise with corporate leadership.” </p><p>“But I think the impact, certainly on the overall size of CEO packages has not had much effect in some cases,” she said.</p><h2>Female CEOs</h2><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/female-women-pay-ceo-equity-inclusion-d482ceb56cd0194d1129083852ce7bde">More women made the AP survey</a></span> than in previous years, but their numbers in the corner office are still minuscule compared to their male counterparts. Of the 341 CEOs included in Equilar’s data, 25 were women. </p><p>Lisa Su, CEO and chair of the board of chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, was the highest paid female CEO in the AP survey for the fifth year in a row in fiscal 2023, bringing in compensation valued at $30.3 million — flat with her compensation package in 2022. Her overall rank rose to 21 from 25.</p><p>The other top paid female CEOs include Mary Barra of automaker General Motors ($27.8 million); Jane Fraser of banking giant Citigroup ($25.5 million); Kathy Warden of aerospace and defense company Northrop Grumman Corp. ($23.5 million); and Carol Tome of package deliverer UPS Inc. ($23.4 million).</p><p>The median pay package for female CEOs rose 21% to $17.6 million. That’s better than their male counterparts fared: Their median pay package rose 12.2% to $16.3 million.</p><p>—</p><p>Ortutay reported from San Francisco.

            Coke is the leader by a comfortable margin. Last year, it captured 19.2% of the soda market in the United States by volume, Beverage Digest’s data shows.

            While “Dr Pepper has been gaining, [Pepsi] has been declining, and they’re meeting in the middle,” said Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest, in an interview with CNN.

            Over the years, the peppery soda — with its claimed blend of 23 flavors — has been growing in popularity, leaning into its identity as a spicy alternative to cola and taking advantage of broader trends.

            Founded in 1885 in Waco, Texas, Dr Pepper preceded both Coca-Cola and Pepsi. And while the two cola giants battled it out in the 20th century, Dr Pepper established a small but devoted following in the American South.

            Today, Dr Pepper is experimenting with new flavors. The brand introduced Dr Pepper Strawberries &amp; Cream last year. The addition was “a standout success,” Timothy Cofer, CEO of Dr Pepper parent company Keurig Dr Pepper, said during an analyst call in April. The brand has also rolled out trendy limited-time flavors, like Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut, inspired by TikTok’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/business/dirty-soda-pepsi/index.html">dirty soda</a> trend (mixing soda with milk or cream and other flavors).

            But the brand doesn’t have to do too much to be on trend. “Swicy,” or sweet and spicy, items are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/02/business/spicy-snack-foods-drinks-trend-swicy/index.html">taking over the food and beverage aisle</a>. Even Coca-Cola wants in: The company <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/07/food/coca-cola-spiced-launch/index.html">in February introduced Coca-Cola Spiced</a>, a rare permanent addition to the lineup of Coke flavors.

            Pepsi, on the other hand, may have been too focused on its other brands. Unlike Coca-Cola and Keurig Dr Pepper, Pepsico has a massive food business — its sprawling portfolio includes Quaker, Frito-Lay and more. And when it comes to beverages, Stanford noted, it seems to be focused on its zero sugar lines rather than classic Pepsi.
    </p>

<p>I believe that Elon Musk’s compensation package will haunt Tesla for years as lawsuits are already piling up. </p>



<p>Everyone is pointing fingers at who they think is responsible for this situation. Here’s my take.</p>



<span id="more-365896"></span>



<p>We are less than two weeks away from Tesla’s annual shareholders meeting during which we will know the results of the shareholder vote on Musk’s compensation package and incorporation move to Texas.</p>



<p>Many shareholders falsely believe that the issue will end there. </p>



<p>Shareholders will vote either for or against these two proposals. The truth is that not much will change after June 13th.</p>



<p>If shareholders vote yes again on the package, at best, it will be used as evidence that shareholders still support the deal for the appeal process in the case, which is still months away.</p>



<p>As for the incorporation move to Texas, many shareholders believe that this would allow Tesla to circumvent the judge’s decision in Delaware. However, Tesla and the judge recently had communications over that concern, and <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/29/tesla-reassures-judge-move-texas-wont-affect-elon-compensation-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla reassured the judge that they will continue to litigate the case in its proper jurisdiction</a>: Delaware.</p>



<p>The next step is a hearing over the compensation that the lawyers for the shareholder who sued Musk and Tesla are asking for, which is a ridiculous $6 billion.</p>



<p>The compensation will likely be greatly reduced by the judge, but they will likely still get a nice payday, and the vultures are already circling to get more.</p>



<p>A new lawsuit was filed last week against Musk and Tesla directors over alleged insider trading by the CEO and breach of fiduciary duty by board members.</p>



<p>Regardless of the results of the votes later this month, Tesla will likely face other lawsuits regarding its corporate governance, which is being increasingly exposed by Tesla and Musk’s reaction to the judge’s decision over his compensation package.</p>



<p>For example, Musk has <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/20/elon-musk-confirms-threat-give-me-25-of-tesla-or-no-ai-robotics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatened not to work on AI products at Tesla</a> if he doesn’t get 25% control over the company despite saying that Tesla is worthless without AI.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>I think I managed to distill my thoughts on Elon’s compensation package at Tesla into something a little clearer. I have been reporting on this for months, and I’m tired of it, but unfortunately, I think it will be a story for months, if not years, to come</p>



<p>Like many Tesla shareholders, I wasn’t happy about Elon selling shares from his previous CEO compensation package to buy Twitter.</p>



<p>But I understand that it is his right to do so.</p>



<p>He can do what he wants with his money, but he did lose credibility in my eyes because I remember him saying this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-03-at-4.10.48%E2%80%AFPM.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-365933"></figure>



<p>He got a lot of people to believe in Tesla through commitments like this and then he broke it to buy Twitter of all things.</p>



<p>But Fred, that’s old.</p>



<p>OK, he also said this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-03-at-4.15.32%E2%80%AFPM.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-365934"></figure>



<p>And then sold billions of dollars worth of Tesla shares in the following months.</p>



<p>All good. It’s not great for his credibility, but again, his money.</p>



<p>Now, what about this new 2018 compensation plan?</p>



<p>Do I really believe Elon is looking for 25% control of Tesla because he is scared of what Tesla’s AI will do if he has less control? No. I don’t buy that for a second.</p>



<p>Am I worried that he will dump his shares in a very poorly planned manner like he did the first time? Yes, I am.</p>



<p>But once again, it is his money, sort of, and he can do whatever he wants with it. I think he did incredible work at Tesla, especially between 2018 and 2021. He deserves it.</p>



<p>However, I can believe all that and still understand why Judge McCormick had to invalidate the package in her decision.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that this litigation started because lawyers saw an opportunity to make money. They enlisted a willing Tesla shareholder with just 9 shares. But you have to ask yourself, why was there an opportunity?</p>



<p>And that’s because of Elon and Tesla’s board. They saw that Tesla’s board presented the package as being negotiated between independent board members and Elon. They looked into those directors and saw that they were anything but independent.</p>



<p>The only board member on the compensation committee who could have been described as independent would have been Robin Denholm. She became Tesla’s chairwoman after Musk had to give up the seat as part of a settlement with the SEC over his botched attempt to take Tesla private, but she was also getting a juicy compensation package worth tens of millions of dollars for a job that Elon himself said was worthless.</p>



<p>Suspicious. </p>



<p>The lawyers made a bet that, based on this situation, they would find a lot more problems with how this historic compensation package came about, and they were right.</p>



<p>They found problems like the board not negotiating the package beyond aligning the tranches with Tesla’s own projections, Elon’s point person on the package being his own divorce lawyer who was also Tesla’s general counsel at the time—blurring the lines as to who he was actually working for, and more.</p>



<p>These are all things that could have affected shareholders’ decisions on whether to vote for or against the package. The judge had to rescind it.</p>



<p>But instead of addressing the governance issues highlighted by the judge and that led to this situation in the first place, Tesla, evidently led by Elon, decided to push a narrative that there’s no issue and that the only reason we shareholders are in this situation is that a politically motivated judge decided to take away our right to decide for ourselves what Elon should get for compensation.</p>



<p>Massive claims like that need strong evidence and as far as I can tell, there’s no strong evidence that the judge did anything other than follow the law. The only thing I’ve seen posted by Elon and his fans is the fact that the judge used to work for a firm that represented President Biden in the past,  but it was one of the biggest firms in Delaware, which is where Biden is from so it’s not surprising and doesn’t prove any wrongdoing.</p>



<p>This narrative about the situation being politically motivated is simply an attempt to ignore and divert attention from Tesla’s governance issues.</p>



<p>At this point, I think Tesla and its shareholders would be way better off addressing these issues, going back to the drawing table on a compensation deal that is negotiated in good faith, and then going back to shareholders for a vote.</p>




	<p>I even think that the deal could be the same amount minus all the costs that Tesla incurred related to this issue, like the legal costs and all the advertising that the company is spending on this vote.</p>



<p>The alternative is, more likely than not, years of costly litigation and this dark cloud over Tesla.</p>



<p>But a big part of the problem is that it doesn’t seem that Elon is interested in establishing proper governance at Tesla because he is not well suited to be an officer in a public company. That’s partly why he tried to take Tesla private – poorly, I might add.</p>



<p>Based on the rumors he is choosing not to deny, he seems to be happy leaving this choice to shareholders: proper corporate governance at Tesla or Elon. You can’t have both.</p>
