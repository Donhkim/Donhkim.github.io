    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) crossed 40,000 for the first time ever, closing just shy of that level, driven by solid earnings and a slight easing of consumer inflation.</li>
<li>The DJIA has gained about 6% this year, with Walmart's strong quarter helping propel gains on Thursday. The retail giant's stock rose 6.95% on the day.</li>
<li>Investors are betting that inflation may cool enough for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at least twice this year, according to the CME's FedWatch Tool.</li>
<li>Goldman Sachs has added the most points since 30,000, while 3M Co. has subtracted the most, as tracked by Dow Jones Market Data Group.</li>
<li>The April inflation report was a mixed bag, with some economists expecting the Fed to cut interest rates in response to the easing of inflationary pressures.</li>

<p>Brussels has opened an in-depth probe into Meta over concerns it is failing to do enough to protect children from becoming addicted to social media platforms such as Instagram.</p>
<p>The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, announced on Thursday it would look into whether the Silicon Valley giant’s apps were reinforcing “rabbit hole” effects, where users get drawn ever deeper into online feeds and topics.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>EU investigators will also look into whether Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, is complying with legal obligations to provide appropriate age-verification tools to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content.</p>
<p>The probe is the second into the company under the EU’s Digital Services Act. The landmark legislation is designed to police content online, with sweeping new rules on the protection of minors.</p>
<p>It also has mechanisms to force Internet platforms to reveal how they are tackling misinformation and propaganda.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/07/landmark-eu-rules-will-finally-put-regulation-of-big-tech-to-the-test/">The DSA</a>, which was approved last year, imposes new obligations on very large online platforms with more than 45 million users in the EU. If Meta is found to have broken the law, Brussels can impose fines of up to 6 percent of a company’s global annual turnover.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Repeat offenders can even face bans in the single market as an extreme measure to enforce the rules.</p>
<p>Thierry Breton, commissioner for internal market, said the EU was “not convinced” that Meta “has done enough to comply with the DSA obligations to mitigate the risks of negative effects to the physical and mental health of young Europeans on its platforms Facebook and Instagram.”</p>
<p>“We are sparing no effort to protect our children,” Breton added.</p>
<p>Meta said: “We want young people to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online and have spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies designed to protect them. This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission.”</p>
<p>In the investigation, the commission said it would focus on whether Meta’s platforms were putting in place “appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure a high level of privacy, safety, and security for minors.” It added that it was placing special emphasis on default privacy settings for children.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/meta-to-face-eu-probe-for-not-doing-enough-to-stop-russian-disinformation/">the EU opened the first probe into Meta under the DSA</a> over worries the social media giant is not properly curbing disinformation from Russia and other countries.</p>
<p>Brussels is especially concerned whether the social media company’s platforms are properly moderating content from Russian sources that may try to destabilize upcoming elections across Europe.</p>
<p>Meta defended its moderating practices and said it had appropriate systems in place to stop the spread of disinformation on its platforms.</p>

<p>WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) — Spirit AeroSystems is notifying its Wichita workforce that layoffs are coming. In an internal memo a worker shared with KSN, the company said it has “made the difficult decision” to reduce the hourly production workforce “by approximately 400-450 employees.”</p>



<p>A Spirit spokesperson would not release the numbers.</p>



<p>“The recent slowdown in the delivery rate on commercial programs compels a reduction to our workforce in Wichita,” Joe Buccino said. “In the coming weeks, we will inform affected employees. We are committed to implementing this transition in as compassionate a manner as possible.”</p>



<p>The internal memo is addressed to the Wichita hourly production teams. It also says the layoffs are due to high inventory levels.</p>



<p>“We must slow down our operations to align our workforce with the needs of our customers,” the message says.</p>



<p>Workers who are affected may not know right away. Managers will contact workers in the coming weeks to provide specific instructions on the exit process.</p>





<p>“These decisions are difficult and sensitive. We sincerely appreciate your contributions and thank you for your understanding and resilience during this period of adjustment,” the company said.</p>



<p>KSN reached out to the Local Lodge 839 Machinist Union. At this time, they do not know how many union employees will be affected by these layoffs.</p>





<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Local leaders react</h2>



<p>Wichita Mayor Lily Wu said the focus now needs to be on the workers.</p>



<p>“Our community needs to come together to help support a lot of families and employees who will be affected by this; I also know as a community, we are rallying behind job opportunities,” said Mayor Wu.</p>





<p>Sedgwick County Commissioner Jim Howell said Wichita has seen an aviation roller-coaster for decades but says Spirit has been an extremely stable employer, not seeing a layoff like this in quite some time. He says it is a challenging day for those employees getting the news that they will be laid off by Spirit.</p>



<p>“Very difficult news today to hear this. This community will have an impact because every one of these jobs has three to four, maybe even some cases, five jobs in the community that are impacted by the flowing of those dollars through the economy, so it’s going to have a ripple effect,” said Howell.</p>



<p>He says while laid-off employees have other options locally like Textron Aviation offering similar positions in metal work and small parts fabrication, Wichita may lose a good portion of these workers to other states like California, North Carolina, and Georgia.</p>



<p>Howell remains confident this move will not be detrimental long term for aviation in Sedgwick county.</p>





<p>“It certainly is bad news, but I do have faith in Boeing, I do have faith in Spirit AeroSystems, I certainly have faith in these employees; at the end of the day, these problems will get worked out, and I think there’s brighter news ahead,” said Howell.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>



<p>Earlier this month, Spirit released its <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spiritaero.com/pages/release/spirit-aerosystems-reports-first-quarter-2024-results/" target="_blank">first quarter financial results</a> — <a href="https://www.ksn.com/business/press-releases/cision/20240507CG06630/spirit-aerosystems-reports-first-quarter-2024-results/">a loss of $616.7 million in the first quarter</a>.</p>





<p>At the time, Spirit President and CEO Pat Shanahan said several factors were hurting the company’s finances, including a slowdown in production after a door plug blew out on an <a href="https://www.ksn.com/news/alaska-airlines-flight-makes-emergency-landing-in-portland-after-window-blew-out/">Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 in January. The plane was forced to make an emergency landing</a>.</p>



<p>Boeing slowed 737 production below 38 a month in order to add quality and safety measures. Shanahan said Spirit will produce about 31 a month for the rest of the year. He also said a slowdown did not necessarily mean the number of employees would drop.</p>





<p>“Our teammates aren’t 100% variable with rate,” Shanahan said. “It doesn’t make sense to go up and down and have people go in and out the door. We’ve invested a lot in their training.”</p>



<p>Of the 21,000 employees Spirit has worldwide, 12,500 work at its Wichita plant.</p>



<p>During his comments on May 7, Shanahan said the company is trying to find the right balance and warned that Spirit would have to make some decisions in the next couple of weeks.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Visa announces major changes to credit and debit cards</strong>: Visa is introducing new features that will allow consumers to carry fewer physical cards and make it less relevant to print the 16-digit credit or debit card number on every card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>One physical payment card for multiple bank accounts</strong>: Visa will allow banks to issue one physical payment card that is connected to multiple bank accounts, eliminating the need to carry multiple cards for different accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting criteria for purchases</strong>: Consumers will be able to set criteria with their bank, such as having all purchases below $100 or with a certain merchant applied to the debit card, while other purchases go on the credit card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buy now, pay later companies and peer-to-peer payment options</strong>: The rise of buy now, pay later companies, peer-to-peer payment options, and digital payment systems like Apple Pay has led to less need for physical cards and more reliance on digital transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visa's new features address online payment fraud</strong>: Visa's new features are aimed at combating online payment fraud, which is increasing with the rise of digital payments. The company estimates that payment fraud happens roughly seven times more often online than it does in person.</p>

    <div><div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC bOdfO " data-testid="prism-article-body"><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC"><span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB">NEW YORK -- </span>Your wallet may soon be getting thinner.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Visa announced major changes to how credit and debit cards will operate in the U.S. in the coming months and years.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The new features could mean Americans will be carrying fewer physical cards in their wallets and will make the 16-digit credit or debit card number printed on every card increasingly irrelevant.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">They will be some of the biggest changes to how payments operate in the U.S. since the U.S. rolled out chip-embedded cards several years ago. They also come as Americans have many more options to pay for purchases beyond "credit or debit," including buy now, pay later companies, peer-to-peer payment options, paying directly with a bank, or digital payment systems like Apple Pay.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"I think (with these features) we're getting past the point where consumers may never need to manually enter an account number ever again," said Mark Nelsen, Visa's global head of consumer payments, in an interview.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The biggest change coming for Americans will be the ability for banks to issue one physical payment card that will be connected to multiple bank accounts. That means no more carrying, for example, a Bank of America or Chase debit card as well as their respective credit cards in a physical wallet. Americans will be able to set criteria with their bank - such as having all purchases below $100 or with a certain merchant applied to the debit card, while other purchases go on the credit card.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The feature, already being used in Asia, will be available this summer. Buy now, pay later company Affirm is the first of Visa's customers to roll out the feature in the U.S.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Some of Visa's new features are in response to online payment fraud, which continues to increase as more countries adopt digital payments. The San Francisco-based company estimates that payment fraud happens roughly seven times more often online than it does in person, and there are now billions of stolen credit and debit card numbers available to criminals.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Other new elements are also in response to features that non-payment companies have rolled out in recent years. The Apple Card, which uses Mastercard as its payment network, does not come with a printed 16-digit account number and Apple Card users can request a fresh credit card number at any time without having to dispose of the physical card.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Visa executives see a future where banks will issue cards where the 16-digit account number, if the new cards come with them, is largely symbolic.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Among the other updates unveiled by Visa are changes to tap-to-pay features. Americans will be able to tap their credit or debit cards to their smartphones to add the card to mobile wallets, instead of using a smartphone's camera to scan in a card's information, or tap the card to their smartphones to approve a transaction online. Visa will also start implementing biometrics to approve transactions, similar to how Apple devices use a fingerprint or face scan to approve transactions.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN">The features will take time to filter down to the banks, which will decide when or what to implement for their customers. But since the banks and credit card companies are Visa's customers, and issue cards with the Visa label, these are features that the financial institutions have been asking for.</p></div><p class="copyright">Copyright © 2024 by The Associated Press.

The average 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate is 7.13% today, down -0.05% over the last week. The average rate for a 15-year fixed mortgage is 6.57%, which is an increase of 0.03% compared to a week ago. For a look at mortgage rate movement, see the chart below.</p>

<h2 id="which-mortgage-term-and-type-should-i-pick-">Which mortgage term and type should I pick? </h2>
<p>
Each mortgage has a loan term, or payment schedule. The most common mortgage terms are 15 and 30 years, although 10-, 20- and 40-year mortgages also exist. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate is set for the duration of the loan, offering stability. With an adjustable-rate mortgage, the interest rate is only fixed for a certain amount of time (commonly five, seven or 10 years), after which the rate adjusts annually based on the market. Fixed-rate mortgages are a better option if you plan to live in a home in the long term, but adjustable-rate mortgages may offer lower interest rates upfront.</p>
<h3>30-year fixed-rate mortgages</h3>
<p>
The 30-year fixed-mortgage rate average is 7.13% today. A 30-year fixed mortgage is the most common loan term. It will often have a higher interest rate than a 15-year mortgage, but you’ll have a lower monthly payment.</p>
<h3>15-year fixed-rate mortgages</h3>
<p>
Today, the average rate for a 15-year, fixed mortgage is 6.57%. Though you’ll have a bigger monthly payment than a 30-year fixed mortgage, a 15-year loan usually comes with a lower interest rate, allowing you to pay less interest in the long run and pay off your mortgage sooner.</p>
<h3>5/1 adjustable-rate mortgages</h3>
<p>
A 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage has an average rate of 6.58% today. You’ll typically get a lower introductory interest rate with a 5/1 ARM in the first five years of the mortgage. But you could pay more after that period, depending on how the rate adjusts annually. If you plan to sell or refinance your house within five years, an ARM could be a good option.</p>
<h2 id="whats-behind-todays-high-mortgage-rates-">What’s behind today’s high mortgage rates? </h2>
<p>
Over the last few years, high inflation and the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes pushed up mortgage rates from their record lows around the pandemic. Since last summer, the Fed has <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-rate-predictions-march-fed-meeting/">consistently kept the federal funds rate at 5.25% to 5.5%</a>. Though the central bank <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/how-the-federal-reserve-affects-mortgage-rates/">doesn’t directly set the rates for mortgages</a>, a high federal funds rate makes borrowing more expensive, including for home loans.</p>
<p class="ad-wrapper js-incontent-ad" id="native-mpu-middle"></p><p>
Mortgage rates change daily, but average rates have been moving between 6.5% and 7.5% since late last fall. Today’s homebuyers have less room in their budget to afford the cost of a home due to elevated mortgage rates and steep home prices. <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/how-a-housing-shortage-is-driving-up-home-prices/">Limited housing inventory</a> and low wage growth are also contributing to the <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/how-an-unaffordable-housing-market-leaves-the-next-generation-out-in-the-cold/">affordability crisis</a> and keeping mortgage demand down.</p>
<h2 id="will-mortgage-rates-drop-this-year">Will mortgage rates drop this year?</h2>
<p>
Most housing market experts predict <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-forecast-february-2024/">rates will end the year between 6% and 6.5%</a>. Ultimately, a more affordable mortgage market will depend on how quickly the Fed begins cutting interest rates. The central bank could start lowering interest rates in the fall, but it will depend on how the economy fares in the coming months.</p>
<p>
Mortgage rates fluctuate for many reasons: supply, demand, <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-predictions-inflation-data-mortgage-rates/">inflation</a>, monetary policy, <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-rate-predictions-labor-data/">jobs data</a> and market expectations. Homebuyers won’t see lower rates overnight, and it’s unlikely there will ever be a return to the <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-predictions-the-new-normal-for-mortgage-rates/">2-3% mortgage rates</a> we saw between 2000 and early 2022.</p>
<p>
“We are expecting mortgage rates to fall to around 6.5% by the end of this year, but there’s still a lot of volatility I think we might see,” said <a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/author/darylfairweather/">Daryl Fairweather</a>, chief economist at Redfin.</p>
<p>
Every month brings a new set of <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-predictions-inflation-data-mortgage-rates/">inflation</a> and <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-rate-predictions-labor-data/">labor data</a> that can influence the direction of mortgage rates, said <a href="https://www.firstam.com/economics/odeta-kushi/">Odeta Kushi</a>, deputy chief economist at First American Financial Corporation. “Ongoing inflation deceleration, a slowing economy and even geopolitical uncertainty can contribute to lower mortgage rates. On the other hand, data that signals upside risk to inflation may result in higher rates,” Kushi said.</p>
<p>
Here’s a look at where some major housing authorities expect average mortgage rates to land.</p>

Getting a mortgage should always depend on your financial situation and long-term goals. The most important thing is to make a budget and try to stay within your means. <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-payment-calculator/">CNET’s mortgage calculator</a> below can help homebuyers prepare for monthly mortgage payments.</p>

<p class="ad-wrapper js-incontent-ad" id="native-mpu-middle2"></p><p>
Though mortgage rates and home prices are high, the housing market won’t be unaffordable forever. It’s always a good time to save for a down payment and improve your credit score to help you secure a competitive mortgage rate when the time is right.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Save for a bigger down payment:</b> Though a 20% down payment isn’t required, a larger upfront payment means taking out a smaller mortgage, which will help you save in interest.</li>
<li><b>Boost your credit score:</b> You can qualify for a conventional mortgage with a 620 credit score, but a higher score of at least 740 will get you better rates.</li>
<li><b>Pay off debt:</b> Experts recommend a debt-to-income ratio of 36% or less to help you qualify for the best rates. Not carrying other debt will put you in a better position to handle your monthly payments.</li>
<li><b>Research loans and assistance:</b> Government-sponsored loans have more flexible borrowing requirements than conventional loans. Some government-sponsored or private programs can also help with your down payment and closing costs.</li>
<li><b>Shop around for lenders:</b> Researching and comparing multiple loan offers from different lenders can help you secure the lowest mortgage rate for your situation.</li>

The indictment claims that the Peraire-Bueno brothers “carefully planned and executed” the attack, beginning sometime in December 2022.

The brothers’ online search history in the weeks following the alleged theft included “top crypto lawyers,” “how long is us statue [sic] of limitations,” “fraudulent Ethereum access database,” and “money laundering statue [sic] of limitations.” Charging documents claim one victim and their lawyer repeatedly contacted the Peraire-Bueno brothers between April and June of 2023, as did a representative from Ethereum. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">If convicted, each faces up to 20 years in prison for each of the three counts, according to the DOJ.</p></div></div>

after an explosion was reported at 2:30 p.m. at the campus in north Phoenix.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>California has relied on gas taxes to fund road repairs, but with the rise of electric and hybrid vehicles, the state is looking for alternative funding sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state's gas tax generates approximately 80% of highway and road repair funding, but this source of income may dwindle as electric and hybrid vehicles become more popular.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To replace the gas tax income, the state is piloting a per-mile fee program called Road Charge, which would charge drivers based on the distance they drive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligible participants in the pilot program will drive as they normally would, pay a Road Charge fee online, and complete two surveys, for which they will receive up to $400.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pilot program aims to test a fair and sustainable way to fund road repairs, as the program will take into account the actual mileage driven by participants, with those who drive more paying more and vice versa.</p>

<p>For decades, <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/" data-type="link" data-id="https://ktla.com/news/california/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California </a>has depended on taxes from gasoline and diesel to provide most of the money for road repairs, but as the state pivots more towards electric and hybrid vehicles, officials are trying to figure out how to replace that income.</p>



<p>Road improvements are mainly financed through the state’s high excise tax on fuels. Approximately 80% of highway and road repairs are funded by a tax on gasoline charged at the pump when you buy gas.</p>





<p>On average, Californians pay $300 a year in state gas taxes, according to the <a href="https://caroadcharge.com/about/" data-type="link" data-id="https://caroadcharge.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Department of Transportation.</a></p>



<p>The state is offering drivers up to $400 to test a per-mile fee, known as <a href="https://caroadcharge.com/media/zehd2y5s/ca-sb-339_public-fact-sheet_final_remediated.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://caroadcharge.com/media/zehd2y5s/ca-sb-339_public-fact-sheet_final_remediated.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Road Charge,</a> which officials hope would be a fair and sustainable way to replace the current gas tax.</p>



<p><strong>Here’s how the study will work:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Those interested in the study can sign up online until June</li>



<li>In July, participants throughout the state will be selected</li>



<li>From August until January 2025, participants would drive as they usually would and pay their Road Charge payments online</li>



<li>Participants would also complete two surveys throughout the six months</li>



<li>Once all the required activities are completed, participants will receive up to $400. An initial payment of $100 would be distributed in September, while $300 would be distributed in February 2025.</li>



<li>Participants may also receive a gas tax or electric vehicle registration fee credit at the end of the pilot program</li>
</ul>





<p>Essentially, the more someone drives, the more they would pay for highway and road repairs and vice versa, according to the Road Charge website.</p>

                                        <p>FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) — An Indiana judge who declared that “tacos and burritos are Mexican-style sandwiches” has cleared the way for the opening of a new restaurant, delighting a restauranteur following a legal battle.</p><p>Martin Quintana, 53, has been trying for about three years to open his second The Famous Taco location in Fort Wayne, a city about 120 miles (190 kilometers) northeast of Indianapolis.</p><p>But the initial written commitment for the development at a plaza Quintana owns limits the business to “a sandwich bar-style restaurant whose primary business is to sell ‘made-to-order’ or ‘subway-style’ sandwiches.”</p><p>Quintana said the nearby Covington Creek Association contacted him to say that his The Famous Taco proposal “somehow ran afoul” to that commitment.</p><p>He sued the Fort Wayne Plan Commission in December 2022 after it denied his proposed amendment that would specifically allow his restaurant to offer made-to-order tacos, burritos and other Mexican-style food items, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.journalgazette.net/local/courts/allen-county-judge-rules-that-developer-can-open-famous-taco-in-southwest-fort-wayne/article_375e0948-1194-11ef-a000-43b34bac5019.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Journal Gazette</a></span> reported.</p>
    

<p>Allen Superior Court Judge Craig Bobay ruled Monday that the plan commission acted correctly when it denied Quintan’s proposed amendment. But the judge also found that his request was not needed and he found that the original commitment allows restaurants like the proposed The Famous Taco.</p>



<p>“The Court agrees with Quintana that tacos and burritos are Mexican-style sandwiches, and the original Written Commitment does not restrict potential restaurants to only American cuisine-style sandwiches,” Bobay wrote.</p>
    
<p>Quintana said Thursday he is relieved the legal fight is over, and he is looking forward to opening his second The Famous Taco restaurant in Fort Wayne, which is Indiana’s second-most populous city with about 270,000 residents.</p><p>“I’m glad this thing is over. We are happy. When you have a decision like this the only thing you can be is happy. We’re excited,” he told The Associated Press.</p>
    

<p>Quintana said he came to the U.S. from Mexico in 1988, working first as a farm worker in California picking grapes, olives and kiwi fruit before entering the restaurant business in Michigan before moving to Chicago and finally Fort Wayne in 2001. He also operates a second restaurant in the city.</p><p>Quintana said his new family-owned The Famous Taco restaurant should open in two or three months. He said that like his other The Famous Taco location that opened nearly seven years ago, customers will be able choose their favored toppings for tacos, burritos or tortas assembled by eatery staff.</p><p>“You know, that’s a sandwich, that’s bread. That’s a sandwich,” he said of tortas. “We go through a lot of those.”</p>

But the Chicago-based burger giant said last month that it was planning to step up deals to combat slowing customer traffic in some markets. </p><p>“We know how much it means to our customers when McDonald’s offers meaningful value and communicates it through national advertising,” McDonald’s said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
    

<p>The meal deal would be a substantial discount from the list prices for the items that will be included in the limited-time deal. One McDonald’s location in Michigan charged $9.66 for the four items sold individually on Thursday.</p>



<p>Fast food prices have risen dramatically in the last few years due to a variety of factors, including elevated costs for labor, food and paper products. Between the first quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2024, the amount spent per person per visit at a U.S. fast food restaurant rose 25%, from $12 to $15, according to Technomic, a restaurant data firm.</p>
    
<p>McDonald’s said <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mcdonalds-sales-fourth-quarter-war-ba0e590fee097ff0b145b2e11192ccf0">earlier this year</a></span> that it was seeing fewer U.S. visits and lower spending from customers earning less than $45,000 per year. </p><p>As grocery inflation has slowed, more people are choosing to eat at home, McDonald’s President and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mcdonalds-chairman-ceo-kempczinksi-hsu-24d5702517660dc1635f60d13fb96702">CEO Chris Kempczinski</a></span> said. In the first quarter, the company said fast food traffic was flat or down in many key markets, including the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom.</p>
    

<p>“The consumer is certainly being very discriminating in how they spend their dollar,” Kempczinski said during a conference call with investors. “It may be more pronounced with lower-income consumers, but its important to recognize that all income cohorts are seeking value.”</p><p>During the same call, Kempczinski said McDonald’s needed a nationwide deal emphasizing its value if it wanted to keep up with rivals.</p><p>Other chains have also reported slowing sales. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/starbucks-earnings-ede9a1b6f756ba5b5b11bae90444df23">Starbucks said last month</a></span> that it was seeing a sharper and faster decline in U.S. consumer confidence than it had anticipated in the January-March period.
