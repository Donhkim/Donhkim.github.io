<li>Delta Air Lines is changing its employee uniform policy to ban employees from wearing pins representing any country or nationality besides the United States, following a social media uproar over two flight attendants photographed wearing Palestinian pins.</li>
<li>The policy change is intended to ensure a "safe, comfortable, and welcoming environment for all" and reflects the ongoing tensions surrounding the Israel-Hamas war.</li>

                                        <p>ATLANTA (AP) — Delta Air Lines is changing its employee uniform policy following a turbulent ride through a social media storm started by a passenger’s outrage over two flight attendants photographed wearing Palestinian pins.</p><p>The uproar over the July 10 post, which described the Palestinian pins as “Hamas badges,” led Delta to ban its employees from wearing pins representing any country or nationality besides the U.S. The rule will take effect Monday.</p><p>“We are proud of our diverse base of employees and customers and the foundation of our brand, which is to connect the world and provide a premium experience,” the Atlanta-based airline said in a statement “We are taking this step to help ensure a safe, comfortable and welcoming environment for all.”</p><p>Delta’s policy shift reflects the ongoing tensions surrounding the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">Israel-Hamas war,</a></span> which has triggered high-profile protests that, among other things, have roiled college campuses.</p>
    

<p>Both attendants captured in the post objecting to the Palestinian pins were in compliance with Delta’s previous policy giving employees more flexibility with uniform accessories. </p>



<p>Before Delta announced its new policy, one of its employees escalated the flag pin flap by posting a reply asserting the attendants wearing the Palestinian pins were violating company rules and sympathized with passengers who might be “terrified” by it. That post has since been deleted but was captured in a screenshot shared by the American Muslim rights group CAIR National.</p><p>Delta said the employee responsible for that post had been removed from handling its social media communications <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://x.com/Delta/status/1811471772367077668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a post</a></span> that also included an apology.</p>

For its part, AT&amp;T explained that the delayed disclosure was a result of its ongoing collaboration with law enforcement during their investigation into the breach.

The breach underscores the ongoing challenges in securing sensitive data stored in cloud environments and the need for robust cybersecurity measures.</p><p>As investigations continue and more details emerge, this incident serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threats to data security in our increasingly connected world.

Here are some steps that you can follow:</p><h3><strong>1. Change your passwords</strong></h3><p>If hackers have recorded your passwords, they could access your online accounts and steal your data or money. ON ANOTHER DEVICE (i.e., your laptop or desktop), you should change your passwords for all your important accounts, such as email, banking, social media, etc. You want to do this on another device so that the hacker isn’t recording you setting up your new password on your hacked device. And you should also use strong and unique passwords that are hard to guess or crack. You can also use a <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/best-password-managers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>password manager</u></a> to generate and store your passwords securely.</p><h3><strong>2. Enable two-factor authentication</strong></h3><p>You’ll want to activate <a href="https://cyberguy.com/how-to/what-is-two-factor-authentication-and-why-should-i-enable-it/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>two-factor authentication</u></a> for an extra layer of security.</p><h3><strong>3. Monitor your accounts and transactions</strong></h3><p>You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</strong></a></p><h3><strong>4. Contact your bank and credit card companies</strong></h3><p>If hackers have obtained your bank or credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you.</p><p>You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification. You can even freeze your credit, if need be.</p><h3><strong>5. Invest in personal data removal services</strong></h3><p>While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is invaluable, especially after a data breach. These services can help you mitigate the potential damage by ensuring your compromised information is continuously monitored and systematically removed from hundreds of sites. This ongoing process reduces the risk of identity theft, fraud, and other malicious activities, providing an additional layer of security and peace of mind. <a href="https://cyberguy.com/privacy/best-services-for-removing-your-personal-information-from-the-internet/"><u>Remove your personal data from the internet with my top picks here.</u></a></p><h3><strong>6. Use identity theft protection</strong></h3><p>Identity Theft protection companies can monitor personal information like your home title, Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. </p><p>One of the best parts of using an identity theft protection company is that it could include identity theft insurance of up to <strong>$1 million to cover losses and legal fees</strong> and a <strong>white-glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager</strong> helps you recover any losses. <a href="https://cyberguy.com/security/best-identity-theft-protection-services/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft</u></a>.</p><h3><strong>7. Alert your contacts</strong></h3><p>If hackers have accessed your email or social media accounts, they could use them to send spam or <a href="https://cyberguy.com/privacy/how-to-prevent-phishing-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>phishing messages</u></a> to your contacts. They could also impersonate you and ask for money or personal information. You should alert your contacts and warn them not to open or respond to any messages from you that seem suspicious or unusual.</p><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/how-to/what-to-do-if-your-bank-account-is-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong><u>WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>Kurt's key takeaways</strong></h2><p>The AT&amp;T data breach is another wake-up call for consumers and corporations in our digital age. It underscores the critical need for enhanced cybersecurity measures, particularly in cloud-based systems where vast amounts of sensitive data are stored. As technology evolves, so too must our approach to data protection.

<p>The former executive, 47, negotiated<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4515/000119312524178619/d729729dex991.htm" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4515/000119312524178619/d729729dex991.htm" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci"> a separation deal</a> with the airline that allows “unlimited reserved travel in any class” for Raja and his spouse or companion and children, according to the company. He’ll also get <a href="https://exploreamerican.com/executiveplatinumstatus/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://exploreamerican.com/executiveplatinumstatus/" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">AAdvantage Executive Platinum status</a> and entry to Admirals Club lounges at his leisure. According to the program, that means free upgrades, comped food and drink, three free checked bags, and a dedicated line for flight changes and reservations. This is all on American’s dime, a spokesperson confirmed.</p>



<p>Raja, who joined the company’s predecessor airline in 2004 as an analyst, will also collect $1.4 million in payments under the terms of the agreement, plus career transition services. Raja had been American’s chief commercial officer since 2022, and<a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/6201/000119312524114008/d636721ddef14a.htm" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/6201/000119312524114008/d636721ddef14a.htm" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci"> previously served as its chief revenue officer.</a> His 2023 compensation was valued at $12.2 million, including yearly salary, cash bonus, stock, and perquisites.</p>



<p>In February 2025, the separation agreement also says Raja will be demoted to the company’s<a href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/do-airline-employees-fly-free-2356338" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.tripsavvy.com/do-airline-employees-fly-free-2356338" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci"> 65-point travel plan for retirees with a minimum of 10 years of active service</a> who pay taxes and fees for their tickets but are allowed to fly for free.</p>



<p>Raja did not respond to a message on <a href="https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">LinkedIn</a>. <a href="https://fortune.com/company/american-airlines-group/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/american-airlines-group/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">American Airlines</a> declined to comment further.</p><p></p>



<p>American announced on May 28 that Raja would depart in June and that it would search for a new chief commercial officer to replace him.<a href="https://x.com/PlaneDame/status/1795805927578194354" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/PlaneDame/status/1795805927578194354" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci"> CEO Robert Isom said at a conference the next day</a> that the company needed to improve on executing its long-range plans and attending to the marketplace.</p>



<p>“I admire his creative thinking, his passion. He’s an innovator, a disruptor. He’s a good friend. But sometimes we need a reset, and in this case, we do,” said Isom,<a href="https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/airlines-lessors/american-airlines-ceo-ndc-strategy-needs-more-carrots-less-sticks" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/airlines-lessors/american-airlines-ceo-ndc-strategy-needs-more-carrots-less-sticks" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci"> according to Aviation Week Network</a>.  </p>

<p>In conjunction with American’s May announcement that Raja was leaving,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/4515/000119312524148138/d800477d8k.htm" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/4515/000119312524148138/d800477d8k.htm" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci"> it cut its profit outlook for the year.</a> The stock price is down 20% year to date.  </p></div></div></div>

            The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has allowed the machines, telling CNN in a statement: “A federal license is not required to sell ammunition. However, commercial sales of ammunition must comply with state laws as well as any applicable federal laws.”

            “There could be a dispute, and someone got upset with someone else and instead of cooling off and having to go to the store the next day they could go to the grocery store to get ammunition and use it for the wrong reasons,” Tyner said.

<p>“The world that the government lives in, with all these numbers saying the economy is great, it’s a fantasy,” said 34-year-old taxi driver Jose Rafael in Buenos Aires. “In the real world, this economy makes it really hard to feed my son.” </p>



<p>Friday’s government report showed <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/argentina-inflation-milei-currency-cuts-peso-devaluation-beddb4f7fd0021463653af37908bcb78">Argentina’s annual inflation</a></span> slowing a bit to just over 271% — still among the highest rates in the world.</p>
    
<p>Surging electricity and gas prices accounted for most of June’s inflationary spike, the statistics agency said. Argentines have reported eye-watering utility bills after years of paying highly subsidized rates under left-leaning governments. </p><p>In stark contrast to Milei’s program, those <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/argentina-election-peronism-massa-milei-f5db5a92328f4316384ff6e0092c5272">past Peronist administrations</a></span> fixed prices and printed billions of dollars’ worth of pesos to fund a large deficit — fueling chronically high inflation. </p>
    

<p>Under Milei, Argentina’s energy ministry reported in June that low-income households that previously paid just 5% of the real cost of electricity have started paying a third of it while middle-income households now cover at least half following Milei’s removal of subsidies. </p><p>The government has also capped electricity consumption to qualify for subsidies, squeezing families as a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/chile-argentina-paraguay-cold-weather-e0aee88ea6475f0665283aa08cf0a313">cold front sweeps Argentina</a></span> during the Southern Hemisphere’s winter.</p><p>The country’s cost of living surged nearly 80% in the first five months of 2024 compared to the same period last year, the report also said. Prices in Buenos Aires shops and restaurants have reached levels comparable to the United States, even as the country offers just a fraction of the wages. </p><p>In another warning sign, the peso fell Friday to another record low against the dollar, hitting 1,500 on the black market and capping another week of volatility after holding steady in the first few months of the year. </p><p>The steep fall in Argentina’s currency means the closely watched gap between the black market rate and the official exchange rate, currently 919 pesos to the dollar, has widened to over 60%. That complicates Milei’s goal of eventually lifting Argentina’s strict currency controls to restore investor confidence.</p>
    

<p>Milei wants the IMF — to which Argentina already owes a staggering $44 billion — to step in with a new loan to support his plans to remove capital controls, which cause major distortions in Argentina’s economy.</p><p>But as uncertainty remains over the future of Milei’s economic program, the IMF dampened expectations of a new deal on Thursday. </p><p>“The staff will engage in discussions on a possible new arrangement as we would with any IMF member,” the fund’s spokesperson, Julie Kozack, told reporters when asked about the state of negotiations. “At this stage, there is no specific timeline for those discussions.”</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>EU Commission warns X</strong>: The European Commission has reached a preliminary view that X has breached the Digital Services Act (DSA), which requires Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) to comply with certain rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Violations of DSA rules</strong>: The Commission claims that X is failing to comply with rules covering the use of dark patterns, advertising transparency, and data access. Specifically, it alleges that X's interface design deceives users, fails to provide adequate advertising transparency, and blocks access to data for researchers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design and operation of interface</strong>: The Commission accuses X of designing and operating its interface in an unconventional way, which makes it harder for users to know whether accounts and their content are authentic. The system has allegedly been abused, making it easier for fake accounts to operate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advertising transparency issue</strong>: X is also accused of failing to provide a searchable and reliable advertisement repository, instead using design features and barriers to obscure this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EU Commissioner's statement</strong>: EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager stated that the DSA has transparency at its core and that the Commission is determined to ensure that all platforms, including X, comply with EU legislation. She emphasized that the decision is based on the company's designation as a VLOP, which has greater responsibilities and constraints than other tech firms.</p>

<p>The European Commission has warned X that it's reached the preliminary view that the company is in breach of the Digital Services Act.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p>As with the Commission's recent <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2024/06/24/apple-accused-of-unfair-competition-as-eus-digital-markets-act-bites/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2024/06/24/apple-accused-of-unfair-competition-as-eus-digital-markets-act-bites/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2024/06/24/apple-accused-of-unfair-competition-as-eus-digital-markets-act-bites/" aria-label="preliminary ruling">preliminary ruling</a> against Apple under the DSA, the decision is based on X's designation as a Very Large Online Platform, which have greater constraints and responsibilities than other tech firms.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p class="article_paragraph_2"></p>
<p>And following a lengthy investigation that included an analysis of internal company documents, interviews with experts and cooperation with national Digital Services Coordinators, the Commission says that X is failing to abide by rules covering the use of dark patterns, advertising transparency and data access.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>
<p>"Today we issue for the first time preliminary findings under the Digital Services Act. In our view, X does not comply with the DSA in key transparency areas, by using dark patterns and thus misleading users, by failing to provide an adequate ad repository, and by blocking access to data for researchers," says Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president for a Europe fit for the digital age.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p>

<p>"The DSA has transparency at its very core, and we are determined to ensure that all platforms, including X, comply with EU legislation."</p>
<p>First, says the Commission, X designs and operates its interface for verified accounts with the blue checkmark in an unconventional way that deceives users, by allowing anyone to subscribe and get verified status. This, it says, makes it harder for users to know whether accounts and their content are authentic - and, indeed, there's evidence that the system has been abused.</p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" class="inread-active" display-called=""></fbs-ad>
<p>Second, the company's failing to comply with the required transparency on advertising, as it doesn't provide a searchable and reliable advertisement repository. Instead, says the Commission, it uses design features and barriers to access that inhibit transparency, particularly when it comes to the risks from the distribution of advertising online.</p>

<p>Finally, it says, X fails to provide access to its public data to researchers as it should, barring eligible researchers from independently accessing its public data, for example by scraping, despite promising to do so in its terms of service.</p>






<p>On top of this, the process the company uses to grant eligible researchers access to its application programming interface may put researchers off carrying out their research projects, or leave them with no other choice than to pay overly-high fees.</p>


<p>"Back in the day, blue checks used to mean trustworthy sources of information. Now with X, our preliminary view is that they deceive users and infringe the DSA," says commissioner for internal market Thierry Breton.</p>
<p>"We also consider that X’s ads repository and conditions for data access by researchers are not in line with the DSA transparency requirements. X has now the right of defense—but if our view is confirmed we will impose fines and require significant changes."</p>
<p>And those fines could be considerable—up to 6% of total worldwide annual turnover. However, X now gets the chance to examine the documents in the Commission's investigation file and present its defense.</p>
<p>This is just the latest action against VLOPs from the Commission under the DSA: it also opened formal proceedings against TikTok in February and April 2024, AliExpress in March 2024, and Meta in April and May 2024.</p>
<p>X has been approached for comment but, as usual, has declined.</p>

<li><strong>Inflation rate drops to 3%</strong>: The annual inflation rate in June 2024 decreased to 3%, its lowest level since March 2021, and the monthly inflation rate contracted by 0.1% for the first time since May 2020.</li>

<li><strong>Producer inflation data doesn't alter expectations</strong>: A higher-than-expected producer inflation data report did not significantly change the expectation of interest rate cuts, as the latest consumer sentiment report confirmed subdued morale and a decline in inflation expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Value stocks and real estate outperform</strong>: The equal-weight S&amp;P 500 outperformed the cap-weighted S&amp;P 500, and value stocks outperformed growth stocks, while real estate sectors such as the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund performed well.</li>
<li><strong>Fed targets 2% inflation rate</strong>: The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is moving closer, according to the latest consumer price index data, which has fueled speculation about interest rate cuts and reductions in borrowing costs.</li>

But other big banks also joined in with their second quarter reports. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE: <a class="link " href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=WFC" data-ylk="slk:WFC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" data-rapid_p="15">WFC</a>) and Citigroup Inc (NYSE: <a class="link " href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=C" data-ylk="slk:C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" data-rapid_p="16">C</a>) also posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue. But, net interest income fell short of implications and banks showed they are expecting macroeconomic conditions to worsen.</p><h3>Wells Fargo &amp; Company</h3><p>For the second quarter, Wells Fargo reported its revenue rose to $20.69 billion, suprassing LSEG’s estimate of 20.29 billion. Net income diped to $4.91 billion, but its earnings per share of $1.33 also surpassed LSEG’s estimate of $1.29 cents. Wells Fargo recorded $11.92 billion in net interest income that fell by 9% YoY.</p><h3>Citigroup</h3><p>Citigroup reported its second quarter revenue rose 4% YoY to $20.14 billion.</p><p>Due to the revival of Wall Street activites like IPOs and mergers, Citigroup reported investment banking revenue expanded by as much as 60% to $853 million. Equities trading revenue also rose 37% to $1.5 billion. Fixed income revenue dipped 3% to $3.6 billion. Net income jumped 10% YoY to $3.22 billion.</p><p>Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser emphasized that the latest results show progress in executing the strategy and reflect the benefits of the bank’s diversified business model. But, this week Citigroup was rebuked for failing to fix as many as six of its regulatory shortfalls which will require additional explanations.</p><h3>JPMorgan Chase</h3><p>Fueled by better-than-expected investment banking fees and equities trading results, JPMorgan Chase reported revenue grew by 20%YoY to $50.99 billion. Investment banking fees alone surged 52% YoY to  $2.3 billion. Equities trading revenue jumped 21% to $3 billion</p><p>Earnings rose 25% YoY to $18.15 billion and excluding items related to the its stake in Visa, adjusted profit amounted $4.26 per share.</p><p>However, CEO Jamie Dimon warned of the complex geopolitical situation that is potentially the most dangerous since World War II, with its outcome and effect on the global economy still being unknown.</p><p>By reporting a $3.05 billion provision for credit losses, JPMorgan clearly showed it expects more defaults and therefore, rough times ahead for the US economy. But its latest quarter has reflected quite a healthy consumer, despite some weakness in the lower-income segment.</p><h3>Recap</h3><p>Wall Street deal making continued coming back to life following a two-year-long sleep. All three banks reported trading revenue went up. But stocks of all three fell as higher interest rates and elevated deposit costs shrinked consumer banking margins. Altogether, banks warned of stress among the lower income consumer segment. Banks clearly showed they are expecting worsening credit conditions by setting aside more finds for future loan losses. But the sequential drop of a key measure that is net interest income, a central driver of profit for any bank, is what really concerned investors as customers continued shifting towards higher-yielding deposit products.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="17"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p><em>DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

    <div><div class="pmc-paywall"><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The full contract terms for <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/paramount-skydance-ellison-redstone-acquire-deal-1236062041/">Skydance Media’s takeover of Paramount Global</a> were disclosed Thursday. And, as expected, there are various restrictions on what Paramount and Skydance can do without the other party’s consent in the pre-closing period.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Under the terms of the agreement, <a href="https://variety.com/t/paramount-global/" id="auto-tag_paramount-global_1" data-tag="paramount-global">Paramount Global</a> has the right to shop around for a better offer in a 45-day window. And, as previously announced, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/paramount-skydance-400-million-breakup-fee-better-offer-1236062266/">Paramount would have to pay a $400 million breakup fee to the Skydance investor group</a>.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Also detailed in the 273-page transaction agreement, disclosed in an 8-K <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000813828/000119312524177535/d860362d8k.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">filing</a>, are certain restrictions concerning Paramount+.


</p>


<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Unless it gets the written consent of Skydance, Paramount is not allowed to enter any joint venture or “omnibus content licensing and/or subscriber acquisition/migration” arrangement involving Paramount+. Per the contract terms, Paramount “shall also consult with Skydance in good faith with respect to any material developments” relating to the negotiations involving a JV arrangement for Paramount+.

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In addition, Paramount may not enter into any new contract with respect to the bundling of Paramount+ with “any of the top seven third-party streaming services (by number of U.S. subscribers)” or do such a deal “outside the ordinary course of business.” Paramount also must get approval to do a deal that would extend the term of an existing streaming distribution contract by more than one year.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	One potential streaming partner for Paramount is Warner Bros. Discovery, which is open to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/max-paramount-plus-warner-bros-discovery-streaming-joint-venture-1236058533/">exploring a combination of Max and Paramount+</a>. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“We’ve had a bunch of inbound [inquiries] from a number of people about partnerships that could involve a partnership with another player or players. And so we will evaluate all that,” according to Jeff Shell, the RedBird exec and ex-NBCUniversal CEO who is set to become president of Paramount when the deal closes. Shell, speaking on Monday’s presentation for investors, also noted that Paramount’s current management team has “come up with a plan potentially on the international business, which is likely to be executed between now and closing, which we also think will be quite compelling to the cash flow generation of the DTC segment.” </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Chris McCarthy, president and CEO, Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks, at a June 25 town hall meeting for employees <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-ceos-town-hall-layoffs-bankers-asset-sales-1236047993/">said that</a> on the international front, “we are advancing talks with potential partners that will significantly transform the scale and economics of the [streaming] service making it profitable and driving long-term value. This approach could also serve as a model for the U.S.”

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Meanwhile, there are other restrictions spelled out in the agreement. For example, as is customary, neither Skydance nor Paramount is allowed to greenlight “the production, acquisition or financing of any Property” or commit “to produce, acquire or finance any Property” without the other company’s OK. There are some exceptions to the greenlight-approval provision, but what those are remain confidential.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Under agreement with Skydance and financial backer RedBird Capital Partners, the special committee of Paramount’s board of directors has a 45-day go-shop period during which it will be permitted to “actively solicit and evaluate alternative acquisition proposals.” According to Paramount, it “does not intend to disclose developments with respect to the go-shop process unless and until it determines such disclosure is appropriate or is otherwise required.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The go-shop window expires 11:59 p.m. ET on Aug. 21, 2024. If Paramount Global is engaged in talks with a prospective bidder that the board’s special committee for M&amp;A has determined “in good faith is or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,” the company may extend the go-shop period until Sept. 5, 2024.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<a href="https://variety.com/vip/what-european-box-office-could-teach-hollywood-1236048473/"></a>The “go-shop” provision of the deal was agreed to by the Skydance team in lieu of giving Paramount Global’s nonvoting shareholders approval over the deal, and it’s seemingly intended to minimize the threat of shareholder litigation against the Paramount board and Shari Redstone’s National Amusements Inc., which owns the controlling voting stake in Paramount.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“The special committee [of Paramount’s board] has done a full and exhaustive and fair process to land the transaction with us,” David Ellison, CEO and founder of <a href="https://variety.com/t/skydance-media/" id="auto-tag_skydance-media_1" data-tag="skydance-media">Skydance Media</a>, told Paramount investors in a presentation Monday. “So we believe it’s appropriate… if anybody comes out of the woodwork to give them 45 days to see if that happens.” </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	There’s no sign yet that anyone else will come forward to snatch Paramount away from Skydance. In May, Sony Pictures and private-equity giant Apollo Global Management <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/sony-apollo-paramount-global-acquisition-offer-cash-1235981220/">emerged as prospective bidders for Paramount Global</a> but have since backed off their $26 billion all-cash offer to buy the entire company.</p>

In order for that lender to make a profit and reduce risk to itself, it will charge interest on the principal — that is, the amount you borrowed.</p><p>Expressed as a percentage, a mortgage interest rate is essentially the cost of borrowing money. It can vary based on several factors, such as your <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/credit-score-needed-for-mortgage" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>credit score</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/what-is-your-dti-ratio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>debt-to-income ratio</u></a> (DTI), <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/first-time-homebuyer-down-payment-assistance?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>down payment</u></a>, loan amount and repayment term.</p><p>After getting a mortgage, you’ll typically receive an <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/first-time-homebuyers-mortgage-amortization-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>amortization schedule</u></a>, which shows your payment schedule over the life of the loan. It also indicates how much of each payment goes toward the principal balance versus the interest.</p><p>Near the beginning of the loan term, you’ll spend more money on interest and less on the principal balance. As you approach the end of the repayment term, you’ll pay more toward the principal and less toward interest.</p><p>Your mortgage interest rate can be either fixed or adjustable. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the rate will be consistent for the duration of the loan. With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate can fluctuate with the market.</p><p>Keep in mind that a mortgage’s interest rate is not the same as its annual percentage rate (APR). This is because an APR includes both the interest rate and any other lender fees or charges.</p><p>Mortgage rates change frequently — sometimes on a daily basis. Inflation plays a significant role in these fluctuations. Interest rates tend to rise in periods of high inflation, whereas they tend to drop or remain roughly the same in times of low inflation. Other factors, like the economic climate, demand and inventory can also impact the current average mortgage rates.</p><p>To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible’s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score. You can also use Credible’s <a href="https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/mortgage-calculator?utm_source=fox&amp;utm_medium=partner_link&amp;utm_campaign=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxbusiness.com%2Fpersonal-finance%2Ftodays-mortgage-rates-july-12-2024&amp;meta=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" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>mortgage calculator</u></a> to estimate your monthly mortgage payments.</p><h2><a name="what-determines-the-mortgage-rate" id="what-determines-the-mortgage-rate"></a>What determines the mortgage rate?</h2><p>Mortgage lenders typically determine the interest rate on a case-by-case basis. Generally, they reserve the lowest rates for low-risk borrowers — that is, those with a higher credit score, income and down payment amount. Here are some other personal factors that may determine your mortgage rate:</p><ul><li>Location of the home</li><li>Price of the home</li><li>Your credit score and credit history</li><li>Loan term</li><li>Loan type (e.g., conventional or FHA)</li><li>Interest rate type (fixed or adjustable)</li><li>Down payment amount</li><li>Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio</li><li>DTI</li></ul><p>Other indirect factors that may determine the mortgage rate include:</p><ul><li>Current economic conditions</li><li>Rate of inflation</li><li>Market conditions</li><li>Housing construction supply, demand, and costs</li><li>Consumer spending</li><li>Stock market</li><li>10-year Treasury yields</li><li>Federal Reserve policies</li><li>Current employment rate</li></ul><h2><a name="how-to-compare-mortgage-rates" id="how-to-compare-mortgage-rates"></a>How to compare mortgage rates</h2><p>Along with certain economic and personal factors, the lender you choose can also affect your mortgage rate. Some lenders have higher average mortgage rates than others, regardless of your credit or financial situation. That’s why it’s important to compare lenders and loan offers.</p><p>Here are some of the best ways to compare mortgage rates and ensure you get the best one:</p><ul><li><strong>Shop around for lenders: </strong>Compare several lenders to find the best rates and lowest fees. Even if the rate is only lower by a few basis points, it could still save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.</li><li><strong>Get several loan estimates: </strong>A loan estimate comes with a more personalized rate and fees based on factors like income, employment, and the property’s location. Review and compare loan estimates from several lenders.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved for a mortgage: </strong><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/mortgage-preapproval?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-approval</a> doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a loan, but it can give you a better idea of what you qualify for and at what interest rate. You’ll need to complete an application and undergo a hard credit check.</li><li><strong>Consider a mortgage rate lock: </strong>A <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/money/lock-or-float-mortgage-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>mortgage rate lock</u></a> lets you lock in the current mortgage rate for a certain amount of time — often between 30 and 90 days. During this time, you can continue shopping around for a home without worrying about the rate changing.</li><li><strong>Choose between an adjustable- and fixed-rate mortgage: </strong>The interest rate type can affect how much you pay over time, so consider your options carefully.</li></ul><p>One other way to compare mortgage rates is with a mortgage calculator. Use a calculator to determine your monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan. Just remember, certain fees like homeowners insurance or taxes might not be included in the calculations.</p><p>Here’s a simple example of what a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might look like versus a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage:</p><h3>15-year fixed-rate</h3><ul><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>$300,000</li><li><strong>Interest rate: </strong>6.29%</li><li><strong>Monthly payment: </strong>$2,579</li><li><strong>Total interest charges: </strong>$164,186</li><li><strong>Total loan amount: </strong>$464,186</li></ul><h3>30-year fixed-rate</h3><ul><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>$300,000</li><li><strong>Interest rate: </strong>6.89%</li><li><strong>Monthly payment: </strong>$1,974</li><li><strong>Total interest charges: </strong>$410,566</li><li><strong>Total loan amount: </strong>$710,565</li></ul><h2><a name="pros-and-cons-of-mortgages" id="pros-and-cons-of-mortgages"></a>Pros and cons of mortgages</h2><p>If you’re thinking about taking out a mortgage, here are some benefits to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Predictable monthly payments: </strong>Fixed-rate mortgage loans come with a set interest rate that doesn’t change over the life of the loan. This means more consistent monthly payments.</li><li><strong>Potentially low interest rates: </strong>With good credit and a high down payment, you could get a competitive interest rate. Adjustable-rate mortgages may also come with a lower initial interest rate than fixed-rate loans.</li><li><strong>Tax benefits: </strong>Having a mortgage could make you eligible for certain tax benefits, such as a <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/mortgage-interest-deduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>mortgage interest deduction</u></a>.</li><li><strong>Potential asset: </strong>Real estate is often considered an asset. As you pay down your loan, you can also build home equity, which you can use for other things like debt consolidation or home improvement projects.</li><li><strong>Credit score boost: </strong>With on-time payments, you can build your credit score.</li></ul><p>And here are some of the biggest downsides of getting a mortgage:</p><ul><li><strong>Expensive fees and interest: </strong>You could end up paying thousands of dollars in interest and other fees over the life of the loan. You will also be responsible for maintenance, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/property-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>property taxes</u></a>, and homeowners insurance.</li><li><strong>Long-term debt: </strong>Taking out a mortgage is a major financial commitment. Typical loan terms are 10, 15, 20, and 30 years.</li><li><strong>Potential rate changes: </strong>If you get an <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/adjustable-rate-mortgage-definition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>adjustable rate</u></a>, the interest rate could increase.</li></ul><h2><a name="how-to-qualify-for-a-mortgage" id="how-to-qualify-for-a-mortgage"></a>How to qualify for a mortgage</h2><p>Requirements vary by lender, but here are the typical steps to qualify for a mortgage:</p><ol><li><strong>Have steady employment and income: </strong>You’ll need to provide proof of income when applying for a home loan. This may include money from your regular job, alimony, military benefits, commissions, or Social Security payments. You may also need to provide proof of at least two years’ worth of employment at your current company.</li><li><strong>Review any assets: </strong>Lenders consider your assets when deciding whether to lend you money. Common assets include money in your bank account or investment accounts.</li><li><strong>Know your DTI: </strong>Your DTI is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward your monthly debts — like installment loans, lines of credit, or rent. The lower your DTI, the better your approval odds.</li><li><strong>Check your credit score: </strong>To get the best mortgage rate possible, you’ll need to have good credit. However, each loan type has a different credit score requirement. For example, you’ll need a credit score of 580 or higher to qualify for an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment.</li><li><strong>Know the property type: </strong>During the loan application process, you may need to specify whether the home you want to buy is your primary residence. Lenders often view a primary residence as less risky, so they may have more lenient requirements than if you were to get a secondary or investment property.</li><li><strong>Choose the loan type: </strong>Many types of mortgage loans exist, including conventional loans, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/va-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>VA loans</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/usda-loans-what-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>USDA loans</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/how-to-use-fha-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>FHA loans</u></a>, and jumbo loans. Consider your options and pick the best one for your needs.</li><li><strong>Prepare for upfront and closing costs: </strong>Depending on the loan type, you may need to make a down payment. The exact amount depends on the loan type and lender. A USDA loan, for example, has no minimum down payment requirement for eligible buyers. With a conventional loan, you’ll need to put down 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI). You may also be responsible for paying any closing costs when signing for the loan.</li></ol><h2><a name="how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage" id="how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage"></a>How to apply for a mortgage</h2><p>Here are the basic steps to apply for a <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/what-is-a-mortgage?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mortgage</a>, and what you can typically expect during the process:</p><ol><li><a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/money/some-of-the-best-mortgage-lenders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Choose a lender</u></strong></a><strong>: </strong>Compare several lenders to see the types of loans they offer, their average mortgage rates, repayment terms, and fees.

A whopping 124 stores in Washington — more than any other state — were on the list, including “nearly 70 in the Seattle area,” <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/124-wa-stores-threatened-by-the-kroger-and-albertsons-merger/">reports the <em>Seattle Times</em></a>. That includes 12 QFCs and three Safeways in Seattle, plus more, the paper says:</p>
<blockquote><p id="cmpyXO">Other Seattle-area divested locations include five QFC stores in Bellevue, two QFC stores and three Safeway stores in Tacoma, two Safeway stores and two QFC stores in Kirkland, and three QFC stores and one Safeway store in Redmond. No Fred Meyer locations appear to be on the list of divested stores. </p></blockquote>
<p id="U9Rhkq">The primary concern for shoppers is that these stores will eventually close after being sold. C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers, as its name suggests, is mostly a distributor, though it operates the Piggly Wiggly and Grand Union grocery chains. </p>
<p id="MRz23S">“The divestiture plan ensures no stores will close as a result of the merger and that all frontline associates will remain employed, all existing collective bargaining agreements will continue, and associates will continue to receive industry-leading health care and pension benefits alongside bargained-for wages,” C&amp;S’s strong operational focus coupled with its experienced management team and financial resources will position it to successfully operate divested stores for years to come.</p>
<p id="2cpHWD">Critics of the deal contend that C&amp;S doesn’t have the resources or know-how to effectively run the spun-off Kroger/Albertsons stores and will have to close some — which is what happened a decade ago when Albertsons sold 146 stores to a chain called Haggen, which later filed for bankruptcy and sued Albertsons (unsuccessfully) for <a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1053572/why-grocery-chain-haggen-once-sued-albertsons/">not providing support</a> that it had promised in the deal. </p>
<p id="zDw3fg">In a <a href="https://agportal-s3bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/0093_Complaint_AmendRedactions_WA_021224%20%28002%29.pdf?VersionId=m0mkgZNbOms.m8h.qwHNHJVdEmXIVFR8">February court filing</a>, Bob Ferguson, the Washington attorney general, drew a direct comparison between the Haggen fiasco and the proposed sale of stores, writing, “C&amp;S is not a sufficiently established and sophisticated competitor to restore the competition that will be lost if Kroger is permitted to acquire an established, successful competitor like Albertsons.” Ferguson also noted that “because this divestiture proposal disproportionately impacts Washington stores, the failure of this proposed divestiture would be particularly harmful here.”</p>
<p id="YmLdXd">Kroger and Albertsons have pushed back against the idea that the divesture would lead to closures or layoffs. “The divestiture plan ensures no stores will close as a result of the merger and that all frontline associates will remain employed, all existing collective bargaining agreements will continue, and associates will continue to receive industry-leading health care and pension benefits alongside bargained-for wages,” a Kroger spokesperson said in a statement. “C&amp;S’s strong operational focus coupled with its experienced management team and financial resources will position it to successfully operate divested stores for years to come”.</p>
<p id="7rZkj0">But critics say that C&amp;S has not committed to keeping open all the stores it will acquire over the long term. <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/124-wa-stores-threatened-by-the-kroger-and-albertsons-merger/">According to the</a> <em>Seattle Times</em>, when C&amp;S reps met with the United Food and Commercial Workers union, they “refused to affirm the earlier promise by Kroger and Albertsons that no locations would close as a result of the merger.” (C&amp;S did not respond to a request to comment from Eater Seattle.)</p>
<p id="QC2F97">There’s still a chance this merger may not become reality. There are several court dates coming up in the next several months, and the <em>Times </em>reports that some experts think that if the Federal Trade Commission gets an injunction temporarily blocking the deal, Kroger and Albertsons may just abandon it altogether.</p>
