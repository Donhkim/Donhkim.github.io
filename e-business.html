<ol>
<li><strong>Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun was re-elected by shareholders</strong>, despite the recommendation to the contrary from proxy adviser Glass Lewis. The vote was likely influenced by the ongoing safety culture crisis at the company.</li>
<li><strong>Boeing has faced multiple safety incidents</strong>, including the death of a whistleblower, multiple high-level malfunctions, and issues with the 787 Dreamliner. These incidents have led to concerns about the company's safety culture.</li>
<li><strong>Calhoun announced his resignation</strong> from his position at the end of 2024, amid the crisis. However, some stakeholders have criticized his leadership and called for changes to the company's safety culture.</li>
<li><strong>Boeing has been criticized by whistleblowers</strong>, including former quality engineer Sam Salehpour, who testified that the company was producing defective planes and putting out "effectively... putting out defective airplanes" and that the planes could "fall apart at the joints" if issues are not addressed.</li>
<li><strong>The incident with the Boeing 747-400</strong> that caught fire on a flight from Indonesia to Saudi Arabia is just the latest in a series of incidents that have raised concerns about the company's safety record.</li>

<ol>
<li>The United Automobile Workers (UAW) union has suffered a setback in its efforts to organize workers at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama, with 56% of workers rejecting the union in a vote.</li>
<li>Despite this loss, the UAW has already scored two significant wins this year: a victory in a vote to unionize workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee and a new contract bringing improved pay and benefits for workers at several North Carolina factories owned by Daimler Truck.</li>
<li>The loss at Mercedes-Benz is seen as a setback, but not a fatal blow to the UAW's efforts to organize workers in the South.</li>
<li>The UAW has been making progress in organizing workers in the South, which is traditionally a region resistant to unionization.</li>
<li>The national director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, Arthur Wheaton, believes the UAW will continue its efforts to organize workers, despite this recent loss, and does not think the union will stop its organizing efforts just because of this setback.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Sports still dominate Upfront meetings</strong>: Live sports continued to be the focus of the latest Upfront meetings, with advertisers still flocking to events that attract large audiences and more lucrative ad dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact of the writers' strike</strong>: The recent writers' strike, which affected the production of scripted shows, has led to some media companies having fewer series and movies to highlight during the Upfront presentations.</p>

<p><strong>Cost-cutting measures</strong>: Several media companies, including Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery, have implemented cost-cutting measures, which has further reduced the number of shows and movies available for the presentations.</p>

<p><strong>Sports remain the biggest draw</strong>: Despite the challenges faced by the media industry, sports events still drew the biggest audiences and ad spend, with sports presenting a more stable and predictable medium for advertisers.</p>

<p>In fact, you will find some of the biggest sales of the year this week and the best sales since President’s Day back in February.</p>
<p>Salesman Tony Green is getting ready for a big week of holiday sales at his hardware store, Woods Hardware.</p>
<p>“It’s Memorial Day, it’s gonna be fun,” he said.</p>
<p>His store has grills and outdoor gear as much as 50 percent off.</p>
<p>Julie Ramhold, a consumer analyst for <a class="Link" href="https://www.dealnews.com/f1724/Memorial-Day/" data-cms-ai="0">DealNews,</a> walked us through other discounts she expects to see this Memorial Day, including major appliances for up to 40 percent off.</p>
<p>With stores more fully stocked than they have been since 2019, she expects to see some of the biggest markdowns in years.</p>

    <h2>Home improvement items, furniture</h2>


<p>“Some home improvement stores may take even more off,” she said. “I’ve seen Home Depot take up to 53 percent off in the past.”</p>
<p>That means markdowns on paint, <a class="Link" href="https://www.simplemost.com/amazon-buyers-love-these-outdoor-furniture-sets/" data-cms-ai="0">patio furniture</a>, even grills and <a class="Link" href="https://www.dontwasteyourmoney.com/best-fire-pits/" data-cms-ai="0">fire pits</a>.</p>
<p>Also seeing big sales is furniture, indoor and outdoor, and anything bedroom-related.</p>
<p>Carol Smith was finding some great prices on pieces for a home office, at the regional chain Furniture Fair.</p>
<p>“I am looking for a credenza for file storage in my study,” she said.</p>

    <h2>Great mattress sales</h2>


<p>For mattress deals, Ramhold said you’ll find great markdowns, but it comes down to where you shop.</p>
<p>“If you’re looking at online mattress places, it’s very common to see things like 20 to 30 percent off at <a class="Link" href="https://fave.co/3QPpRuO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cms-ai="0">Casper</a> or <a class="Link" href="https://fave.co/3yqcPxs" data-cms-ai="0">Purple</a>,” she said.</p>

<p>In person, she said mattress discounts vary.</p>
<p>“Some stores will have up to 50 percent off,” she said, “or they have $600 off on particular brands.”</p>
<p>Other categories that dominate Memorial Day, <a class="Link" href="https://www.dealnews.com/f1724/Memorial-Day/" data-cms-ai="0">according to DealNews:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Spring clothing, which can also be worn all summer long.</li>

<ol>
<li>The meme-stock revival, led by GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC), which started with a surge in shares, quickly fizzled out and most of the gains were erased within days.</li>
<li>Unlike the frenzy of 2021, this latest rally was a brief and short-lived event, with GME's stock price slipping more than 60% from its intraday high, and AMC's stock price dropping by over 60% from its peak.</li>
<li>Despite the brief rally, GameStop's stock price has still managed to put together four consecutive weeks of gains, adding over $3.6 billion in value to its market capitalization.</li>
<li>Both GameStop and AMC took advantage of the rally to shore up their cash reserves, with GameStop arranging to sell up to 45 million shares and AMC raising over $250 million through share sales and debt-for-equity swaps.</li>
<li>While the meme-stock rally may have been short-lived, it highlights the ongoing interest in speculative stocks and the willingness of retail traders to participate in these kinds of investments, despite the significant risks involved.</li>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- The meme-stock revival was over almost as quickly as it began.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. — the poster children of 2021’s frenzy — saw shares surge at the start of the week only to fizzle, with the bulk of those gains erased just days later. Other speculative corners of the market, mainly beaten-down stocks that have drawn the scrutiny of short-selling hedge funds, saw their booms mostly go bust while the broader US stock market powered to record highs.</p><p>Read MLIV Pulse: Meme-Stocks Pop Signals Too Much Froth in Stocks</p><p>An X post from Keith Gill — one of the masterminds behind the Covid-era spike in GameStop, better known as “Roaring Kitty”— set social media platforms abuzz into Monday morning as traders, both amateur and professional, pounced on old day-trading standbys and other stocks that seemed susceptible to a short squeeze. However, unlike the 2021 delirium that lasted weeks and resulted in congressional hearings and lawsuits, the revival of meme stocks was a flash in the pan.</p><p>With the rally quickly losing its shine, AMC shares have slipped more than 60% from an $11.88 intraday year-to-date high while GameStop gave back almost all of its gains. The differences between the two frenzies — if you can call the latest iteration that — were quickly apparent. In 2021, GameStop soared more than 1,000% in a matter of days, making this week’s peak look tame as the pair only held onto mere double-digit gains for the week.</p><p>Still, a more than 100% rally over four weeks is nothing to completely shrug off for the video-game retailer. The stock has put together four consecutive weeks of gains, adding some $3.6 billion over that stretch, though it’s still more than 80% below a 2021 high.</p><p>Both companies moved to capitalize on the rallies to shore up their cash reserves this week. GameStop arranged to sell up to 45 million shares in a so-called at-the-market program, enabling its bank to create shares for sale, with the proceeds being added to its balance sheet.</p><p>For AMC, the beleaguered movie chain was able to raise more than $250 million through share sales and a debt-for-equity swap though it still faces more than $4 billion in debt, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. This week’s gains look like a blip given it’s still down some 90% over the past 12 months.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>An aspect of 2024’s meme stock moment is how fleeting it was and the lack of follow-through from retail traders. Yes, GameStop saw more than 10-times its recent average number of shares traded at the start of the week while AMC had more than 1.7 billion shares change hands over the five-day span, but the notional value is nothing compared to 2021.</p><p>Even with the jump in volume, activity for retail traders on things like Fidelity’s platform was a fraction of levels seen three years ago with retail traders placing sell orders roughly matching those that were placed to buy.</p><p>Options markets also whipsawed traders, with short-term GameStop and AMC prices implying well over 500% annualized volatility at one point, before dropping to about half that by week’s end. Even as shares retreated below $40, some traders were buying GameStop calls that would only pay out if the stock rocketed back up above $128 by Friday.</p><p>The sky-high costs attracted the attention of noted bond trader Bill Gross, who said he sold so-called straddles on both companies, betting the wild swings would become more muted.</p><p>The rally in AMC and GameStop ate away at profits for short sellers, traders who gain on a stock’s decline, meaning billions in paper losses for the group as the stocks surged. Of course, those losses were partially reversed when the shares fell back to earth.</p><p>The exuberance for the top meme stocks lifted shares of other companies that are also popular with the retail crowd and often trade more on sentiment than fundamentals. This group — which includes Tupperware Brands Corp., Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. and Lucid Group Inc. — has high short interest as a percentage of float, meaning that contrarian traders have borrowed most available shares to bet against them.</p><p>With the markets placid once again, some of the companies that got lifted in the meme-stock resurgence remain beaten down over the past year.</p><p>Take Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc.; shares have surged about 2,000% this week, but are still down some 98% over the last 12 months.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li><strong>Decrease in cost of consumer products</strong>: For two decades, imported goods from China and other emerging economies led to a significant decrease in the cost of consumer products such as video games, clothing, and home appliances in the US.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on American factories and jobs</strong>: The influx of low-cost imports led to the closure of many American factories, resulting in over 1 million job losses. Discount stores and online retailers, such as Walmart and Amazon, flourished by selling these imported goods.</li>
<li><strong>Reaction from voters</strong>: The negative impact on US factories and jobs led to voters electing politicians who promised to take action against China, including Donald Trump in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2024.</li>
<li><strong>Trade policy changes</strong>: Both Trump and Biden have implemented or announced plans to impose tariffs on Chinese imports to make them more expensive and revive American factories. This includes taxing imports in industries such as clothing, appliances, and solar panels.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in trade policy priorities</strong>: The article suggests that the US has shifted its trade policy priorities from encouraging free trade to focusing on protecting American industries and jobs, particularly in the face of China's economic influence.</li>

<li><strong>The Fed is cautious about false victories</strong>: The Federal Reserve, which sets monetary policy, is likely to be cautious about declaring victory over inflation, having previously underestimated the severity of the problem, and will likely want to monitor inflation trends closely.</li>

But requests for a fraction of that compute were often denied, blocking the team from doing their work.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">That issue, among others, pushed several team members to resign this week, including co-lead Jan Leike, a former DeepMind researcher who while at OpenAI was involved with the development of ChatGPT, GPT-4 and ChatGPT’s predecessor, InstructGPT.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Leike went public with some reasons for his resignation on Friday morning. “I have been disagreeing with OpenAI leadership about the company’s core priorities for quite some time, until we finally reached a breaking point,” Leike wrote in a series of posts on X. “I believe much more of our bandwidth should be spent getting ready for the next generations of models, on security, monitoring, preparedness, safety, adversarial robustness, (super)alignment, confidentiality, societal impact, and related topics. These problems are quite hard to get right, and I am concerned we aren’t on a trajectory to get there.”</p>

	
	


	
	




<p class="wp-block-paragraph">OpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment about the resources promised and allocated to that team. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">OpenAI formed the Superalignment team last July, and it was led by Leike and OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/ilya-sutskever-openai-co-founder-and-longtime-chief-scientist-departs/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/ilya-sutskever-openai-co-founder-and-longtime-chief-scientist-departs/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="1" mrfobservableid="65cdf3f4-821d-47e5-b31f-4b5e6db900b7">who also resigned from the company this week</a>. It had the ambitious goal of solving the core technical challenges of controlling superintelligent AI in the next four years. Joined by scientists and engineers from OpenAI’s previous alignment division as well as researchers from other orgs across the company, the team was to contribute research informing the safety of both in-house and non-OpenAI models, and, through initiatives including a research grant program, solicit from and share work with the broader AI industry.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Superalignment team did manage to publish a body of safety research and funnel millions of dollars in grants to outside researchers. But, as product launches began to take up an increasing amount of OpenAI leadership’s bandwidth, the Superalignment team found itself having to fight for more upfront investments — investments it believed were critical to the company’s stated mission of developing superintelligent AI for the benefit of all humanity.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor,” Leike continued. “But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Sutskever’s battle with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman served as a major added distraction.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Sutskever, along with OpenAI’s old board of directors, moved to abruptly fire Altman late last year over concerns that Altman hadn’t been “consistently candid” with the board’s members. Under pressure from OpenAI’s investors, including Microsoft, and many of the company’s own employees, Altman was eventually reinstated, much of the board resigned and Sutskever <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/technology/ilya-sutskever-leaving-openai.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-mrf-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/technology/ilya-sutskever-leaving-openai.html" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="2" mrfobservableid="7a1d8860-7c3d-4d07-920a-88461b05994b">reportedly</a> never returned to work.</p>

	
	


	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">According to the source, Sutskever was instrumental to the Superalignment team — not only contributing research but serving as a bridge to other divisions within OpenAI. He would also serve as an ambassador of sorts, impressing the importance of the team’s work on key OpenAI decision makers.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After Leike’s departure, Altman wrote in X that he agreed there is “a lot more to do,” and that they are “committed to doing it.” He hinted at a longer explanation, which co-founder Greg Brockman supplied Saturday morning:</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Though there is little concrete in Brockman’s response as far as policies or commitments, he said that “we need to have a very tight feedback loop, rigorous testing, careful consideration at every step, world-class security, and harmony of safety and capabilities.”</p>

	
	


	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Following the departures of Leike and Sutskever, John Schulman, another OpenAI co-founder, has moved to head up the type of work the Superalignment team was doing, but there will no longer be a dedicated team — instead, it will be a loosely associated group of researchers embedded in divisions throughout the company. An OpenAI spokesperson described it as “integrating [the team] more deeply.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The fear is that, as a result, OpenAI’s AI development won’t be as safety-focused as it could’ve been.</p>

<li><strong>Publicly traded companies drive US growth</strong>: Unlike China, where state-owned companies play a major role in the economy, the US gets more growth from publicly traded companies.</li>
<li><strong>US stock dominance may not last</strong>: The article cautions that the US's stock market supremacy may not continue forever, citing the example of Japan, whose markets soared in the late 1980s but ultimately crashed due to asset bubbles and overborrowing.</li>

    <div><div data-cy="article-content" class="rawHtml-content-no-nativo"><p>Every year, China gets closer to catching the U.S. as the world’s biggest economy. When it comes to their stock markets, however, there’s no contest. Since 1992, China’s GDP has grown 6.5 times as fast as America’s—but U.S. stock returns have been 3.5 times as high. </p><div class="paywall paywallActive">



<p>Indeed, U.S. stocks have dominated global investing, as measured by market capitalization, for most of the past 125 years. For that, you can partly thank New Deal­–era regulations that tamed the Wild West of U.S. markets, making them attractive to risk-averse investors worldwide. And compared with China, where state-owned companies drive the economy, the U.S. gets more growth from publicly traded companies. But supremacy can be fleeting. Just ask Japan, whose markets soared in the late 1980s, only to nose-dive amid asset bubbles and massive overborrowing. In other words: Don’t get too cocky, U.S. stock bulls.</p>

<li>A Russian court has ordered the seizure of assets, accounts, property, and shares of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank in Russia, as part of a lawsuit involving a gas processing plant project with German company Linde.</li>
<li>The project was terminated due to Western sanctions, and the banks are guarantor lenders under the contract. Deutsche Bank has provisioned about $283m (260 million euros) for the case.</li>
<li>The court also seized the assets of Commerzbank, worth $101.85m (93.7 million euros), as well as securities and the bank's building in central Moscow. Commerzbank has not commented on the case.</li>
<li>UniCredit was also ordered to have its assets, accounts, and property seized, as well as shares in two subsidiaries, covering 462.7 million euros ($503m) in assets. UniCredit has confirmed being "made aware" of the decision, but has not commented further.</li>
<li>The asset seizures were part of a broader trend of European banks exiting Russia after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</li>

<p>European banks have largely exited Russia after Moscow launched its <a href="/news/2024/5/18/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-814">offensive on Ukraine in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>A court in St Petersburg ruled in favour of seizing 239 million euros ($260m) from Deutsche Bank, documents dated May 16 showed.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt said it had already provisioned about 260 million euros ($283m) for the case.</p>
<p>“We will need to see how this claim is implemented by the Russian courts and assess the immediate operational impact in Russia,” the bank added in a statement.</p>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<p>The court also seized the assets of Commerzbank, another German financial institution, worth 93.7 million euros ($101.85m) as well as securities and the bank’s building in central Moscow.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>The bank is yet to comment on the case.</p>
<p>In a parallel lawsuit on Friday, the Russian court also ordered UniCredit’s assets, accounts and property, as well as shares in two subsidiaries, to be seized. The ruling covered 462.7 million euros ($503m) in assets.</p>
<p>UniCredit said it “has been made aware” of the decision and was “reviewing” the situation in detail. The bank was one of the most exposed European banks when Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine, with a large local subsidiary operating in Russia.</p>
<p>It began preliminary discussions on a sale last year, but the talks have not advanced. Chief executive Andrea Orcel said UniCredit wants to leave Russia, but added that gifting an operation worth three billion euros ($3.3bn) was not a good way to respect the spirit of Western sanctions on Moscow over the conflict.</p>
<p>Russia has faced heavy Western sanctions, including on its banking sector, since the start of the <a href="/news/2024/5/18/zelenskyy-warns-russias-kharkiv-offensive-may-only-be-first-wave">war in Ukraine</a>. Dozens of US and European companies have also stopped doing business in the country.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Morgan Stanley economists have changed their forecasts, now expecting two Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year, with the possibility of a "live" meeting at the July Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.</li>
<li>The shift in expectations follows recent economic reports, including April's jobs numbers and retail sales data, which indicated a transition from upside surprises to downside surprises.</li>
<li>April's Consumer Price Index (CPI) data did not significantly underperform expectations, but rather aligned with them, providing relief to financial markets. Inflation figures appear to be on a downward trajectory, with core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation forecast to decelerate.</li>
<li>Morgan Stanley economists project that three-month annualized PCE inflation will fall back to 2.7% by June. While a rate cut in July may be premature, three cuts throughout the year could be appropriate.</li>
<li>The brokerage firm notes that more evidence would be required for the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates, and that the market is still underestimating the number of rate cuts this year.</li>

However, the brokerage firm added that more evidence would be required for the Fed to begin cutting rates.</p><p>The shift in expectations follows a series of economic reports, including April's jobs numbers and retail sales data, which signaled a transition from previous upside surprises to downside surprises.</p><p>Notably, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for April did not significantly underperform expectations, but rather aligned with them, providing relief to financial markets.</p><p>Morgan Stanley had anticipated this change in trend, expecting disinflation to resume, yet projecting the Federal Reserve to maintain rates until September due to data volatility.</p><p>Inflation figures appear to be on a downward trajectory based on April's inflation figures. Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation, which had spiked to an annualized rate of 4.4% in March from 1.6% in December 2023, is projected to decelerate, with April's core PCE tracking at 0.26% month-over-month compared to 0.32% in March.</p><p>Morgan Stanley forecasts that the three-month annualized pace will fall back to 2.7% by June.</p><p>While a rate cut in July may be premature, three cuts throughout the year could be appropriate, the economists concluded</p><div class="mt-3 text-center text-xs text-[#5b616e]"><p>3rd party Ad.

The year-over-year measure cooled to the slowest pace in three years.</p><p>A string of reports this week illustrated a slow start for the economy in the second quarter, adding to evidence that demand is cooling which will help set the stage for the Fed to cut interest rates later this year.</p><p>Americans give Donald Trump the edge over Joe Biden on the economy in poll after poll. That’s even as the Biden years have been the best time to find work since the 1960s, and the US has bounced back from the pandemic with stronger growth than international peers and stronger growth overall than under President Trump. Instead, voters this year are focused on the steep jump in prices from the post-pandemic surge in inflation.</p><p>President Biden is hiking tariffs on a wide range of Chinese imports — including semiconductors, batteries, solar cells, and critical minerals — in an election-year bid to bolster domestic manufacturing in critical industries. The US will also raise levies on port cranes and medical products, in addition to previously reported increases on steel, aluminum, and electric vehicles.

That possibility threatens to put about 5 million people — equal to the population of Ireland — at risk of unemployment or reduced incomes, the analysts wrote.</p><p>China’s economic recovery tilted even further toward manufacturing, leaving it more vulnerable to trade barriers and highlighting the stakes of a new bid to shore up domestic demand. Growth in consumer spending unexpectedly cooled to 2.3% in April, the slowest pace since 2022, while industrial output rose from a month ago to a faster-than-expected 6.7%, the National Bureau of Statistics said.</p><p>Emerging Markets</p><p>Israel’s economy rebounded at a pace seen only after the coronavirus pandemic, as investment and consumption powered an upswing that partly offset the shock of more than seven months of war. The worst of the economic fallout may be coming to an end, with consumer confidence approaching its pre-war levels and the labor market quick to stabilize after unemployment spiked in October.</p><p>Unexplained outflows of capital from Turkey surged again during a month when voters went to the polls, a repeat of the money drain it suffered in the run-up to national elections a year ago.</p><p>Europe</p><p>Norway plans to spend more of its $1.6 trillion sovereign wealth fund than planned earlier, helping the Nordic nation’s economy overcome a soft patch amid an expected delay in interest rate cuts.

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- From New York to London to Tokyo, if there’s one similarity among the world’s equity markets it’s this: record highs.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>Of the world’s 20 largest stock markets, 14 have hit all-time highs recently. The MSCI ACWI Index, which tracks developed and emerging markets, has been on a record-breaking run, setting another new high on Friday. In the US, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes hit records this week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 40,000 for the first time ever. Meanwhile, the biggest bourses in Europe, Canada, Brazil, India, Japan and Australia are currently at or near their peaks.</p><p>Looming interest rate cuts, healthy economies and corporate earnings are driving the activity. And what’s more, there are plenty of potential drivers to keep the rally rolling, such as the $6 trillion sitting in money market funds, while risks remain scarce.</p><p>“From a macro perspective, there are no red signals,” said Salman Ahmed, global head of macro and strategic asset allocation at Fidelity International, who’s overweight global equities in his multi-asset portfolios. “The cyclical picture is staying strong, and the rally is broadening out.”</p><p>The April pullback in global stocks didn’t last long, as dip buyers consistently showed up. That helps explain why the S&amp;P 500 hasn’t seen a 2% drop in 311 days, its longest streak since 2017-2018. And even Chinese equities, which have been struggling since hitting a high in February 2021, are starting to come back.</p><p>With all that in mind, here’s the state of play in major equity markets around the world:</p><p>$12 Trillion Rally</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has set 24 new all-time highs in 2024 after going two years without one, as US stocks have been on a $12 trillion rally since late October. One part of that is hopes for a soft landing with the economy staying strong while inflation cools, which is spurring bets the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy as soon as later this year.</p><p>Another part is enthusiasm for artificial intelligence technology. AI chip giant Nvidia Corp. on its own is responsible for about one-fourth of the gains in S&amp;P 500. And together with Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Google-parent Alphabet Inc., roughly 53% of the benchmark’s rise is coming from just five stocks.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>So perhaps the Dow’s new milestone this week was the more significant development, since it’s less heavily weighted toward those big tech behemoths, according to Dave Mazza, chief executive officer of Roundhill Investments.</p><p>“While the tech sector’s strength has been incredibly important to helping markets make high after high, it’s far from the only sector that’s doing well,” he said. “While some were pointing to the market being too concentrated last year, you can’t say the same in 2024.”</p><p>Europe’s Earnings Surprise</p><p>European equities are also on a record-hitting spree as economic data shows signs of bottoming amid positive surprises this year. That’s fueling corporate profits and driving expectations for markets to keep building on the rally.</p><p>“The expected sluggish earnings season turned out to be better than feared,” BNP Paribas strategists led by Georges Debbas said, noting that three-quarters of European companies met or exceeded earnings expectations, with margins improving. That’s fueling analyst estimates for future profits, lifting stocks higher.</p><p>The pan-European Stoxx 600 Index has risen in five of the last six months, with the divergence in monetary policy from the US likely to be a tailwind for the region’s equities. The European Central Bank has struck a more dovish tone than the Fed over the past few months, and bond markets are expecting the ECB to cut rates before its US counterpart for the first time ever.</p><p>While the rally had been heavily concentrated in a handful of stocks, it’s been broadening out since February, with 16 stocks contributing 50% of the yearly gains in the Stoxx 600. Novo Nordisk A/S is the largest, making up 10% of the gauge’s returns this year, while ASML Holding NV and SAP SE account for 7.7% and 4.3%, respectively.</p><p>Commodities Lift Stocks</p><p>The UK’s FTSE 100 Index has beaten the Euro Stoxx 50 in dollar terms over the past three months, recovering much of its underperformance from the beginning of the year. Soaring commodity prices have been a key driver, helping one of the cheapest developed equity markets in the world start to catch up to its rivals.</p><p>The economically sensitive commodities sector has also pushed to Canada’s main stocks benchmark, the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index, to an all-time high. Gold and copper have repeatedly set records this year, giving a boost to the country’s massive mining sector, which accounts for over 12% of the index’s weighting.</p><p>“Precious metal prices are closing in on decade highs set just a few weeks ago, which could keep the Canadian index supported for now, though a reversal could spell trouble,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Gillian Wolff and Gina Martin Adams wrote in a note.</p><p>Japan Is Back</p><p>Japan’s Nikkei 225 is up 16% this year, adding to a 28% gain last year. The country lured investors and drove gains with a campaign to improve shareholder returns, a weak yen and the end of negative rates in Japan.</p><p>BlackRock Inc. strategists said the sliding yen could put off foreign investors. But they also think the outlook is good over the long-term due to corporate reforms, domestic investments and wage growth.</p><p>India also has been on a strong run, with the benchmark S&amp;P BSE Sensex setting records and outperforming China, thanks to the government’s investment pledges and an expanding economy. However, investors turned cautious in recent weeks over election uncertainties and high valuations.</p><p>Meanwhile, Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index hit a high on March 28 after inflation data bolstered bets that rates have peaked. Since then, expectations have shifted with a former central bank official predicting that cuts may only come in late 2025. Yet, Australian stocks are back to hovering near that record high.</p><p>--With assistance from Sagarika Jaisinghani, Abhishek Vishnoi, Winnie Hsu, Joe Easton and Farah Elbahrawy.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

              </figcaption></figure><p>While the rate climate in recent years has hurt all types of borrowers, it's been a boost for savers with select accounts. With rates on <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/high-yield-savings-account/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">high-yield savings</a></span> and <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whats-a-certificate-of-deposit-cd/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">certificates of deposit (CD) accounts</a></span> less than 1% in 2020 and 2021, savers had no real way to grow their funds with these vehicles. But as the pandemic faded and <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-june-cpi-report-hit-new-high-40-years-9-1-percent/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">inflation surged</a></span>, the federal funds rate rose in tandem. That caused rates on both savings accounts to rise exponentially. As of May 2024, savers can now earn upward of <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-todays-cd-interest-rates/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">5%</a></span> with either (<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-you-should-open-cd-and-high-yield-savings-account-this-week/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">or both</a></span>) of these accounts. That said, 5% may not seem like a substantial amount but when viewed as dollars and cents, savers can gain a better perspective on what they stand to earn.</p><p>Right now, the very best rates are typically offered on CDs. And you won't need to deposit an exorbitant amount or keep your money locked away forever to realize a significant return. Still, before getting started, it helps to see what your bottom line will be after the account <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-to-do-when-your-cd-matures-according-to-experts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">matures</a></span>. To that end, below we've broken down exactly how much a $10,000 deposit into a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/best-6-month-cd-rates/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">6-month CD</a></span> would earn at today's elevated rates.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhow-much-interest-would-a-10000-6-month-cd-earn-now&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhow-much-interest-would-a-10000-6-month-cd-earn-now%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=ab4a4ea6-2290-4971-afd7-0b3623f78e86" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See how much more you could be earning with a top CD account here now</a>.</p><p></p><h2><strong>How much interest would a $10,000 6-month CD earn now?</strong></h2><p>To determine precisely how much a $10,000 6-month CD will earn if opened this month, you'll have to know the interest rate it's opened with. Since different lenders offer different rates based on the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cd-terms-everything-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">term</a></span> (or length) of the CD, this could vary. That understood, here's what the account will earn based off of some common 6-month CDs rates available online now:</p><ul><li><strong>5.35%:</strong> $264.01 in interest for a total amount of $10,264.01 after six months. </li><li><strong>5.30%:</strong> $261.58 in interest for a total amount of $10,261.58 after six months. </li><li><strong>5.25%:</strong> $259.14 for a total amount of $10,259.14 after six months.</li><li><strong>5.00%:</strong> $246.95 for a total amount of $10,246.95 after six months. </li></ul><p>As can be seen, rates on six-month CDs are in the same range right now across lenders. But if you're truly after the highest rate possible, consider opening a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/should-you-open-a-cd-account-online/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">CD with an online bank</a></span> versus one with physical branches. Since online banks often don't have the overhead costs of maintaining physical locations, they can frequently offer higher rates to customers than their counterparts with banks in different parts of the country.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhow-much-interest-would-a-10000-6-month-cd-earn-now&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhow-much-interest-would-a-10000-6-month-cd-earn-now%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=ab4a4ea6-2290-4971-afd7-0b3623f78e86" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Start exploring your 6-month CD account options online today</a>.</p><h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>While the above returns are substantial, savers stand to earn even more if they make a larger deposit or extend the term past six months. By doing either, savers can potentially earn <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-make-hundreds-of-dollars-with-a-cd-now/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">hundreds of dollars</a></span> more than illustrated and even <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-earn-thousands-of-dollars-with-a-cd-now/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">thousands</a></span> with the right strategic approach. </p>

    </p>
<p>But it's important to remember that <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cd-early-withdrawal-penalties-what-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">early withdrawal penalties</a></span> will apply if you take your money out of the account before it matures, so only deposit an amount you're comfortable parting with for the full term. And be cognizant of tax implications as you may have to pay <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-you-avoid-taxes-on-cd-account-interest/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">taxes</a></span> if the interest you earn on a CD surpasses a certain threshold. But if you understand these nuances - and account for them in advance - you can earn a few hundred dollars right now simply by transferring some money into one of today's top 6-month CD accounts.</p>
