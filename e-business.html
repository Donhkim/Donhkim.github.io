<p><strong>CDK Global, a software provider for thousands of auto dealerships in North America, was hit by back-to-back cyberattacks on Wednesday, leading to an outage that still affects many of its operations on Friday.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The outage has caused disruptions for prospective car buyers, leading to delays at dealerships and manual vehicle orders, with no immediate end in sight.</strong></p>

<li>
<p><strong>CDK Global is a major player in the auto sales industry, providing software technology to dealerships for day-to-day operations such as vehicle sales, financing, insurance, and repairs, serving over 15,000 retail locations across North America.</strong></p>

<li>
<p><strong>The company has shut down all of its systems out of caution and has had to execute extensive testing and restore its core services, with no estimated timeframe for resolution, implying that the outage may last for "several days".</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In the meantime, CDK has warned customers to be cautious of phishing attempts from "bad actors" posing as company members or affiliates, and has urged dealers to take caution to protect their systems.

That led to an outage that continued to impact many of their operations on Friday.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">For prospective car buyers, that may mean delays at dealerships or vehicle orders written up by hand, with no immediate end in sight. Here's what you need to know.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">CDK Global is a major player in the auto sales industry. The company, based just outside of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, provides software technology to dealers that helps with day-today operations — like facilitating vehicle sales, financing, insurance and repairs.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">CDK serves more than 15,000 retail locations across North America, according to the company. Whether all of these locations were impacted by this week's cyberattacks was not immediately clear.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">CDK is “actively investigating a cyber incident” and the company shut down all of its systems out of an abundance of caution, spokesperson Lisa Finney said Wednesday. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">CDK “executed extensive testing," consulted third-party experts, and restored its core DMS and Digital Retailing solutions by the afternoon, Finney said in a prepared statement. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">CDK experienced another "cyber incident” Wednesday evening, Finney said in a update the following day. “We remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible,” she said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">When that will be is still unknown. As of Friday morning, a recorded message from CDK on a hotline detailing updates for its customers said “we do not have an estimated time frame for resolution — and therefore our dealer systems will not be available, likely for several days.” Customer care support channels also remain unavailable, it said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The message added that the company was aware of “bad actors” posing as members or affiliates of CDK to try to obtain system access by contacting customers. It urged employers to be cautious of any attempted phishing.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Several major auto companies — including Stellantis, Ford and BMW — confirmed to The Associated Press Friday that the CDK outage had impacted some of their dealers, but that sales operations continue.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In light of the ongoing situation, a spokesperson for Stellantis said that many dealerships had switched to manual processes to serve customers. That includes writing up orders by hand. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">A Ford spokesperson said that the outage may cause “some delays and inconveniences at some dealers and for some customers.” However, many Ford and Lincoln customers are still getting sales and service support through alternative routes being used at dealerships. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">With many details of the cyberattacks still unclear, customer privacy is also at top of mind — especially with little known about what information may have been compromised this week.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In a statement sent to the AP on Friday, Mike Stanton, president and CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association said that “dealers are very committed to protecting their customer information and are actively seeking information from CDK to determine the nature and scope of the cyber incident so they can respond appropriately."</p></div></div>

<li><strong>Existing home sales are at a 30-year low</strong>: Sales of previously owned homes in May were essentially flat, down 0.7% from April to a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 4.11 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).</li>
<li><strong>Mortgage rates remain high</strong>: The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed loan is around 7%, which has been a significant hurdle for buyers. The rate increase in April led to a slowdown in sales, and it remains a challenge for the housing market.</li>
<li><strong>Prices hit a new record</strong>: The median price of an existing home sold in May was $419,300, a record-high price in the Realtors' recording and up 5.8% year over year. This is the strongest gain in prices since October 2022.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory of homes for sale is increasing</strong>: The supply of homes for sale jumped 6.7% month to month and 18.5% higher than in May last year, which is a sign that the market may be slowly rebalancing. However, inventory is still very low given demographics and demand.</li>
<li><strong>Prolonged low sales pace is expected</strong>: NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun expects the sales pace to remain sluggish, citing high mortgage rates and low inventory. He believes that increased inventory will eventually help boost home sales and tame price gains, but it may take time.</li>

Sales fell 2.8% from May of last year.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>This count of closed sales is based on contracts likely signed in March and April. The sluggish sales pace came as rates took a big leap in April.</p><p>The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed loan started the month just below 7% and then rose to just over 7.5% by mid-April, before settling back slightly in May, according to Mortgage News Daily. That rate is now right around 7%.</p><p>“Home sales refuse to recover,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the NAR. “I thought we would see a recovery this spring. We are not seeing it.”</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107418452" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">Homes in the Issaquah Highlands area of Issaquah, Washington, US, on Tuesday, April 16, 2024. </p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>Sales were unchanged month to month in all regions except the South, where they fell 1.6%.</p><p>The biggest change in May is that the inventory of homes for sale jumped, up 6.7% month to month and 18.5% higher than in May last year. At the current sales pace, there is now a 3.7-month supply. While inventory is gaining, it is still very low given demographics and demand.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>“Eventually, more inventory will help boost home sales and tame home price gains in the upcoming months.

The median price of an existing home sold in May was $419,300, a record-high price in the Realtors’ recording and up 5.8% year over year. The gain was the strongest since October 2022. Prices gained in all regions.</p><p>The Realtors noted in a release that the mortgage payment for a typical home today is more than double what it was five years ago. Not only have rates climbed, but home prices are more than 50% higher than they were five years ago. That comes in part because the median is skewing to the higher end.</p><p>Sales of homes priced below $250,000 were lower than a year ago, while sales priced between $250,000 and $500,000 were up just 1%. Sales priced between $750,000 and $1 million were 13% higher, and sales priced over $1 million were up nearly 23%.</p><p>Cash is still king, accounting for 28% of sales. First-time buyers are hanging in at 31% of sales, up from 28% the year before.</p><p>Two-thirds of homes went under contract in less than a month, so competition is still strong despite higher prices. Redfin, a real estate brokerage, is reporting that an increasing number of listings are becoming stale, so if a home comes on the market that is well-priced and doesn’t need much work, it goes fast.

Schaben | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>At the ICR conference in January, Authentic Brands CEO Jamie Salter said acquiring Forever 21 was “probably the biggest mistake” of his career, adding he also erred when he failed to recognize the competitive threat posed by Shein and Temu earlier. </p><p>He recalled a conversation he had with Simon’s CEO David Simon, who asked Salter why he wanted to partner with Shein. </p><p>“I said, ‘David, it’s the right decision, we cannot beat them. Their supply chain is too good. They know what’s going on. They’ve figured this out. We need to partner with them,’” Salter said. “So I was the brave one that said, ‘Let’s go partner with these guys.’”</p><p>As part of the two retailers’ partnership, Shein will design, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/27/shein-to-sell-co-branded-forever-21-clothes-online.html">manufacture and distribute</a> a line of co-branded Forever 21 apparel and accessories that will be sold primarily on Shein’s website. Forever 21 has also hosted Shein pop-up stores and begun accepting Shein returns, both of which have driven positive foot traffic to Forever 21′s shops, one of the people said. </p><p>The two <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/24/shein-strikes-deal-with-fast-fashion-retailer-forever-21.html">originally linked up</a> last August and under the terms of the agreement, Shein acquired about one-third of Sparc while Sparc took a minority stake in Shein. </p><p>Given the concerns that Forever 21 is having with its leases, and the success of Shein’s pop-up shops, some industry observers questioned whether the digital giant could soon take over Forever 21′s stores. However, one of the people said that’s unlikely because the retailer lacks experience in physical retail and its business model involves small-batch production and an inventory that constantly shifts based on trends.</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Don’t miss these from CNBC PRO</h2></div></div></div></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

<p>In late January, PayPal held an “Innovation Day” conference that new CEO Alex Chriss had promised would “shock the world.” A research report by FT Partners captured investors’ reaction, dubbing the event “Innovationless Day” and writing that the announcements were “largely comprised of uninspiring / recycled advertising methods ranging from placing ads in PayPal receipts and Venmo’s social feed to reorganizing PayPal’s in-app cashback offers.”</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p>Wall Street’s smirks and yawns were likely a harsh reality check for 46-year-old Chriss, who became PayPal’s CEO just last fall after 19 years at Intuit, where he was an executive vice president and oversaw its QuickBooks business. He was brought in to help the 26-year-old San Jose-based company regain its momentum, but it appears that won’t be easy. PayPal declined to make Chriss available to <em>Forbes</em> for an interview, though his predecessor Dan Schulman did talk to us.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>
<p class="article_paragraph_7"></p><fbs-ad position="top" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-top"><p id="article-0-top"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>Nearly a decade after its spin-off from eBay (which acquired the payments startup in 2002), PayPal still has a profitable franchise, with over $4 billion in net income in 2023. Its digital financial network of 220 million monthly active customers is one of the world’s largest, standing behind juggernauts like Apple Pay and China’s Alipay.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p>
<p>While PayPal has done dozens of acquisitions and entered nearly as many new business lines, more than 60% of its $14 billion in gross profits still comes from the PayPal button, according to Autonomous Research. That’s the icon people click to pay for anything from tchotchkes on eBay or Etsy to diapers from Target. Many users still see it as a safer way to transact instead of trusting an unfamiliar website or person. But transaction growth for PayPal’s branded button is slowing–last year, it grew just 7% in dollar terms, compared with about 9% for ecommerce overall.</p>
<p>From the outside, that button appears largely the same as it did years ago. “The core business is still effectively the cash of the internet–payments 1.0,” says FT Partners managing director Craig Maurer. Part of the problem seems to be that PayPal has long struggled to modernize and integrate disjointed parts of its payments technology. Meanwhile, the risk and fraud-prevention benefits that have buoyed PayPal for so long have ceased to be the competitive advantages they once were, with products like Apple Pay and Shopify’s Shop Pay taking a growing share of the market.</p>
<p>Now Chriss, who was awarded a $42 million pay package by PayPal in 2023 (part of which is contingent on the company’s future performance), is hanging his hat on new strategies, including a “Fastlane” product to speed up guest checkout. But some analysts are skeptical of the impact it will have on profits and think the plan will take much longer to make a difference than investors realize.</p><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light">

<p><abbr class="drop-cap color-accent font-accent">B</abbr>efore Alex Chriss took over at PayPal, former American Express executive Dan Schulman ran it for nine years, nearly quadrupling PayPal’s yearly revenue to $30 billion and growing earnings per share from under $1.00 to $3.85, according to FactSet. Yet today, in retrospect, some Wall Street analysts fault Schulman for going in too many directions.</p>
<p>They point to acquisitions that haven’t seemed to pay off, such as iZettle, a Swedish company that makes point-of-sale checkout devices, which PayPal paid $2.2 billion for in 2018, and Hyperwallet, bought for $400 million the same year, which makes payout technology for ecommerce platforms.

<p>Schulman, 66, who owns about $40 million worth of PayPal shares, told<em> Forbes </em>some acquisitions have worked out “extraordinarily well” while acknowledging others have done worse than expected. He adds that acquisitions sometimes take longer to create value, noting that Honey is the foundation for a new advertising technology product that PayPal <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2024-05-28-PayPal-Announces-New-Leaders-to-Build-New-Advertising-Platform-and-Accelerate-Consumer-Product-Innovation" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2024-05-28-PayPal-Announces-New-Leaders-to-Build-New-Advertising-Platform-and-Accelerate-Consumer-Product-Innovation" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2024-05-28-PayPal-Announces-New-Leaders-to-Build-New-Advertising-Platform-and-Accelerate-Consumer-Product-Innovation" aria-label="recently announced">recently announced</a>.</p>
<p>Asked if he took on too many different priorities, Schulman responds: “Every year, we looked at what we were trying to drive and tried to do fewer things, rather than more things. It's not always easy to do.” He adds, “Alex Chriss is doing an outstanding job coming into the company. One of the big reasons why I left was that I had been there almost a decade. You want somebody coming in thinking about things differently, thinking boldly, seeing where you can leverage what's already been done.”</p>
<p>Venmo is another actively debated topic in PayPal’s history. In 2013, two years before PayPal spun off from eBay and a year before Schulman took over as PayPal CEO, eBay purchased white-label payment processor Braintree and the upstart peer-to-peer payment app Braintree owned, Venmo, for $800 million. In 2023, Venmo did $270 billion in transactions, according to Autonomous, but the revenue it produces and its margins are anemic compared with PayPal’s main business.</p>
<p>That’s partially because monetization means trying to get customers to use Venmo’s credit card and to use the app like a neobank, for outgoing purchases (as opposed to just transfers within the Venmo system)—two categories where competition is already steep. Meanwhile, PayPal has had trouble integrating Venmo with the core PayPal platform to create synergy.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-2"><p id="article-0-topx-2"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>At his final investor conference in June 2023, Schulman’s response to a question from FT Partners’ Craig Maurer shed light on PayPal’s ongoing challenges to integrate its fragmented payments infrastructure. Schulman said it was a problem he had been working on since he arrived at PayPal in 2014. PayPal alone had four different payment stacks, while Venmo and Braintree each had their own separate payment rails. “The goal, starting eight years ago, was to bring all of these together onto a single modern payment platform,” Schulman said. “It's like open-heart surgery on us while we're running a marathon, because it's our payment-processing stack. It can't go down for a second.”</p>
<p>The disparate systems made it difficult to scale efficiently and forced a “tremendous” number of engineers to focus on just fixing things, Schulman said. “It's been a long, hard slog, honestly, on that, but we are finished,” he added, noting that PayPal, Venmo and Braintree were finally on the same payment rails, and the company could “start to do a ton of things that we could not do with that legacy infrastructure that we had in place before, including things like interoperability between Venmo [and] PayPal.”</p>
<p>In essence, it took PayPal eight years to integrate two of its own systems, and in all that time, the company couldn’t accomplish it with its own home-grown tech–they still needed help from a Visa product called Visa+ to supplement the integration. “It was a stunning admission,” Maurer says. Schulman counters today, “It was a very complex, highly detailed migration that needed to be implemented and stress-tested with each piece of the architecture … Without all of that hard work that had to go perfectly, there is no way that PayPal can now innovate on top of a modern tech stack.”</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-3"><p id="article-0-topx-3"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>PayPal stopped reporting Venmo’s revenue after 2021, when it was roughly $900 million, likely a sign that growth has languished. Beyond Venmo, the integration challenges may also help explain why PayPal has had trouble maximizing returns from more of its acquisitions.</p><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light">

PayPal’s total unbranded payment processing unit, most of which is driven by Braintree, did $534 billion in transactions in 2023 (compared with $1 trillion for Stripe), up from $299 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>The problem? PayPal has gotten there partly by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2023/10/11/inside-paypals-billion-dollar-battle-for-payment-processing-dominance" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2023/10/11/inside-paypals-billion-dollar-battle-for-payment-processing-dominance" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2023/10/11/inside-paypals-billion-dollar-battle-for-payment-processing-dominance" aria-label="pursuing a risky strategy">pursuing a risky strategy</a> of undercutting competitors on price; it only collects about 0.20% of the value of each transaction, compared with 1.5% to 2% for PayPal branded transactions, analysts say. Darrin Peller, a managing director at Wolfe Research, says PayPal has gotten less aggressive on pricing under Alex Chriss and that investors today are largely focused on profitability, which is not Braintree’s strong suit.</p>
<p>Ken Suchoski, an analyst at Autonomous Research, argues Schulman didn’t innovate enough on PayPal’s branded checkout button during his tenure. Schulman, of course, strongly disagrees. He says that during his time as CEO, PayPal made big improvements in areas like speed, number of clicks to make a transaction, features offered and fraud prevention. He notes that PayPal had an “antiquated tech stack” when he took over, and he oversaw an overhaul of its code that allowed it to go from two hundred software updates a year to tens of thousands of annual updates.</p>
<p>PayPal’s share of the $6 trillion global ecommerce market fell from a peak of 8% in 2021 to 7% in 2023, according to Suchoski. Apple Pay, which is likely the fastest and easiest payment method to use in America today due to its integration with the iPhone, has gone from a 0.5% share to 3% in just five years. Shop Pay, Shopify’s payment app that’s also well integrated with its ecommerce ecosystem, has reached a 1% share over the same period, Suchoski says.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-4"><p id="article-0-topx-4"></p></fbs-ad><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light">
<p><abbr class="drop-cap color-accent font-accent">D</abbr>uring earnings calls and interviews, Alex Chriss has been calling 2024 “a transition year.” He said in April, “We have a plan that will return this company to where it needs to be,” and Wall Street analysts are giving him credit for being more focused than Schulman.</p>
<p>One of the core tenets of Chriss’ plan is Fastlane, a new product that began development under Schulman and aims to make guest checkout–that is, checkout at a site where a buyer isn’t registered–faster. It allows customers not using the PayPal button to save their shipping and credit card information so that when they return for future purchases, they only need to enter their email and a verification code sent to their cell phone.</p>
<p>Chriss has said that 60% of ecommerce transactions are guest checkouts, and nearly 50% of those are typically abandoned. But PayPal has seen a much higher 80% of those who start a guest checkout continue to a purchase in early instances of customers using Fastlane.</p>
<p>Those statistics sound promising, especially since the total addressable market for guest checkout transactions is in the trillions. But since this is an unbranded PayPal product, there’s a big question around how much Chriss will be able to charge merchants for the feature and how much profit it will really drive. “We may get very aggressive on the pricing side when it comes to Fastlane for 2024, because we want to drive adoption,” Chriss said in April. Then he gave a vague assurance regarding profitability: “Rest assured, we'll be pricing to value over time to ensure that we get the right value from that.”</p>
<p>Initially, analysts expect PayPal will be charging large customers prices similar to what it charges for Braintree, around 0.20%. Then it needs small businesses to sign on, because it can charge them much higher rates per transaction. Add that challenge to the fact that this feature isn’t yet widely available, plus a structural industry shift toward larger merchants, and analysts at Autonomous and FT Partners think it will be years before Fastlane can make a meaningful difference. “If expectations are that Fastlane will have a material impact on the holiday season of 2024, I think that might be too aggressive … It will be the back half of 2025 before we’ll really know if Fastlane is building momentum,” Maurer says.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-5"><p id="article-0-topx-5"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>Others are more optimistic. Mizuho recently upgraded PayPal’s stock from a neutral rating to a buy, with senior analyst Dan Dolev estimating that PayPal will eventually be able to charge 0.70% of each transaction for Fastlane and that the product will add $1 to $1.5 billion to its annual $14 billion in gross profits over the next 18 months or so.</p>
<p>Dolev also says the PayPal button’s market-share losses have stabilized based on Mizuho’s research of web traffic for top retailers. He takes comfort in that trend. “You don’t want it to become a melting ice cube in the oven. Right now, the evidence suggests it’s like a melting ice cube in the fridge. You can live with that,” he says. In a recent research report, he also commented on this apparent leveling-off, saying, “This may mean the worst of share loss to Apple Pay and others is in the past, and is likely already reflected in the stock.”</p>
<p>More bullish analysts like Dolev estimate that PayPal will grow its gross profit by 6% to 7% in 2025 and 2026, while folks like Ken Suchoski–who is the only analyst with an underperform rating on the stock, out of roughly 45 total analysts who cover PayPal, according to Bloomberg–expect gross profit to grow more slowly, at 3% to 4% over the next two and a half years. (Twenty of those analysts have more neutral ratings on PayPal such as “neutral,” “hold” and “market perform.”) It might be encouraging that only one analyst expects the stock to underperform, if it weren’t down so much–it’s off about twice as much as the average public fintech stock over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Suchoski thinks payments investors can do better by buying stocks like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/fiserv/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/companies/fiserv/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/companies/fiserv/" aria-label="Fiserv">Fiserv</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/fis/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/companies/fis/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/companies/fis/" aria-label="FIS">FIS</a>, which, he says, are trading at similar valuation multiples as PayPal, aren’t facing the same competitive pressures and are growing revenues by up to 8% a year. “You can basically buy a business at the same price as PayPal, but they're delivering on top-line growth, and you don't have the execution risk of trying to turn this thing around as you do with PayPal.”</p>
<p>Since earlier this year, Alex Chriss seems to have already gotten more conservative—he’s no longer telling people PayPal will shock them. “He’s been trying to set the bar low and then slowly but surely raise it,” says Wolfe Research’s Darrin Peller. “It’s a better way to approach the stock.”</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-6"><p id="article-0-topx-6"></p></fbs-ad>

<li><strong>Nvidia's stock volatility</strong>: Nvidia's stock price went on a wild ride this week, reversing direction from all-time highs and sparking debate about the company's ability to sustain its record-setting rally.</li>
<li><strong>Bank of America's outlook</strong>: Bank of America reiterated its Buy rating and $150 price target for Nvidia, calling it a "top pick" and predicting that any volatility will be short-lived.</li>
<li><strong>Competition concerns</strong>: Nvidia faces increased competition, not only from merchant silicon providers like AMD and Intel, but also from homegrown competition from companies like Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure, which could impact its pricing power.</li>
<li><strong>Profitability concerns</strong>: Investors should be watchful for signs of a pullback and focus on the downstream profitability that software companies like Adobe, Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow are making or not making. If these companies aren't generating more revenue from AI features, the boom could come to an end.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia's market value</strong>: Nvidia's market capitalization briefly surpassed Microsoft's, but then dipped to around $3.12 trillion, below Microsoft's $3.33 trillion.</li>

<li>
<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Federal Reserve Board (FRB) have reviewed the resolution plans (also known as "living wills") of the 8 largest and most complex banks in the US, submitted in July 2023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agencies have identified weaknesses in the plans of four banks: Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase. These weaknesses are considered "shortcomings", which raise questions about the feasibility of the plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FDIC has determined that Citigroup's plan has a "deficiency", meaning it is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the US Bankruptcy Code, while the FRB has deemed it to have only a "shortcoming".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agencies provided feedback letters to each of the 8 banks, outlining the weaknesses and deficiencies identified in their plans. The banks will need to address these issues to ensure their plans are credible and feasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The weaknesses identified in the plans are related to the banks' strategy for orderly resolution in bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure. The resolution plans are meant to enhance financial stability by ensuring that large and complex banks can be resolved quickly and orderly in the event of a crisis.</p>

                <p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Federal Reserve Board today announced that, following their joint review of the July 2023 resolution plan submissions of the eight largest and most complex banks, they identified a weakness in the plans from Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase. The agencies did not identify any weaknesses in the plans from the other banks.</p>

<p>Resolution plans, also known as living wills, must describe a bank's strategy for orderly resolution in bankruptcy in the event of its material financial distress or failure. The agencies have jointly determined that each weakness identified in the 2023 plans from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase is a "shortcoming." A shortcoming is a weakness that raises questions about the feasibility of the plan.</p>

<p>The agencies jointly identified a weakness in the 2023 plan submitted by Citigroup, but reached different conclusions on its severity. The FDIC determined that the Citigroup plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and considers the weakness to be a "deficiency." A deficiency is a weakness that could undermine the feasibility of the plan. The Board concluded that the weakness is only a shortcoming. Under the resolution planning rule of the agencies, when one agency finds a shortcoming in a resolution plan and the other agency finds a deficiency, the plan is deemed to have a shortcoming. As a result, Citigroup's 2023 plan is considered to have a shortcoming. The agencies also previously identified a shortcoming in Citigroup's 2021 plan related to data quality and data management, and that shortcoming remains outstanding.</p>

<p>The agencies provided feedback letters to each of the eight banks that identify areas for continued development of banks' resolution strategies and capabilities. For the four banks with an identified shortcoming, the letters describe the specific weaknesses resulting in the shortcoming and the remedial actions required by the agencies. The shortcomings are to be addressed in the next resolution plans due by July 1, 2025. The feedback letters also specify that each bank, in its 2025 resolution plan submission, should address the topics of contingency planning and obtaining foreign government actions necessary to execute the resolution strategy.</p>

Announcements of cancellations for certain trains continued throughout the afternoon.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The changes come after a disastrous day of rail service disruptions and cancelations <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/amtrak-njtransit-rail-service-delayed-penn-station-due-overhead-wire/14981317/" target="_blank">on Thursday afternoon</a> on the Northeast Corridor.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">NJ Transit and Amtrak service was suspended just before 3 p.m. on Thursday due to power issues. A malfunctioning circuit breaker caused the widespread issue, resulting in a loss of power on the tracks between New York Penn Station and Newark Penn Station.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy"><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/nj-traffic-brush-fire-secaucus-impacting-traffic-new/14981424/" target="_blank">An unrelated brush fire in the area</a> complicated the repairs, according to NJ Transit.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">This was the latest in a string of incidents that have adversely impacted rail commuters.  <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/overhead-wire-issues-suspend-service-new-york-penn/14969643/" target="_blank">On Tuesday, NJ Transit and Amtrak commuters experienced delays and cancelations</a> due to overhead wire problems in the morning and later a stalled train outside Penn Station.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">NJ Transit and CEO Kevin Corbett released the following statement Friday afternoon, and called the issues "unacceptable."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"We are as frustrated as our customers, and the frequency and impact these issues are having on our customers' quality of life is clearly unacceptable. Regarding today's incident specifically, we've had rail maintenance supervisors positioned at Newark Penn Station to inspect trains in light of the recent incidents. The train involved was inspected thoroughly before leaving Newark, including the pantograph, and no defects were found," Corbett said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Corbett went on to say that they are working with Amtrak to identify root causes of the recent spate of incidents.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"For instance, Amtrak reported that yesterday's incident was caused by one of their circuit breakers impacting power between Philadelphia and New Haven," Corbett said. "What we can say is that we operate approximately 700 trains every weekday along hundreds of miles of track on 11 rail lines with the same equipment and these incidents are mainly occurring on just this one stretch of track on the NEC between Newark and New York. We continue to offer Amtrak our assistance to resolve the issue."</p><div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "><div class="WrapperInlineVideo"><div class="VideoCaption nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU eEzcu lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"><p class="HXPPJ barbu IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "><span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"><span><span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ ">Josh Einiger has details on the construction pause.</span></span></span></p></div></div></div><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">----------</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">*<strong class="vtkaO"><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/newsletters/" target="_blank"> Get Eyewitness News Delivered</a></strong></p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">*  <strong class="vtkaO"><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/manhattan/" target="_blank">More Manhattan news</a></strong></p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">* <strong class="vtkaO"><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://7ny.tv/submitnewstip" target="_blank">Send us a news tip</a></strong></p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">* <strong class="vtkaO"><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/apps/" target="_blank">Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts</a></strong></p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">*<strong class="vtkaO"><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrlIS7z20CnVaCrMvdkig_g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Follow us on YouTube</a></strong></p><h2 class="RxNCg PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq">Submit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News</h2><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The US government has announced plans to ban the sale of antivirus software made by Russian firm Kaspersky due to its alleged links to the Kremlin and the risk it poses to US infrastructure and services.</li>
<li>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo stated that the decision was taken due to Russia's "capacity and intent to collect and weaponise the personal information of Americans", citing the risk to US security.</li>
<li>The ban will effective ban downloads of software updates, resales, and licensing of Kaspersky products from September 29, and new business will be restricted within 30 days of the announcement. Sellers and resellers who violate the restrictions will face fines from the Commerce Department.</li>
<li>Kaspersky has denied any allegations of threatening US security and has indicated it will pursue "all legally available options" to fight the ban. The company has offices in 31 countries and services over 400 million users and 270,000 corporate clients worldwide.</li>
<li>This is not the first time the US government has targeted Kaspersky, as the Department of Homeland Security banned the company's flagship antivirus product from federal networks in 2017, alleging ties to Russian intelligence.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>FDA authorizes menthol-flavored e-cigarettes for adult smokers</strong>: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved four menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes from Njoy, a vaping brand owned by Altria, for use by adult smokers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acknowledge potential benefits for adult smokers</strong>: The FDA's decision recognizes that menthol e-cigarettes can help reduce the harms of traditional tobacco smoking, which is responsible for 480,000 US deaths annually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Criticism from parents and anti-tobacco groups</strong>: The decision has been met with criticism from parents and anti-tobacco groups, who argue that it could lead to increased youth vaping and undermine efforts to prevent the use of flavored e-cigarettes by teenagers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Youth vaping has declined in recent years</strong>: While there is still concern about youth vaping, the frequency of e-cigarette use among high schoolers has declined from all-time highs, with about 10% of high schoolers reporting e-cigarette use last year.</p>

E-cigarettes have been sold in the U.S. since 2007 but in recent years their potential benefits for smokers have been overshadowed by their use by adolescents and teens.</p><p>Parents and anti-tobacco groups immediately criticized the decision, which follows years of advocacy efforts to keep menthol and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/fda-vapes-vaping-elf-bar-juul-80b2680a874d89b8d651c5e909e39e8f">other flavors that can appeal to teens</a></span> off the market.</p>
    

<p>“This decision could mean we’ll never be able to close the Pandora’s box of the youth vaping epidemic,” said Meredith Berkman, co-founder of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes. “FDA has once again failed American families by allowing a predatory industry to source its next generation of lifetime customers — America’s children.”</p>



<p>Youth vaping has declined from all-time highs in recent years, with about 10% of high schoolers reporting e-cigarette use last year. Of those who vaped, 90% used flavors, including menthol.</p>
    
<p>All the e-cigarettes previously authorized by the FDA have been tobacco, which isn’t widely used by young people who vape.</p><p>Njoy is one of only three companies that previously received FDA’s OK for vaping products. Like those products, two of the Njoy menthol varieties come as cartridges that plug into a reusable device that heats liquid nicotine, turning it into an inhalable aerosol. The other two Njoy menthol products are disposable e-cigarettes.</p>
    

<p>Njoy’s products accounted for less than 3% of U.S. e-cigarette sales in the past year, according to retail data from Nielsen. Vuse, owned by Reynolds American, and Juul control about 60% of the market, while hundreds of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaping-ecigarettes-waste-environment-disposable-pollution-3d19dce9693ce78dd244729f524df02a">disposable brands</a></span> account for the rest.</p><p>Most teens who vape use disposable e-cigarettes, including brands like <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaping-elf-bar-ecigarettes-china-teens-77033584983ad47fc5795baa46b4705e">Elf Bar</a></span>, which come in flavors such as watermelon and blueberry ice.</p><p>Altria’s data showed Njoy e-cigarettes helped smokers reduce their exposure to the harmful chemicals in traditional cigarettes, the FDA said. The agency stressed the products are neither safe nor “FDA approved,” and that people who don’t smoke shouldn’t use them.</p><p>Friday’s action is part of a sweeping FDA review intended to bring scientific scrutiny to the multibillion-dollar vaping market after years of regulatory delays. Currently the U.S. market includes thousands of fruit- and candy-flavored vapes that are technically illegal but are widely available in convenience stores, gas stations and vape shops.</p><p>The FDA faced a self-imposed court deadline at the end of this month to wrap up its yearslong review of major vaping brands, including Juul and Vuse.</p>
    

<p>Those brands have been sold in the U.S. for years, awaiting FDA action on their scientific applications. To stay on the market, companies must show that their e-cigarettes provide an overall health benefit for smokers, without significantly appealing to kids.</p><p>“Based upon our rigorous scientific review, in this instance, the strength of evidence of benefits to adult smokers from completely switching to a less harmful product was sufficient to outweigh the risks to youth,” said Matthew Farrelly of FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.</p><p>Richmond-based Altria previously took a $13 billion stake in Juul in 2018, when the brand controlled most of the U.S. vaping market. But Juul’s value plummeted after it was hit with lawsuits and investigations over its role in sparking a national spike in underage vaping.</p><h2>___</h2><p>This story has been updated to correct that two of the four menthol e-cigarettes from Njoy are disposable products.</p><h2>___</h2><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

<ol>
<li><strong>Sarepta Therapeutics gains approval from FDA</strong>: The FDA has expanded the approval of Sarepta's Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, Elevidys, to nearly all patients with the condition.</li>
<li><strong>Company gains freedom to market the drug</strong>: With the broad approval, Sarepta has the freedom to sell its gene therapy almost without restrictions, allowing it to reach peak sales of $2-3 billion in the US.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty about benefits for Duchenne patients</strong>: While the approval is a positive development, it is unclear whether the drug will benefit boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a severe and debilitating genetic disorder.</li>
<li><strong>Criticism of FDA's decision</strong>: The unilateral decision by Peter Marks, the FDA's top regulator of gene therapies, to expand the approval has been criticized, with concerns that the agency's review process was not thorough enough.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on manufacturing capacity</strong>: The broad approval may impact Sarepta's manufacturing capacity, as the company will need to scale up production to meet the increased demand for its drug.</li>

That was a given, even before the Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/20/fda-sarepta-gene-therapy-elevidys-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy/">expanded approval</a> of the company’s Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug on Thursday. Will boys with Duchenne also benefit? I hope they do, but it’s uncertain. And is this a good look for the FDA? No, it is not.</p>
<p>There is much to unpack from the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/20/sarepta-duchenne-elevidys-fda-approval-peter-marks-overruled-staff/">unilateral decision</a> by Peter Marks, the FDA’s top regulator of gene therapies, to expand the use of Sarepta’s Elevidys to nearly all Duchenne patients. Some thoughts:</p>
<p>Sarepta is unshackled. The broad approval — its best-case scenario — gives the company freedom to sell its gene therapy almost without restrictions. Manufacturing capacity — and how fast it can be upgraded — might be one of the only brakes right now on Sarepta’s effort to hit peak U.S. sales of $2-3 billion.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Price</strong>: The Bugatti Tourbillon has a starting price of €3.8 million ($4.06 million), making it an extremely expensive car.</li>
<li><strong>Powertrain</strong>: The car features an 8.3-liter, naturally aspirated V16 engine producing 1,000 horsepower, paired with three electric motors producing an additional 800 HP.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: The Tourbillon has impressive acceleration and top speed, with 0-186 mph in less than 10 seconds, 0-62mph in less than 2 seconds, and a top speed of 277 mph.</li>
<li><strong>Electric range</strong>: The car has an all-electric range of only 37 miles, which is relatively short compared to other electric vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>Partially electric</strong>: The Bugatti Tourbillon is one of the first Bugattis to feature a partially electric powertrain, reflecting the company's move towards electrification, which is a trend seen in many sports car makers, including Bugatti Rimac, Porsche, Lamborghini, and Koenigsegg.</li>

<p>Bugatti is known for very fast, expensive, and extravagant <a href="https://mashable.com/category/cars" target="_self">cars</a>. The company is also known for upping the ante every time a new model is released, and the new Bugatti Tourbillon, launched on Friday, fits the profile perfectly. </p><p>The name tourbillon comes from the world of mechanic watches, where it means a cool-looking rotating thingy that makes the watch a little more accurate and far more expensive. On the Bugatti Tourbillon, it also indicates priciness — the car starts at €3.8 million ($4.06 million) — but it's mostly a nod towards those mechanical watch makers that dare to be different. </p><ins class="zmgad-full-width"><p data-pogo="incontent" id="incontent-1"></p></ins><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Bugatti Tourbillon is, indeed, very different, not only when compared to other cars, but also other Bugattis.</p><p>It's the first Bugatti in decades that's not powered by a turbocharged W16 engine, instead coming with an 8.3-liter, naturally aspirated V16 engine that produces 1,000 horsepower, and paired with three electric motors (two in the front, one in the back) producing an additional 800 HP. </p>

<p>Not all of the numbers are available yet, but what we do know is pretty nuts: top speed is 277 mph, the car goes from 0-186 mph in less than 10 seconds and from 0-62mph in less than two seconds. The only metric where your electric Volkswagen may fare better is the all-electric range, which is just 37 miles for the Tourbillon. </p><ins class="zmgad-full-width"><p data-pogo="incontent" id="incontent-4"></p></ins><p>The fact that the Bugatti is now partially electric is no surprise given that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/rimac-bugatti" target="_self">Bugatti is now a part of Bugatti Rimac</a>, with CEO Mate Rimac known for its electric supercar, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/rimac-nevera" target="_self">Rimac Nevera</a>. It's also a very strong trend, with sports car makers such as Porsche, Lamborghini, or Koenigsegg all going fully or partially electric in the past couple of years. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p class="mt-2 subtitle-2 font-sans ">
<span class="normal-case text-gray-1000">Wait, where are all the screens?</span>

</p>
</div><ins class="zmgad-full-width"><p data-pogo="incontent" id="incontent-5"></p></ins>
<p>But inside, the Tourbillon is defiantly non-electric-looking, instead opting for a car interior equivalent of a pricy mechanical watch. Among the many analog gizmos inside, the one that catches the eye is the instrument cluster, which is placed inside of the steering wheel yet remains fixed as you turn the wheel. It looks odd, yeah, but we guess it's the sort of thing people with $4 million to burn on a car may be looking for. </p>
<ins class="zmgad-full-width"><p data-pogo="incontent" id="incontent-6"></p></ins>
<p>The details make a car like the Tourbillon, and there are tons to soak in. The materials are, of course, the most expensive you can get; as Christophe Piochon, president of Bugatti, said in a press release, "If you see a piece of what you think is titanium, then that’s what it is." This especially goes for that instrument cluster, which is constructed from titanium as well as gemstones like sapphire and ruby, as well as the center console, which is a "blend of crystal gass and aluminum." Oh, and Bugatti's engineers even thought to increase the storage space compared to the Chiron, though you will have to buy bespoke Bugatti luggage to take full advantage of that. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p class="mt-2 subtitle-2 font-sans ">
<span class="normal-case text-gray-1000">If you think it's titanium, then that's what it is. The trick is in never allowing yourself to think of cheap materials. </span>

</div><ins class="zmgad-full-width"><p data-pogo="incontent" id="incontent-7"></p></ins>
<p>The Bugatti Tourbillon has now entered its "testing phase," with prototypes already on the road. Customer deliveries are planned for 2026; Bugatti says that 250 units will be made (by hand, of course), and Rimac says they're all "mostly" sold out already.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Change said it was still in the “late stages” of its review of the stolen data to determine what was taken and that more affected individuals may be identified. Some of the stolen information may relate to guarantors who paid healthcare bills for someone else, the company said.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company added that affected individuals should receive notice by mail beginning late July.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The ransomware attack on Change Healthcare stands as one of the largest-ever known digital thefts of U.S. medical records. While the full impact of this data breach remains unclear, the ramifications for the millions of Americans whose private medical information was irretrievably compromised are likely incalculable.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Change said it secured a copy of the stolen dataset in March to review for identifying and notifying affected individuals, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/change-healthcare-stolen-patient-data-ransomhub-leak/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/change-healthcare-stolen-patient-data-ransomhub-leak/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="5" mrfobservableid="d65c5cd1-c3fc-4225-af30-240392062f0e">TechCrunch previously reported was obtained in exchange for paying a ransom demand</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/unitedhealth-change-healthcare-hackers-substantial-proportion-americans/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/unitedhealth-change-healthcare-hackers-substantial-proportion-americans/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="6" mrfobservableid="da7a80d3-38e1-416d-b317-3bc62052d9ae">UnitedHealth confirmed it paid at least one ransom demand</a> to the cybercriminal group behind the ransomware attack, known as ALPHV, in an effort to prevent the publication of the stolen files. Another hacking group called RansomHub demanded an additional payment from UnitedHealth after claiming ALPHV made off with the first ransom payment but left the stolen data with one of its affiliates — essentially a contractor — who broke in and deployed the ransomware on Change’s systems.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">RansomHub <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/change-healthcare-stolen-patient-data-ransomhub-leak/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/change-healthcare-stolen-patient-data-ransomhub-leak/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="5" mrfobservableid="b0e636cc-ba94-4d7f-a6e5-474966ff1fe9">subsequently published several files on its dark web leak site</a> and threatened to sell the data to the highest bidder if another ransom wasn’t paid. </p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">According to UnitedHealth chief executive Andrew Witty, the hackers broke into Change Healthcare’s network using a set of stolen credentials to an internal system that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/30/uhg-change-healthcare-ransomware-compromised-credentials-mfa/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/30/uhg-change-healthcare-ransomware-compromised-credentials-mfa/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="7" mrfobservableid="836138b0-2e0c-456a-a0f4-cc1b20de6312">not protected with multi-factor authentication</a>, a security feature that makes it more difficult for malicious hackers to misuse stolen passwords.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The ransomware attack cost UnitedHealth around $870 million in the first three months of the year, during which the company made $100 billion in revenue, according to the company’s earnings report. UnitedHealth is expected to report its most recent earnings in mid-July.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trump Media's share price drops</strong>: The share price of Trump Media, the company founded by former President Donald Trump, has dropped significantly since his conviction on May 30, from around $50 to just over $25, a decline of over 25%.</li>
<li><strong>Share dilution contributes to price fall</strong>: The company's move to dilute existing shares by issuing over 14 million new shares, which was approved by the SEC, has further contributed to the price drop, causing existing investors to see their holdings decrease in value.</li>
<li><strong>Trump Media plans to raise $250M</strong>: The company plans to use the funds raised from the issuance of new shares to grow its holdings, improve its platform, and potentially make mergers and acquisitions.</li>
<li><strong>Trump's net worth affected</strong>: As the largest individual investor in Trump Media, Trump is significantly impacted by the price fluctuations, which could affect his net worth, estimated to be around $3-6 billion, which is tied to his stake in the company.</li>

								<input type="hidden" id="article_url" value="2024/06/21/media-stock-tumbles-post-conviction-amid-share-dilution/">
																
								<p>The former president’s media company has seen a share price crash following his May 30 felony conviction for falsifying business records to hide hush money payments, but a recent move to dilute existing shares plunged the stock even lower.</p>
<p>A poisonous message to existing investors in a <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2660/0001140361-24-030534.htm" target="_blank">Tuesday filing</a>, that the SEC had green-lit the firm to create and sell more than 14 million new shares, sent the price tumbling.</p>
<p>The Truth Social parent company went public in March, revealing its 2023 revenue of $4.1 million and losses of $58.2 million, climbing to a peak valuation of over $66 per share that month. </p>
<p>Shares were trading well over $50 in the days leading up to the verdict before 12 jurors found Trump guilty on all 34 counts of the charges stemming from his attempts to cover up an affair. Losing nearly a third of its valuation, Trump Media pushed forward on its April plan to print more shares.</p>
<p>Today, shares sit at just over $25, down over 25% since Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>The move, which diluted existing investors’ holdings in the company, enables the organization to collect, per their estimate, just under $250 million from stock sales. Trump Media plans to use that new cash to grow its holdings, it says.</p>
<p>“With our S-1 declared effective, we’re expecting to be well positioned to energetically pursue TV streaming, other enhancements to the platform, and potential mergers and acquisitions,” Trump Media <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/04/19/media-ceo-devin-nunes-blasted-by-megadonors-hedge-fund/">CEO Devin Nunes</a> wrote in an announcement.</p>
<p>Trump Media has been closely tied to the former president’s net worth, with the $3-6 billion stake reportedly making up over half of his wealth. As the largest individual investor in the group, he is <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/03/22/cashes-in-on-truth-social-meme-stock--but-cant-use-the-money-to-pay-454-million-penalty/" target="_blank">especially sensitive</a> to price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Trump Media, and Trump’s holding in it, were mired in speculation from the group’s start, holding associations with a <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/05/03/media-audit-firm-charged-with-fraud/">fraudster accounting firm</a> and bucking charges that it serves merely as a cash-funneling service for the former president’s allies.</p>

<li>The Butch Lewis Act, a part of President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan, has saved over 1 million union workers' and retirees' pensions from being cut as of Friday, according to the White House.</li>
<li>The law, enacted in 2021, will ultimately stop cuts to the retirement benefits of 2 million workers and retirees across the country, preventing massive economic damage.</li>

<p class="title">About the U.S. CPSC</p>

<p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risk of injury or death associated with the use of thousands of types of consumer products. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product-related incidents cost the nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC's work to ensure the safety of consumer products has contributed to a decline in the rate of injuries associated with consumer products over the past 50 years.</p>

<p>Federal law prohibits any person from selling products subject to a Commission ordered recall or a voluntary recall undertaken in consultation with the CPSC.</p>
