<ol>
<li>The 31 largest US banks have passed the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests, with all banks satisfying regulators that they could withstand a severe recession scenario.</li>
<li>Under the stress test scenario, the banks would lose nearly $685 billion and suffer their biggest hit to capital in six years, but would still meet regulatory minimum standards.</li>
<li>The stress test scenario involved a 40% decline in commercial real estate prices, a substantial rise in office vacancies, and a 36% fall in house prices, mimicking a severe recession with high unemployment (10%).</li>
<li>The banks can start providing updates on their new capital requirements on Friday afternoon, which may potentially impact dividend and buyback plans. Analysts estimate that some banks, such as Goldman and Bank of America, may see their capital requirements rise more than expected.</li>
<li>The goal of the stress tests is to ensure that banks have enough capital to absorb losses in a highly stressful scenario, as specified by Michael Barr, the Fed's vice-chair for supervision.</li>

In recent years, the nation’s largest banks have generally passed the tests, usually by a wide margin, raising questions about their usefulness and purpose. <br><br>Matthew Bisanz, a partner in the financial services practice at law firm Mayer Brown, said the tests’ reliance on capital buffers “focuses people on the wrong things”.</p><p>“Last March [2023], we saw three banks obliterated in one month,” he said, referring to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank and Signature Bank. “Yet all 31 of these banks survive a stress event that lasts nine quarters. This reinforces how unrealistic the stress test is.”</p><p>The results come during a renewed focus around capital levels at large US banks, with regulators weighing changes to its proposal to implement the so-called Basel III <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dca35571-2deb-4e2e-84fb-eb0bc1c37201" data-trackable="link">Endgame capital rules</a>. </p><p>The Fed’s initial proposal, which called for a significant increase in capital requirements, provoked an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/48555d55-ca6d-4ab8-ae29-aba4d4f10f13" data-trackable="link">aggressive lobbying effort</a> from large US banks. Fed chair Jay Powell has since said it would probably make material changes to the proposed new rules.</p><p>This year’s stress tests would push banks’ aggregate tier one capital ratio, their main cushion against losses, down by 2.8 percentage points — the biggest drop since 2018. </p><p>The Fed said the bigger losses were partly the result of an expectation of higher losses on credit card loans for the nation’s biggest banks, up nearly 20 per cent from a year ago. Banks’ corporate loan books also became riskier, as higher expenses and lower fees left lenders with less of a cushion to absorb a severe hit. </p><p>Another scenario, examining what would happen if five large hedge funds failed, showed the largest and most complex banks did have material exposure and were projected to lose between $13bn and $22bn in aggregate.</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Stephen Gandel in New York</em></p></article></div>

It reported results that fell shy of forecasts and cut its outlook. The company said it could close hundreds more stores in the next three years.</p>
    

<p>Jeans maker Levi Strauss sank 15.4% after its latest quarterly revenue results fell short of analysts’ expectations, along with its current earnings forecast for the year.</p><p>Spice maker McCormick rose 4.3% for one of the biggest gains in the market after beating analysts’ earnings forecasts.</p>

The figure is a slight revision from a prior estimate of 1.3%. It marks the slowest quarterly growth since spring 2022.</p><p>The report also backed data from previous economic reports that show consumers are getting squeezed by persistent inflation and high interest rates. Consumer spending, which has been fueling economic growth, grew at just a 1.5% rate, down from an initial estimate of 2%, according to the report.</p>
    

<p>The main upshot from the report is that “the economy remained resilient in the first quarter but that private sector demand growth was cooling, led by more consumer prudence,” said Gregory Daco, EY chief economist, in a note.</p><p>The slowdown in consumer spending could help further ease inflation, but too much of a slowdown could result in a more painful hit to the economy. The Federal Reserve is trying to time its efforts tame inflation back to its 2% target without slowing the economy so much that it slips into a recession.</p><p>The stock market has been listless this week in the lead up to Friday’s release of the next influential inflation report from the government. The personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE, is the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation.</p><p>Economists expect the report to show a modest easing of inflation to 2.6% in May, following a 2.7% reading in April. That’s down from the PCE’s peak of 7.1% in the middle of 2022. Other measures of inflation, including the consumer price index, have also eased significantly over the last two years.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Recall of over 270,000 Volkswagen vehicles</strong>: Volkswagen is recalling 271,330 model year 2021-2024 Atlas SUVs and model year 2020-2024 Atlas Cross Sport vehicles due to an issue with the passenger occupant detection system (PODS) that could lead to the front passenger airbag not working properly.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of injury in an accident</strong>: Until the issue is fixed, passengers are advised to avoid sitting in the front passenger seat "whenever possible" because the issue poses an "increased risk of injury" in the event of an accident.</li>
<li><strong>Symptoms of the issue</strong>: If the recalled vehicle has the wiring contact fault, the instrument panel warning light will come on together with an acoustic warning sound, and an error message will be displayed in the instrument panel.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Volkswagen will replace the PODS sensor mat and wiring harness with improved parts free of charge at authorized dealerships once parts are available.</li>
<li><strong>Notification</strong>: Affected customers will be notified through letters sent by Volkswagen, and owners can also contact the company or visit their website for more information about the recall.</li>

<ol>
<li>Arizona Beverages, the company that produces Arizona iced tea, has no plans to increase the price of its 23-ounce canned drinks above 99 cents, according to co-founder Don Vultaggio.</li>
<li>Vultaggio cited the company's success, debt-free status, and ownership of all its assets as reasons for maintaining the affordable price for its customers.</li>
<li>The company has maintained the 99-cent price for over three decades, since the early 1990s, and attributes its ability to keep prices low to its efficient production and shipping practices, as well as using thinner cans.</li>
<li>The 23-ounce cans of Arizona iced tea are sold in multiple locations across the US and Canada, and the company produces over 100 flavors of drinks, including new products like its alcoholic offerings.</li>
<li>The co-founder's decision to keep prices low is seen as a way to give back to consumers, who are facing inflationary pressures, and shows the company's commitment to its customers.</li>

But even a lost week, or slow week of sales, in June could affect overall second quarter sales for the dealer groups and automakers too, due to the historically strong end-of-June period.</p><p>“The CDK cyberattacks have thrown a monkey wrench into sales during the second half of June, affecting what is arguably one of the most lucrative and busiest times of the month and quarter for dealerships,” said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’s head of insights. “Although the impact of these attacks will be different from dealer to dealer, this event is another speed bump on the automotive industry’s long road to recovery.”</p><p>Caldwell noted that despite high interest rates and other headwinds, new vehicle sales were poised to be strong in Q2 due to healthier inventory levels and return of summertime incentives. However, like JD Power, Edmunds now expects sales to be pushed to Q3, meaning sales losses could be recovered.</p><p>With Q2 earnings season coming up next month, investors will get a clearer picture of the cyberattack’s impact on dealership group-level sales and overall quarterly deliveries for volume automakers like Ford, GM, and Toyota.</p><p><em>Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

<li><strong>Costco's success and impact on Sam's Club</strong>: The article notes that Costco's private brand, Kirkland Signature, has been successful, and Sam's Club CEO Chris Nicholas admits that the rival's success has inspired Sam's Club to revamp its own private brand, Member's Mark.</li>

The label’s makeover has become critical for Sam’s Club as it aims to close the gap with Costco, which has roughly the same number of U.S. clubs but about twice as much annual revenue. Net sales for Sam’s Club totaled $86.2 billion in its most recent fiscal year, compared with $176.63 billion for Costco’s U.S. clubs.</p><p>Sam’s Club CEO Chris Nicholas told CNBC the brand’s revamp was inspired, in part, by the retailer’s chief rival.</p><p>“The club model survives because you have brilliant merchants focusing on creating or buying exceptional items,” he said in an interview. “Costco did such a great job of that over the years with Kirkland and we saw that be successful.”</p><p>The success of Member’s Mark will help determine how Sam’s Club fares as its expands, with plans to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/26/walmart-owned-sams-club-plans-to-open-new-stores.html">open more than 30 stores</a> over the next four years.

Consumers experimented with new brands during the Covid pandemic when they couldn’t find their typical purchases on shelves. Some fast-growing grocers, including Trader Joe’s, Aldi and Lidl, have fueled growth almost entirely through their own brands. And stubborn inflation also pushed more consumers to buy a store’s own brand to save some bucks.</p><p>Sales of private label increased 34% between 2019 and 2023 to $236.3 billion, according to the annual report by the Private Label Manufacturers Association, which is conducted by market research firm Circana.</p><p>Exclusive offerings, such as products you can’t find anywhere else, are even more essential for clubs, which require shoppers to pay a membership fee. Annual fees cost $60 at Costco and $50 at Sam’s Club. Each also has a higher-tier membership: $120 at Costco and $110 at Sam’s Club. (Costco is widely expected to raise its annual fee soon, based on its history of doing so.)</p><p>At Sam’s Club, Member’s Mark accounts for roughly 30% of sales in terms of dollars and more than one-third of sales in terms of units. Kirkland accounts for about 28% of Costco’s annual sales.</p><p>Costco declined interview requests for this story.</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107433604" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">Sam’s Club is trying to raise the quality of Member’s Mark.

It announced new goals for food and merchandise standards that it aims to reach in 2025, such as switching to antibiotic-free poultry and fair trade certified coffee beans.</p><p>And it recently launched a program that allows customers to help co-create Member’s Mark items by giving feedback on flavors, design and more before the retailer green lights an item for the shelf.</p><p>Nicholas said customers don’t hold back. “They are exacting, like, ‘Hey, this seam is not good enough or the stitching here needs to be better or this needs to be double stitched or you haven’t got enough lobster in your lobster mac [and cheese],’” he said.</p><p>Myron Frazier, Sam’s Club senior vice president of private brands and sourcing, said the company wants to turn Member’s Mark into a well-respected lifestyle brand. He said the store brand plans to go deeper in home categories, such as offering more indoor furniture and making its own line of small appliances.</p><p>To come up with popular items, he said merchants have sought out products that solve customers’ problems, such as easy meals like chicken rotisserie bites and mix-and-match kids’ clothing sets that can help parents on a hectic morning before school.</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107433598" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">Like Costco’s Kirkland Signature, Sam’s Club has a private brand that cuts across categories including grocery, home decor and apparel.

Sam’s Club does not share its membership number, but it has reported a record number of members in each consecutive quarter for more than a year.</p><p>Customer transactions rose 5.4% and the average ticket declined about 1% in the most recent quarter, which could point to shoppers opting more for Member’s Mark items. The products tend to cost less than national brands.</p><p>Nicholas said sales growth of the private brand has outpaced the rest of the store. He added that as its items gain popularity, the club gains leverage to push suppliers to lower prices or step up innovation.</p><p>On an earnings call last month, Walmart finance chief John David Rainey credited Member’s Mark for driving the quarter’s high single-digit growth and said it is “a growing reason why members join and renew.”</p><p>Product quality will help to determine whether the growth continues.</p><p>Since 2020, the year when Crozier’s pool broke, Member’s Mark has launched, tweaked and upgraded more than 1,200 items.</p><p>One of those reformulated items? Its inflatable pool.</p><p>Crozier said it works well now.

The company found that over the past 10 years, the average person’s deductible nearly doubled, and copays are rising as the majority of plans are adding another tier of drugs with higher copays.</p><p>It is a dynamic GoodRx deems “the big pinch.” High medication costs are coupled with reduced insurance coverage.

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Brent crude oil price surges</strong>: Brent crude oil price rose to over $86 per barrel on Thursday due to fears of an all-out war between Israel and Lebanon, which could lead to a significant escalation of proxy wars in the Middle East.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Escalating tensions</strong>: Iraq's Iran-backed militias have vowed to strike U.S. interests in the Middle East if Israel launches a large-scale campaign against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. The leader of a powerful Iran-backed militia in Iraq has said that American interests in the region will be targeted if Israel strikes.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Concerns about oil supply</strong>: Markets are concerned that a war between Israel and Lebanon would quickly turn into a significantly escalated proxy war in multiple venues with Iran, potentially threatening future oil supply. This could lead to a surge in oil prices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>U.S. inventory data</strong>: The previous day's disappointing U.S. inventory data, which showed a 3.6-million build in oil inventory, reduced demand optimism and added to concerns about oil supply, driving up the price of Brent crude oil.</p>

<p></p><p>German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Wednesday urged restraint, warning that any “miscalculation” could trigger an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, saying that “with every rocket across the Blue Line between Lebanon and Israel, the danger grows that a miscalculation could trigger a hot war,” The National reported. Earlier this week, the leader of Asaib Ahl al-Haq (League of the Righteous), a powerful Iran-backed militia in Iraq on the U.S. foreign terrorist organization list, told public TV that American interests in the region will be targeted if Israel strikes. </p><p>Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that with Gaza operations gradually winding down, the shift will now be to Lebanon and Hezbollah, as reported by CNN. </p><div>

Either way, let’s take a look at these vehicles to see if we can make some guesses about what they are. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component clear-both block md:float-left md:mr-30 md:w-[320px] lg:-ml-100"><div class="duet--article--article-pullquote mb-20"><p class="mb-10 h-[22px] w-[65px] bg-franklin"></p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup relative bg-repeating-lines-dark bg-[length:1px_1.2em] pb-8 font-polysans text-28 font-medium leading-120 tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20  dark:bg-repeating-lines-light dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple">It’s already been a pretty jam-packed 2024 for Rivian</p></div></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">First of all, Rivian’s shroud-covered vehicles look <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178404/tesla-vehicles-robotaxi-van-model-2-shareholder-shrouded">very similar to the ones Tesla</a> revealed during its company shareholder meeting earlier this month, which raises the possibility that both are just using the same tools in Photoshop to create these images. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Starting from the left, we have Rivian’s OG vehicles: the R1T truck, R1S SUV, and EDV (Electric Delivery Van) for Amazon. In the next column, we have the second-generation R1 vehicles that were announced earlier this month. On top of those, there’s our first mystery vehicle, which suggests the company could be working on an updated EDV built on the Gen 2 architecture. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Except that doesn’t really look like a van shape. It’s definitely more truck-shaped — although <em>InsideEVs</em> editor-in-chief (and former <em>Verge</em> contributor) Patrick George makes a <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/724547/rivian-future-vehicle-roadmap/">convincing argument</a> that we shouldn’t read too much into the various shapes. They could be stock images or just placeholders. If anything, Rivian could actively be trying to throw sleuths off the scent with these shapes. (Rivian spokesperson Liz Markman declined to comment on the mystery vehicles.)</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component clear-both block md:float-left md:mr-30 md:w-[320px] lg:-ml-100"><div class="duet--article--article-pullquote mb-20"><p class="mb-10 h-[22px] w-[65px] bg-franklin"></p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup relative bg-repeating-lines-dark bg-[length:1px_1.2em] pb-8 font-polysans text-28 font-medium leading-120 tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20  dark:bg-repeating-lines-light dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple">If anything, Rivian could actively be trying to throw sleuths off the scent</p></div></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">In the next column, we can see the R2 and R3, both of which were unveiled in March. There’s another mystery vehicle on top of that column. And all three vehicles will be built on an electrical architecture called “MSP,” which stands for “midsized platform.”</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">And then there’s the fourth column with three shrouded vehicles built on a platform simply called “Affordable Mass-Market.” How intriguing! Earlier this year, the R2 and R3 were billed as Rivian’s big play for affordable EVs, with the former starting at $45,000. Rivian hasn’t put a price on the R3 or the performance trim R3X except to say it will be less than the R2. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">So what are we to make of all of this? It seems likely that a few of these mystery vehicles will be trucks. Trucks are some of the bestselling vehicles in North America. Rivian’s first vehicle was the R1T. Trucks are in the company’s DNA. So does that mean we’re going to get an R2T or R3T or perhaps even X variants of both?

The company didn’t mention whether it was working on such a vehicle during the R2 announcement in March. And none of these silhouettes are instantly screaming “truck,” so it’s unclear whether that’s actually in the cards. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component clear-both block md:float-left md:mr-30 md:w-[320px] lg:-ml-100"><div class="duet--article--article-pullquote mb-20"><p class="mb-10 h-[22px] w-[65px] bg-franklin"></p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup relative bg-repeating-lines-dark bg-[length:1px_1.2em] pb-8 font-polysans text-28 font-medium leading-120 tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20  dark:bg-repeating-lines-light dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple">Trucks are in the company’s DNA</p></div></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Another thing to note is that the affordable mass-market vehicles are all different shapes. I know, we can’t trust the shapes! But this could still mean that there are at least small, medium, and large vehicles in the works for that category. That seems important.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">The fact that Rivian is working on a trio of vehicles that are <em>even cheaper</em> than the R2 and R3 is encouraging. Other automakers have stumbled in their attempts to produce truly affordable EVs. Tesla has gone <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122064/tesla-cancel-affordable-electric-vehicle-model-2-china">back</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138646/tesla-q1-2024-earnings-model-2-affordable-electric-vehicles">forth</a> on whether it will make a $25,000 “Model 2”-type vehicle. The Volvo EX30 is getting <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/723093/volvo-ex30-summer-tariffs-china/">caught up in the trade war with China</a> and likely won’t sell for its promised $35,000.

The company clearly doesn’t want to get pegged as an automaker that exclusively makes luxury vehicles on par with Land Rover or Mercedes-Benz, churning out expensive trucks and SUVs for the superrich. Still, it will need to break out of the <a href="https://heatmap.news./electric-vehicles/rivian-earnings-r2-release">“EV valley of death”</a> in which its costs exceed its revenue and start showing signs of long-term survivability before it can tackle that project. The lifeline from Volkswagen — $1 billion right away, with an additional $4 billion to follow — will certainly help in that effort. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">I like that despite its financial woes, Rivian is still playing the long game.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pending home sales decreased 2.1% in May</strong>: The Pending Home Sales Index (PHSI) decreased to 70.8 in May, a decline of 2.1% from the previous month. Year-over-year, pending transactions were down 6.6%.</li>
<li><strong>Regional breakdown</strong>: The Northeast and West regions saw gains in pending home sales, while the Midwest and South experienced declines. The Northeast PCI rose 1.1% to 63.6, while the South PCI fell 5.5% to 83.7.</li>
<li><strong>Economic forecast</strong>: NAR predicts mortgage rates will remain above 6% in 2024 and 2025, even with the Federal Reserve cuts to the Fed Funds rate. The association also forecasts an increase in existing-home sales and housing starts, as well as an increase in median existing and new home prices.</li>
<li><strong>Supply and demand dynamics</strong>: According to NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun, rising inventory and lower demand suggest easing home price appreciation in upcoming months. He also expects mortgage rates to descend in the second half of 2024, leading to greater home buying.</li>
<li><strong>Nationwide outlook</strong>: NAR anticipates the median existing-home price will reach a record annual high of $405,300 in 2024 and $412,000 in 2025, while the median new home price is expected to increase to $434,100 in 2024 and $441,200 in 2025.</li>

    <div><div class="field-item even"><p>WASHINGTON (June 27, 2024) – Pending home sales in May slipped 2.1%, according to the National Association of REALTORS®. The Midwest and South posted monthly losses in transactions while the Northeast and West recorded gains. Year-over-year, all U.S. regions registered reductions.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics/pending-home-sales">Pending Home Sales Index (PHSI)</a>* – a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings – decreased to 70.8 in May. Year over year, pending transactions were down 6.6%. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.</p>

<p>“The market is at an interesting point with rising inventory and lower demand,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “Supply and demand movements suggest easing home price appreciation in upcoming months. Inevitably, more inventory in a job-creating economy will lead to greater home buying, especially when mortgage rates descend.”</p>

<h2>U.S. Economic Forecast</h2>

<p>NAR predicts mortgage rates will remain above 6% in 2024 and 2025, even with the Federal Reserve cuts to the Fed Funds rate.</p>

<p>The association forecasts that existing-home sales will rise to 4.26 million in 2024 (from 4.09 million 2023) and to 4.92 million in 2025 (from 2024). Housing starts are expected to rise to 1.382 million in 2024 (from 1.413 million in 2023) and to 1.492 million in 2025 (from 2024).</p>

<p>NAR anticipates the median existing-home price will increase to a record annual high of $405,300 in 2024 (from $389,800 in 2023) and to $412,000 in 2025 (from 2024). NAR forecasts increases in the median new home price to $434,100 in 2024 (from $428,600 in 2023) and $441,200 in 2025 (from 2024).</p>

<p>“The first half of the year did not meet expectations regarding home sales but exceeded expectations related to home prices,” explained Yun. “In the second half of 2024, look for moderately lower mortgage rates, higher home sales and stabilizing home prices.”</p>

<p>Pending Home Sales Regional Breakdown</p>

<p>The Northeast PHSI ascended 1.1% from last month to 63.6, a decline of 2.3% from May 2023. The Midwest index dropped 0.4% to 70.4 in May, down 5.6% from one year ago.</p>

<p>The South PHSI lowered 5.5% to 83.7 in May, falling 10.4% from the prior year. The West index increased 1.4% in May to 56.7, down 2.1% from May 2023.</p>

<p>*The Pending Home Sales Index is a leading indicator for the housing sector, based on pending sales of existing homes. A sale is listed as pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction has not closed, though the sale usually is finalized within one or two months of signing.</p>

<p>Pending contracts are good early indicators of upcoming sales closings. However, the amount of time between pending contracts and completed sales is not identical for all home sales. Variations in the length of the process from pending contract to closed sale can be caused by issues such as buyer difficulties with obtaining mortgage financing, home inspection problems, or appraisal issues.</p>

<p>The index is based on a sample that covers about 40% of multiple listing service data each month. In developing the model for the index, it was demonstrated that the level of monthly sales-contract activity parallels the level of closed existing-home sales in the following two months.</p>

<p>An index of 100 is equal to the average level of contract activity during 2001, which was the first year to be examined. By coincidence, the volume of existing-home sales in 2001 fell within the range of 5.0 to 5.5 million, which is considered normal for the current U.S. population.</p>

<p></p>

<p>NOTE: Existing-Home Sales for June will be released July 23. The next Pending Home Sales Index will be released June 31. All release times are 10 a.m. Eastern. View the NAR Statistical News Release Schedule.</p>

Mann Jr., a former airline executive officer and current president of R. W. Mann and Co., an independent airline consultancy, told USA TODAY in an email. Mann said he does not have inside information about the changes Boeing is working on internally, but his comments referred to the company's culture more generally. </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Boeing insists it’s turning that corner. Here are some of the changes it said it’s making:</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Enhancing training</h2><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221668007-boeing-renton-80.JPG?width=980&amp;height=654&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221668007-boeing-renton-80.JPG?width=1960&amp;height=1308&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Moushmi Sharma trains on electrical wiring at the Foundational Training Center on June 25, 2024, in Renton, Washington."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Moushmi Sharma trains on electrical wiring at the Foundational Training Center on June 25, 2024, in Renton, Washington." data-c-credit="Jennifer Buchanan, The Seattle Times"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">According to Elizabeth Lund, Boeing's senior vice president of quality, the company’s first step to fixing its safety culture is changing the way it conducts training.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Lund told the 50 or so international journalists who attended Tuesday’s briefing that a production slowdown following the 737 Max crashes, followed by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in high turnover on the factory floors, leading to a glut of newly hired workers with less experience. To address the resulting change in the company’s demographics, Lund said, it’s reinforcing its peer mentoring program.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“We knew we brought in thousands of new employees,” she said, “We have really strengthened on-the-job training. That’s the really hands-on part … you go to the floor and you really learn how to do your job.” </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Before on-the-job training, however, Boeing factory employees undergo a reinvigorated foundational training regime where they learn the basics of their factory tasks before moving to the production line. According to Lund, every employee who comes out of foundational training gets assigned a mentor with more experience on the factory floor. </p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Simplifying processes</h2><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221665007-boeing-renton-15.JPG?width=980&amp;height=654&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221665007-boeing-renton-15.JPG?width=1960&amp;height=1308&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality at Boeing, speaks to the media at the Boeing 737 factory on June 25 in Renton, Wash."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality at Boeing, speaks to the media at the Boeing 737 factory on June 25 in Renton, Wash." data-c-credit="Jennifer Buchanan, The Seattle Times"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Lund said that Boeing is also trying to streamline its production processes and instruction documents to make them easier for new hires to learn. </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Lund explained that because of Boeing’s multigeneration fleet types, like the 737, the first version of which was produced in the 1960s, some documents and production standards are amalgamations of previous best practices. Now, the company is evaluating many of its existing workflows, starting with the most safety-critical aspects, to ensure that they are efficient and easier to replicate. </p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Eliminating defects</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Another key part of Boeing’s safety updates is trying to identify and address defects as soon as possible in the production chain. Part of that work includes sending more Boeing inspectors to its own suppliers to ensure that parts, like the fuselage produced by Spirit AeroSystems that was implicated in the Alaska Airlines incident in January, are defect-free before they even reach Boeing property. </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It also means being more prepared to stop the production line when a defect is identified if it’s not easily remedied.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221671007-boeing-renton-23.JPG?width=980&amp;height=654&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221671007-boeing-renton-23.JPG?width=1960&amp;height=1308&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="737 MAX aircraft are seen in various states of assembly at the Boeing 737 factory on June 25 in Renton, Wash."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="737 MAX aircraft are seen in various states of assembly at the Boeing 737 factory on June 25 in Renton, Wash." data-c-credit="Jennifer Buchanan, The Seattle Times"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Get quality right, via quality control, quality assurance, root cause identification and resolution, and it resolves the rest of the present issues,” Mann said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Boeing’s 737 fuselages go through a 10-day production workflow on the factory floor. They move ahead day by day from the moment they enter the factory to the day they’re ready to roll out to the paint shop. </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">During the tour, a Boeing employee pointed out that the day-five slot was empty on the production line. A few days earlier, employees had identified an issue with a fuselage that was being worked on. Under Boeing’s previous practices, the semi-built aircraft may have moved ahead and the defects would have been addressed literally down the line. But now Boeing is putting greater emphasis on keeping airplanes in place until they pass a quality inspection each day that aims to guarantee they won’t need major retroactive fixes.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“We have seen up to an 80% reduction in defects” since implementing these changes, Lund said.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/travel/airline-news/2024/06/27/boeing-pulls-back-the-curtain-on-safety-changes/74223445007/" data-t-l=":l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - Behind the scenes at Boeing production facility" data-g-r="nav_mo" data-g-tn="pgcss" data-g-mtn="pg74223445007" data-g-moh="hpgm" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" data-c-id="74223445007"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74223321007-3417.JPG?crop=1199,675,x0,y62&amp;width=660&amp;height=372&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt=""><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="27"><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg__ca"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"></use></svg><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_expand"></use></svg></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="Behind the scenes at Boeing production facility" aria-label="In a tightly choreographed media open house of its Renton, Washington, manufacturing facility, Boeing said it’s facing its safety challenges head-on."></p></a><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Strengthening Boeing’s safety culture</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Lund acknowledged that Boeing only began implementing an official safety management system in 2019. The FAA defines a safety management system as “the formal, top-down, organization-wide approach to managing safety risk and assuring the effectiveness of safety risk controls. It includes systematic procedures, practices, and policies for the management of safety risk,” and it’s a standard practice at many airlines and other companies in the aviation industry.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Boeing still has not fully rolled out its safety management system, but Lund said the company is committed to finalizing that work, echoing promises the airframer made in the wake of the 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“How do we make sure we’re not doing anything that could cause an airplane safety issue later on? We’re documenting it, we’re reviewing it,” Lund said. </p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221669007-boeing-renton-35.JPG?width=980&amp;height=654&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221669007-boeing-renton-35.JPG?width=1960&amp;height=1308&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="737 MAX aircraft are seen in various states of assembly at the Boeing 737 factory on June 25 in Renton, Wash."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="737 MAX aircraft are seen in various states of assembly at the Boeing 737 factory on June 25 in Renton, Wash." data-c-credit="Jennifer Buchanan, The Seattle Times"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Boeing has also been in the spotlight for its handling of whistleblower complaints. Several current and former employees have come forward alleging safety lapses at the company, and saying they were retaliated against for reporting their concerns.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">While testifying on Capitol Hill earlier this month, <a href="/story/travel/news/2024/06/18/boeing-ceo-dave-calhoun-testomony-takeaways/74140822007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said he had not met with any of the whistleblowers directly</a>. </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Lund said that Boeing takes these complaints seriously. While she couldn’t say for sure how involved the whistleblowers were in working with Boeing to update its safety procedures, she said they were certainly invited to participate in company-wide meetings that focused on safety, including recent “safety stand-downs” that gave employees across the company an opportunity to address their concerns to management directly. </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Family members of victims killed in the Boeing crashes asked a U.S. judge to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-737-max-crash-victim-families-ask-judge-name-corporate-monitor-2024-06-24/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">name a corporate monitor</a> to examine the company’s safety and corporate compliance procedures. </p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Is it working?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Of course, by inviting members of the media, Boeing was always planning to highlight its progress toward safety. The steps it’s taking are in line with what Mann, the industry consultant, would recommend.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“A focus on quality creates the improved output and financial results that go with reduced traveled work, product rework, and the associated wasted effort, cost, time, and lost productivity,” Mann said. Traveled work refers to fuselages with defects moving down the production line that then require fixes out of phase with the regular workflow. </p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221667007-boeing-renton-60.JPG?width=980&amp;height=654&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/26/USAT/74221667007-boeing-renton-60.JPG?width=1960&amp;height=1308&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="The top half of a 737 aircraft is seen at Boeing's Foundational Training Center on June 25 in Renton, Wash."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="The top half of a 737 aircraft is seen at Boeing's Foundational Training Center on June 25 in Renton, Wash." data-c-credit="Jennifer Buchanan, The Seattle Times"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The feedback of one of its employees on the tour underscored the fact that this time, Boeing may actually be succeeding in making changes.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">David Prigg, one of the Boeing-appointed tour guides for the media group, has been with the company for 13 years and told a group of journalists that his father worked for Boeing as well. He said he’s been involved in mentoring new hires on the production line and has recently seen a subtle shift in the company’s culture.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Now, he said, factory employees, including his mentees, are more assertive about speaking up about safety concerns. They’re even more open to offering suggestions to help make their workflow more efficient.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“We’re very proud of what we do and we take (safety) seriously,” Prigg said. </p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"></p></div></div>
