<ol>
<li>Tesla shareholders have reaffirmed a pay award of over $45 billion for Elon Musk, the company's CEO.</li>
<li>The pay award, which consists of stock options, was initially thrown out in a legal challenge.</li>
<li>The shareholders' vote is seen as a strong sign that they still believe in Elon Musk and may persuade the judge who voided the award to reinstate it.</li>
<li>The vote is a relief to Mr. Musk's supporters, who feared that a rejection of the pay award may prompt him to spend less time managing Tesla or even quit the company.</li>
<li>The outcome of the shareholder vote may have implications for the future of Tesla and its CEO, with some speculating that the company's stock price could be impacted if Mr. Musk decides to take a break from the company.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wells Fargo fired over a dozen employees</strong> for faking work-from-home activity, with the bank citing "simulation of keyboard activity creating the impression of active work".</li>
<li><strong>The employees were from the bank's wealth and investment management unit</strong> and were "discharged" (fired) after an investigation found they were not actually working.</li>
<li><strong>Wells Fargo spokesperson said the bank "does not tolerate unethical behavior"</strong>, reinforcing the company's commitment to high standards of employee conduct.</li>
<li><strong>The bank had previously asked employees to return to the office</strong>, with most employees, including those in customer-facing roles, instructed to return to the office in September 2022 under a hybrid flexible model.</li>

 </p>
<p><b>Assessing Key 2024 Financial Drivers</b></p>
<p>CFO Natalie Knight also provided a financial review highlighting Stellantis’ key 2024 performance drivers and considerations.</p>
<p>“Stellantis is responding decisively to near-term challenges, including optimizing inventory while executing a generational product transition,” said Natalie Knight. “Despite the related short-term headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to deliver double-digit profitability, among the best OEMs in the world, while continuing to deliver exceptional capital returns to shareholders.”</p>

<li>The Company will continue to use share buybacks and ordinary dividends to return excess cash to shareholders.</li>

Each camper can attend one of the six days offered.</p><p class="text | article-text">Campers will be given the opportunity to meet the Chick-fil-A mascot as well as team leaders and get a behind-the-scenes look at what goes into the brand’s hospitality.</p><p class="text | article-text">In an earlier announcement, the Chick-fil-A location shared different activities that it was offering to campers including: “learning dining room host and customer service skills, learn how to take a guest order, learn how to bag a guest order, tour the kitchen and box your own nugget and make your own Ice Dream cone or cup.”</p><p class="w-100"></p><p class="text | article-text">This may sound like a dream to fans of the restaurant chain, but not everyone on social media appear to support the camp.</p><p class="text | article-text">A Facebook post about the camp, published on June 6, received around 1,000 comments, with many accusing the restaurant of exploiting campers by putting them to work and charging $35 per child. The money also gets you a kid’s meal, t-shirt, name tag, and a snack.</p><p class="text | article-text">“Wait. You’re wanting parents to <i>check notes</i> pay you, to use their young children as laborers. But they get a free meal, snack, and shirt that will give you free advertising?” one person commented.</p><p class="text | article-text">“‘Hey parents! Pay us so we can use your kids for child labor.’  – I fixed your flier,” another user wrote.</p><p class="w-100"></p><p class="text | article-text">Some critics tagged the U.S. Department of Labor in their comments.</p><p class="text | article-text">“Please just take your kids to the park and spend those $35 on water balloons and nerf idk,” wrote another.</p><p class="text | article-text">“Just because it’s the 20′s again doesn’t mean we should bring back child labor. It didn’t go great the last time, spoiler alert,” another Facebook user wrote.</p><figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"><figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"><span class="caption-text">Chick-fil-A restaurant</span><span class="caption-credit">(young shanahan | MGN)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="w-100"></p><p class="text | article-text">Some applauded the camp for providing work skills that children could use later in life.</p><p class="text | article-text">“I’ll go against the grain here. Kudos to you, Chick-Fil-A Hammond. It’s nice to see an offer to teach young children about work ethic and responsibility, while having a little fun at the same time. I’ll ask my daughter if she’s interested in attending,” one Facebook user commented.</p><p class="text | article-text">“I love this and don’t think it’s bad at all. Customer service skills and kids love to play in the kitchen. Reminds me of the children museum where we got to grocery shop, but only with real food,” another person wrote.</p><p class="text | article-text">Despite the mixed reactions, interest has been strong enough to completely book the first three sessions. The store offered an additional three sessions, which were also completely filled.</p><p class="w-100"></p><p class="text | article-text">“Why is everyone in the comments tripping?? Kids would LOVE this. It’s literally no different than paying to get into one of those kid only towns where the kids learn new skills,” another user commented.</p><figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"><figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"><span class="caption-text">Chick-fil-A restaurant</span><span class="caption-credit">(MGN)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="text | article-text">When asked for comment, the corporate representative responded on behalf of the Hammond, Louisiana, Chick-fil-A location.</p><p class="text | article-text">“Some local restaurants create their own programs to engage with the communities they’re located in. Chick-fil-A restaurants are locally owned and operated by people who live and work in the communities their restaurants serve,” a public affairs and external communications representative for Chick-fil-A told <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/chick-fil-a-locations-summer-camp-kids-draws-criticism-sparks-debate-social-media" target="_blank">FOX Business</a>.</p><p class="w-100"></p><p class="text | article-text">The representative noted that the camp is not a corporate program.</p><p class="text | article-text">The concept behind the camp started six years ago by an owner-operator Chick-fil-A location in Houston, Texas, and has continued to take place every summer since first launching, the representative added.</p><p class="text | article-text">“It continues to run every summer and receives positive comments from parents and kids alike – this year’s kids camp at that restaurant sold out in seven minutes, 200 spots,” she said.</p><p class="text | article-text">Campers at the Houston restaurant partake in activities like trivia and bingo games that are focused on the brand.</p><p class="w-100"></p><p class="text | article-text">Chick-fil-A’s rep highlighted that the restaurant does not profit off of the camp.</p><p class="text | article-text">“It’s important to know campers are not doing the work of a Team Member,” she said.</p><p class="text | article-text">“While there are Team Members who serve as camp counselors, other Team Members are continuing to work in the restaurant and ensure guests receive the delicious food and hospitality Chick-fil-A is known for.”</p><p class="text | article-text"><i>See a spelling or grammar error in our story? </i><a href="mailto:WVUE-digitalcontent@gray.tv"><i>Click Here</i></a><i> to report it.

<p>Elon Musk is betting Tesla on its Optimus program, which he now says will add tens of trillion of dollars to its valuation.</p>



<p>He added that Tesla should have over 1,000 humanoid robots working in its factories next year, but he is delaying a recently shared timeline.</p>



<span id="more-367600"></span>



<p>Musk started out Tesla’s shareholder meeting with a rant about how he believes that Tesla will be worth “10x more than the currently most valuable companies”, which are worth about $3 trillion.</p>



<p>He built on previous grandiose statements about believing that Optimus is going to be Tesla’s most important product.</p>



<p>The CEO now added that he sees the market for humanoid robots to be about 1 billion units per year and he believes Tesla should capture “at least 10% of it”.</p>



<p>Musk said that he sees Tesla building robots at a volume for about $10,000 a unit and selling them for $20,000, resulting in a $1 trillion profit.</p>



<p>Tesla recently announced that it has “<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/06/12/tesla-2-optimus-humanoid-robots-working-autonomously-factory/">2 Optimus robots working autonomously in its factory</a>” and Musk recently said that he sees <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/23/tesla-may-start-selling-optimus-humanoid-robot-next-year-elon-musk/">Tesla selling robots to customers next year</a>.</p>



<p>Now, at the shareholders meeting, the CEO announced that he expects Tesla to have “a thousand to a couple thousand robots working in its factories next year.”</p>



<p>He said that it would be in limited production, but he didn’t mention customer deliveries.</p>




	<p>Finally, the CEO did say that he belives that by 2026, Optimus is going to be a fully software customizable robot.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>That sounds nice, but the guy said the same thing on a slightly smaller scale about self-driving for the past 8 years.</p>



<p>I do believe that Tesla has some great advantages in building humanoid robots, especially when it comes to compute power efficiency, and real-world AI experience – though I do think that Tesla is way behind what Elon is claiming. History has proven me right on that… until it doesn’t.</p>



<p>But it’s hard to give him credibility these days. I wish it would take a few pages from Apple’s playbook and shut up about the products until they are ready.</p>

	Sumner Redstone earned renown as both dealmaker and deal breaker (he once said he’d fired Tom Cruise). His daughter, Shari, seems to have inherited only part of his skill set.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Flash back 50 years: The Beverly Hills dinner party was lavish. The mood among the Hollywood power players was upbeat. Gossip about a stream of impending hits from the <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/paramount/" id="auto-tag_paramount" data-tag="paramount">Paramount</a> studio prompted praise and optimism.</p>






<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Until <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/barry-diller/" id="auto-tag_barry-diller" data-tag="barry-diller">Barry Diller</a> abruptly chimed in. “Paramount’s management team will implode within weeks,” said the acerbic Diller. “It’ll be the classic Hollywood case of turning success into failure.”

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	From a perspective of 50 years, Diller’s prediction of turmoil proved accurate for that moment – and for the present as well. As a film studio, Paramount again levitates in limbo land. And Hollywood wonders whether any creative entity can survive its many episodes of turmoil.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Until this week Paramount’s new corporate suitors had ranged from <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/david-ellison/" id="auto-tag_david-ellison" data-tag="david-ellison">David Ellison</a>, 41, who envisioned a slate of studio hits – that plan apparently now canceled — to the combat-tough <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/edgar-bronfman-jr/" id="auto-tag_edgar-bronfman-jr" data-tag="edgar-bronfman-jr">Edgar Bronfman Jr.</a>, 70, who 30 years ago won control of Universal Pictures in a tight battle.

</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Both men had had to overcome the skepticism of billionaire fathers. Ellison, chief of Skydance Media, could trace his legacy to technology — Larry Ellison runs Oracle. The Bronfman dynasty understood how to distill alcohol, but not entertainment. They were content owning Seagram until heirs began dabbling in Hollywood.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Edgar Jr. once walked me across the Universal lot and promised he would turn its famous tower from black to white to reflect his optimism.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Instead, he soon placed Universal under the control of a confused French conglomerate called Vivendi, his focus promptly shifting to Warner Music.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Meanwhile, the Paramount studio could now also aspire to a paint job as it endures its bidding wars. Formidable entities like Sony remain in play, backed by funds like Apollo (Sony) and Bain Capital (behind Bronfman).</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	RedBird, having backed Ellison, now watches from the sidelines.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Sony, impatient with Paramount talks, has now acquired the the 35-cinema Alamo Drafthouse chain where it can serve up booze as well as films.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	The Paramount bidding, if it’s reignited, might considerably embellish the fortune of <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/shari-redstone/" id="auto-tag_shari-redstone" data-tag="shari-redstone">Shari Redstone</a>, who controls the unwieldy structure created by her deceased father. His National Amusements built <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/paramount-global/" id="auto-tag_paramount-global" data-tag="paramount-global">Paramount Global</a>, which also owned CBS among other entities.

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Viewed long term, however, Paramount has been an undependable friend to filmmakers seeking stable funding, not paint jobs. Long before Sumner, gifted young filmmakers provided the key to the remarkable recovery of the Paramount studio through the 1960s and ’70s — one that studio executives have since yearned to emulate.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	By the year 1975, Paramount’s slate (in production or pre) included <em>Chinatown, Godfather Part II, The Conversation, Nashville, Day of the Locust, The Parallax View, Murder on the Orient Express, The Gambler, The Great Gatsby</em> and <em>The Last Tycoon</em> among others. Some were hits, some flops, but all were ambitious in terms of talent and budget.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	The success was historic and evanescent. The heralded hits, accompanied by a blizzard of publicity, exacerbated the tensions between Paramount’s president, Frank Yablans, and Bob Evans, chief of production, who bitterly fought over both strategy and the division of film profits.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Evans’ ambition to be both producer and studio chief intruded on decision making, prompting the selection of Diller, formerly chief of Fox, to succeed both Paramount executives.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	(On a personal level, as vice president for production, I remained aloof from the executive battles; my role was to cobble together movies, flashing green lights at propitious moments, soon moving on to calmer surroundings.)</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Diller, of course, ran Paramount deftly and decisively before finding richer pastures as chairman of IAC and Expedia.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Fifty years later, the studio awaits its next champion. Diller isn’t making any predictions — other than to warn that time is running short.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Eight former SpaceX employees have sued the company and its CEO Elon Musk, alleging they were illegally fired for speaking out against rampant sexual harassment and gender discrimination within the company.</li>
<li>The lawsuit claims that Musk's own behavior, including making "grotesque sexual banter" in the workplace, encouraged others to engage in similar conduct, creating a hostile work environment.</li>
<li>The employees had previously written an open letter to Musk, accusing him of failing to uphold SpaceX's "No Asshole" policy and zero-tolerance sexual harassment policy. Shortly after, at least five of the letter's authors were fired.</li>
<li>The lawsuit and allegations have shed light on a well-documented work culture at SpaceX and other companies owned by Musk, including Tesla, which have been accused of similar issues.</li>
<li>The allegations have been made public amid a reported scathing new report by The Wall Street Journal, which revealed that Musk had sex with a SpaceX college intern, further casting a shadow over Musk's leadership and company culture.</li>

SpaceX paid her $250,000, documents showed.</p><p>The incident clearly infuriated many at the company.</p><p>"Elon’s behavior in the public sphere is a frequent source of distraction and embarrassment for us, particularly in recent weeks," read the letter, which was signed by at least 400 employees.</p><p>Musk has made plenty of sexist comments himself over the years. In late 2021, he <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-deletes-tweets" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">joked</a> in a since-deleted tweet thread that degrees at his fictional university — named Texas Institute of Technology &amp; Science to make a <a href="https://qz.com/work/2082746/elon-musks-tweet-captures-everyday-sexism-faced-by-women-in-stem" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">crude <strong>acronym joke</strong></a> — would be based on women's physical characteristics.</p><p>He has also been an outspoken opponent of gender expression, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/grimes-tells-elon-musk-that-she-cannot-support-hate-after-he-tweets-pronouns-suck-2714960" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">tweeting that "pronouns suck</a>."

<li>The European Union has imposed new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports, with tariffs as high as 38% on certain models.</li>
<li>Despite this, BYD, a Chinese automaker, is expected to continue making a profit on its EV sales in Europe, with a profit of $15,400 per vehicle compared to $1,400 per vehicle in China.</li>
<li>Analysts from Rhodium Group conclude that even with a 30% tariff, many Chinese EV models would still enjoy a strong profit premium in the EU.</li>
<li>China has complained that the EU's new tariffs on Chinese EV imports would "harm Europe's interests" and has warned of a potential trade war.</li>
<li>The new tariffs will be implemented in addition to the current 10% tariffs, with BYD facing a total tariff rate of almost 30%.</li>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BYD doesn’t seem fazed by the European Union’s new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports. Analysts have calculated that the Chinese automaker’s profits from EVs sold in Europe still far exceed those of local EU automakers.</span></p>



<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The European Commission announced new tariffs on Chinese EV imports based on its ongoing anti-subsidy probe. The Commission placed tariffs as high as </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.teslarati.com/europe-ponders-additional-tariffs-china-made-electric-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">38% on select EVs made in China</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and imported into Europe. The new Chinese EV import duties will be implemented on the current 10% tariffs. </span></p>



<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Three Chinese automakers received individual duty rates because they cooperated with the European Commission’s investigation. BYD received the least additional tariffs at 17.4%. In total, BYD’s tariffs will be almost 30%.</span></p>



<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to Rhodium Group, the nearly 30% duty on </span><a href="https://carnewschina.com/2024/06/13/byd-profit-in-eu-is-10x-higher-than-in-china-and-even-with-new-30-tariffs-still-makes-5000-usd-per-vehicle-report-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BYD will not affect the company’s EU profits</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. To illustrate its point, the Group looked into BYD’s profits with the BYD Seal U in Europe versus China. The Chinese automaker makes a profit of $15,400 for every BYD Seal U sold in Europe. In comparison, BYD makes $1,400 on each Seal U unit sold in China. The significant profit BYD makes on each Seal U vehicle is what Chinese EV makers call the EU premium. </span></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Unemployment claims rose unexpectedly</strong>: The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits jumped to 242,000, the highest level in 10 months, despite expectations of a decline.</li>
<li><strong>Labor market cooling</strong>: The surge in jobless claims suggests the labor market is cooling, possibly due to high interest rates and inflation. This could impact the Federal Reserve's plans for interest rates.</li>
<li><strong>Fed implications</strong>: The Federal Reserve may hold interest rates at elevated levels to combat high inflation, but the weaker-than-expected jobless data could keep the door open for a rate cut later this year.</li>
<li><strong>High-paying job opportunities dwindling</strong>: The article highlights that high-paying job opportunities are dwindling, with white-collar workers struggling to find employment as the labor market slows.</li>
<li><strong>Fed rate cut possible</strong>: The latest jobless data could keep the central bank on track to cut interest rates later this year, with experts suggesting that the door is "a little wider open" for a rate cut in September.</li>

That same month, prices remained unchanged from April, and only 3.3 percent higher than they were one year earlier, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/cpi-inflation-may-report-data-today">according to a Consumer Price Index (CPI)</a> report released on Wednesday. These figures were both lower than anticipated.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">What’s more, the official CPI data likely overstates the actual pace of price increases in the economy. This is because a major driver of overall inflation in recent months has been housing costs, and the Consumer Price Index’s measure of rental prices is out of date. The CPI measures what consumers are currently paying in rent, but most renters are paying rates that were set months ago, when they first signed their leases. In that time, the going rate for new leases has fallen, according to industry data. Thus, the actual market price of a rental unit today is lower than the average price that’s presently being paid. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Asking rents <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/rent-falls-for-10th-month-but-may-not-help-lower-inflation-8661406">fell for a 10th straight month</a> in May, according to a Realtor.com Rental Report released this week. The typical rent has now fallen by $24 since August 2022. By contrast, the new CPI data shows rent prices up 0.4 percent from April and 5.4 percent from one year ago. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">As the economist Paul Krugman <a href="https://x.com/paulkrugman/status/1800872490660728980">notes,</a> if you remove outdated rental data from CPI, the inflation rate looks right in line with the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. In his view, this means that “inflation has basically been defeated.”</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">On its face, this would seem like great news for Joe Biden. Inflation has long been the president’s greatest political liability. If May’s trends continue and Biden presides over full employment and stable prices come Election Day, the case for Donald Trump’s candidacy might seem drastically weaker.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">But there are three reasons for Democrats to fear that slowing inflation will prove too little, too late.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">For one thing, voters’ distrust of Biden’s economic management appears unshakeable. In a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/644750/confidence-biden-economic-stewardship-historically-low.aspx">recent Gallup poll</a>, just 38 percent of Americans expressed confidence in Biden to “do the right thing for the economy.” That is up a smidgen from Biden’s 35 percent mark in 2023, but it is still the worst economic approval that any modern president has suffered in Gallup’s polling, with the exception of George W. Bush immediately after the financial crisis. By contrast, 46 percent of voters have confidence in Trump’s economic management.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">In RealClearPolitics’s <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/approval/joe-biden/economy">average of recent surveys</a>, Americans disapprove of Biden’s handling of the economy by a 17.6 point margin. And voters’ appraisal of Biden’s economic acumen has not substantially improved in recent months, even as inflation has declined. By the end of Trump’s term, on the other hand, voters <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval_economy-6182.html">approved</a> of his economic management by a 7.8 percent margin. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Thus, the idea that Biden is personally responsible for the surge of inflation in 2022 — and that he cannot be trusted to effectively manage the economy for that reason — appears deeply rooted in voters’ minds. The fact that wages have been <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/average-wages-have-surpassed-inflation-for-12-straight-months/">rising much faster</a> than prices for more than a year has left no dent on this impression. Another few months of falling inflation could move the needle a bit, but there’s little reason to assume that such a development will dramatically change public opinion. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Second, relatedly, historical precedent suggests that the economy’s performance up to this point in Biden’s term will matter more than its performance from now until November. According to <a href="https://x.com/davidshor/status/1537500072635662343">Democratic data scientist David Shor</a>, when you examine the relationship between GDP growth and past incumbent presidents’ electoral outcomes, their economic records between inauguration and April of their reelection year count for much more than economic conditions in their campaigns’ final months.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Finally, if inflation has truly been defeated, victory has come too late to yield substantial interest rate cuts before November. The Federal Reserve <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/fed-forecasts-one-rate-cut-181120277.html">declined</a> to reduce rates after its meeting this week and forecast a single, quarter-percentage-point cut by year’s end. Investors predict that such a cut will come in September at the earliest. Even if the rate cut comes before Election Day, it would still leave Americans with dramatically higher borrowing costs than they faced when Biden was inaugurated. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">It is conceivable that a small September cut may help the president a bit at the margins. Another possibility is that Biden will effectively shepherd the nation out of an economic crisis and deliver it into a low-inflation, high-employment economy and then promptly hand the White House back to Donald Trump, who will proceed to receive the lion’s share of the credit when the Fed slashes interest rates next year.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">After all, whatever else you might say about Trump, he knows <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/02/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes/index.html">how to inherit more than he deserves</a>.</p></div></div></div>

            <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/10/tech/apple-ai-next-big-thing/index.html">Apple on Monday announced a partnership</a> with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to power some of its phone’s features. Although the partnership will likely give the company a much-needed boost, Apple aligning itself with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust has raised criticism, especially for taking user inputs and incorporating them into ChatGPT’s data set. Those may cause some privacy challenges down the road for a company that has long prioritized its users’ safety and anonymity.

            Still, a big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales and services for years to come, as users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices and an uncertain economic environment weighs on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington.
