<li>
<p>Disney's direct-to-consumer (DTC) business, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, posted a profit of $47 million in the fiscal second quarter, the first time the business has been profitable. However, the company expects to report a loss in the DTC business in the third quarter.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has opened a formal investigation into Boeing after it was discovered that some company employees failed to complete specific inspections on some 787 Dreamliners, falsifying inspection records.</li>
<li>The inspections are necessary to verify that the planes have adequate bonding and grounding of the fasteners connecting the wings to the fuselage, to ensure proper grounding against electrical currents like a lightning strike.</li>
<li>According to a source, around 450 planes are potentially affected, including around 60 aircraft still within Boeing's production system.</li>
<li>Planes still within Boeing's possession are being re-inspected, and while there is no immediate safety issue, the design of the 787 Dreamliner includes multiple redundancies to protect against events like a lightning strike.</li>
<li>The investigation is ongoing, and the FAA will take any necessary action to ensure the safety of the aircraft.</li>

<p>Boeing notified employees of the situation last Monday in an email from Scott Stocker, the vice president and general manager of the 787 program. The email, obtained by CBS News, says that Boeing's engineering team has "assessed that this misconduct did not create an immediate safety of flight issue."</p><p>Stocker credited a Boeing South Carolina worker for spotting the issue and reporting it. </p><p>"The teammate saw what appeared to be an irregularity in a required conformance test in wing body join.

"After receiving the report, we quickly reviewed the matter and learned that several people had been violating Company policies by not performing a required test, but recording the work as having been completed."</p><p>Stocker told employees that Boeing has "zero tolerance for not following processes designed to ensure quality and safety" and that the company is "taking swift and serious corrective action with multiple teammates."</p><figure class="embed embed--type-video embed--type-content_video is-video embed--float-left embed--size-medium ">

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Marissa Mayer, former CEO of Yahoo!, chose Google as her employer after a chance encounter with a recruiter's email, which led her to meet the founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.</li>
<li>Mayer attributes her success to taking risks and doing things she's "not ready to do", which helped her grow and push herself beyond her comfort zone.</li>
<li>She mentions that she considered multiple job offers from major companies, but chose Google because it was a "fledgling startup" looking to revolutionize search, even with fewer than two dozen employees at the time.</li>
<li>Mayer has also served as a corporate director for various companies, including Nextdoor Holdings, Walmart, and others, highlighting her experience in corporate leadership.</li>
<li>Mayer emphasizes the importance of taking calculated risks and stepping out of one's comfort zone to achieve personal and professional growth, citing her own experiences as an example.</li>

<p>Although she would later become Google’s 20th employee and first female engineer, as a graduating computer science major at Stanford during the height of the tech bubble in 1999, Mayer found herself with 14 job offers to major companies. Unsure of which to choose, Mayer took stock of all the good decisions she had made up until that time, according to an interview at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CVaOgHAkD0" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CVaOgHAkD0" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS"><em>Fortune</em>’s MPW conference in 2011</a>, which included picking Stanford, pivoting away from a major in medicine, and working in Switzerland for a summer.</p>



<p>When she analyzed what made those choices great, she saw a common theme: Mayer thrived in the unknown.</p>



<p>“I always did something I felt a little unready to do,” she told <em>Fortune</em>.</p>



<p>In the end, it was a fluke that led her to considering Google as a career option. With a flurry of recruiter emails in her inbox, Mayer went to delete one, and because of a wrong keystroke, opened it instead, according to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-marissa-mayer-found-her-google-job-2013-8?r=MX&amp;IR=T#:~:text=So%20when%20an%20email%20from,about%20through%20a%20Stanford%20professor." target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.businessinsider.com/how-marissa-mayer-found-her-google-job-2013-8?r=MX&amp;IR=T#:~:text=So%20when%20an%20email%20from,about%20through%20a%20Stanford%20professor." rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS"><em>Business Insider</em></a>. When she opened the Google recruiter email she remembered that her mentor, Stanford professor Eric Roberts, had told her she should meet the founders, Stanford PhD students Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Instead of deleting the email, Mayer asked for an interview.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>Despite the happenstance of her applying to Google, Mayer was willing to take a chance on the fledgling startup looking to revolutionize search, even if at the time it had fewer than two dozen employees. </p>



<p>“When you do something you’re not ready to do, that’s when you push yourself and when you grow,” she said. </p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>Another area of growth for Mayer is in serving as a corporate director. Nextdoor Holdings, which offers the neighborhood-based app of the same name, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240507278632/en/Nextdoor-Appoints-Marissa-Mayer-Niraj-Shah-and-Robert-Hohman-to-Board-of-Directors" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240507278632/en/Nextdoor-Appoints-Marissa-Mayer-Niraj-Shah-and-Robert-Hohman-to-Board-of-Directors" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">appointed Mayer to its board today</a>. She also currently serves on the boards of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/walmart/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/walmart/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">Walmart</a> and AT&amp;T. She was joined by Niraj Shah and Robert Hohman, who also joined the Nextdoor board, the company announced today. Shah is cofounder and CEO of online home goods seller <a href="https://fortune.com/company/wayfair/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/wayfair/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">Wayfair</a>, and Hohman is the founder and chairman of company information platform Glassdoor. </p>



<p>According to Mayer, encircling herself with the right crowd is another important factor and stood out when she contemplated a future at Google. One of Mayer’s closest friends was working at Google, and said she was already “really impressed” with Page and Brin.</p>



<p>“I always surrounded myself with the smartest people I could find,” Mayer said. “Because I think that when you’re surrounded by smart people, they challenge you and they make you think about things, you know, harder and and just rise to another level.”</p>



<p>All of those factors made Mayer’s decision easy. Mayer stayed at Google for more than a decade until she was offered the top job at Yahoo. Although Mayer was often criticized during her time there, she still tripled the company’s stock price and navigated it through a sale to <a href="https://fortune.com/company/verizon/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/verizon/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">Verizon</a> in 2017. Mayer now runs an <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/06/16/marissa-mayer-sunshine-contacts-founder/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/06/16/marissa-mayer-sunshine-contacts-founder/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">AI startup called Sunshine</a>, which raised $20 million in 2020 “to simplify and learn from people’s digital address books,” <em>Fortune</em> reported.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the future of business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/eye-on-ai?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=eye_on_ai" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/eye-on-ai?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=eye_on_ai" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

              </figcaption></figure><p>Restaurant chain Panera said on Tuesday that it plans to stop selling its Charged Sips caffeinated beverages that are at the center of multiple lawsuits. </p><p>The company will phase out the caffeine-laden lemonade drinks nationwide, a spokesperson confirmed to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/moneywatch/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">CBS MoneyWatch</a>. As of Tuesday, they were still available for purchase on Panera's website. </p><p>The move comes as Panera revamps its menu to offer new "low-caffeine" drink options amid <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/panera-lawsuit-charged-lemonade-caffeine-death/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">allegations that the caffeinated lemonade drinks caused two deaths</a></span>. Another plaintiff alleges Panera's Charged Lemonade <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/panera-bread-lawsuit-charged-lemonade-caffeine-lauren-skerritt/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">left her with long-term heart problems</a></span>. Panera did not indicate why it's phasing out Charged Sips. The company did not comment on pending litigation. </p>    
  <p>"We listened to more than 30,000 guests about what they wanted from Panera, and are focusing next on the broad array of beverages we know our guests desire — ranging from exciting, on-trend flavors, to low-sugar and low-caffeine options," Panera said of its recent menu changes. The company's new beverage offerings include a "Blueberry Lavender Lemonade" among other options. </p><p>Sarah Katz, a 21-year-old college student with a heart condition, died in September 2022 after drinking a Charged Lemonade beverage. Her family <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/panera-charged-lemonade-caffeine-sarah-katz-death-lawsuit/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">filed a lawsuit against Panera</a></span> alleging the lemonade drink, which contains higher caffeine levels than Red Bull and Monster Energy Drink combined, came with no warning. </p>

<p>A second lawsuit alleges that Dennis Brown of Fleming Island, Florida, died from cardiac arrest after downing three of the drinks and unknowingly <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-much-caffeine-health-effects/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">consuming high levels of caffeine</a></span>, according to the suit filed in Superior Court in Delaware. </p><p>On its <a href="https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/menu/categories/beverages.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>, the Charged Sips beverages contain between 155 and 302 milligrams of Caffeine. They come with a warning indicating they are not recommended for "children, people sensitive to caffeine, pregnant or nursing women."</p><p>It's safe for most healthy adults to consume up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according to The Mayo Clinic</a>. That's the rough equivalent of about four cups of coffee or 10 cans of soda.</p>

<p>“Bidenomics, if I was a professor, I’d give him an ‘F,'” Druckenmiller <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/07/stanley-druckenmiller-gives-bidens-economic-policies-an-f-blames-the-fed-for-reigniting-inflation.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/07/stanley-druckenmiller-gives-bidens-economic-policies-an-f-blames-the-fed-for-reigniting-inflation.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">told</a> <em>CNBC</em> on Tuesday. </p>



<p>Druckenmiller was especially irate over what he considered to be a <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/31/stanley-druckenmiller-janet-yellen-debt-mistake-interest-rates-bonds/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/10/31/stanley-druckenmiller-janet-yellen-debt-mistake-interest-rates-bonds/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">misreading</a> of the macroeconomic landscape on behalf of both Biden, the Federal Reserve, and the Treasury Department. All three, according to Druckenmiller, overestimated the gravity of the economic crisis the pandemic brought on—and therefore <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/09/how-bad-recession-billionaire-stanley-druckenmiller-hard-landing/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/05/09/how-bad-recession-billionaire-stanley-druckenmiller-hard-landing/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">implemented</a> the wrong policies. </p>



<p>The administration “misdiagnosed COVID and thought we’re going into a depression,” Druckenmiller said. “The Fed did, too. I worried about it, too, in the early days. The Fed eventually pivoted—better late than never. Treasury is still acting like we’re in a depression.”</p>



<p>The country would have been able to pull itself out of the economic slump, which at one point was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-financial-markets-us-news-ap-top-news-economic-growth-31ffad3ea17ef1d07e2724dd8fc25d50" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-financial-markets-us-news-ap-top-news-economic-growth-31ffad3ea17ef1d07e2724dd8fc25d50" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">technically a recession</a>, without the level of fiscal spending of Bidenomics, Druckenmiller said—and now that the recovery is almost complete, some of its policies have caused the deficit to soar. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>Bidenomics was structured to feature massive outlays of government funding across the country in an effort to keep money moving in the economy and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/26/bidenomics-gdp-economy-00123706" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/26/bidenomics-gdp-economy-00123706" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">spur</a> economic growth. However, critics say it’s led to record-high national debt of <a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">$34 trillion</a>, a result of all the government spending.

<p>Bidenomics also faces mounting concerns that it could ultimately be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/2023/08/15/what-is-bidenomics-president-biden-s-economic-philosophy-explained/e9ba8398-3b9b-11ee-aefd-40c039a855ba_story.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/2023/08/15/what-is-bidenomics-president-biden-s-economic-philosophy-explained/e9ba8398-3b9b-11ee-aefd-40c039a855ba_story.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">inflationary</a> because the extra government spending will drive up prices at a time when the Federal Reserve is trying to curb inflation. The truth is likely somewhere in the middle. It is still <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-03-04/has-bidenomics-worked-it-s-too-soon-to-say" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-03-04/has-bidenomics-worked-it-s-too-soon-to-say" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">too early</a> to know the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/jamie-dimon-on-bidenomics-jpmorgan-chase-economy-inflation-infrastructure/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/jamie-dimon-on-bidenomics-jpmorgan-chase-economy-inflation-infrastructure/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">full extent</a> of Biden’s economic policies, considering the manufacturing and infrastructure subsidies will take years to come to fruition given the long lead times in those industries. </p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>In the here and now, though, Druckenmiller remains frustrated. He also took issue with the Fed and its chair Jerome Powell for getting the market overexcited late last year when it began telegraphing rate cuts on the horizon when inflation had come down markedly from the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-ECONOMY/INFLATION/lbpgneoyqvq/index.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-ECONOMY/INFLATION/lbpgneoyqvq/index.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">9%</a> levels of June 2022. But there was still the possibility inflation might either <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-prices-rise-more-than-expected-january-2024-02-13/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-prices-rise-more-than-expected-january-2024-02-13/" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">spike back up</a> or remain extremely stubborn in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/last-mile-of-the-inflation-fight-will-be-the-hardest-86bcebb1" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/articles/last-mile-of-the-inflation-fight-will-be-the-hardest-86bcebb1" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">last mile</a>. It certainly wasn’t down to the Fed’s 2% target. In fact, Powell himself would later say he needed more data to indicate it was heading to those levels. Instead, Powell jumped the gun and forecasted as many as three rate cuts at the time. </p>



<p>“To some extent, I feel like they fumbled on the five-yard line with the game on the line,” Druckenmiller said. </p>



<p>The market rejoiced after Powell’s prediction, anticipating the current cycle of monetary tightening was over. Overjoyed economists began <a href="https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/fed-december-meeting-speech-rate-decision-today/card/futures-markets-expect-6-rate-cuts-in-2024-versus-4-earlier-0GuZFQP7CW6pR1VEmOdr" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/fed-december-meeting-speech-rate-decision-today/card/futures-markets-expect-6-rate-cuts-in-2024-versus-4-earlier-0GuZFQP7CW6pR1VEmOdr" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">prognosticating</a> as many as <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/economy/we-predict-6-interest-rate-cuts-2024" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.morningstar.com/economy/we-predict-6-interest-rate-cuts-2024" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">six rate cuts</a> in 2024, which resulted in the <a href="https://fortune.com/company/dow/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/dow/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">Dow</a> Jones <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/12/13/dow-stocks-hit-record-fed-signals-interest-rate-cuts-in-2024/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/12/13/dow-stocks-hit-record-fed-signals-interest-rate-cuts-in-2024/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">shooting up</a> to record levels and the bulls claiming a recession had been definitively <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/economy/economy-fed-recession/index.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/economy/economy-fed-recession/index.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">avoided</a>. </p>



<p>“They set financial conditions on fire again,” Druckenmiller said. </p>



<p>Throughout his interview, Druckenmiller was especially irate with Powell, who he continued to chastise for speaking too much in public. Parsing the carefully measured words of the Federal Reserve chair—known as Fed speak—has become an art unto itself. For Druckenmiller, though, it was just a bad decision. </p>



<p>“Don’t go on <em>60 Minutes</em>,” Druckenmiller said, referencing Powell’s February <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNEoTlDJGxk" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNEoTlDJGxk" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">interview</a> with the program. “You’re not a rock star—okay. You’re the Fed chairman. You’re supposed to be running monetary policy for the good of the country.”</p>



<p>Druckenmiller’s words come at a time when the merits of having an independent Fed are under intense scrutiny. A <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/trump-allies-federal-reserve-independence-54423c2f" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/trump-allies-federal-reserve-independence-54423c2f" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">report</a> in April detailed how former president Donald Trump’s campaign was working on plans to try and limit the central bank’s independence, even floating the idea that the president would set interest rates. While Trump was in office, he regularly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-07/trump-jawbones-fed-yet-again-may-be-grooming-powell-successor" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-07/trump-jawbones-fed-yet-again-may-be-grooming-powell-successor" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">jawboned</a> Powell in public for engaging in monetary policy he didn’t approve of. That in and of itself was a virtually unheard of practice. </p>



<p>Druckenmiller, however, took the opposite view to the former president. According to him, the Fed should be even more independent and not provide forward guidance at all. “What I would do is just say nothing and do what the Fed chair used to do,” he said. “When you need to raise rates, raise them; when you need to cut them, cut them.”</p></div></div>

<li><strong>Bladeless Swiss Army Knife in development</strong>: Victorinox, the manufacturer of the classic Swiss Army Knife, is creating a new model that will be bladeless to address regulatory barriers and restrictions on carrying knives in some countries.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory challenges</strong>: CEO Carl Elsener cited concerns over the increasing regulation of knives due to violence in the world, saying that the company is working on pocket tools without blades to comply with regulations in countries like the UK and some Asian nations.</li>
<li><strong>Bladeless tools for specific hobbies</strong>: Elsener mentioned that the company is designing tools for specific hobbies, such as cycling and golfing, that may not require a blade. These tools are expected to complement rather than replace classic Swiss Army Knives.</li>
<li><strong>Country-specific regulations</strong>: Elsener explained that some countries restrict the carrying of knives, citing England and some Asian countries as examples. In the UK, for instance, knives with folding blades less than three inches in length are allowed for certain professions and activities.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with regulations</strong>: The developments are aimed at addressing regulatory barriers and ensuring that Victorinox can continue to sell its products globally. The company is exploring ways to create products that comply with local regulations while still meeting customer needs.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Fed President Neel Kashkari says interest rates may need to stay steady for an "extended period"</strong>, potentially through the rest of the year, as inflation has largely stalled and is still above the Fed's 2% target rate.</li>
<li><strong>Kashkari needs to see "multiple positive inflation readings"</strong> before he can support interest rate cuts, citing that decreases in inflation have largely stalled in recent months.</li>
<li><strong>Kashkari will be monitoring developments in the labor market</strong>, where a "marked" shift to weaker job creation could also justify an interest rate cut.</li>
<li><strong>Kashkari had initially thought the Fed would need to deliver two interest rate cuts in 2024</strong>, but may mark that down to just one cut or even no cuts, depending on the data, when the central bank meets next month.</li>
<li><strong>The Fed has held interest rates steady for now</strong>, as inflation casts doubt on future rate cuts, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said that further interest rate hikes are unlikely, but rate levels may remain elevated until inflation subsides.</li>

The EV maker also reaffirmed its full-year loss forecast and still sees a "path" to "modest gross profit" in the fourth quarter of this year.</p><p>For the quarter, Rivian reported revenue of $1.204 billion versus $1.175 billion expected, which is an 80% jump from a year ago. However, Rivian posted a loss per share of $1.45 versus $1.27 estimated, with an operating loss $1.484 billion compared to $1.299 billion loss expected.</p><p>Rivian reaffirmed its adjusted EBITDA loss forecast of $2.70 billion for 2024, but now sees its capital expenditure outlays improving to $1.2 billion from $1.75 billion seen earlier due to moving the start of R2 production to its Normal, Ill., plant, with further savings seen in 2025 and 2026.</p><p>Rivian stock was trading higher after hours before the release of its Q1 results, but fell around 4% after the results were posted.</p><p>"We hit several milestones this quarter, including producing our 100,000th vehicle in Normal, successfully navigating the retooling upgrade, and unveiling our new midsize platform, which underpins the R2, R3, and R3X," CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement.</p><p>The company also said, as a result of its retooling upgrade and other improvements, Rivian remains "confident in its path to achieving modest gross profit in the fourth quarter of this year."</p><p>By shifting R2 production to its existing US factory instead of its upcoming Georgia factory, Rivian said on Tuesday the company will save more than $2.25 billion. The company now expects its Normal plant following the R2 launch and plant changes to hit 215,000 units of total annual capacity across all vehicles, which includes up to 155,000 units of the R2.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">Founder and CEO of Rivian RJ Scaringe speaks onstage during the Rivian Reveals All-Electric R2 Midsize SUV event at Rivian South Coast Theater on March 7, 2024, in Laguna Beach, Calif.

The company also reaffirmed production guidance of 57,000 vehicles in 2024.</p><p>Part of bringing down those costs came in the form of a 10% salaried staff reduction, with the company citing economic uncertainty. Though Rivian reaffirmed its forecast to reach “modest gross profit” by the end of 2024, Rivian didn't reiterate past statements that it was "very close" to achieving a positive contribution margin at the end of 2023.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-1">The Rivian R3 and R3X SUVs are displayed during the Rivian Reveals All-Electric R2 Midsize SUV event at Rivian South Coast Theater on March 7, 2024, in Laguna Beach, Calif.
