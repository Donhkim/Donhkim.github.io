<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed Monday earlier reports the company was delaying its robotaxi reveal, explaining it was because he requested an “important design change to the front.” </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bloomberg News reported last week Tesla was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-11/tesla-plans-to-delay-robotaxi-unveiling-to-october-from-august" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-mrf-link="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-11/tesla-plans-to-delay-robotaxi-unveiling-to-october-from-august" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="0" mrfobservableid="5d221f41-1010-4fd3-bc7d-15725a621f50">pushing the event to October</a>. It had been aiming for an August 8 event. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tesla shares fell more than 6% immediately following the report, but have since recovered.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Musk responded to a question posed in a post on X, the social media network he owns, explaining the reason for the delay. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“Requested what I think is an important design change to the front, and extra time allows us to show off a few other things,” <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1812883378703925625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-mrf-link="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1812883378703925625" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="1" mrfobservableid="b6f81369-8eca-407d-8d78-167ea09b5de5">he wrote</a>.</p>

Musk denied that report on his social media platform X.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Tesla had internally planned to build the dedicated robotaxi and the $25,000 car — often referred to as the Model 2 by fans and watchers of the company — on the same platform. But Musk has waffled on the idea of building a new vehicle with a steering wheel and pedals and instead has favored going all-in on the robotaxi.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Just a few weeks after Musk announced the robotaxi event, he slashed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/16/tesla-layoffs-hit-high-performers-slashes-some-departments-sources-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/16/tesla-layoffs-hit-high-performers-slashes-some-departments-sources-say/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="4" mrfobservableid="cc19247e-f7d2-42f7-bc3e-b15021210dc3">more than 10%</a> of Tesla’s global workforce and said the company was going “balls to the wall for autonomy.”</p>

In February, he posted on X about how the long-delayed second generation Tesla Roadster is going to be capable of going even faster than originally promised — an announcement that surprised the Roadster development team, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/at-tesla-a-wild-week-that-defined-the-companys-future?shared=1c2491a98c59b2c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-mrf-link="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/at-tesla-a-wild-week-that-defined-the-companys-future?shared=1c2491a98c59b2c0" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="5" mrfobservableid="3fd4b1ab-1dd6-493e-8586-3e7aa6ce803b">The Information</a>.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Musk’s robotaxi event announcement similarly took employees by surprise, according to one person familiar with the matter, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A new EV road trip planning feature in FLO’s EV charging app lets drivers customize their journey, optimize routes and find charging stops at more than 30 networks</h2>
<p>Planning a road trip this summer with your electric vehicle? There’s an app for that. </p>
<p>As the summer road trip rush gets into high gear, FLO EV Charging is offering a new trip-planning feature in its app.</p>
<p>The new tool allow EV drivers to program in their desired routes that are then matched to convenient charging stops along the way. Drivers can select their specific EV make and model, set precise charge levels for both departure and arrival and even account for factors like the number of passengers, climate control, extra weight and weather conditions.</p>
<p>With those details, the trip planner will identify the optimal route using over 100,000 stations across more than 30 charging networks. It will recommend essential charging stops, estimate costs and calculate the charging time needed for your trip. </p>
<p>Drivers can then transfer the route to Apple Maps or Google Maps.</p>
<p>“EV drivers can then start their journey with a clearer sense of how their range is expected to evolve between departure and arrival points and where they can expect to charge along the way based on their inputs and the feature’s estimates,” says Nathan Yang, FLO chief product officer in a <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/summer-adventures-await-flo-introduces-personalized-ev-road-trip-planning-in-the-flo-app-808588149.html">press statement.</a> </p>
<p>The trip planner feature on the FLO app is currently available for iOS and soon for Android. </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Other features of the app</h3>
<p>FLO says this latest update is part of its ongoing commitment to “provide EV drivers with the best charging experience.”</p>
<p>Last summer, the company introduced a convenience feature that allows users to monitor their charging sessions directly from their phone’s lock screen (eliminating the need to unlock the phone or open the app).</p>
<p>This feature works with both public and home charging stations on the FLO network, as well as major roaming partners.</p>
<p>Additionally, FLO’s app includes a suite of other functions including helping users locate FLO network and partner network charging stations, view the real-time availability of chargers and manage their FLO HomeTM X5 charging stations.</p>
<p>The FLO app (and the road trip feature) are free for drivers to download.</p>

A few Prime Days ago Amazon started offering invite-only deals for Prime members. To get these deals, you need to log into your Prime account and request an invite. You then have to wait and check your inbox to see if Amazon "invites" you to purchase the deal. Last year, they had an amazing 43" 4K TV deal for $99. Alas, they didn't bring that deal back for Prime Day 2024, but you can check out this year's top invite-only deals below. On a side note, I signed up for that $99 TV deal last year and although I didn't get invited to buy it, I do recall receiving an Amazon credit just for signing up.

This is Louis here taking over our Prime Day live blog from deals expert Millie. So technically, Prime Day is still a few hours out. It starts on July 16 at 12:01 a.m. (PT), which would be 2:59am here on the East Coast. However, there are hundreds of Amazon deals you can get right now. Likewise, there are plenty of junk deals out there. The purpose of our live blog is to weed out those bad deals and only focus on the good ones. The entire Tom's Guide team will be surfacing those epic deals on items we own or have reviewed. So all that said.....let's continue with the deal hunting! </p>

<p>Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is in talks to buy cybersecurity start-up Wiz for about $23 billion, in what would be the largest acquisition in the tech group’s history, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Alphabet’s discussions to acquire Wiz are still weeks away from completion, said one person with direct knowledge of the matter, while people briefed about the transaction said there was still a chance the deal would fall apart, with a number of details still needing to be addressed in talks.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>If a deal were to be reached it would be a test case for antitrust regulators, which in recent years have been cracking down on tech groups buying out emerging companies in the sector. Alphabet’s last big deal came more than a decade ago with the $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Wiz would mark a further big push into cyber security for Alphabet, two years after it acquired Mandiant for $5.4 billion.</p>
<p>New York-headquartered Wiz has raised about $2 billion from investors since its founding four years ago, according to data provider PitchBook. The start-up, led by Israeli founder and former Microsoft executive Assaf Rappaport, was most recently valued at $12 billion. Its backers include venture capital firms Sequoia and Thrive.</p>
<p>Wiz, which counts multinational groups including Salesforce, Mars, and BMW as customers, helps companies secure programs in the cloud. That has led to a surge in revenue as corporations increasingly operate their software and store data online—Wiz has said it has hit about $350 million in annual recurring revenue, a metric often used by software start-ups.</p>
<p>A deal would be among the largest acquisitions of a company backed by venture capital.</p>
<p>Wiz declined to comment on the talks, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

that were watching on this Monday morning, shares of Apple moving higher this morning following a slew of upgrades, citing the potential of its A I software joining us now to discuss, we got one mo on Bank of America it and hard analyst who recently raised his own price target on Apple.</p><p>W it's great to have you on to talk about this.</p><p>I know you have increased confidence in a multi year iphone upgrade cycle and that's part of what drove your price target increase.</p><p>Talk to me about where that confidence comes from.</p><p>Yeah, good morning.</p><p>Thanks for having me.</p><p>Uh Yeah, look, I, I mean, I think that we, we ran a survey um which is fairly broad based covers for major geographic regions.</p><p>Uh And it's been a long standing survey.</p><p>We've been running this since 2018.</p><p>It's very unusual for Apple to actually talk about future products and releases, right?</p><p>Like they basically said iphone 15 pro and newer would be needed to run some of these Apple Intelligence features.</p><p>Uh So we thought the survey was going to be somewhat pertinent to see after worldwide developer conference that people actually change their decision to buy an iphone in 2024.</p><p>And we did see a meaningful uptake and the number of people who basically said yes, we would like to upgrade our phone this year based on the future based on the feature functionality that Apple is introducing.</p><p>So a we think that, you know, this is going to be a start.</p><p>We we know obviously all the features won't be available to everyone at the same time.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="20"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>So we actually think of this as more of a multiyear cycle.</p><p>Uh given that the survey also shows that the install based age is actually quite old.</p><p>There's still a whole lot of iphone elevens, twelves and thirteens in the install base.</p><p>So we actually expect a lot of that install the base to come up for a week fresh at the same time when all these new feature functionality was starting to hit the tumor.</p><p>Yeah, it was interesting.</p><p>The evening of the worldwide developers conference, the stock really wasn't moving that much to the upside and then you had a slew of kind of commentary surrounding it and the news of day and that really led to some broader gains for Apple.</p><p>So I'm curious from your perspective, where do you get clarity on hype versus actual excitement that's gonna convert to sales regarding these iphone A I features?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Great question.</p><p>Look, I, I think that when, when apple sort of tends to introduce products.</p><p>Uh they are really ready for the consumer, right?</p><p>Like, so we, we don't see them jump the gun, not generally first to market, but at the same time, and we have a slew of already phones from, from Chinese competitors from Samsung and others uh that have some of these A I features.</p><p>So Apple is not first to the game, generally not.</p><p>But when they do come, you, you have a high degree of that whatever product they're coming up with is going to act extremely well.</p><p>So now from a perspective of like, you know, how much of this is hype versus reality, right?</p><p>I I think that when you look at the feature functionality, this is where you can start to think about a step function change in productivity.</p><p>We all aim for so much productivity in our daily life, working lives and, and try to optimize but really for from an iphone perspective and in our p small lives, we haven't had the opportunity to really capitalize on some of these productivity initiatives, right?</p><p>And what I'm talking about is just, you know, ordering at restaurants or, or going from place to place.</p><p>We have Ubers, a lot of this stuff can actually be automated, but we go and jump across so many different apps to try to get this just our daily routines in place.</p><p>And so uh what I think is that, you know, this is going to take some time to roll out and and they also introduced a worldwide developer conference, very deep integration with Siri.</p><p>I think this is the part that really was not understood well by the broader community is how deep this integration can go and what kind of changes that can bring.</p><p>And I think that once people got comfortable with the fact that look, I mean, Siri is going to be an assistant that you don't want to turn off as you wanted to in the past.</p><p>But rather one that you would want on that can help you with all your features.</p><p>I just think that we're entering a new paradigm over here where consumers are really going to see this increased benefit of productivity over time.</p><p>And I think that that's really key to understanding this upgrade cycle and as those features roll out and over the next several quarters and more and more developers are going to integrate, Siri even more deeply, it could start with Uber, maybe Lyft would follow, you could see open table or others start to integrate.</p><p>So as you see that really that snowballs into into sort of this effect of people wanting to upgrade for all the future functionality.</p></div></div>

<p>More details are coming to light about the AT&amp;T hack, which saw the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal data</a> of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/12/massive-att-data-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around 110M customers compromised</a> – including records of who they called and texted.</p>



<p>It’s reported that the carrier made a Bitcoin ransom payment in return for the hacker deleting the data, and that public disclosure of the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">security</a> breach was delayed for two months in response to a request from the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/fbi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBI</a> …</p>



<span id="more-958418"></span>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-massive-at-amp-t-hack">The massive AT&amp;T hack</h2>



<p>The carrier disclosed the hack last week.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>A massive AT&amp;T data breach has seen hackers able to steal the personal data of almost every customer the company has – a total of some 110 million Americans. In an incredible security fail, the stolen data includes not only customer phone numbers, but also records of who contacted whom – a potential privacy minefield.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The carrier said the data was obtained from a third-party cloud platform, and this is now believed to be Snowflake – where data from other companies was also obtained. This includes obtaining the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/04/ticketmaster-hack-560-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal data of 560M TicketMaster customers</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-carrier-paid-a-ransom">Carrier paid a ransom</h2>



<p><em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/atandt-paid-hacker-300000-to-delete-stolen-call-records/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a></em> provides evidence that AT&amp;T paid a ransom to the hacker in return for them deleting the data. The hacker originally demanded $1M in Bitcoin, and the amount finally paid was the equivalent of $373k.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The hacker, who is part of the notorious ShinyHunters hacking group that has stolen data from a number of victims through unsecured Snowflake cloud storage accounts, tells WIRED that AT&amp;T paid the ransom in May. He provided the address for the cryptocurrency wallet that sent the currency to him, as well as the address that received it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Both <em>Wired</em> itself and crypto-tracing firm TRM Labs were able to independently confirm transactions matching the hacker’s claim. Additionally, a security researcher who acted as a go-between also confirmed the payment, and provided proof.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-at-amp-t-delayed-disclosure-at-fbi-request">AT&amp;T delayed disclosure at FBI request</h2>



<p>Normally, the law requires companies to report data breaches to the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/27/data-breaches-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">within four days of discovery</a>. This requirement is intended to protect shareholders, rather than customers.</p>



<p>However, in this case <em><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/12/business/att-customers-massive-breach/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a></em> reports that AT&amp;T contacted the FBI first, and the agency asked the carrier to delay public disclosure, granting it an exemption from the SEC requirement.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The company said the US Department of Justice Department determined in May and in June that a delay in public disclosure was warranted. The FBI said AT&amp;T reached out shortly after learning about the hack, but the agency wanted to review the data for potential national security or public safety risks.</p>



<p>“In assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting… due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety,” the FBI said in a statement.</p>



<p>This appears to be the first cyber incident in which the Justice Department has asked a company to delay filing a disclosure with the SEC because of potential national security or public safety concerns.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The FBI made at least one arrest using the information provided.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article "Car recalls: Why they happen and what buyers should know":</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why car recalls happen</strong>: Car recalls occur when a vehicle's manufacturer identifies a potential safety risk or defect that needs to be repaired or replaced. Recalls can be triggered by various factors, including design or manufacturing issues, software bugs, and even consumer complaints.</li>
<li><strong>Types of recalls</strong>: There are two main types of recalls: "fail-to-function" and "non-compliance" recalls. Fail-to-function recalls involve defects that can cause a vehicle to malfunction or fail to perform as intended, while non-compliance recalls involve defects that may not be immediately hazardous, but still violate safety standards.</li>
<li><strong>How to check for open recalls</strong>: Vehicle owners can check for open recalls by visiting the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website, using their Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), or reaching out to the manufacturer's customer service department. Some dealerships and mechanics may also be able to check for recalls.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of neglecting a recall</strong>: Failure to address open recalls can have serious consequences, including increased risk of accidents, injuries, and even fatalities. In some cases, drivers may also face fines or legal action if they are involved in an accident that is attributed to a recalled defect.</li>
<li><strong>What buyers should know</strong>: When purchasing a used car, buyers should always check for open recalls before finalizing the sale. They can also request documentation from the seller or check with the manufacturer to ensure the vehicle has been properly repaired or replaced. Additionally, buyers should be aware of the importance of addressing recalls promptly and should not hesitate to contact the manufacturer or a authorized dealership if issues arise.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inflation is easing</strong>: The consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, dipped in June for the first time in more than four years, suggesting that inflation may be cooling down.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Reserve may lower interest rates soon</strong>: Recent signs of easing inflation have paved the way for the Federal Reserve to start lowering interest rates as soon as this fall, according to Fed Chair Jerome Powell.</li>
<li><strong>Rate cut may bring relief for households</strong>: A fall rate cut could bring relief to households struggling with high borrowing costs, as it would lower the interest rates on private student loans, credit cards, and other variable-rate debts.</li>
<li><strong>Fed officials expect multiple rate cuts in 2024 and 2025</strong>: Fed officials have signaled that they expect to reduce the benchmark rate once in 2024 and four additional times in 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Consumers should review their debt and spending habits</strong>: With a potential rate cut on the horizon, consumers are advised to review their debt and spending habits to make the most of their money, consider debt relief options, and prioritize their spending.</li>

Although that’s not the rate consumers pay, the Fed’s moves still affect the rates they see every day on things such as private student loans and credit cards.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>“If you are a consumer, now is the time to say, what does my spending look like? Where would my money grow the most and what options do I have?” said Leslie Tayne, an attorney specializing in debt relief at Tayne Law in New York and author of “Life &amp; Debt.”</p><p>Here are three key strategies to consider:</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline0"></a>1. Watch your variable-rate debt</h2><div class="group"><p>With a rate cut, the prime rate lowers, too, and the interest rates on variable-rate debt — such as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/01/credit-cards-gaining-steam-again.html">credit cards</a>, adjustable-rate mortgages and some private student loans — are likely to follow, reducing your monthly payments.</p><p>For example, credit card holders could see a reduction in their annual percentage yield, or APR, within a billing cycle or two. But even then, APRs will only ease off extremely high levels.</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/how-to-get-lower-interest-rates-without-a-fed-rate-cut.html">Rather than wait</a> for a small adjustment in the months ahead, borrowers could switch now to a zero-interest balance transfer credit card or consolidate and pay off high-interest credit cards with a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/cost-of-personal-loans/">personal loan</a>, Tayne said.</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107374951" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"></p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Olga Rolenko | Moment | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>Many homeowners with ARMs, which are pegged to a variety of indexes such as the prime rate, Libor or the 11<sup>th</sup> District Cost of Funds, may see their interest rate go down as well — although not immediately as ARMs generally reset just once a year.</p><p>In the meantime, there are fewer options to provide homeowners with extra breathing room. “Your better move may be waiting to refinance,” McBride said.</p><p>Private student loans also tend to have a variable rate tied to the prime, Treasury bill or another rate index, which means once the Fed starts cutting interest rates, the interest rates on those private student loans will start dropping.</p><p>Eventually, borrowers with existing variable-rate private student loans may also be able to refinance into a less expensive fixed-rate loan, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. </p><p>Currently, the fixed rates on a private refinance are as low as 5% and as high as 11%, Kantrowitz said.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline1"></a>2. Lock in savings rates</h2><div class="group"><p>While borrowing will become less expensive, those lower interest rates will hurt savers. </p><p>Since rates on online savings accounts, money market accounts and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/certificate-of-deposit/">certificates of deposit</a> are all poised to go down, experts say this is the time to lock in some of the highest returns in decades.</p><p>For now, top-yielding online savings accounts and one-year CDs are paying more than 5% — well above the rate of inflation.</p></div><blockquote data-test="Pullquote"><div class="Pullquote-pullquote"><p class="Pullquote-quotemark"><span class="Pullquote-quotemark1"></span><span class="Pullquote-quotemark2"></span></p><div><p class="Pullquote-quote">The opportunity to earn 5% annually on those cash investments may not last much longer.</p><div class="Pullquote-sourceWrapper"><p class="Pullquote-sourceAccentWrapper"></p><p class="Pullquote-source">Howard Hook</p><p class="Pullquote-info">wealth advisor with EKS Associates</p></div></div></div></blockquote><div class="group"><p>“One thing you may want to do is consider investing any idle cash you have into a higher-yielding money market fund,” said certified financial planner Howard Hook, a senior wealth advisor at EKS Associates in Princeton, New Jersey.</p><p>“Money market brokerage accounts usually pay higher rates than money market or savings accounts at banks,” he said in an emailed statement. “If the Fed is indeed looking to reduce rates five times over the next eighteen months (as currently projected), then the opportunity to earn 5% annually on those cash investments may not last much longer.”</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline2"></a>3. Put off large purchases</h2><div class="group"><p>If you’re planning a major purchase, like a home or car, then it may pay to wait, since lower interest rates could reduce the cost of financing down the road.</p><p>“Timing your purchase to coincide with lower rates can save money over the life of the loan,” Tayne said.</p><p>Although mortgage rates are fixed and tied to Treasury yields and the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/us-economy/">economy</a>, they’ve already started to come down from recent highs, largely due to the prospect of a Fed-induced economic slowdown. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is now just above 7%, according to Bankrate.</p><p>However, lower mortgage rates could also boost homebuying demand, which would push prices higher, McBride said. “If lower mortgage rates lead to a surge in prices, that’s going to offset the affordability benefit for would-be buyers.”</p></div><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><div class="group"><p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/auto-loans/">auto loans</a>, there’s no question inflation has hit financing costs — and vehicle prices — hard. The average rate on a five-year new car loan is now nearly 8%, according to Bankrate.</p><p>But in this case, “the financing is one variable, and it’s frankly one of the smaller variables,” McBride said. For example, a quarter percentage point reduction in rates on a $35,000, five-year loan is $4 a month, he calculated.</p><p>In this case, and in many other situations as well, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/27/why-a-good-credit-score-matters-and-how-to-improve-your-number.html">consumers would benefit more from improving their credit scores</a>, which could pave the way to even better loan terms, McBride said.</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO</h2></div></div></div></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

<li><strong>Trade policy uncertainty and defense pressures could impact Europe</strong>: Trump's re-election could lead to increased trade policy uncertainty, defense and security pressures, and spillover effects from U.S. domestic policies, such as taxes, which could negatively impact the European economy.</li>
<li><strong>Markets are pricing in a Trump win</strong>: Despite a poor performance by President Joe Biden in a recent presidential debate, betting markets have assigned a probability of around 60% for a Trump win in November, with some reports indicating this figure may have risen further after the assassination attempt.</li>
<li><strong>Trade tensions could be a factor</strong>: Like during his last presidency, Trump's trade policy and the uncertainty surrounding it could impact the European economy, with trade tensions between the US and other countries, such as China, the EU, Canada, and Mexico, contributing to this uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Assassination attempt may boost Trump's chances</strong>: The assassination attempt has sparked concerns that it could boost Trump's chances of taking back the White House in the US election later this year, with some analysts suggesting that the event may have had a positive impact on his polling numbers.</li>

        <h1 class="article-heading">Cleveland-Cliffs Announces the Acquisition of Stelco</h1>
        
        
        
    	

<p>    CLEVELAND--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. <b>(NYSE:CLF)</b> (“Cliffs” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Stelco Holdings Inc. <b>(TSX:STLC)</b> (“Stelco”). The acquisition confirms Cliffs’ commitment and leadership in integrated steel production in North America, and also brings an additional 1,800 United Steelworkers (“USW”) union employees into Cliffs’ workforce. Under the terms of the agreement, Stelco shareholders will receive CAD $60.00 per Stelco common share in cash and 0.454 shares of Cliffs common stock per share of Stelco common stock (or CAD $10.00 per share as of July 12, 2024), representing a total consideration of CAD $70.00 per Stelco share. The transaction has received full support from David McCall, International President of the USW union.

</p>
<p>
The transaction implies a total enterprise value of approximately USD $2.5 billion (CAD $3.4 billion) for Stelco and represents an acquisition multiple of 4.8x 3/31/24 LTM Adjusted EBITDA with synergies. Cliffs has a clear line of sight to the achievement of approximately $120 million of estimated annual cost savings with no impact to union jobs. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to 2024 and 2025 EPS. The transaction implies pro forma net leverage of 2.4x 3/31/2024 LTM Adjusted EBITDA. Upon completion of the transaction, Cliffs shareholders will own approximately 95% and Stelco shareholders will own approximately 5% of the combined company, on a fully diluted basis.

</p>
<p>
Stelco is an integrated steelmaker consisting of two operational sites, both located in the province of Ontario: Lake Erie Works, the newest and lowest-cost integrated steelmaking facility in North America; and Hamilton Works, a downstream finishing and cokemaking facility. Stelco ships approximately 2.6 million net tons of flat-rolled steel annually, primarily hot-rolled steel to service center customers. The acquisition of Stelco expands Cliffs’ steelmaking footprint and doubles Cliffs’ exposure to the flat-rolled spot market, with cost advantages in raw materials, energy, healthcare, and currency. Stelco adds capabilities that complement Cliffs’ existing operations and product portfolio, while diversifying its customer base across the construction and industrial sectors. The transaction brings substantial integration opportunities, generating synergies associated with procurement, overhead, and public company related expenses.

</p>
<p>
Voting support agreements for the transaction have been entered into by Fairfax Financial Holdings, Alan Kestenbaum, an affiliate of Lindsay Goldberg and each of the other executive officers and directors of Stelco, which collectively represent approximately 45% of Stelco’s outstanding shares, pursuant to which such parties have agreed to vote all shares held by them in favor of the transaction, subject to customary exceptions.

</p>
<p>
Upon closing of the transaction, Stelco is expected to continue operations as a wholly-owned subsidiary, preserving the name and legacy of the business.

</p>
<p>
Lourenco Goncalves, Chairman of the Board, President and CEO of Cliffs, stated: “I want to first recognize Alan Kestenbaum and the Stelco team for the remarkable turnaround they executed at Stelco, turning what was an underperforming asset under previous ownership into a very cost-efficient and profit-oriented company. In the process, they restored the Canadian national pride associated with Stelco, and we are going to continue that. We did this deal the way it should be done, reaching a respectful agreement between the two parties that keeps national interests at the forefront and recognizes the importance of the workforce. The enterprise value of this transaction is significantly lower than the cost of building an equivalent replacement mill in the United States, and the cost structure is lower than what a new U.S. mill would provide us. Stelco is a company that respects the Union, treats their employees well, and leans into their cost advantages. With that, they are a perfect fit for Cleveland-Cliffs and our culture. We look forward to proving that our ownership of Stelco will be a net benefit for Canada, the province of Ontario, and the cities of Nanticoke and Hamilton.”

</p>
<p>
Alan Kestenbaum, Executive Chairman of the Board and CEO of Stelco, stated: “I am proud of what we have accomplished over the past seven years, and the value we have generated. This sale crystallizes a 32% CAGR on a Stelco common share investment since our IPO in 2017. Most importantly, we have revitalized Stelco and restored it to its iconic status in Canada. I know that Cliffs will continue to build upon the excellent work and life environment we have created for all of our employees, and continue to be a reliable supplier to our valued customers, while maintaining Stelco’s stature and reputation in Canada and maintaining our Canadian national interests. One of the important drivers for this transaction was receiving a meaningful portion of the consideration in Cliffs shares. I have strong belief and optimism in the North American steel market. I believe that Lourenco and his team have created a winning platform and I intend to remain an investor in Cliffs for a long time to come as he and his team continue to build out their platform and business.”

</p>
<p>
David McCall, International President of the USW, stated: “On behalf of our entire membership, I am excited for this transaction and proud to support a deal that is great for the resilience of manufacturing and Union jobs in North America. Cleveland-Cliffs has a proven track record of making sure the Union always has a seat at the table, and this deal was no different. We are delighted to further expand our already great partnership between Cliffs and the USW.”

</p>

Cliffs’ plan is to grow the business in Canada and build on the progress Stelco has made in recent years. In connection with this investment:

While JPMorgan and Citigroup are among the worst performers on the S&amp;P 500 today, both banks posted Q2 earnings that exceeded expectations.</p><p>Citi reported revenues of $20.13 billion, surpassing the forecast of $20.11 billion, and a net income of $3.03 billion, which was 11% higher than the estimated $2.72 billion. JPMorgan’s results were even better.</p><p>This week, several companies are expected to be in the spotlight, most notably Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:<span>) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:</span><span>), due to report earnings on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.</span></p><p>Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, ASML (AS:<span>), and </span><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Corporation"><span itemprop="name"> American Express </span></span><span> (NYSE:</span><span>) will also unveil their latest quarterly performance data.</span></p><h2>What analysts are saying about US stocks</h2><p><strong>JPMorgan</strong><span>: “The historical spread between the performance of S&amp;P500 and SPW is extreme. Given this, it is probable that the divergence peaks, but that could happen through winners stalling, and not through laggards rallying. Post the benign CPI print last week, SPW is bouncing again, but we fear the conditions for a sustained rally are not there, and look for the consolidation beneath the surface to continue through the summer.”</span></p><p><strong>RBC</strong><span>: “The thing that we’re most interested to get color on is whether earnings dynamics will give US equity investors a reason to continue the rotation that appeared to begin (yet again) last week away from Growth, Large, and Mega Cap, to Value, Small Cap, and everything else. As we discussed in Strategy Spotlight earlier this month, valuations and positioning have set the stage for an eventual rotation to new leadership. But this has been true for quite some time, and we’ve had several false starts. Fundamentals need to cooperate. Greater confidence around Fed cuts coming soon clearly helps to make the case for moving back into Small Caps, and we confess that we exited last week more comfortable nibbling on Small Caps.”</span></p><div class="mt-3 text-center text-xs text-[#5b616e]"><p>3rd party Ad.

If earnings turn out to be better than expected (as we project), then the bull market should broaden as investors continue to discount cuts in the federal funds rate later this year, as they did on Thursday and Friday. The breadth of positive three-month forward earnings growth rates among the S&amp;P 500 companies continues to widen.”</span></p><p><strong>Bank of America</strong><span>: “The big question in the market is “is growth slowing too much?” But tamed inflation means the Fed can solely focus on growth, putting the Fed in a much better position, especially after 5.25ppt of hikes. The stars are aligning for the rotation into rate-sensitive cyclicals: rate pressure is easing, growth would ultimately be supported by the Fed, and most importantly, earnings are broadening out as the Other 493 comes out of an earnings recession.”</span></p><div data-test="contextual-subscription-hook" class="flex flex-col items-start justify-end"><h2 data-test="contextual-subscription-hook-title" class="text-[1.11111em] font-bold">Which stock should you buy in your very next trade?</h2><p data-test="contextual-subscription-hook-text" class="mt-5 max-w-full text-[1em] tracking-[-0.0125em]">With valuations skyrocketing in 2024, many investors are uneasy putting more money into stocks.
