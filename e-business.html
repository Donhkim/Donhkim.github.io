<p>Spot lumber prices have plummeted 75% from their May 2021 record high of $1,514 per thousand board feet to just $366 this week, roughly matching pre-pandemic levels, according to Random Lengths’ Framing Lumber Composite Price Index. Lumber’s price drop has been particularly dramatic in just the last 90 days in the futures market, with contract prices for July falling 28% to $466 per thousand board feet (futures prices are around $100 above spot prices due to a delivery fee).</p>



<p>Industry experts blame the record <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/20/housing-affordability-crisis-long-plagued-renters-coming-for-homeowners/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/20/housing-affordability-crisis-long-plagued-renters-coming-for-homeowners/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">drop</a> in U.S. housing affordability and a slowdown in home renovations for quashing lumber demand. It’s just too expensive for consumers to buy new homes or renovate their current ones. That’s led to fewer construction projects, and slowing lumber sales. Meanwhile, overly optimistic industry demand forecasts amid hopes for plunging interest rates and rising home sales have led lumber mills to increase supply at the worst possible moment. </p>



<p>Put it all together and “it’s an ugly scenario” for the lumber market, Ashley Boeckholt, director of lumber and risk management at Sitka Forest Products USA, told <em>Fortune</em>. “We’re kind of having a hangover from a great three years.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"></p></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The demand side: A record deterioration in housing affordability and a renovation slowdown</h2>



<p>The factors behind lumber’s price moves are varied and complex, but, as always, it all comes down to supply and demand. On the demand side, sky-high home prices and elevated mortgage rates have led to a record drop in U.S. housing affordability over the past few years. The Atlanta Federal Reserve’s Home Ownership Affordability Monitor (HOAM) Index is now at its <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/center-for-housing-and-policy/data-and-tools/home-ownership-affordability-monitor" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.atlantafed.org/center-for-housing-and-policy/data-and-tools/home-ownership-affordability-monitor" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">lowest level</a> since before the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.</p><p></p>



<p>As a result, even with an ongoing housing <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/11/root-cause-housing-affordability-crisis-crunch/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/08/11/root-cause-housing-affordability-crisis-crunch/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">shortage</a>, demand for new homes has remained subdued, leading to similarly weak demand for lumber to build them. “Housing affordability is just really offsides right now,” Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist who leads Fastmarkets’ Wood Products team, told <em>Fortune</em>. “It's one of the least affordable times to buy a house in decades and the pool of qualified buyers is starting to kind of dwindle a bit, too. So high interest rates eventually do start to bite.”</p>



<p>Weak demand for new homes led home builder confidence to drop to a five-month low last month, and housing starts fell 19% from a year ago. Most of that drop was the result of the 52% year-over-year <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lance-lambert-0bb5b677_single-family-housing-starts-are-down-2-activity-7209717907713396736-kQGO/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lance-lambert-0bb5b677_single-family-housing-starts-are-down-2-activity-7209717907713396736-kQGO/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">plunge</a> in multi-family housing starts. For a while, steady single-family home starts kept lumber prices from dropping significantly, because single-family homes use more wood than multi-family projects. But now that trend has flipped as well, with single-family housing starts down 2% year-over-year in May.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"></p></figure>



<p>What’s more, the critical home-renovation market, which boomed during the pandemic helping to lift lumber prices, is also showing signs of weakness. HomeDepot saw its U.S. comparable sales sink 3.2% in the first quarter, for example. One of the reasons for the drop was “softer engagement in larger discretionary projects…such as kitchen and bath remodels,” Billy Bastek, the retailer’s executive vice president of merchandising, noted on its May earnings call.</p>



<p>Boeckholt, a veteran lumber trader who also hosts the weekly “<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-lumber-word/id1701995783" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-lumber-word/id1701995783" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Lumber Word</a>” podcast, said he is seeing evidence of declining lumber demand from retail buyers as well. Traders like him are starting to receive “premium” lumber that is typically reserved for the Home Depots and Lowes of the world. “That generally means there's pushback” from retail buyers at home goods centers, he noted.</p>



<p>This home renovation slowdown, when combined with the U.S.’ long-running housing affordability challenges, has led to a serious lack of demand for wood products, particularly when compared to what was forecast just a year ago.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The supply-side: A hope-driven ‘bullwhip’ effect</h2>



<p>While the demand side of the lumber market is ailing, the supply side may be in an even worse position. After lumber prices surged in 2021 and 2022, the lumber industry responded by investing to increase production. Many lumber veterans saw a long-term opportunity for increased demand for their products due to the housing shortage; and like many Americans, they also anticipated imminent interest-rate cuts which tend to drive more near-term lumber demand.</p><p></p>



<p>The only issue with this plan, as Fastmarkets’ Jalbert explained, is that it takes years to create new sawmills and increase lumber supply. This means that a lot of the new lumber supply that was commissioned during the pandemic is just now coming to market—at a time when added supply is the last thing the industry needs. </p>



<p>“It's a classic bullwhip,” Jalbert noted. “The supply side [responds] in a like manner to demand, and by the time it comes to the market that demand picture is already changed—and in this case in a negative way.”</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>Boeckholt backed up Jalbet’s argument, saying it’s an example of the “hangover” the lumber market is experiencing after its highly profitable pandemic years led to too much “hope” for more demand. That’s especially true “down in the southern U.S., where there have been mills in a pipeline to build for three or four years that have finally been coming on over the last year,” he said, adding that there was also a lot of investment into older mills to increase production in many regions nationwide.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect from lumber prices through year-end 2024</h2>



<p>When it comes to what to expect for the rest of this year, Boeckholt warned that lumber prices may languish near their current, pre-pandemic levels, with the potential for a minor—roughly $50—price increase in the fourth quarter. “There was a lot of hope out there, so when we wash all that hope out—which we will, eventually—that's when we'll bottom,” he said. </p>



<p>Jalbert also believes lumber prices will likely stagnate through year-end 2024, but in 2025, he argues things could turn around. Some sawmills will be forced to slow or shut down production due to depressed lumber prices in the second half of this year, lowering lumber supply—“the bullwhip in the opposite direction.” </p><p></p>



<p>That, coupled with interest rate cuts that could stoke lumber demand, will likely lead lumber futures prices to a range between $500 and $600, or slightly above pre-pandemic levels, according to Jalbert. “Supply is going to be cut and demand will recover,” he said. “But that's going to take time.”</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the Fortune Next to Lead newsletter to get weekly strategies on how to make it to the corner office. </p><a href="https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p>.</p></div></div>

                                        <p>TORONTO (AP) — Canada’s second largest airline, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.westjet.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WestJet</a></span>, said it canceled 407 flights affecting 49,000 passengers after the maintenance workers union announced it went on strike.</p><p>The Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association said its members <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/westjet-mechanics-strike-canada-flights-cancelled-a4801eb2f8eb2d09a449e91b58eb3ad8">started to strike Friday evening</a></span> because the airline’s “unwillingness to negotiate with the union” made it inevitable.</p><p>The surprise strike affecting international and domestic flights came after the federal government issued a ministerial order for binding arbitration on Thursday. That followed two weeks of turbulent discussions with the union on a new deal.</p><p>WestJet said it will continue to park aircraft through Sunday for the long weekend culminating in Canada Day on Monday. The airline has about 200 aircraft and says they’ll operate approximately 30 by Sunday evening.</p><p>The airline’s CEO, Alexis von Hoensbroech, put the blame for the situation squarely on what he said was a “rogue union from the U.S.” that was trying to make inroads in Canada.</p>
    

<p>Von Hoensbroech said that, as far as the airline was concerned, bargaining with the union had come to an end once the government directed the dispute to binding arbitration.</p>



<p>“This makes a strike totally absurd because the reason you actually do a strike is because you need to exercise pressure on the bargaining table,” he said. “If there is no bargaining table it makes no sense, there shouldn’t be a strike.”</p>
    
<p>He added the union had rejected a contract offer that would have made the airline’s mechanics the “best-paid in the country.”</p><p>In an update to its membership, the union negotiating committee referenced an order by the Canada Industrial Relations Board that does not explicitly bar any strikes or lockouts as the tribunal undertakes arbitration.</p><p>Sean McVeigh, a WestJet aircraft maintenance engineer picketing Saturday at Toronto Pearson International Airport Terminal 3, said the strike is an attempt to force the airline to return to a “respectful negotiation.”</p>
    

<p>McVeigh said the union regrets any inconvenience caused to passengers.</p><p>“However, the reason they (passengers) have possibly missed a flight or had to cancel is due to the reason that WestJet is not respectfully sitting down at the table and negotiating,” he said alongside roughly 20 others on the picket line. </p><p>“We take on a lot of responsibility and we would just like to be appreciated financially,” he said.</p><p>At Pearson, WestJet passengers Samin Sahan and Samee Jan said they had been planning to leave Saturday with extended family members on a trip to Calgary that had been planned for six to eight months.</p><p>Sahan said they had received emails earlier in the day telling them their flight had been rescheduled for Monday, but they went to the terminal anyway. He said their efforts to seek clarification combined with the strike had left their travel plans up in the air.</p><p>“This inaction is hurting a lot of people, their own company as well as their customers who will likely no longer be their customers ever again,” Sahan said.</p><p>Jan called the situation “sad.”</p>

            The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen more than 32 million folks at US airports from June 27 through July 8. That would be a 5.4% increase over the 2023 Independence Day holiday. “We expect this summer to be our busiest ever and summer travel usually peaks over the Independence Day holiday,” said TSA Administrator David Pekoske in a news release this week.

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>Share prices of <strong>Rivian</strong> <span class="ticker">(NASDAQ: RIVN)</span> surged higher after the maker of electric vehicles (EV) received a sizeable investment from German automaker <strong>Volkswagen</strong> <span class="ticker">(OTC: VWAGY)</span>. Despite the recent price gains, the stock is still down nearly 43% in 2024.</p><p>Let's look at the importance of this investment, how it could help Rivian, and if it is too late to buy the stock.</p><h2>Volkswagen investment</h2><p>Volkswagen announced it will invest up to $5 billion in Rivian over three years as well as form a 50/50 joint venture (JV) between the companies. Volkswagen will initially invest $1 billion in the company in the form of a convertible note, which will convert to Rivian shares once it receives regulatory approvals, but not before Dec. 1, 2024.</p><p>If the JV is approved, the German automaker would look to invest another $4 billion into Rivian or the JV by 2026, including another $1 billion this year upon the implementation of the JV. The purpose of the JV will be to develop next-generation electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture for EVs.</p><p>For the JV, Rivian will contribute its expertise in the field of electronic architecture for software-defined vehicles and the associated IP via a fully paid-up license. The formation of the JV will also allow Volkswagen to use Rivian's current electronic architecture in its own vehicles, which includes its new zonal hardware design.</p><p>For Volkswagen, the deal brings with it immediate access to much-needed technology to develop its next generation of EVs. Rivian is one of the few non-Chinese automakers outside of <strong>Tesla</strong> so far to develop zonal architecture.</p><p>For Rivian, meanwhile, this is a huge cash infusion that will allow the company to continue to scale its business. Along with the current $7.9 billion in cash on its balance sheet, this should give Rivian ample room to ramp up production of its lower-priced R2 SUV models at its Illinois plant, as well as build out its planned $5 billion manufacturing campus in Georgia, which it temporarily paused construction on earlier this year.</p><p>Volkswagen will also lend some of its manufacturing expertise, which can help Rivian continue to cut manufacturing costs. Rivian has done a great job creating popular luxury electric SUVs, but it has not been able to sell them for a profit, losing money on each vehicle it sells. At its investor day following the Volkswagen announcement, the company spent much of its time discussing reducing the costs of its vehicles so it could obtain a positive <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/g/gross-margin/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=c7d6bb89-2f3c-486d-bd18-616b8c562fe4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gross margin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="14">gross margin</a>.</p><p>The company reiterated its forecast to be near a positive gross margin in the fourth quarter, and it set a long-term target of a 25% gross margin. It is also looking for a 10% free cash flow margin and a high-teens adjusted profit margin over the long term.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="15"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">Image source: Getty Images.</figcaption></p></figure><h2>Is it too late to buy the stock?</h2><p>The Volkswagen investment, if the JV is approved, should give Rivian the cash it needs to scale its business and make it viable. Negative gross margins and cash flow have been its biggest issues, but the company has made aggressive steps to reduce the cost of its vehicles and improve its manufacturing process.</p><p>The development of its zonal architecture, meanwhile, has not only greatly improved the cost structure of its vehicles, but has also proven to be a highly valuable technology that Volkswagen was willing to pay a lot of money to get access to for use in its vehicles.</p><p>The deal now gives Rivian two very large powerful investors and partners in Volkswagen and <strong>Amazon</strong>, for whom it has a deal in place to make Amazon's electric van fleet.</p><p>Rivian remains a high-risk/high-reward stock given its early-stage nature and still negative gross margin. However, the deal with Volkswagen helped remove a lot of the liquidity risk associated with the company. As such, the stock looks more attractive from a risk-reward basis after its recent run-up than before the deal.</p><h2>Should you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?</h2><p>Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:</p><p>The <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the <strong><a href="https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=8a3e6da0-fdf5-4690-97f3-549d3077764d&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-foolcom-sa-bbn-dyn%3Faid%3D8867%26amp%253Bsource%3Disaeditxt0010895%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D13885&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=c7d6bb89-2f3c-486d-bd18-616b8c562fe4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 best stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The US 10-year Treasury yield has been stuck in a narrow range of 4.20% to 4.35% since mid-June, with no clear direction due to mixed economic data.</li>
<li>Upcoming economic reports, including employment data and inflation numbers, could break the yield's range-bound pattern. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's Congressional testimony may also have a significant impact on the market.</li>
<li>Some economists believe that a higher unemployment rate could push yields lower, while others are skeptical about the yield's potential for further decline due to stubborn inflationary pressures.</li>
<li>The low liquidity surrounding the July 4th holiday could exacerbate market reactions to employment data, which is due to be released next Friday.</li>
<li>A recent survey by BofA Global Research found that fund managers are the most underweight on bonds since November 2022, which could lead to a potential increase in fixed-income allocations if economic data weakens, supporting the case for more rate cuts and potentially driving yields lower.</li>

                    A series of upcoming economic reports and Congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could jolt U.S. government bonds out of a narrow trading range.
</p><p>Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasuries, which move inversely to bond prices, have bounced between about 4.20% and 4.35% since mid-June, as the market digested data showing slowing inflation and signs of cooling economic growth in some indicators. The 10-year yield stood at 4.33% on Friday.</p>

<p>So far, the economic numbers have failed to dispel doubts over how deeply the Fed will be able to cut interest rates this year, keeping Treasury yields range-bound. But next week's U.S. employment data, followed by inflation numbers and Powell's appearance could change that outlook.</p>

<p>"The market has settled into a narrative that we may see incremental softness but not a growth scare," said Garrett Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. "That will continue to keep us in this range, but the one thing that will push it meaningfully lower is an increase in the unemployment rate."</p>

<p>U.S. monthly inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was unchanged in May, a report released on Friday showed, advancing the narrative of slowing inflation and resilient growth that has tamped down bond market gyrations and buoyed stocks in recent weeks. Yet futures linked to the fed funds rate showed traders pricing in just under 50 basis points of rate cuts for the year.</p>

<p>Market reactions to employment data, due next Friday, could be exacerbated by low liquidity during a week when many U.S. bond traders will be on vacation for the July 4th U.S. Independence Day holiday, said Hugh Nickola, head of fixed income at GenTrust.</p>

<p>"The market is waiting for the other shoe to drop."</p>

<p>A recent survey by BofA Global Research showed fund managers the most underweight bonds since November 2022. Some believe that means yields could fall further if weakening data bolsters the case for more rate cuts and spurs increased allocations to fixed income.</p>

<p>Other highlights for the month include consumer price data scheduled for July 11. Powell is scheduled to give his semiannual testimony on monetary policy on July 9 at the Senate Banking Committee, said the office of its chairman, Senator Sherrod Brown, on Monday. If tradition holds, the Fed Chair will deliver the same testimony at the House Financial Services committee the following day.</p>

<p>Some investors are not convinced Treasury yields have much further to fall. Despite its recent cooling, inflation has proven more stubborn than expected this year, forcing the Fed to rein in expectations for how aggressively it can cut rates. A recent unexpected inflationary rebound in Australia underscored how difficult it has been for some central banks to keep consumer prices under control.</p>

<p>At the same time, some investors believe inflation is unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels and the U.S. economic is likely to show a higher level of underlying strength, limiting the longer term downside for bond yields, said Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group.</p>

<p>"The market has become much more acclimated to the idea that when the Fed cuts rates, they won't cut by as much as people surmised a few months ago," Wizman said. "People have adjusted their expectations but there's a limit to how much yields can fall on one month of bad data."</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Crypto platforms will report transactions to the IRS</strong>: Starting in 2026, crypto platforms that hold assets (such as Coinbase) will be required to report transactions to the IRS, making it easier for individuals to pay taxes on their crypto gains.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralized platforms exempt</strong>: However, decentralized platforms that don't hold assets themselves will be exempt from these reporting requirements, after lobbying from the crypto industry.</li>

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Crypto platforms will need to report transactions to the Internal Revenue Service, starting in 2026. However, decentralized platforms that don’t hold assets themselves will be exempt.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Those are the main takeaways from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-14004/gross-proceeds-and-basis-reporting-by-brokers-and-determination-of-amount-realized-and-basis-for">new regulations</a> that the IRS and U.S. Department of Treasury finalized Friday — essentially implementing a provision of the Biden Administration’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was passed in 2021.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Gains from selling crypto and other digital assets are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/14/irs-fud-what-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-taxes/">taxable</a> even without these new regulations; however, there was no real standardization around how those gains were reported to individual investors and to the government. Beginning in 2026 (covering transactions in 2025), crypto platforms must provide a standard 1099 form, similar to the ones sent by banks and traditional brokerages.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Beyond making it simpler to pay taxes on crypto, the IRS also said it’s trying to crack down on tax evasion.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“We need to make sure digital assets are not used to hide taxable income, and these final regulations will improve detection of noncompliance in the high-risk space of digital assets,” said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-irs-issue-final-regulations-requiring-broker-reporting-of-sales-and-exchanges-of-digital-assets-that-are-subject-to-tax-under-current-law-additional-guidance-to-provide-penalty-relief-address">a statement</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But again, these regulations apply to “custodial” platforms (such as Coinbase) that actually take possession of customer assets. After lobbying from the crypto industry, decentralized brokers that don’t take possession are excluded from these rules. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In fact, the Blockchain Association (an industry lobbying group) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theblockchainassociation.org/blockchainassociation-statement-on-irs-broker-rule/">called the exclusion</a> “a testament to the incredibly powerful voice of our industry and community.”</p>
<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">
</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Treasury Department and IRS said they will cover these decentralized brokers in a separate set of regulations.</p>

<li><strong>Nvidia's stock has fallen</strong>: After reaching a market cap of $3.34 trillion, Nvidia's stock fell by over 6% over the next three trading days, with no significant news driving the decline.</li>
<li><strong>Investors are rotating out of Nvidia</strong>: The article suggests that investors are shifting out of Nvidia and other chip-heavy stocks, leading to the decline in the company's stock price.</li>

<p>The Fed required the banks to wait until after the market closed Friday to announce any updates, allowing time for each firm, as well as investors, to digest the results. </p><p></p>



<p>This year’s annual exam, a product of the 2008 financial crisis, included banks with at least $100 billion of assets. For the entire group, the so-called common equity tier 1 capital ratio — deemed to be the highest-quality regulatory capital — would bottom out at 9.9% in a “severely adverse” economic scenario, well above the 4.5% minimum requirement. </p>



<p>Even as banks breezed through, the stress tests are still the subject of intense debate among economists and policymakers.

Gavin Newsom’s office confirmed Saturday that he signed SB 1524, legislation that allows restaurants to continue adding surcharges to diners’ checks — fees that the industry says are crucial to the survival of these businesses.</p><p>These fees range from additional tips intended to maintain pay parity between the wait staff and the kitchen staff, to city health mandate fees, to corkage fees for diners who bring their own bottles of wine for dinner.</p><p>Without the industry carve-out, an emergency measure introduced by Sen. Bill Dodd (D-Napa) in early June, restaurants, bars and other food service businesses would have been subject to the SB 478 prohibition starting July 1 on so-called “hidden fees.”</p><p>The Golden Gate Restaurant Association hailed the approval, noting that surcharges “will make it possible for restaurants to continue to support pay equity and contribute to worker health care.”</p><p>Transparency is critical, the GGRA said in its statement Saturday. “Customers should never be surprised by their bill,” the group said.</p><cnx class="cnx-main-container cnx-in-desktop cnx-ps cnx-main-container-flex" id="318b84a3e17949b7bdc1ee73a1409c59"><cnx class="cnx-player-wrapper cnx-size-responsive cnx-in-ad-container cnx-hide-pinned-title-in-ad"><cnx class="cnx-ratio"></cnx><cnx class="cnx-playspace-container cnx-in-ps-landscape cnx-bp-md-st cnx-close-hover cnx-close-float-off cnx-bp-xl-v cnx-in-ad-full cnx-in-ad"><cnx class="cnx-ui cnx-ui-ad cnx-ad-duration cnx-is-playing"><cnx class="cnx-ui-ad-content "><cnx class="cnx-ad-marker" role="img" aria-label="Ad"><cnx class="cnx-marker-cnt-first"><cnx class="cnx-marker-cnt-second"><cnx class="cnx-ad-marker-svg"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 32 22"><path d="M26,22H0V0H31.93L32,16A6,6,0,0,1,26,22Z"></path><path d="M12,5.29h0L16.45,16.7H14.83l-1.06-2.85H8.86l-1,2.85H6.21L10.6,5.31h0Zm5.89,11.42V5.29h3.63A5.52,5.52,0,0,1,26.65,11a5.33,5.33,0,0,1-4.93,5.7H17.89Zm1.46-1.36h2.17c1.77,0,3.7-1.49,3.7-4.35s-1.93-4.28-3.7-4.28H19.35Zm-8-8.16-2,5.24h3.86Z"></path></svg>

Palo Alto, Fremont and Milpitas, was pleased to hear of Saturday’s resolution of the issue.</p><p>“I am happy to know that the political figures finally understand the importance of taking action to support the restaurant business,” she said. “The service charge will help business owners maintain a balance in payments between front-of-house workers and back-of-house workers,” she said. “It will also save money for customers ordering takeout.”</p><p>In the months leading up to the rollout of SB 478, confusion emerged about how it would be implemented. When details about the new policy were released in May in a California Department of Justice FAQ, it triggered alarms around the restaurant community, because it stipulated that no extra restaurant fees — including mandatory tips for large parties (a widespread industry practice), as well as various surcharges, many of which were clearly shown on restaurant menus — would be permitted. That would leave restaurants to try to recoup that income by rolling those costs into the overall price per item on each menu.</p><p></p><p>And that, in turn, could trigger even more severe sticker shock among restaurant customers, Bay Area restaurant owner and partner Darren Matte said earlier this month.</p><p></p><p>“There’s an art and a science to menu pricing,” said Matte, whose restaurants include Los Gatos Parkside, Harvest in Danville and Per Diem in San Francisco. Efforts that restaurants make to, for instance, keep burgers under a ceiling of $20 or entrées under $30, would be in vain if there aren’t other ways to cover the costs of running the restaurant, he said.</p><p></p>

<figure id="attachment_161455" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161455" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-161455 size-medium" title="Paul Zimnisky" src="https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Paul-Zimnisky-600-by-600-300x300.jpg" alt="Paul Zimnisky" srcset="https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Paul-Zimnisky-600-by-600-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Paul-Zimnisky-600-by-600-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Paul-Zimnisky-600-by-600.jpg 600w, https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Paul-Zimnisky-600-by-600-120x120.jpg 120w, https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Paul-Zimnisky-600-by-600-240x240.jpg 240w, https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Paul-Zimnisky-600-by-600-160x160.jpg 160w, https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Paul-Zimnisky-600-by-600-320x320.jpg 320w, https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Paul-Zimnisky-600-by-600-450x450.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-161455" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Paul Zimnisky</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>“I’m still forecasting that demand will be down, probably by a low- to mid-single-digit percentage year over year, in 2024,” Zimnisky said. “The next big catalyst will be to see if the Federal Reserve starts to reverse some of that interest rate hike cycle over the next six to 12 months. Something like that could stimulate consumer demand.”</p>
<p>Below, we offer additional excerpts from Zimnisky’s illuminating presentation, including the outlook for natural diamond production, how a “lukewarm” economy is affecting discretionary spending, and what has propelled the rise of lab-grown diamonds.</p>
<p><strong>On the volatility of the past four years</strong></p>
<p>“The last four years have been highly unusual. Obviously, the lockdowns in 2020 were followed by record demand in 2021 and 2022. The last 18 months or so, we’ve been dealing with an overhang. We had diamond prices make an all-time high in the first quarter of 2022, according to my proprietary rough diamond price index.</p>
<p>“Since then, prices have come off anywhere from 20% to 30%, depending on the category. So it’s just been breakneck volatility. And the fun continues. Now we’re dealing with sanctions on Russian diamonds. We’re dealing with a significant macroeconomic slowdown in China. De Beers is now up for sale. The list goes on and on.”</p>
<p><strong>On natural diamond supplies</strong></p>
<p>“I’m forecasting that global natural diamond production will be approximately 115 million carats this year. I think that’s a relatively sweet spot for production. If we look at some watermarks—for instance, in 2017 production was 150 million carats. …2020 production was about 110 million carats; notably, that was the lowest level of output since the 1990s. So if we look at the previous range of production, we’re kind of towards the lower end of that.</p>
<p>“If we do have lower supply, it should theoretically at least allow for higher prices if and when we see an increase in relative demand. Obviously, we don’t want an oversupplied market, but you also want enough core supply that diamonds can remain a relevant luxury product.”</p>
<p><strong>On upcoming diamond production </strong></p>
<p>“There’s only one major new mine of significant size that’s commencing production this year. It’s the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/angolas-new-diamond-mine-opens-against-backdrop-weak-demand-2023-11-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luele mine in Angola</a>. And if we look at future production catalysts, there’s really not a whole lot on the horizon.</p>
<p>“We’re in this phase where these legacy mines are getting older. Production is declining. Some of them are reaching depletion and closing. There just aren’t a whole lot of significant new sources of supply—and that’s even if we’re looking 10, 20 years into the future. At the end of the day, with most commodities, and diamonds are in this category, as the price of the commodity goes higher, typically that drives economics and allows new projects to come online.</p>
<p>“Diamonds are somewhat unique given the long lead time to put new mines into production. The <a href="https://www.debeersgroup.com/about-us/our-operations/our-mines/canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gahcho Kué mine</a> in Canada, which came online around 2016, I think that literally was 25 years, the process to finally bring that online. So there’s a long lead time to bring these new products online, and it kind of gives you an idea of what supply is going to look like into the future.”</p>
<p><strong>On diamond demand</strong></p>
<p>“Diamond prices, there’s always going to be short-term volatility. A great example of that was what we’ve seen the last few years where we went from a market where diamond stocks were sold out in early 2022, and then the industry aggressively restocked just as some of these demand drivers were starting to reverse. The stimulus ran out. People were able to go out and spend money on these experiential things. So that kind of leaves us in a situation today where I would say the diamond supply chain is still overstocked. I think it’s going to take some time to de-stock it.</p>

Movál-cut diamonds, $38,000; <a href="https://rahaminov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rahaminov</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>“But I think that’s going to be worked through mostly in 2024 and then 2025. If we’re looking at demand, it’s important to remember that diamonds tend to correlate quite highly with GDP.</p>
<p>“If we’re looking at just economic growth in the U.S., you could certainly make the argument that the economy is outperforming relative to expectations. If we’re looking at government economic action with the Federal Reserve, we saw the most aggressive sequence of interest rate hikes probably since the 1980s over the last few years. Obviously, that was meant to try to quell the inflation problem, which was a problem that was arguably caused by too much fiscal stimulus.</p>
<p>“Inflation is still stickier than I think a lot of people would like it to be at this point. It’s definitely impacting consumer spending ability on more discretionary items like diamonds. But at the end of the day, most consumers are still working. They’re gainfully employed, and they’re doing the best to deal with the impacts of inflation. The consumer economy in the U.S., it’s not cold, it’s not hot. It’s moderate, maybe lukewarm.”</p>
<p><strong>On lab-growns’ effect on the natural market</strong></p>
<p>“I’ve been following this very closely since about 2015. The product went mainstream in maybe 2017, 2018, and then it just went crazy in 2021 and 2022.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen an explosion in supply. We’ve seen prices come down and a pretty consistent trend. In theory, we can produce as many lab diamonds as we want. They’re getting to the point where they could produce the sizes, the colors, the clarities that they want. And that’s just something that comes with advancements and production technologies for a manufactured product like this.</p>

<p>“If we’re looking at the impact that lab diamonds are having on natural diamonds, it’s certainly a significant sensitivity. It’s impacting the supply side of the equation. If we go back to, say, 2015, lab diamonds were probably, at best, 1% of global diamond jewelry demand. This year, I’m forecasting that we’re going to breach 20% for the first time.</p>
<p>“Natural diamonds still dominate diamond demand globally. But obviously, coming from essentially a base of zero, the growth has been extremely aggressive. It’s been extremely rapid. And there’s been a lot of volatility around the product that I think a lot of people in the trade weren’t expecting.”</p>
<p><strong>On why lab diamonds have struck a chord with consumers</strong></p>
<p>“If you look at the driving factor for the product, part of it is the novelty. It’s been a long time since the diamond industry has had something exciting and new to bring to customers. Customers always want newness. That was part of it. At the end of the day, it’s definitely the lower price point that’s driving the consumer interest.</p>
<figure id="attachment_196483" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-196483" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-196483 size-full" title="Smiling Rocks necklace" src="https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Smiling-Rocks-necklace.jpg" alt="Smiling Rocks necklace" srcset="https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Smiling-Rocks-necklace.jpg 600w, https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Smiling-Rocks-necklace-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Smiling-Rocks-necklace-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Smiling-Rocks-necklace-120x120.jpg 120w, https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Smiling-Rocks-necklace-240x240.jpg 240w, https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Smiling-Rocks-necklace-160x160.jpg 160w, https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Smiling-Rocks-necklace-320x320.jpg 320w, https://www.jckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Smiling-Rocks-necklace-450x450.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-196483" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Couture Drop necklace in 14k white gold with 29.83 cts. t.w. lab-grown diamonds, price on request; <a href="https://smilingrocks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smiling Rocks</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>“But the other factor to keep in mind is that a lot of retailers really adopted the product. They saw it as an opportunity to drive their profit margins. And the profit margins for lab diamonds—on a relative basis, at least—are still significantly higher than that of a natural diamond. So there’s really been an incentive for a lot of retailers to sell the product, and not only sell it, but maybe push it more so than natural diamonds because they wanted to capture that profit margin.</p>
<p>“As the price comes down—you’ll see a lot of cases where lab diamonds sell for a 90% or even a greater discount than that of an equivalent natural diamond—we’re getting to the point where the price points are getting so low, even if you have that fat relative profit margin, your overall profits for your business are going to take a hit just because your top line is going to be impacted.</p>
<p>“Now the question becomes, this year and going into 2025: Will these reduced profit margins for lab diamonds ultimately lead to a pivot in a lot of jewelers’ propensity to push lab diamonds over natural diamonds? If that happens, that could certainly be a big catalyst for the natural diamond industry.”</p>

Amazon makes it super easy to add products to your Wish List or Save for Later section, which will make it much easier to try and check things off your shopping list once the sale kicks off.    </p><p>Better yet, if you have <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="/home/smart-home/best-alexa-devices/" rel="follow" class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"><span>Alexa devices</span></a></span> you can even be alerted if a product you've saved goes on sale during the Prime Big Deal Days sale. We truly live in the future.    </p><h2>   Be open-minded to alternative picks   </h2><p>Sometimes the price of the product you really want just doesn't budge. Instead of staring at its Amazon listing and missing out on other great deals, maybe have a backup pick or two in mind in case this situation arises. That way you can still ensure you're saving money on a product that will fit the bill, even if it might not have been your go-to choice.    </p><p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class=""></p><p>Think about what makes your top pick the most attractive choice, assess its pros and cons, then see if any other products check some of the same boxes. Chances are, there's an alternative product that gets you 90% of the way there and may save you a decent amount of money come Prime Day.    </p><h2>   Don't be limited to Amazon   </h2><p>This sounds counterintuitive, but some of the best Prime Day deals don't actually crop up on Amazon. In recent years, competing retailers such as <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="/deals/walmart-fourth-of-july-sale/" rel="follow" class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"><span>Walmart</span></a></span> and <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="/" rel="follow" class="c-shortcodeLink"><span>Target</span></a></span> have launched their own sales to coincide with Amazon's big jamboree and try and steal away some buyers that are already primed to open their wallets. These July sales are no different, with sales already announced at <a href="https://www.cnet.com/deals/best-buys-member-deal-days-sale-is-offering-mega-discounts-for-plus-and-total-members-right-now/" rel="follow" target="_self">Best Buy</a>, Walmart and Target. </p><p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class=""></p><p>Competition is good news for consumers, especially if you've been holding out on making some big purchases until the fall sale season. </p><p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class=""></p><h2>   Keep checking back   </h2><p>Amazon deals are ever-changing, especially during events like Prime Day, so you're going to want to peep the sale periodically throughout the event to ensure you're giving yourself the best chance of scoring the best deals.    </p><p>Like previous events, we expect that we'll see the first tranche of Prime Day deals go live at midnight PT (3 a.m. ET) when the event officially kicks off on July 16, with a second batch dropping at the same time on Day 2 of the event. That said, super-limited-time lightning deals will be popping up and expiring throughout the two-day span, and Amazon will also be trying its best to match any stellar sales offered at other retailers. There are a lot of moving parts, and prices rarely stand still for too long during the event hours.    </p><p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class=""></p><h2>   Let us do the work for you   </h2><p>The CNET Deals team will be hard at work throughout July surfacing the very best deals for our readers, so follow along with our coverage if you want to separate the signal from the noise during Amazon's Fourth of July and Prime Day sales.    </p><p>For a great overview of the best price cuts, check out <a href="https://www.cnet.com/deals/best-4th-of-july-sales/" rel="follow" target="_self">our picks for Fourth of July deals</a> and our <a href="https://www.cnet.com/deals/amazon-prime-day/" rel="follow" target="_self">favorite Prime Day bargains</a>.</p></div></div>
