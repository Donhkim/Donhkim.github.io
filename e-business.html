<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">It’s been a busy weekend for union organizing efforts at U.S. Apple stores, with the union at one store voting to authorize a strike, while workers at another store voted against forming a union.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Back in 2022, workers in Towson, Maryland became <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/18/apple-store-union-maryland-win-vote/">the first formally recognized union at an Apple retail store</a>. That union, which is part of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, voted Saturday to <a href="https://www.goiam.org/news/iam-core-members-at-first-unionized-u-s-apple-retail-store-vote-to-authorize-strike/">authorize a strike</a>. The date of this potential strike has yet to be determined.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“This vote today is the first step in demonstrating our solidarity and sends a clear message to Apple,” said the IAM CORE Negotiating Committee in a statement. “The passage of the strike sanction vote highlights IAM CORE’s unwavering commitment to advocating for the rights and well-being of workers in the face of challenges. As discussions with Apple management continue, we remain committed to securing tangible improvements that benefit all employees.”</p>

	
	


	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The union says it has been negotiating with Apple since January 2023 over issues including work-life balance, unpredictable scheduling, and wages.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“We deeply value our team members and we’re proud to provide them with industry leading compensation and exceptional benefits,” an Apple spokesperson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-12/apple-store-in-new-jersey-votes-against-unionizing-cwa-says">told Bloomberg</a>. “As always, we will engage with the union representing our team in Towson respectfully and in good faith.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bloomberg also reported that a vote to unionize a Short Hills, New Jersey store with the Communication Workers of America has failed. Before the vote, the CWA <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-charges-apple-additional-labor-law-violations">filed an unfair labor practice charge</a> against Apple for allegedly retaliating against one of the organizers at the store by scheduling “unprecedented multiple meetings with his supervisor and denying requests for leave.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Earlier this week, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-06/apple-illegally-interrogated-nyc-retail-staff-us-labor-board-rules?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxNTE3NjcxNiwiZXhwIjoxNzE1NzgxNTE2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTRDMwVThEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIyMUUyRjFBQUYzNjA0MDM1ODU2MTZFOEY2NzI5RUJDNSJ9.ERcJ18ESl-5on5xFFydEHY1r0K5NebWB-7KI9-cXsSo"> Apple violated federal labor laws</a> in 2022 by confiscating union flyers and interrogating staff about unionizing efforts at the Apple store in New York’s World Trade Center.</p>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- Underlying US inflation probably moderated in April for the first time in six months, offering a ray of hope that price pressures will start to ease again after a string of upside surprises.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>The core consumer price index, which excludes food and fuel, is seen rising 0.3% from a month earlier after 0.4% advances throughout the first quarter. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will issue its CPI report on Wednesday.</p><p>Compared with April 2023, the core CPI is projected to rise 3.6%. While that annual increase would be the smallest in three years, it’s still running too fast to placate Federal Reserve policymakers, who want evidence inflation is slowing consistently as they debate the timing of interest-rate cuts.</p><p>The overall CPI probably climbed 0.4% for a third straight month as gasoline prices reached a six-month high. While core goods prices have largely been retreating, underlying services costs remain elevated and explain why inflation proved stubborn in the first quarter.</p><p>Part of the difficulty the Fed has had in bringing inflation down toward its 2% goal rests with the resilient American consumer. Retail sales in February and March advanced solidly, although economists’ projections for April suggest households took a breather. Those figures are also due on Wednesday.</p><p>On Tuesday, economists will parse the government’s report on producer prices to assess the impact of categories such as health care and portfolio management that feed into the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditures price index.</p><p>Other reports in the coming week include housing starts and industrial production for April.</p><p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak Tuesday at a foreign bankers event in Amsterdam. Regional Fed presidents Loretta Mester of Cleveland and Raphael Bostic of Atlanta — who both vote on policy this year — are also slated to speak.</p><p>What Bloomberg Economics Says:</p><p>“April’s core CPI report could appear encouraging – we expect it to decelerate from March – but we see a meaningful likelihood that the month’s core PCE reading, a greater concern for the Fed, could still come in robust.”</p><p>—Anna Wong, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger and Estelle Ou, economists.

Housing starts, manufacturing and wholesale data will also be released.</p><p>Elsewhere, numbers on the strength of the Chinese and Japanese economies, wage data in the UK and the latest European Union forecasts will keep investors busy in coming days.</p><p>Click here for what happened in the past week and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy.</p><p>Asia</p><p>China publishes a slew of data Friday that’s expected to show the second quarter got off to a solid start, with growth in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment accelerating year on year.</p><p>But the housing slump will continue to pose risks, with property investment seen falling more than 9%.</p><p>Japan’s economy is estimated to have contracted in the first quarter on falling private consumption and business investment, as well as the first negative contribution from net exports in a year. Those numbers are due on Wednesday.</p><p>Growth will likely bounce back in the second quarter thanks to recovering auto output, according to Bloomberg Economics.</p><p>On Friday, Malaysia reports gross domestic product numbers.</p><p>Australian wage growth probably picked up a tad in the first quarter, with the unemployment rate forecast to have ticked higher to 3.9% in April.</p><p>Meanwhile, Australia’s Treasurer Jim Chalmers told Bloomberg that the budget will feature a bigger boost for the nation’s critical minerals industry, describing the lucrative market as a “golden opportunity.” He’s set to release his annual fiscal blueprint on Tuesday night.</p><p>Trade statistics are due in Indonesia and Singapore, and the central bank in the Philippines is expected to hold its benchmark rate at 6.5% on Thursday.</p><p>Europe, Middle East, Africa</p><p>The UK will take the spotlight with labor-market data that may encourage policymakers watching for waning inflation pressures.</p><p>Average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, probably rose an annual 5.9% in the first quarter, according to the median estimate of economists.</p><p>While still robust, the continuing downward shift would cheer Bank of England officials, two of whom voted on Thursday for an immediate reduction in borrowing costs against seven who favored no change.</p><p>In the wake of that decision, speeches by UK policymakers will draw attention. Among them, the BOE’s chief economist Huw Pill is scheduled to speak on Tuesday.</p><p>Over in the euro zone, the calendar features several European Central Bank officials. Governors from the Netherlands, Germany, France and Italy are among those set to speak. The ECB’s half-yearly financial stability review will arrive on Thursday.</p><p>Germany’s ZEW investor confidence number on Tuesday will be a highlight in a quieter week for data.

The country’s latest consumer-price and growth numbers are also due in the coming days.</p><p>Further east, Russia’s inflation is likely to have stayed close to 7.7%, based on the economy ministry’s weekly data.

<p>While his trading and quantitative analysis strategies have been heavily scrutinized, he has also shared several management and leadership lessons over the years. In 2010, he laid out five “<a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2020/01/22/my-guiding-principles/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2020/01/22/my-guiding-principles/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2020/01/22/my-guiding-principles/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">guiding principles</a>“:</p>



<p>1. “Do something new; don’t run with the pack. I am not such a fast runner. If I am one of <em>N</em> people all working on the same problem, there is very little chance I will win. If I can think of a new problem in a new area, that will give me a chance.”</p>



<p>2. “Surround yourself with the smartest people you can find. When you see such a person, do all you can to get them on board. That extends your reach, and terrific people are usually fun to work with.”</p>



<p>3. “Be guided by beauty. This is obviously true in doing mathematics or writing poetry, but it is also true in fashioning an organization that is running extremely well and accomplishing its mission with excellence.”</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>

<p>During a 2022 speech at an event organized by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTaQvnwLzM" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTaQvnwLzM" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTaQvnwLzM" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">Abel Prize for mathematics</a>, Simons echoed those five principles and also noted that RenTech hired statisticians, physicists, astronomers, and mathematicians in its early years, adding that “I like to say that you can teach a physicist finance, but you can’t teach a finance person physics.”</p>



<p>In fact, RenTech rarely hired to fill a need and instead sought top talent with the assumption they would find ways to improve its quant trading, according to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/how-did-jim-simonss-firm-make-100-billion-he-told-his-secrets-to-our-reporter-f7b335f9" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/how-did-jim-simonss-firm-make-100-billion-he-told-his-secrets-to-our-reporter-f7b335f9" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/how-did-jim-simonss-firm-make-100-billion-he-told-his-secrets-to-our-reporter-f7b335f9" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS"><em>Wall Street Journal</em>‘s Gregory Zuckerman</a>, who wrote a <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557104/the-man-who-solved-the-market-by-gregory-zuckerman/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557104/the-man-who-solved-the-market-by-gregory-zuckerman/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557104/the-man-who-solved-the-market-by-gregory-zuckerman/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">book about Simons</a>. But his ability to motivate all those brilliant minds also stood out. A former senior executive told Zuckerman that “It’s not his genius. It’s his ability to manage genius.”</p>



<p>Zuckerberg also said Simons maintained a flat organizational structure at RenTech that encouraged collaboration and transparency. That philosophy also extended to RenTech’s compensation, in which employees were paid based on its Medallion Fund’s results rather than focusing on individual achievements. </p>



<p>“By Wall Street standards, Jim wasn’t greedy,” another former executive told Zuckerman. “So senior guys were mostly very happy and didn’t fight with each other.”</p>



<p>Simons resigned as RenTech’s chief executive in 2010 and retired as chairman in 2021, while turning more attention to his philanthropy.</p>

                                        A cyberattack on the Ascension health system operating in 19 states across the US forced some of its 140 hospitals to divert ambulances, caused patients to postpone medical tests, and blocked online access to patient records. An Ascension spokesperson said it detected "unusual activity" Wednesday on its computer network systems. Officials refused to say whether the nonprofit Catholic health system, based in St. Louis, was the victim of a ransomware attack or whether it had paid a ransom, and it didn't immediately respond to an email seeking updates. But the attack had the hallmarks of ransomware, and Ascension said it had called in Mandiant, the Google cybersecurity unit that's a leading responder to such attacks, per the <a href="https://www.newser.com/article/728ab2a0e5afaf7c344e46a5ce5ca42c/a-cyberattack-forces-a-big-us-health-system-to-divert-ambulances-and-take-records-offline.html">AP</a>.

<p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/white-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="White House">White House</a> is set to announce new <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="China">China</a> tariffs as soon as next week, with a levy on <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/electric-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="White House">electric vehicles</a> and other clean <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="White House">energy</a> goods.</p>
<p>The full announcement is expected on Tuesday and will target solar goods, critical minerals, and batteries from China, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/biden-to-quadruple-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-203127bf?mod=hp_lead_pos1">reporting</a> from the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. The Biden administration has invested in these industries domestically. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Chinese electric vehicles currently face a 25% tariff, and the administration is expected to raise that as much as 100% in order to make it more expensive to buy the product from China. The new tariffs are not expected to include traditional gasoline-powered cars that are made in China.</p>
<p>The new tariffs are also expected to include new levies on semiconductors, which Biden has worked to boost domestically. Lawmakers <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/technology/2979226/watch-biden-remarks-chips-and-science-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">passed</a> the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act in 2022, which includes grants and other incentives for chip makers.</p>
<p>The tariff update comes after lawmakers on Capitol Hill have called for hikes on Chinese vehicle tariffs. Sen. Sherrod Brown (R-OH), the Banking Committee chairman, has called on the Biden administration to ban Chinese electric vehicles completely due to privacy concerns about people’s data. </p>
<p id="dsk-banner-ad-f" tpd-injected="true" tpd-injected-flag="generic" tpd-found="true"></p><p>The Biden administration has considered adjusting the Trump-era tariffs, with some advisers calling for higher levies while Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has made the case to lower duties on consumer goods. Yellen is expected to head to the G7 Finance Ministers meeting in Italy later this month, where the U.S. hopes to influence other countries to join the tariff fight, to ratchet up pressure on China, according to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-plans-raise-tariffs-electric-vehicles-china-rcna151748" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">reporting </a>from NBC News.</p>
<p>The White House has kept all the existing tariffs from former President Donald Trump in place, who imposed some $300 billion in tariffs at U.S. ports of entry. Trump has said he would consider a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports if he is elected in November. In March, Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on cars made in <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/Mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Mexico</a> by Chinese companies. </p>
<p>In announcing the new round of tariffs, Biden is looking to demonstrate his push to safeguard manufacturing in the U.S. ahead of the November election. In a speech to United Steelworkers union members in Pittsburgh last month, Biden said he wanted to raise tariffs on imports of Chinese aluminum and steel, pointing out that thousands of steelworkers in the area lost their jobs between 2000 and 2010.</p>
<p>“I promise you that I’m not going to let that happen again,” he said.</p>
<p id="dsk-box-ad-d" tpd-injected="true" tpd-injected-flag="generic" tpd-found="true"></p><p>Biden has attempted to contrast his tariffs as “strategic and targeted” while claiming Trump’s tariffs have raised costs for U.S. consumers. Both candidates have been attempting to appeal to voters across manufacturing-heavy swing states in the Midwest.</p>
<p>The trade moves are weighing on U.S.-China relations. The two superpowers have spent months trying to stabilize diplomatic relations after years of acrimony over Taiwan, Russia’s invasion of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/Ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Ukraine</a>, and access to advanced technology. China has invested in clean-energy production in an effort to strengthen its economy.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry slammed the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/Biden-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Biden administration</a>’s planned tariffs on Friday, saying existing tariffs have disrupted trade.</p>
<p id="dsk-banner-ad-g" tpd-injected="true" tpd-injected-flag="generic" tpd-found="true"></p><p>“China will take all necessary measures to defend its rights and interest,” the spokesman said.</p>

                        <p>PHOENIX — Arizona’s attorney general is launching an investigation after a health care network with four hospitals in the state filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Dallas-based Steward Health Care <a href="https://www.steward.org/newsroom/2024-05-06/steward-health-care-finalizing-financing-deal-medical" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced Monday</a> it was filing for <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/Steward/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> in Texas, saying it didn’t expect any interruptions to its day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>At a court hearing the next day, the physician-owned network said it is planning to sell all 31 of its U.S. hospitals by the end of the summer to address $9 billion in total liabilities, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/bankrupt-steward-health-puts-its-hospitals-up-sale-discloses-9-bln-debt-2024-05-07/#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2C%20May%207%20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to Reuters</a>.</p><p></p>
<p>Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said Friday she is considering intervening in the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>

<p>“Arizonans deserve to know more about the circumstances that led to Steward’s bankruptcy filing. I am deeply concerned about the potential impact this could have on Arizona patients and medical providers,” Mayes <a href="https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-mayes-announces-investigation-steward-health-cares-bankruptcy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said in a press release</a>.</p>
<h2>What Arizona hospitals are part of Steward Health Care network?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.steward.org/network/our-hospitals#view-state-az" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steward operates</a> three metro Phoenix hospitals — Mountain Vista Medical Center in Mesa, St. Luke’s Behavioral Health Center in Phoenix and Tempe St. Luke’s Hospital — and Florence Hospital in Pinal County. They are set to be auctioned off June 28, along with Steward’s hospitals in Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.</p>
<p>“No matter who ultimately ends up owning and operating these facilities, I am committed to ensuring that no Arizonan is harmed by this bankruptcy, and I will fight to ensure that these hospitals remain open at all times to care for patients without any degradation of service,” Mayes said.</p>

And that's carried on in 2024.</p><p>In a weekly note to clients, Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert examined how stocks are reacting to hotter-than-expected economic data. Investors started the year cheering the data as they priced in a "soft landing" for the US economy, where inflation would return to the Fed's 2% target without an economic downturn. At that time, the S&amp;P 500 moved higher with Citi's Economic Surprise Index, which gauges whether data is coming in better than consensus expectations.</p><p>But after recent hot inflation data, markets have been more skittish as investors have <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-increasingly-expect-no-landing-for-us-economy-123944030.html" data-ylk='slk:increasingly priced in "no landing,";cpos:16;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;' class="link  yahoo-link" data-rapid_p="35" data-v9y="0">increasingly priced in "no landing,"</a> where inflation doesn't come down to the Fed's target but the economy keeps growing.</p><p>This had led to the market perceiving good economic news to be bad news for inflation, and therefore bad for the market's rate cut hopes. Subsequently, the correlation between the S&amp;P 500 and economic surprise has headed toward negative territory.</p><p>"This suggests hot macro data has increasingly threatened the soft landing narrative that may be needed to push markets higher from these elevated valuation levels," Chronert wrote.</p><p>If inflation data returns to showing further cooling, the question is whether good economic growth news will be once again welcome by the market.</p><h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="weekly-calendar">Weekly calendar</h2><h3 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="monday"><strong>Monday</strong></h3><p><strong>Economic data:</strong> New York Fed one-year inflation expectations, April (3% previously)</p><p><strong>Earnings: </strong>BuzzFeed (<a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BZFD" data-ylk="slk:BZFD;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="36" data-v9y="0">BZFD</a>), Petrobras (<a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PBR" data-ylk="slk:PBR;cpos:18;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="37" data-v9y="0">PBR</a>), Stone (<a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/STNE" data-ylk="slk:STNE;cpos:19;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="38" data-v9y="0">STNE</a>), Tencent Music Entertainment (<a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TME" data-ylk="slk:TME;cpos:20;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="39" data-v9y="0">TME</a>)</p><h3 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="tuesday"><strong>Tuesday</strong></h3><p><strong>Economic data:</strong> NFIB Small Business Optimism, April (88.2 expected, 88.5 previously);

    <p>Here are five key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visits to sit-down restaurants in the US have declined by nearly 5% in 2023 compared to the previous year, according to Placer, a location analytics firm.</li>
<li>The decline in restaurant visits is attributed to inflation, which is weakening the purchasing power of Americans and reducing their willingness to eat out.</li>
<li>Several major metropolitan areas, including New York City, are experiencing a surge in restaurant closures. Over 40 bars and restaurants closed in New York City from December 2023 to January 2024.</li>
<li>Many restaurants are struggling to remain profitable due to the lingering effects of the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020, which disrupted the industry and led to many restaurants taking out deferred loans.</li>
<li>Some restaurants are being forced to fold due to financial difficulties, including those that took out 30-month deferred loans during the COVID lockdowns and are now struggling to pay them back.</li>

It is noteworthy that the federal government has not formally disclosed the date on when the public will be able to receive funds for federal assistance in another round.

Several families of four might receive $5,600 in direct benefits; $1,400 would go to people making less than $75,000, another $1,400 to couples making less than $150,000, and an additional $1,400 to dependents.</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>$1,400 Stimulus Checks 2024 Eligibility Requirements</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>People have to be US citizens or resident aliens for tax purposes, and they cannot be claimed as dependents by another US taxpayer.</li>
<li>Their maximum gross income should not be more than $75,000 for single people and $150,000 for married couples.</li>
<li>Scholars who are not residents of America and students who are in their first 5 years of study here are not eligible for stimulus payments.</li>
<li>Eligibility is restricted to individual taxpayers with an AGI income of more than $99000, as well as minors over 16 and college students under 24.</li>
<li>Even with earnings up to $112,500 and $1,400 for each dependent, the individuals are still entitled for $1,400. At a income of $150,000 or more, stimulus checks for those Americans will end completely.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When Will You Receive $1400 Stimulus Payments?</strong></h3>
<p>Most previous stimulus payment recipients received their funds directly into the bank linked to their IRS registration. If you were not registered for direct deposit with the IRS, the processing and delivery of your <strong>$1400 Stimulus Payment 2024</strong> as a check or debit card might take a little longer. The couples and individuals who meet the requirements will get the <strong>$1400 Stimulus Check Payment 2024</strong> immediately. The IRS website has a daily updated feature called “Get My Payment,” that you can use to see if your payment has been scheduled and to monitor its status. If so, you will be able to view the <strong>$1400 Stimulus Checks 2024 Payment Date</strong> and other updates.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>$1400 Stimulus Checks 2024 Latest Update</strong></h3>
<p>Several senators pushed for a stimulus check in 2024 in an attempt to help Americans who were struggling to recover from corona virus and its financial impacts but the <strong>$1400 Stimulus Checks 2024 </strong>never came to pass. The economy and employment had rebounded when the country started to reopen, so it didn’t seem necessary for another government stimulus check. Still, a number of governments took many action and provided their citizens with a fourth stimulus payment. A stimulus check is intended to support people experiencing financial hardship and encourage consumer spending. Thus, as of right now, I believe that in 2024 there won’t be a stimulus check from IRS.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>$1400 Stimulus Checks Fact Check</strong></h3>
<p>Government stimulus checks were already shared to citizens during the corona virus pandemic and afterwards. However, as this program is only available in emergency situations, the government is no longer running it. However, representatives hold constant meetings to talk about the rising cost of living and other issues. It was made clear by a recent fact check on <strong>IRS $1400 Stimulus Checks 2024 Payment</strong> that the US government has not officially announced any additional stimulus payments or other forms of assistance. The US Congress gave its approval for the prior stimulus payments, that were sent out in 2020 and 2021.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The TV industry's upfronts, a decades-old tradition, is back in person this year after being disrupted by the pandemic. The events will feature eight live presentations, including those from Netflix and Amazon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The upfronts are a major opportunity for TV networks to showcase their content and attract advertisers. This year, major tech companies like YouTube will also be participating, adding to the excitement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite the increased energy and excitement around the upfronts, some companies have opted to scale back their events, citing doubts about the return on investment. Paramount Global and The CW are two examples of networks that have chosen to go with smaller-scale events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The stakes are high, with advertisers expected to spend around $18.8 billion during the upfronts, which is 17% of their total digital video spend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For some companies, traditional live events like the upfronts remain essential. For example, Warner Bros. Discovery's Chief U.S. Advertising Sales Officer, Jon Steinlauf, believes that the energy and momentum of such events are essential for winning over decision-makers.</p>

As the ad business crawls toward a recovery, there are more in-person presentations – eight, up from six a year ago, filling the Monday-to-Wednesday schedule – including the debuts of <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/netflix/" id="auto-tag_netflix" data-tag="netflix">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/amazon/" id="auto-tag_amazon" data-tag="amazon">Amazon</a>.

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	After the Zoom doom loop of Covid, this year’s extravaganzas are sure to feel particularly festive. And the entry of major tech companies, including <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/youtube/" id="auto-tag_youtube" data-tag="youtube">YouTube</a>, whose Brandcast will cap off the week, will add considerable buzz. But is all of the exuberance a little irrational given the significant financial pressures weighing on the industry? Two players, Paramount Global and The CW, have opted to ditch large public events in favor of smaller-scale contact with advertisers, citing their doubts about the return on investing in a single show.

</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The stakes are considerable, with research firm eMarketer recently estimating that advertisers will spend about $18.8 billion in the upfront, one-third of their total TV outlay and 17% of what they will put toward digital video. Live events, particularly sports, remain vital and streaming allows for more precise targeting and marrying brands to the right shows.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	For the companies carrying on with the traditional extravaganzas, there is no substitute.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“It’s just energy and momentum and bigness,” Jon Steinlauf, Chief U.S. <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/advertising/" id="auto-tag_advertising" data-tag="advertising">Advertising</a> Sales Officer for Warner Bros. Discovery, told Deadline in an interview. “The bigness really matters when you have decision-makers coming in.” By Steinlauf’s estimate, about 2,000 attendees at WBD’s event next Wednesday at the Theater at Madison Square Garden will be visiting New York from elsewhere.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“If you’re going to have a 72-hour window when you’ll have 1,000 clients in New York City who are not easily accessed any other way, you can tell them your company story,” he said. Beyond traditional ad buyers, he noted, the audience increasingly has representation from Wall Street, distribution and tech companies.

	</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“What I love about the week is that it allows us to really stand out,” said Rita Ferro, Disney’s President of Global Advertising. “Everybody shows up side by side. It allows almost an equal footing, so that brands can decide where they want to be.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Todd Reinhart, partner and co-founder at DeadLizard, a creative agency whose clients include Disney, said his team has developed a saying based on this year’s combination of streaming and technology. “It’s in with the old and in with the new,” he said. Disney, adds co-founder Bill Skrief, every year looks to make its upfront “10% to 15% bigger” than the year before. “It’s all about immersion.” At the cruise-ship-sized North Javits venue, he said, “you can’t see the entire stage and all those monitors in your field of view. It breaks out of your peripheral.” DeadLizard has helped implement a number of complementary screens and visual elements, including “ribbon” monitors over the audience’s head. The main objective, he added, is “scale and it’s just showing, you know, ‘We’re Disney and it’s all the content and we can’t have enough screens to show all this stuff.'”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Josh Feldman ,CMO, Advertising &amp; Partnerships at NBCUniversal, said the company’s commitment to Radio City (seating capacity: 6,000) is rooted in the same ambition. With the Olympics, <em>Saturday Night Live</em>‘s 50th anniversary season, news programming in an election year and a raft of scripted and unscripted shows, “it really helps to have that kind of environment to use as a showcase. We want to remind our partners about the full portfolio, and to do it in an engaging and immersive way.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Streaming, in years gone by, was largely confined to the NewFronts, an offshoot held two weeks prior to the main upfront week. This year’s NewFronts proved to be more muted, as Amazon decamped for mid-May and presenters from past years like Tubi and Peacock also left to join their corporate parents.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The business backdrop to the upfronts this year is checkered. Some companies have reported progress in the first quarter of 2024, while others posted declines as macro factors like high interest rates and inflation continued to squeeze spending. On Fox’s quarterly call with Wall Street analysts last week, CEO Lachlan Murdoch said advertising trends at the company “are clearly moving in the right direction, both in the scatter market and in early upfront discussions.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Given the pressure to make advertisers feel like their time is well-spent shuttling around town, companies have collectively streamlined the concept of an upfront. When the focus was on scheduling blocks or vast network portfolios each wanting time in the spotlight, presentations routinely ran to multiple hours. Now, 90 minutes is generally the outer limit, with some companies aiming for a little more than an hour. That puts added pressure on each transition, stage moment, lighting cue and sizzle reel. “Every single second needs to do twice as much work as it used to before,” DeadLizard’s Reinhart said.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Hispanic programmer TelevisaUnivision is shooting for about 30 minutes for its main presentation from ad sales chief Donna Speciale. The company is turning HK Hall into what it calls “Casa Cultura,” opening its doors in the morning and, after Speciale’s pitch, inviting advertisers to linger through an evening performance by singer and actress Becky G. NBCUniversal is taking a similar tack with its Hispanic media division, Telemundo, with the company hosting a reception at The Shed on Monday evening as a complement to the NBCU upfront. <em>SNL</em> featured player Marcello Hernandez and Colombian singer Manuel Turizo are the night’s entertainment.

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Presenting companies are increasingly looking to pack more razzle-dazzle into leaner running times. “We’re calling this more of the ‘IP upfront,'” WBD’s Steinlauf said. The Warner Bros. film slate, which has become a major draw on Max, will get more prominent billing than ever, he said. “We want the advertisers for the first time to hear more about what they can do” to connect with theatrical movies and HBO series, he added. (Max’s growing ad tier has recently begun allowing pre-roll ads with HBO shows, a first for the half-century-old programmer.)</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Disney last year managed to assemble more talent than others, largely due to ESPN, with Serena Williams and Pat McAfee making headlines with their appearances. With no strike limitations this year, Ferro said, “In terms of star power, this is the largest ever. It kicks off with a bang and just keeps going from there.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Robyn Henry, a VP at Production Glue, a vendor working with Warner Bros. Discovery, noted that the show can change up to the moment it starts and even potentially during the show, based on talent availability. “The process is designed to accommodate last-minute changes, so the script can change a lot,” she said, with the flurry reaching a crescendo at the end of weeks of rehearsal.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Andrew Schulman, a former TV exec whose Damn Good! Studio works with DeadLizard, said all of the effort will be worth it for those with the best programming. “Do they remember what they ate there? No. Do they remember what they saw there? Yeah. Is that the priority? One thousand percent,” he said. “Do you remember the show? If that doesn’t happen, they don’t connect those dots, then it doesn’t matter how much experience you offer and how much storytelling you think you made.” In a nod to monarchies through the centuries, he added, “The upfront is dead – long live the upfront.”</p>

<li>Activists held a press conference to express their opposition to the expansion of Tesla's electric car factory in Grünheide, Germany, which they claim will have negative environmental and social impacts.</li>
<li>At least 1,000 protesters participated in the protests, which were largely peaceful, with only minor clashes between protesters and police.</li>
<li>The protesters, including the Disrupt Tesla group, claim that the expansion of the factory is a betrayal of local citizens' interests and will have devastating environmental and social consequences.</li>
<li>The protesters are not just targeting Tesla, but also other car manufacturers, saying that the industry as a whole is responsible for polluting and exploiting natural resources.</li>
<li>Residents in Grünheide, where the factory is located, are also opposed to the expansion and feel that the company and the state government are not listening to their concerns about the impacts of the factory.</li>

<p>At least 1,000 activists participated in the protests, according to police.</p>

<p>Their comments came as authorities readied for a repeat of <a class="internal-link" href="/en/protesters-attempt-to-storm-teslas-factory-near-berlin/a-69046103">violent clashes between police and demonstrators the previous day</a>.<br>

<p>A police spokesperson said that the march on Saturday largely proceeded peacefully.</p>

<p>Police said that there had been minor clashes with activists, but did not initially provide any information on injuries or arrests.</p>

<h2>What did the protesters say?</h2>

<p>The Disrupt Tesla group said the political and environmental problem went beyond the <a class="internal-link" href="/en/elon-musk/t-63587027">Elon Musk</a>-owned carmaker and extended to other auto manufacturers.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter if it's Tesla, VW or Mercedes — car companies and their political supporters are responsible for selling out our lifeblood," said Disrupt Tesla group spokeswoman Lucia Mende, ahead of a planned demonstration.</p>

<p>"We must prevent this and we will prevent it," she added.</p>

<p>Some residents in Grünheide, where <a class="internal-link" href="/en/germany-elon-musk-visits-tesla-factory-after-power-sabotage/a-68511988">billionaire Musk</a> has built his only European Tesla factory, say both the company and the Brandenburg state government have not paid attention to citizens' interests in pressing ahead with the expansion.</p>

<p>"They are going through with it, they are not listening to the sensitivities of the local people," said spokesman Steffen Schorcht, a spokesman for a citizens' initiative. "It only serves the interests of Tesla."</p><div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"><h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Taking on Tesla — Fight for the Forest" class="headline"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"><g fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"></path></g></svg>Taking on Tesla — Fight for the Forest</h2><div class="render-container"><div class="sc-djLfiL bWQlcR sc-gSYeb fALeZZ"><div class="bg-poster"><video id="video-68996009" dir="ltr" controls="" playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-duration="12:36" data-play-btn-title="Play video" class="dw-player video-js vjs-fluid"><source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/repoe/repoe20240504_gesamtHD_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"><track src="https://www.dw.com/media/subtitles/69045611" srclang="en" label="ENGLISH"><p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p></track></source></video></div></div></div></div>

<p>"If you're fighting and keep hitting a wall and don't know what else to do, then sometimes the only thing left is civil disobedience."</p>

<h2>Police prepared for further flare-ups</h2>

<p>Police said they were braced for more trouble after multiple people were arrested after activists attempted to break into the factory on Friday evening.  </p>

<p>Regional broadcaster RBB said several hundred people ran toward the Tesla facility, with many wearing masks and dressed in black.</p>

<p>Hundreds of demonstrators had gathered near the site on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>"We are aware," said a police spokesman adding that the situation had been calm in the night and the morning.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Activists set up a protest camp, including tree houses, near the factory in late February and have been there ever since. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tesla was forced to suspend production in March after an <a class="internal-link" href="/en/germany-tesla-plant-targeted-in-deliberate-arson-police/a-68455762">arson attack on an electricity pylon</a> compromised the factory's power supply.

<p>Opponents of the expansion, which would include a freight depot and requires forest to be cleared, say their concerns are chiefly environmental.</p>

<p>They criticize the production of electric cars in general and have cited fears about the possible pollution of local drinking water.</p>

<p>Activists also cite environmental destruction in countries like Argentina or <a class="internal-link" href="/en/russia-china-ahead-in-race-for-bolivias-lithium/a-67843534">Bolivia where the mineral lithium, needed for electric car batteries, is mined</a>.</p>

<li><strong>Solar storms caused GPS disruptions</strong>: A series of solar storms have been disrupting GPS signals in the United States, causing issues for farmers in the Midwest.</li>
<li><strong>Farmers impacted by GPS outages</strong>: The GPS disruptions have crippled some farmers' operations, particularly those using Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) systems for centimeter-level positional accuracy in their tractors.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on farming operations</strong>: The outages have caused drastic shifts in the field and changes in heading for farmers who continued planting during the outages, leading to potential issues with automated guidance systems.</li>

Tractors from John Deere and other brands use RTK for “centimeter-level positional accuracy” when carrying out farming work like crop-planting or fertilizing, <em>404 Media </em>writes. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">The “extremely compromised” systems caused “drastic shifts in the field and even some heading changes” for those who continued planting during the outages, <a href="https://landmarkimp.com/news/news/blog/geomagnetic-storm-affecting-gps-signals--may-2024/">according to a warning</a> from Kansas and Nebraska John Deere dealer Landmark Implement over the weekend. Landmark said that planted rows won’t be where AutoPath, a tractor guidance system, thinks they are later when it’s time to tend to them, and that it could be difficult or impossible to use it in fields that were planted while GPS systems were compromised.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">While the solar storms, which are some of the worst to have hit the Earth in over two decades according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), are expected to subside soon, it comes at a critical time for corn crops. Willie Cade of right-to-repair advocate group Repair.org told <em>404 Media</em> that May 15th “is a critical date to get corn planted,” calling it “huge” if corn farmers can’t get their crops planted by then.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Organic farmer Tom Schwarz, who was also quoted in the story, said the solar storms halted their operations, and that now the weather forecast threatens to put off planting even further. His farm and others like it use RTK systems to plant crops right up to the edge of the lanes tractors use to drive between them, and if GPS was inaccurate while planting happens, they risk destroying crops later, because human drivers “can’t steer fast enough or well enough” to keep tractors between the rows.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">On a broad scale, the farming that’s done today is heavily reliant on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22533735/john-deere-cto-hindman-decoder-interview-right-to-repair-tractors">high-tech, often heavily automated tractors</a> and other equipment. When they fail, farmers often have no recourse because the entire life cycle of their crops is wrapped up in the tech. That reliance is part of why there’s so much momentum <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/27/23700448/colorado-right-to-repair-law-farmers-farming-equipment">behind right-to-repair laws</a> now, as farmers want to be able to fix their tractors when they break, rather than be beholden to manufacturers for it.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Geomagnetic storms like the ones affecting farmers this weekend are created when plasma and magnetized particles are flung out of the sun in what’s called coronal mass ejections. The NOAA <a href="https://spaceweather.sansa.org.za/space-weather-information/definitions/noaa-scales">rates them on an increasingly severe scale</a> from G1 to G5. The storm that’s been hitting the Earth the last couple of days <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g5-conditions-reached-yet-again">has reached G5</a>. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Such powerful storms can wreak havoc on our planet, as in March 1989 when a powerful storm <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DmEqE-g128kk&amp;xcust=___vg__p_23918820__t_w__d_D" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener">knocked out power for millions in a Canadian province</a> for several hours. Weaker storms can present issues as well, like when a 2022 storm <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22924561/spacex-starlink-satellites-geomagnetic-storm">knocked out dozens of Starlink satellites</a>. Starlink has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/starlink-experiencing-degraded-service-musk-says-satellites-under-pressure-2024-05-11/">also been somewhat impacted</a> this weekend. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">The NOAA says “severe to extreme” solar storms of G4 or higher <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/severe-extreme-geomagnetic-storming-possible-again-later-today">could occur again today</a>. So far, the storms haven’t led to widespread reports of solar storm-related disruptions, though Starlink has experienced some “degraded performance,” as <em>Reuters </em>writes, while some on Reddit reported issues <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1cp7v6a/solar_storm_caused_loss_on_glideslope_on_lpv/">with flight systems</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1cp4uqo/outages_due_to_g5_solar_storm/l3igwn8/">HAM radio transmissions</a>.</p></div></div>
