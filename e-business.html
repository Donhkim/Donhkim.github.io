<p>Ben Reitzes, a managing director and head of technology research at Melius Research, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/26/expect-nvidia-to-deliver-more-cash-to-shareholders-says-melius-ben-reitzes.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/26/expect-nvidia-to-deliver-more-cash-to-shareholders-says-melius-ben-reitzes.html" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/26/expect-nvidia-to-deliver-more-cash-to-shareholders-says-melius-ben-reitzes.html" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">told CNBC on Wednesday</a> that Jensen Huang’s Nvidia has mastered a “full stack” approach with its hardware and software, giving it a key advantage in AI.</p>



<p>“What they did is they built a computing language and an ecosystem that allows you to monetize AI, and obviously they’re killing it,” he said. </p>



<p>Reitzes has a price target of $160 on Nvidia stock, implying a 30% gain from Friday’s closing price. Despite an <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/25/nvidia-jensen-huang-shares-market-cap-value-shareholder-meeting/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/25/nvidia-jensen-huang-shares-market-cap-value-shareholder-meeting/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/06/25/nvidia-jensen-huang-shares-market-cap-value-shareholder-meeting/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">ongoing selloff</a> that began earlier this month, shares have soared 150% so far this year after more than tripling in 2023. Among the Magnificent 7 stocks that he covers, Nvidia has the most upside ahead, he added.</p>



<p>Another big advantage Nvidia has over rivals is its annual cadence of innovating new products, Reitzes said. That means developers and customers will know where Nvidia is headed and can a budget for upgrades accordingly. </p><p></p>



<p>“And they’re running 150 miles an hour while everyone else is running 100. It’s going to be hard to catch these guys,” he said.</p>



<p>Given Nvidia’s edge in the booming AI space, Melius Research projects the company will generate $270 billion in cash over the next three years, potentially setting the stage for huge shareholder returns. </p>



<p>Management may not be eager to tout the possibility of stock buybacks as those are often associated with older companies, Reitzes said. But in his view, it’s obvious.</p>



<p>“No one’s talking about it, and when you do the model we do, it’s a cash gusher,” he said. “And there’s nothing they can do. This government’s not going to let them buy anything big. They can’t invest that much in R&amp;D. It’s just not possible. So we gotta get it as shareholders.” </p>



<p>To be sure, Nvidia has been returning capital to shareholders. In August, it announced a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidias-frankfurt-shares-surge-stellar-results-seen-keeping-ai-rally-alive-2023-08-24/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidias-frankfurt-shares-surge-stellar-results-seen-keeping-ai-rally-alive-2023-08-24/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidias-frankfurt-shares-surge-stellar-results-seen-keeping-ai-rally-alive-2023-08-24/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">$25 billion repurchase program</a>. And last month, Nvidia boosted its quarterly cash dividend by 150% from $0.04 per share to $0.10, equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis.</p><p></p>



<p>Nvidia declined to comment about the possibility of more stock buybacks.</p>



<p>For his part, Reitzes was quick to point out that any future buybacks wouldn’t imply that Nvidia has stopped growing. “It’s not an insult to buy back stocks if you have nothing else to do.”</p>



<p>Nvidia’s recent financials show that its ability to generate cash is accelerating. In the <a href="https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2024/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2024/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2024/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">fiscal year</a> that ended in January, Nvidia’s net cash provided by operating activities soared to $28.1 billion from $5.6 billion in the prior year.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>And in the <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2025" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2025" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2025" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">first quarter</a> that ended in April, net cash provided by operating activities was $15.3 billion—already more than half of last year’s total.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Huang told investors this past week that <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/nvidia-jensen-huang-micron-ai-training-semiconductor-chips-high-bandwidth-memory/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/nvidia-jensen-huang-micron-ai-training-semiconductor-chips-high-bandwidth-memory/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/06/28/nvidia-jensen-huang-micron-ai-training-semiconductor-chips-high-bandwidth-memory/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Nvidia will remain the gold standard</a> for AI training chips amid concerns that rivals could cut into his market share.</p><p></p>



<p>The rollout of Nvidia’s <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/03/19/nvidia-new-blackwell-chip-ai-carbon-footprint-problem/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/03/19/nvidia-new-blackwell-chip-ai-carbon-footprint-problem/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Blackwell</a> system later this year will only cement that lead, he said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. </p>



<p>“The Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history and even in the entire computer history,” Huang said.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the Fortune Next to Lead newsletter to get weekly strategies on how to make it to the corner office. </p><a href="https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p>.</p></div></div>

<ul>
<li><em>21Shares took VanEck’s lead in the pursuit of a Spot Solana ETF</em></li>
<li><em>A surge in Solana inflows can be expected IF the applications go through</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://ambcrypto.com/category/solana-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Solana [SOL]</a>‘s market performance over the last few years has attracted the attention of many Wall Street institutions recently. Hence, it is not surprising that some of them are now very keen on the idea of a spot Solana ETF.</p>
<h2>21Shares moves in</h2>
<p>In a move to capitalize on the growing interest in SOL, Swiss asset management firm 21Shares has filed an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2028834/000121390024057001/ea0208625-s1_21shares.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">application</a> to list a Solana ETF in the United States. This filing closely follows a similar application submitted by its competitor – VanEck.</p>
<p>21Shares’ application hinges on the legal classification of the altcoin. The filing presumes that Solana is not considered a security under U.S law. This distinction is important because Security ETFs face stricter regulations, compared to standard ETFs.</p>
<p>If the SEC classifies it as a security, 21Shares might withdraw its application altogether. This potential withdrawal would stem from the additional registration requirements that come with security ETFs, which 21Shares may be unwilling to meet.</p>
<h2>How will SOL be affected?</h2>
<p>A potential spot Solana ETF is expected to boost the price of Solana (SOL), similar to how Bitcoin’s price surged after its spot ETF approval.</p>
<p>In fact, a recent <a href="https://www.gsr.io/reports/is-solana-eft-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">analysis</a> by GSR Markets actually used Bitcoin’s 2.3x price hike as a jumping-off point. It’s worth pointing out though that they acknowledged Solana ETFs likely won’t attract the same level of investment. To account for this, GSR instead explored three scenarios based on potential investment inflows, relative to Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>In the Bear Case, they assumed an increase of 2% in SOL’s inflows. This assumed a low level of interest in Solana ETFs, with only 2% of the inflows compared to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Next is the Base Case, which would result in 5% of the inflows compared to Bitcoin. This would be a more moderate scenario based on actual investment activity in Solana products from 2021 to 2023, excluding 2024 to avoid the influence of Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>In the most bullish and optimistic scenario, GSR took into account SOL’s higher relative inflows in 2022 and 2023. It estimated that the altcoin could attract 14% of the inflows, compared to Bitcoin on average.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The author believes that the outcome of the presidential election does not affect the stock market, citing that stocks rose on a favorable inflation report and did not react significantly to the debate performance of President Biden.</li>
<li>The article mentions that the odds of another Democrat replacing President Biden jumped on PredictIt, an election prediction market, following the debate.</li>
<li>The author acknowledges that some people, including Democrats, may be concerned about President Biden's performance in the debate, but as an investor, they are trying to remain indifferent to the outcome of the election.</li>
<li>The article references a previous article published by The New York Times about why the stock market doesn't care who wins an election, citing the idea that investors prioritize economic fundamentals over political developments.</li>
<li>The author questions the importance of the outcome of the presidential election, suggesting that as a citizen and voter, they care about the question of who will win the election, but as an investor, they are trying to remain unaffected by the outcome.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Nike's stock plunges</strong>: Nike's stock price dropped 20% on Friday, wiping out $28.41 billion from the company's market valuation, due to a forecast of a surprise drop in annual sales.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns about market share losses</strong>: The forecast has amplified investor concerns about Nike's efforts to stem market share losses to upstart brands such as On, Hoka, and others. Leather products, once a source of strength for Nike, are now a weakness in the company's sales.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-cutting measures</strong>: To curb a worsening sales decline, Nike has cut back on oversupplied brands including Air Force 1, as part of a $2 billion cost-cutting plan launched late last year.</li>
<li><strong>Rivalry among sportswear brands</strong>: The news has had an impact on rival sportswear brands, with shares of British retailer JD Sports, German brand Puma, and Adidas affected. While Adidas' shares were up marginally, JD Sports and Puma both suffered losses.</li>
<li><strong>Market share decline</strong>: Nike's US market share in the sports footwear category has declined from 35.37% in 2022 to 34.97% in 2023, while other sporting goods brands such as Hoka, Asics, New Balance, and On have gained market share, accounting for 35% of the global market share in 2023.</li>

<p>It was the worst day ever for the stock, which slumped 20 percent on Friday, with the losses wiping out $28.41bn from the company’s market valuation.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 4 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 4 of 4</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>On Thursday, the company had projected a mid-single-digit percentage fall in fiscal 2025 revenue, compared with analysts’ estimates of a near 1 percent rise.</p>
<p>“Nike is at a point where they want to put out the most conservative guidance they can, such that they’re setting the bar low for themselves and hopefully it’s a bar they can beat,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.</p>
<p>Its forecast dragged shares of rivals and sportswear retailers across Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States on Friday.</p>
<p>British sportswear retailer JD Sports lost 5.4 percent at Friday’s close, while Germany’s Puma fell 1 percent. Adidas’s shares were up marginally.</p>
<p>“Nike’s been under pressure for a couple of years now. I certainly think they have an opportunity now that the valuation’s been reset extremely low to start getting some sponsorship, but it’s just not going to happen today or this week,” Hogan added.</p>
<p>The company’s US market share in the sports footwear category fell to 34.97 percent in 2023 from 35.37 percent in 2022, and 35.4 percent in 2021, according to GlobalData.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other sporting goods brands such as Hoka, Asics, New Balance and On accounted for 35 percent of the global market share in 2023 compared with the 20 percent held over the 2013-2020 period, according to a June RBC research report.</p>

<p>The sportswear giant is also tweaking its product lineup to roll out new $100-and-under sneakers in countries around the world to appeal to price-conscious consumers.</p>
<p>It will also roll out this year an Air Max version and Pegasus 41 with a full-length foam midsole made from ReactX to boost sustainability.</p>
<p>“This is still Nike, and we expect their size and scale to prove a long-term competitive advantage, but the burden of proof [is] on management execution at this point,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel.</p>
<h2 id="management-shakeout">Management shakeout?</h2>
<p>The underperformance over the past year has led to some Wall Street analysts raising the possibility of a management shake-up ahead of the company’s investor day this fall.</p>
<p>“In retail, if you have two bad quarters, you’re usually out the door,” said Jessica Ramirez, senior analyst at Jane Hali &amp; Associates.</p>
<p>“I think it [a leadership change] is very much needed.”</p>
<p>CEO John Donahoe is in his fourth year of a five-year commitment as Nike’s top boss. The former eBay CEO, who succeeded Mark Parker, was hired to focus on strengthening the company’s digital channel sales.</p>
<p>“I have seen Nike’s plans for the future, and wholeheartedly believe in them. I am optimistic in Nike’s future, and John Donahoe has my unwavering confidence and full support,” Phil Knight, co-founder and chairman emeritus, said in a statement.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>

<li><strong>John Deere announced layoffs</strong>: The company is laying off around 610 production staff at plants in Illinois and Iowa, with the layoffs taking effect on August 30.</li>
<li><strong>Reason for layoffs</strong>: The layoffs are due to reduced demand for John Deere's products from those factories, according to the company's press release.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>A survey conducted by McKinsey &amp; Co. found that nearly half of electric car owners in the US are "very likely" to switch to a gasoline-powered vehicle when it comes time to replace their current vehicle.</li>
<li>The top reason for this is the difficulty in finding places to recharge, with 35% of respondents citing this as a major issue.</li>
<li>Despite the Biden administration's commitment to building a half-million charging stations by the end of the decade, only seven federally-funded stations have been built so far, with Costco having more functional chargers without using federal dollars.</li>
<li>Another reason for disgruntled electric car owners is the revelation that electric cars are actually more expensive to own and operate than previously claimed, with some charging sessions costing up to $45.</li>
<li>The survey suggests that range anxiety and the high cost of recharging are significant barriers to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, with many owners considering a switch to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles when it comes time to replace their current vehicle.</li>
</ol>

    <div><div id="mainArticleDiv" itemprop="articleBody">
                    <p>A survey completed by McKinsey &amp; Co. of electric car owners in the United States found, to their amazement, that almost half of the electron burner owners were "very" likely to dump their watt wagon and buy a gasoline-powered vehicle when it comes time to get new transportation.</p>

<p>Automotive News quotes Philipp Kampshoff, who is in charge of McKinsey’s Center for Future Mobility, expressing his surprise, "I didn’t expect that, I thought, 'Once an EV buyer, always an EV buyer.'"</p>

<p>This is the quality of thought we’ve learned to expect from McKinsey since the consulting firm inflicted Pete Buttigieg on an unsuspecting American public.</p>

<p>Once the wizards at McKinsey came to, here’s what we learned.</p>

<p>In the U.S., the number one reason, at 35%, for returning to the folds of reliable fossil fuel transportation was the difficulty in finding someplace to recharge.</p>

<p>We’ve been writing about this particular EV foible for quite some time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/reagan/california-epa-epstein/2023/04/15/id/1116267/">Here</a> you can learn how the charging situation isn’t likely to improve because the Biden administration is busy ordering natural gas-powered power plants to close, while at the same time failing to build the charging infrastructure necessary to keep electric cars humming down the road.</p>

<p>As Fox Business points out, "To further Biden’s EV agenda, Democrats passed infrastructure legislation in 2021 that committed billions of taxpayer dollars to building a half million charging stations in the U.S. by the end of the decade.</p>

<p>"But three years later, only seven federally funded chargers have been built to date."</p>

<p>Costco currently has more chargers functioning than the Biden administration and that company didn’t use any federal dollars to do it.</p>

<p>The second reason for second thoughts among disgruntled amperage auto owners — 34 percent — was their shock at learning the EV lobby had been lying all along.</p>

<p>It’s <em><u>more</u> </em>expensive to own and operate electric cars.</p>

<p>We knew that, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/reagan/battery-electricity-wind/2023/09/15/id/1134658/">Here</a> you can learn how U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm started a clown car caravan to show the rubes in flyover country how great owning an EV really was.</p>

<p>When it came time to recharge Her Highness Granholm’s luxury Cadillac, it took 40 minutes to add 60% to its battery according to Inside EV, and cost up to $45.00 depending on where your charger is located and the brownout situation.</p>

<p>And that didn’t include the time tax.</p>

<p>Unless you’re in line for the really cheap gas at the discount club wholesale warehouse, refueling a carbon carriage takes about five minutes. On most occasions you don’t even have time to run to the bathroom before you’re finished.</p>

<p>That’s not how it works with EVs. The recharging process involves so much time you can take a book to the bathroom and still have plenty of time to wait.</p>

<p>The third reason for fossil reconciliation — at 32% — was the range of a voltage vehicle was too limited.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/reagan/charge-ford-gmc-hybrid/2022/07/09/id/1078022/">Here</a> you can read the results of a test between an EV pickup (a contradiction in terms if you ask us) and a gas-burner.</p>

<p>The electric truck was a Ford F-150 pickup and the driver quickly learned campers considering using an electric vehicle to tow their trailer will have to adjust to playing charger leapfrog every 80 miles or so with at least an hour spent calculating how much carbon you offset at each stop as you wait for the charge to finish.</p>

<p>Electric vehicles, like the rest of the clean energy scam are all hype and hypocrisy with no performance in the real world.</p>

<p>We welcome EV owners return to sanity.</p>

<p>We only regret that it was such an expensive lesson for them.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Inflation continues to ease</strong>: The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, showed a 2.6% gain in May compared to a year ago, down from 2.7% in April. This signals that inflation is continuing to ease.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Technology stocks weighed on the market</strong>: Tech stocks, which have been big winners in the market's recent runup, fell sharply on Friday. Apple, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms were among the biggest losers.</p>

<p>The market headed higher in the early going following a closely watched report that showed <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-election-federal-reserve-rates-economy-b5e545b2591d8c249424624ff43d60ef">inflation continues easing</a></span>. Investors are hoping that cooling inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates, which remain at their highest level in more than 20 years.</p>



<p>Consumer prices rose 2.6% in May compared with a year ago, according to the latest personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE. That signaled continued easing from a 2.7% reading in April and is sharply lower than the peak reading of 7.1% two years ago.</p>
    
<p>“It’s moving in the right direction and this is what the Fed needs to make a decision to cut rates,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.</p><p>The PCE is the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation and the latest reading is encouraging for economists and investors who are hoping for rate cuts to help ease pressure on the market and borrowers. Wall Street is betting that the Fed will start cutting interest rates at its meeting in September.</p>
    

<p>Treasury yields rose in the bond market after initially losing ground following the latest signal of easing inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences interest rates on mortgages and other consumer loans, rose to 4.38% from 4.30% just prior to the release of the PCE data. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed actions, rose to 4.74% from 4.72% just prior to the data’s release.</p><p>The Fed raised interest rates to their highest level in more than two decades in an effort to tame inflation back to its 2% target. Other measures of inflation, including the well-known consumer price index, have also confirmed that pressure on prices has been easing.</p><p>Consumers are still feeling pressure from inflation, despite the significant easing from its peak, and recent data has shown that spending is weakening and weighing down economic growth. The Fed’s goal was to slow economic growth enough to cool inflation, but not so much that the economy slips into a recession.</p>
    

<p>“This combination of inflation coming down and consumers being much more careful with spending patterns allows the market to see the possibility of a rate cut in September,” Krosby said.</p><p>The strong jobs market has been another big factor driving economic growth, but that has also shown signs of weakening. Wall Street will get updates on job openings, unemployment, and hiring next week.</p><p>Nike tumbled 20% for the biggest decline among S&amp;P 500 stocks after the shoe and athletic wear company missed Wall Street’s revenue targets and cut its full-year sales guidance. Company executives said they expect sales to decline by single digits in the current fiscal year, citing a “challenging” environment.</p><p>Nike’s dour outlook dragged other athletic apparel companies down with it. Foot Locker fell 2.4%, Skechers lost 1% and Under Armour dropped 2.6%.</p><p>More retailers, especially those focusing on discretionary items, have been warning about a slowdown in consumer spending. Consumers barely increased spending in May from April, according to the latest government retail sales report. </p>
    

<p>Gains in financial sector stocks helped limit the pullback in the S&amp;P 500. JPMorgan Chase rose 1.6% and Wells Fargo closed 3.4% higher.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 closed out its final trading day of June with a 3.5% gain for the month. The index is up about 14.5% so far this year.</p><p>The Nasdaq gained about 6% for the month and is up 18.1% this year.</p><p>All told, the S&amp;P 500 fell 22.39 points to 5,460.48. The Dow dropped 45.20 points to 39,118.86. The Nasdaq slid 126.08 points to close at 17,732.60.</p><h2>___</h2><p>AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed to this report.</p>

It provides car dealerships with software to handle operations like financing, inventory, back office, payroll and more. CDK’s services are used by over 15,000 car dealerships across North America. The company also employs thousands of people.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</strong></a></p><h2><strong>Timeline of the attacks</strong></h2><p>Cybercriminals targeted CDK twice. The first attack occurred this month, and while CDK Global didn’t reveal details, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cdk-global-hacked-again-while-recovering-from-first-cyberattack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Bleeping Computer</u></a> reported it was related to the company’s always-on VPN.</p><p>Car dealerships use a special kind of VPN connection that's always on to connect to CDK's data centers. This lets their dealership software, installed on their computers, access CDK's platform. Since the CDK software has permission to update itself (like admin privileges) automatically, it makes sense why CDK recommended disconnecting from their data centers during the security incident.</p><p>CDK reported restoring some services on June 20 and told CyberGuy that its systems were again offline due to another cyberattack.</p><p>"Late in the evening of June 19, we experienced an additional cyberincident and proactively shut down most of our systems. In partnership with third-party experts, we are assessing the impact and providing regular updates to our customers," said Lisa Finney, senior external communications manager at CDK Global.</p><p>"We remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible," Finney added.</p><p>CDK Global announced on June 24 that the breach was, in fact, a ransomware attack, meaning the company’s systems won’t be back online until it pays the hackers a ransom. CDK’s software remains down as of this writing, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/cdk-dealer-software-unlikely-be-restored-before-june-end-memo-says-2024-06-25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Reuters reported</u></a> that it won’t be back online until the end of June. </p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-24/blacksuit-cybercrime-gang-blamed-in-major-cdk-ransomware-attack" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg reported</a> that a hacking group called BlackSuit is behind the cyberattack on CDK Global, demanding an extortion fee of tens of millions of dollars.</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>BMW sales car lot</span> <span>(Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson)</span></p></div></div></div><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/pharma-giants-data-breach-exposes-patients-sensitive-information/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong><u>PHARMA GIANT’S DATA BREACH EXPOSES PATIENTS’ SENSITIVE INFORMATION</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>How are dealerships responding?</strong></h2><p>Car dealerships across the U.S. are feeling the pinch from the CDK cyberattack. But some dealerships are showing their resourcefulness. Employees are taking to social media, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/1djl7iy/comment/l9blify/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">like Reddit</a>, to share how they're keeping things going with spreadsheets and sticky notes. This allows them to handle smaller sales and repairs, but for now, bigger transactions are on hold.</p><p>Big names like Honda, Toyota and Hyundai are closely monitoring the situation to see how badly the outage is hurting dealerships. Honda even went further, telling affected dealerships to use alternative tools and processes to keep business running smoothly while CDK gets its systems back online.</p><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/mobile/massive-free-vpn-data-breach-exposes-360-million-records/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong><u>MASSIVE FREE VPN DATA BREACH EXPOSES 360 MILLION RECORDS</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>How does the CDK cyberattack impact you?</strong></h2><p>Car dealerships rely on CDK's software to manage various aspects of their operations, including financing and inventory management. When these systems are down, it can delay the process of purchasing a car, affecting those who are in the market for a new vehicle.</p><p>If you’re seeking services from dealerships, such as maintenance or repairs, you may experience delays or disruptions because the dealership's management systems are offline. CDK's software also helps dealerships manage financing and leasing agreements. The cyberattack has disrupted these processes, leading to delays in securing loans or leases for customers.</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Toyota dealership</span> <span>(Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson)</span></p></div></div></div><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/privacy/ticketmaster-data-breach-exposes-560-million-customers-data-says-it-group/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong><u>TICKETMASTER DATA BREACH EXPOSES 560 MILLION CUSTOMERS’ DATA SAYS IT GROUP</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>Cybersecurity lessons you can learn from the CDK global attack</strong></h2><p>The CDK Global cyberattack serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in our digital world and the far-reaching consequences of such breaches. This incident underscores several key security considerations you should take into account:</p><h3><strong>1. Ransomware awareness and prevention</strong></h3><p>The revelation that the attack involved <a href="https://cyberguy.com/privacy/ransomware-reality-check-as-us-is-top-target-of-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ransomware</a> highlights the ongoing threat posed by this type of malware. It's a reminder that you need to be vigilant about the security of your personal devices. Here are some steps you can take:</p><p><strong>Regular backups:</strong> Ensure that you regularly back up important data to an <a href="https://cyberguy.com/kurts-picks/best-external-hard-drives/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>external hard drive</u></a> or a <a href="https://cyberguy.com/kurts-picks/space-running-low-securely-store-heavy-files-free-cloud-storage-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>secure cloud service</u></a>. This can help you recover your data without paying a ransom if your device is compromised.</p><p><strong>Update software:</strong> Keep your operating system, antivirus software and all applications <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/how-to-update-your-devices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>up to date</u></a> to protect against known vulnerabilities.</p><p><strong>Email caution:</strong> Be wary of <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/outsmart-spammers-to-finally-end-unsolicited-emails/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>unsolicited emails</u></a>, especially those with attachments or links. <a href="https://cyberguy.com/privacy/dont-fall-for-these-7-fake-phishing-emails/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Phishing emails</u></a> are a common method for delivering ransomware. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any phishing emails or ransomware scams. <a href="https://cyberguy.com/security/best-antivirus-protection/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices</u></a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE U.S. NEWS</strong></a></p><h3><strong>2. Strong authentication and access controls</strong></h3><p>While the CDK attack involved always-on VPN connections, the principle of strong authentication applies to you as well. Protect your accounts with:</p><p><strong>Two-factor authentication (2FA):</strong> Enable <a href="https://cyberguy.com/how-to/what-is-two-factor-authentication-and-why-should-i-enable-it/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>2FA</u></a> on all accounts that offer it. This adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password.</p><p><strong>Unique passwords:</strong> Use unique, complex passwords for different accounts. Consider using a <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/best-password-managers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>password manager</u></a> to keep track of them.</p><h3><strong>3. Incident response and personal data protection</strong></h3><p>The prolonged outage and its impact on dealership operations underscore the need for you to have your own incident response plan:</p><p><strong>Know your recovery steps:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the steps to take if your device is compromised, such as disconnecting from the internet, <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/how-to-install-antivirus-software-onto-your-devices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>running antivirus scans</u></a> and <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/how-to-back-up-and-restore-your-mobile-device/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>restoring from backups</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Protect personal information:</strong> Be cautious about sharing personal information online. Use privacy settings on social media and be mindful of the data you share with various services.</p><h3><strong>4. Regular security audits</strong></h3><p>Just as businesses need to assess their security regularly, you should also:</p><p><strong>Review account activity:</strong> Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorized transactions.</p><p><strong>Security settings:</strong> Periodically review and update the security settings on your devices and online accounts.</p><p>By taking these proactive steps, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to cyberattacks. The CDK Global incident serves as a powerful reminder that cybersecurity is not just a concern for businesses but for you and everyone in our increasingly digital world.</p><h2><strong>Kurt’s key takeaways</strong></h2><p>When a company of CDK’s scale is affected by a ransomware attack, it disrupts the whole market, which is something we are witnessing right now. Many dealerships in the U.S. use CDK Global’s software, meaning their business is paralyzed unless they can find another alternative. The company should work on tightening its security systems and hurry to deal with cybercriminals to minimize the losses suffered by dealerships.</p><p><a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p><p>What role should government and regulatory bodies play in supporting businesses affected by ransomware attacks?

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>Americans are still eager to spend on barbecues this Fourth of July, even if their wallets are a little stretched.</p><p>When it comes to the holidays, consumers "typically are willing to spend," Katie Thomas, lead at the Kearney Consumer Institute, told Yahoo Finance, noting that <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-sentiment-hits-lowest-level-in-7-months-152049172.html" data-ylk="slk:mediocre consumer sentiment;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link" data-rapid_p="19">mediocre consumer sentiment</a> is unlikely to weigh on food sales.</p><p>Overall, Americans are expecting to spend a whopping $9.4 billion on food alone this July Fourth, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://nrf.com/research-insights/holiday-data-and-trends/independence-day/independence-day-data-center" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the National Retail Federation.;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="20">according to the National Retail Federation.</a></p><p>Those hosting cookouts can expect to spend a little more. A barbecue index from Rabobank Group showed that a 10-person barbecue this year will cost Americans roughly $99, the most on record, with key fixings such as beer, beef, soda, and lettuce making up nearly two-thirds of the overall cost.</p><p>The holiday does offer an opportunity to save. July Fourth is the most popular day for barbecuing at home. That's "really advantageous" for consumers, according to Wells Fargo chief agricultural economist Michael Swanson, as food away from home drove overall <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/food-inflation-stabilizes-but-price-changes-remain-a-mixed-bag-170340784.html" data-ylk="slk:food inflation;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link" data-rapid_p="21">food inflation</a> higher again last month.</p><p>In May, grocery prices were up 1% year over year, while the cost to dine out jumped 4% year over year. Both were in line with trends in recent months.</p><p>Wells Fargo reported that grilling hamburgers at home for a party of 10 will save hosts nearly $50 compared to dining out, not including taxes and tips. To break it down further, the average cost of a hamburger with all the fixings, cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes is $2.15 at home versus $6.95 at a restaurant.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">Families grill tacos on the beach beneath their giant American flag as they await the fireworks over the ocean on July 4, 2021, in Huntington Beach, Calif.

But cheese prices are down 3.4% from last year.</p><p>On the side, chips are up 2.7% year over year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics mid-June data that Wells Fargo reported. Guacamole may be the go-to dip this year: It's down 1.1%, whereas salsa prices are up 2.5%.</p><p>For those with a sweet tooth, it'll cost you. Increased sweetener costs are driving ice cream prices 3.3% higher, per Swanson.</p><p>As far as drinks go, consumers are better off getting 2-liter bottles than cans to save, as aluminum has gotten more expensive. The bill for 2-ounce cans is up 4.8%, while the cost of 2-liter bottles is down 6.5% from a year ago.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="22"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>And if you're looking to have a toast with some alcoholic beverages, prepare to spend a bit more.

<ol>
<li>JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are boosting both dividend payouts and share repurchases, among other financial institutions.</li>
<li>The two banks announced the news on Friday, with JPMorgan stating it would increase its dividend payout by 15% and Morgan Stanley planning to raise its dividend by 10%.</li>
<li>Rival banks Citigroup and Bank of America made more modest announcements, with Citigroup increasing its dividend by 3% and Bank of America planning to repurchase $30 billion in shares.</li>
<li>The announcements come as banks face increasing competition and pressure to maintain investor confidence in the face of rising interest rates and economic uncertainty.</li>
<li>JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank by assets, stated that the changes would "provide even more value to our shareholders" and emphasized its commitment to returning capital to investors while also maintaining its ability to invest in the business.</li>

The slew of new models could include the kind of “affordable” EVs that Western automakers have been promising for years but have so far been unable to deliver.

	Earlier this week, it was announced that VW Group would invest $5 billion into Rivian. The two companies are partnering together on an “equally controlled and owned joint venture” focused on technology for new vehicles, specifically EV architecture and software. In short, the investment grants the German automotive giant access to the EV maker’s impressive technology, giving the former some help in its bid to catch up with Tesla. The agreement, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-07/rivian-sticks-with-ev-forecast-despite-wider-than-expected-loss" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cash-hemorrhaging Rivian</a> some much-needed financial help.

The presentation includes a slide that breaks down the EV maker’s vehicles into four categories: Gen 1, Gen 2, MSP (or “midsize platform”), and Affordable Mass Market. The Gen 1 column includes the first-generation R1T and R1S and the electric delivery van the company built for Amazon. After that things start getting interesting. The Gen 2 column includes the newly refreshed R1T and R1S, while MSP features the R2 and R3 models unveiled earlier this year. Both column also feature two mysterious EV covered with a shroud. Even more intriguing is the Affordable Mass Market column which features three such hidden vehicles, one of which is low enough to the ground that it may be a car.

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	That’s all we know about the vehicles so far, but it’s hard not to be intrigued. Especially interesting is the fact that the company explicitly referred to the cloaked EVs in column four as “affordable.” The term tends to be relative when it comes to EVs, but if Rivian releases an EV (or three) at a lower price point than the R2, which it says will start at $45,000, that could be a game changer.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Of course, it will likely be a while before we see any of the new models. The R2 won’t be ready until 2026, with the R3 coming later. Who knows how long we’ll have to wait for the rest.
