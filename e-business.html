If the deal is finalized, it will be the company’s largest ever acquisition.</span></p><p>The news comes days after reports surfaced that Alphabet has decided not to pursue an acquisition of HubSpot (NYSE: NYSE:<span>), a company with a market cap of over $24 billion.  Antitrust scrutiny was said to have played a part in the company’s decision not to acquire HubSpot.</span></p><p>Wiz posted annual recurring revenue of $350 million in 2023, up from $100 million in its first 18 months after its founding in 2020 by CEO Assaf Rappaport.</p><p>The company raised $1 billion earlier this year at a valuation of $12 billion, suggesting the takeover is nearly double from those levels.  Wiz is backed by venture capitalists, including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. </p><p>Wiz was one of the rare startups outside of AI to raise capital at a higher valuation in 2024. Many startups are suffering from a tech boom hangover fueled by the low-interest rate environment.</p><p>If a deal is completed, it would <span>be nearly double the value of Google’s largest deal to date, a $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility in 2012. Meanwhile, its second-largest acquisition to date was a $5.4 billion purchase of </span><span>another security company, Mandiant.</span></p><div class="mt-3 text-center text-xs text-[#5b616e]"><p>3rd party Ad.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>AT&amp;T paid $370,000 to a hacker to delete stolen customer data</strong>: The company paid the ransom to a member of the ShinyHunters hacking group, with an intermediary called Reddington negotiating on behalf of the hacker.</li>
<li><strong>The hacker originally asked for $1 million, but was talked down to $370,000</strong>: AT&amp;T allegedly negotiated with the hacker through Reddington, with the final payment being made in bitcoin on May 17th.</li>
<li><strong>The hacker provided a video as proof of deleting the stolen data</strong>: Reddington believes the only complete copy of the data was deleted after the ransom was paid, but it's possible that excerpts may still be in circulation.</li>
<li><strong>Reddington claims to have negotiated with other companies on behalf of the hackers as well</strong>: It's unclear how many companies may have been compromised through this hacking spree, but it's possible that other companies may have paid ransoms to eliminate the threat.</li>
<li><strong>AT&amp;T had previously kept the breach silent, but the payment was made public through the Wired report</strong>: The exact extent of the data breach is still unclear, but the payment of the ransom has shed more light on the incident and the involvement of the ShinyHunters hacking group.</li>

<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">What Are Dark Patterns?</h2>
<p>Dark patterns are user interface (UI) designs crafted to trick users into taking actions they might not otherwise take. Coined by Harry Brignull, founder of <a href="https://www.deceptive.design/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.deceptive.design/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.deceptive.design/" aria-label="Deceptive Patterns">Deceptive Patterns</a> , the term describes UI elements that manipulate users into decisions that benefit the service provider, often at the user's expense. These patterns exploit cognitive biases and lack of user attention to guide users down a path that they may later regret.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p>Examples of dark patterns include:</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>
<p></p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Fake Scarcity</strong>: Users are pressured to act quickly by falsely indicating that what they are looking at is almost gone.</li>
 <li><strong>Disguised Ads</strong>: Tricking users into clicking on ads that look like navigation elements.</li>
 <li><strong>Roach Motel</strong>: Making it easy to get into a situation (e.g., signing up for a service) but hard to get out (e.g., canceling a subscription).</li>
</ul>
<p></p>


<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">EU's Allegations Against X</h2>
<p>The European Commission's investigation under the DSA revealed that X's blue checkmarks, available for a monthly fee, are a form of dark pattern. For most of Twitter’s history, these checkmarks were a mark of verification for celebrities, politicians, and other influential accounts. It was an indication that the identify of the person had been verified.</p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" class="inread-active" display-called=""></fbs-ad>
<p>Other social networks like LinkedIn continue to use a “verified” badge to indicated they have authenticated the member’s identity.</p>
<p>In contrast, under Elon Musk's ownership, any X user can obtain a blue checkmark by paying $8 per month. This shift has led to confusion and deception, as users can no longer rely on the blue checkmark as a sign of authenticity and trustworthiness.</p>
<p>A quick scan of trending topics at X showed plenty of blue checkmarks - some recognizable names, some unfamiliar ones that might or might not be real, and a many anonymous accounts. At this point, it seems, the blue checkmark means only that somebody paid eight dollars to X - the person, an organization, a bot farm creator... there’s no way to tell.</p>






<p>According to the EU, this practice "negatively affects users’ ability to make free and informed decisions about the authenticity of the accounts and the content they interact with."</p>
<p>The blue checks are just one aspect of the broader accusations, which also include blocking data access to researchers and shortcomings in X's ad database​​.</p>


<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Understanding the EU Allegations about X</h2>
<p>The EU's findings suggest that the current system of blue checkmarks on X can mislead users into believing certain accounts are more trustworthy or authentic than they actually are. This practice undermines the original purpose of verification, which was to provide a reliable indicator of an account's legitimacy. By allowing anyone to purchase a blue checkmark, X is effectively reducing the clarity and reliability of this marker for genuine verification.</p>
<p>The allegations also extend to X's compliance with transparency rules for advertising. The DSA requires platforms to maintain a searchable and reliable database of all digital advertisements, including details about who paid for them and their intended audience. The EU's investigation found that X's ad database is not up to these standards, hindering researchers' ability to study emerging risks from online ads​​.</p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">The Broader Issue of Dark Patterns</h2>
<p>Dark patterns are not unique to X. Many platforms use similar tactics to nudge users into making decisions that benefit the company. These can range from making it difficult to cancel subscriptions to automatically enrolling users in services without their explicit consent.</p>
<p>All of the major tech companies have been <a href="https://deceptive.design/hall-of-shame" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://deceptive.design/hall-of-shame" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://deceptive.design/hall-of-shame" aria-label="reported multiple times">reported multiple times</a> at Deceptive Patterns. Even <a href="https://www.d?brand=Trump" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.d?brand=Trump" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.d/?brand=Trump" aria-label="Trump campaigners and fundraisers">Trump campaigners and fundraisers</a> make the list.</p>
<p>The most common dark patterns involve making a choice favorable to the user hard to find or making an action favorable to the brand look like the default or only option. Years ago, I inadvertently shared my contacts with LinkedIn by clicking a “Continue” button after adding a connection. Later, they suggested I should <a href="https://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/dark-patterns.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/dark-patterns.htm" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/dark-patterns.htm" aria-label="connect with my deceased mother">connect with my deceased mother</a> on the platform.</p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Regulatory Response and User Awareness</h2>
<p>The EU's action against X is part of a broader effort to regulate digital platforms and protect users from manipulative practices. The Digital Services Act represents a significant step in that direction, setting clear guidelines for transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>As users, it’s important to be aware of dark patterns and understand how they can influence our decisions.</p>
<p>The EU is scrutinizing X for its alleged use of dark patterns, but this issue is common across many digital platforms. Understanding and recognizing dark patterns is crucial for consumers to make informed decisions and for businesses to maintain trust and transparency. By not only recognizing but these tactics, but calling out the offenders, we can make better choices and hold platforms accountable.</p>

								<p><span>The price of several Donald Trump-themed memecoins has surged in the last few hours after the former US President and Republican Presidential Candidate survived an assassination attempt. Trump, who has publicly <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/donald-trump-declares-support-for-crypto-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">declared support</a> for digital assets in recent times, has continued to remain a center of attention in the crypto ecosystem, especially with the US elections set to be held in November.<br>
</span></p>

<h2><strong>Donald Trump Memecoins React Positively To Failed Attack</strong></h2>
<p><span>Several circulating videos on July 13 showed Donald Trump dropping to the ground amidst sounds of gunshots while delivering a speech at a campaign rally in Butner, Pennsylvania. The injured former US President was quickly covered by the agents of the US Secret Service who quickly escorted him off the stage at the rally.</span></p>
<p><span>In reaction to this event, memecoins based on the image and personality of Donald Trump have recorded significant price gains. </span></p>
<p><span>According to <a href="https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0xe4b8583ccb95b25737c016ac88e539d0605949e8" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">data from DexScreener,</a> the MAGA token (TRUMP/WETH), based on the Ethereum blockchain soared from $6.17 to $10.46 following news of this development. Meanwhile, <a href="https://dexscreener.com/solana/5o9kgvozarynwfbytzd1wdrkpkkdr6ldpqbuuqm57nfj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">donald tremp (tremp/SOL)</a> created on the Solana network rose from $0.39 to as high as $0.84 indicating a 132.35% price increase.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to the price effects on existing tokens, there has also been a rapid creation of many more Donald Trump-themed memecoins with remarkable price gains. Notably, there is the Solana-based <a href="https://dexscreener.com/solana/axa4gev6xashzagwftoszjbbv2pqzgck9nahrnpnt4xc" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Make Ear Great Again (MEGA/SOL)</a> which produced a 30,982% gain in the last few hours.<br>
</span></p>

<h2><strong>Trump Comments On Recent Shooting</strong></h2>
<p><span>Meanwhile, Donald Trump has released a statement on this incident detailing his traumatic experience. The former US President posted on self-owned social media platform Truth Social saying: </span><span><br>
</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>The Republican Presidential candidate also confirmed the shooter has been neutralized although his identity among other things about this person remains unknown. </span><span>According to <a href="https://x.com/Polymarket/status/1812288565524779125" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">data from election prediction site Polymarket</a>, Trump’s chances of winning the US Presidential elections have now hit 70% following the failed assassination attempt.</span></p>
<p>Trump, who has been a vocal supporter of cryptocurrency in recent weeks, has garnered some levels of support within the crypto space marked by heavy donations from key figures such as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/kraken-founder-donates-1-million-to-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell</a> and the Winklevoss twins, founders of the Gemini exchange. However, other popular persons including the founder of <a href="https://cryptohayes.substack.com/p/hot-chick" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BitMEX exchange Arthur Hayes,</a> remain critical and suspecting of the politician’s “sudden” embracement of digital assets.</p>

<p>Last week, Paramount and Skydance officially announced a deal to merge. Skydance will buy the Redstone family’s majority control of Paramount. Part of the deal gave the Redstone family 45 days to look for other buyers to beat the Skydance offer.</p>



<p>One of the other potential buyers was Sony, which had looked at Paramount but decided not to follow through on the purchase of Paramount, including its streaming services Pluto TV and Paramount+. This comes from a report by <a href="https://deadline-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/deadline.com/2024/07/paramount-sale-sony-out-1236008101/amp/?amp_gsa=1&amp;amp_js_v=a9&amp;usqp=mq331AQGsAEggAID#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;aoh=17207764750431&amp;csi=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fdeadline.com%2F2024%2F07%2Fparamount-sale-sony-out-1236008101%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Deadline</em></a>, which says their sources confirmed Sony dropped out of the running. Sony had reportedly made a preliminary $26 billion offer, but Paramount decided to go with Skydance. Sony declined to make a new offer.</p>



<p>Paramount reportedly wanted to get the Paramount studio to make more movies and TV shows. Its partner, Apollo, wanted to get its hands on the land the Paramount studio is located on. Both sides had no interest in the other assets owned by Paramount and planned to sell CBS, Pluto TV, MTV, and Paramount+ to just name a few.</p>



<p>According to the <em>Deadline</em> report, Sony’s plans to sell off most of the Paramount assets resulted in the Redstone family declining to accept the offer.</p>



<p data-inc="1">For now, Sony still has time to look for new offers that can beat the Skydance offer.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The standard allowable time for evacuating an aircraft under FAA and European rules is 90 seconds.  Airlines have to simulate these evacuations to show that the way they configure planes make this possible.  In an emergency, people need off an aircraft quickly.
</p><p>But these simulations don’t assume people stopping to grab their luggage.  That’s what passengers do!  Some experts argue that overhead bins should lock to prevent passengers from grabbing bags, but that would only slow things down further as everyone tries to fight to get the bins open, not understanding that they’re locked.</p>
<p>And the simulations don’t assume people stopping to take selfies, film the situation for social media, or record their heading down the emergency slide.  But who ever figures that passengers would simply lollygag their way out of the plane during an evacuation – or stop to argue with flight crew over whether they need to get up at all?</p>
<p>On Friday an American Airlines flight from San Francisco to Miami <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/laptop-fire-sparks-emergency-evacuation-of-american-airlines-flight-in-san-francisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to evacuate while still at the gate</a> when a passenger’s laptop caught fire.  Passengers exited via both emergency slides and the still-attached jet bridge.  But they didn’t do so in a very orderly manner.  </p>
<p>Video from inside the cabin shows a flight attendant yelling at passengers not to take their carry-on bags, and even arguing with a passenger over whether or not he needed to go at all.  Passengers can be seen remaining seated.  Overhead bins are open.  And you can even see people still reaching in to grab their bags, even as they’re being told not to – and to get off the plane! This is literally insane.</p>
<p class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered"></p>
<p> </p>	
	
	
<p>This 90-second rule is based on the assumption that an aircraft needs to be evacuated quickly in case of an emergency to maximize the chances of survival and minimize injuries. But it doesn’t assume the real world of how passengers actually behave.</p>
<p>The truth is that the rule still works.  Usually there’s more than 90 seconds available, and when you add in the time for how people actually behave the theoretical standard and real world available time mostly sync up.</p>
<p>In the American Airlines evacuation, there were only a few minor injuries.  It isn’t clear though whether there was Venn diagram overlap between injured passengers and idiot passengers.</p>
<p>You do not know how long you have to evacuate an aircraft, and as passengers or even crew you probably don’t have full information about the risks in front of you.  The goal is to get out and away from the aircraft as quickly as possible.  That means not slowing down to get bags or crowding the aisle with bags. It means no selfies.  Maybe you’ll get out in time anyway – but will everyone behind you?</p>

Upgrade today!</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>UBS cuts Tesla (NASDAQ:<span>) to Sell on valuation reassessment, high AI costs</span></strong></h2><p dir="ltr">UBS analysts on Friday downgraded Tesla stock from Neutral to Sell, while raising the price target from $147 to $197.</p><p dir="ltr">This adjustment aims to reflect a reassessment of Tesla's valuation amid market expectations for its growth, particularly in AI.</p><p dir="ltr">The UBS acknowledged Tesla's diversification beyond automotive manufacturing, citing positive developments in its Energy and Full Self-Driving (FSD) segments as supportive factors.</p><p dir="ltr">However, expectations for Tesla's core auto business are declining, analysts cautioned. They noted that Tesla's valuation has historically included a premium for its potential growth in various areas. Still, the challenge lies in accurately valuing this "optionality."</p><p dir="ltr">Recently, Tesla's premium has expanded due to increased enthusiasm around AI. After evaluating Tesla's various segments, UBS concluded that the current stock price implies a value of over $500 billion for future growth initiatives.</p><p dir="ltr">To justify the current stock levels, Tesla would need to achieve a future value of $1 trillion within five years, and even more to support a Buy rating, analysts said. </p><p dir="ltr">They also raised concerns over the high costs of AI investments, the unpredictable pace of improvement, and the long-term nature of potential returns. The firm warned that if market excitement for AI diminishes, Tesla's stock multiple could be negatively impacted.</p><p dir="ltr">With the stock trading at 86 times the next twelve months (NTM) P/E, the lack of visibility and potential for delayed growth opportunities warranted the downgrade to Sell, UBS said.<strong><br></strong></p><div class="mt-3 text-center text-xs text-[#5b616e]"><p>3rd party Ad.

The <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/why-the-federal-reserve-affects-mortgage-rates/">Federal Reserve</a> has been postponing interest rate cuts because inflation has been slow to improve. While experts still expect <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/mortgage-interest-rates-today/">mortgage rates</a> to gradually move lower in the coming months, housing market predictions can always change in response to economic data, geopolitical events and more.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-different-mortgage-types">What are the different mortgage types?</h2>
<p>
Each mortgage has a loan term, or payment schedule. The most common mortgage terms are 15 and 30 years, although 10-, 20- and 40-year mortgages also exist. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate is set for the duration of the loan, offering stability. With an adjustable-rate mortgage, the interest rate is only fixed for a certain amount of time (commonly five, seven or 10 years), after which the rate adjusts annually based on the market. Fixed-rate mortgages are a better option if you plan to live in a home in the long term, but adjustable-rate mortgages may offer lower interest rates upfront.</p>
<h3>30-year fixed-rate mortgages</h3>
<p>
The average interest rate for a standard 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.94% today. A 30-year fixed mortgage is the most common loan term. It will often have a higher interest rate than a 15-year mortgage, but you’ll have a lower monthly payment.</p>
<h3>15-year fixed-rate mortgages</h3>
<p>
Today, the average rate for a 15-year, fixed mortgage is 6.41%. Though you’ll have a bigger monthly payment than a 30-year fixed mortgage, a 15-year loan usually comes with a lower interest rate, allowing you to pay less interest in the long run and pay off your mortgage sooner.</p>
<h3>5/1 adjustable-rate mortgages</h3>
<p>
A 5/1 ARM has an average rate of 6.59% today. You’ll typically get a lower introductory interest rate with a 5/1 ARM in the first five years of the mortgage. But you could pay more after that period, depending on how the rate adjusts annually. If you plan to sell or refinance your house within five years, an ARM could be a good option.</p>
<h2 id="whats-behind-todays-high-mortgage-rates-">What’s behind today’s high mortgage rates? </h2>
<p>
At the start of the pandemic, mortgage rates were near record lows, around 3%. That all changed as inflation began to surge and the Federal Reserve kicked off a series of aggressive interest rate hikes starting in March 2022 to slow the economy, which indirectly drove up <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/30-year-mortgage-rates/">mortgage rates</a>.</p>
<p>
Now, more than two years later, mortgage rates are still around 7%. Over the last several months, mortgage rates have fluctuated in response to economic data and investors’ expectations as to <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/june-fed-meeting-and-mortgage-rates-what-housing-market-experts-predict/">when the Fed will start to lower rates</a>.</p>
<p>
Today’s homebuyers have less room in their budget to afford the cost of a home due to elevated mortgage rates and steep home prices. <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/how-a-housing-shortage-is-driving-up-home-prices/">Limited housing inventory</a> and low wage growth are also contributing to the <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/how-an-unaffordable-housing-market-leaves-the-next-generation-out-in-the-cold/">affordability crisis</a> and keeping mortgage demand down.</p>
<h2 id="will-we-see-lower-mortgage-rates-in-">Will we see lower mortgage rates in 2024?</h2>
<p>
Most experts predict mortgage rates will <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/june-fed-meeting-and-mortgage-rates-what-housing-market-experts-predict/">fall below 7%</a> in the coming months. However, a sustained downward trend will depend on several factors, including upcoming inflation and labor data. </p>
<p>
The Fed hasn’t hiked interest rates in almost a year, but an actual rate cut doesn’t appear imminent. Some experts say the first cut could come <a href="/personal-finance/banking/advice/dont-expect-interest-rate-cuts-tomorrow-but-what-about-july/">as early as July</a>, though it’s more likely we see the Fed lower rates in September or November.</p>
<p>
“If the Fed makes any moves later this year, the signal would be sufficient for the mortgage market, and mortgage rates would start falling,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/selma-hepp-phd-11b0773a/">Selma Hepp</a>, chief economist at CoreLogic. “In that case, we could see the mortgage rates around 6.5% at the year-end.”</p>
<p>
One thing is for sure: Homebuyers won’t see lower mortgage overnight, and <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-predictions-the-new-normal-for-mortgage-rates/">a return to the 2-3% mortgage rates</a> from just a few years ago is unlikely.</p>
<p>
Here’s a look at where some major housing authorities expect average mortgage rates to land.</p>

Getting a mortgage should always depend on your financial situation and long-term goals. The most important thing is to make a budget and try to stay within your means. <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-payment-calculator/">CNET’s mortgage calculator</a> below can help homebuyers prepare for monthly mortgage payments.</p>
<p></p><p class="myFinance-widget" data-campaign="cnet-full-page-mortgage-calc" data-frame="static" data-ad-id="5778edbc-31f1-405a-9f8a-6fb2b32886cd"></p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-get-the-lowest-mortgage-rates">How can I get the lowest mortgage rates?</h2>
<p>
Though mortgage rates and home prices are high, the housing market won’t be unaffordable forever. It’s always a good time to save for a down payment and improve your credit score to help you secure a competitive mortgage rate when the time is right.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Save for a bigger down payment:</b> Though a 20% down payment isn’t required, a larger upfront payment means taking out a smaller mortgage, which will help you save in interest.</li>
<li><b>Boost your credit score:</b> You can qualify for a conventional mortgage with a 620 credit score, but a higher score of at least 740 will get you better rates.</li>
<li><b>Pay off debt:</b> Experts recommend a debt-to-income ratio of 36% or less to help you qualify for the best rates. Not carrying other debt will put you in a better position to handle your monthly payments.</li>
<li><b>Research loans and assistance:</b> Government-sponsored loans have more flexible borrowing requirements than conventional loans. Some government-sponsored or private programs can also help with your down payment and closing costs.</li>
<li><b>Shop around for lenders:</b> Researching and comparing multiple loan offers from different lenders can help you secure the lowest mortgage rate for your situation.</li>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — One Monday morning in May, I woke up and grabbed my cell phone to read the news and scroll through memes. But it was out of cell service. I couldn’t make calls or texts. </p><p>That, though, turned out to be the least of my problems. </p><p>Using my home Wi-Fi connection, I checked my email and discovered a notification that $20,000 was being transferred from my credit card to an unfamiliar Discover Bank account. </p><p>I thwarted that transfer and reported the cell phone issues, but my nightmare was just starting. Days later, someone managed to transfer $19,000 from my credit card to the same strange bank account.</p><p>I was the victim of a type of fraud known as port-out hijacking, also called SIM-swapping. It’s a less-common form of identity theft. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-governmental-affairs/fcc-announces-effective-compliance-date-sim-swapping-item" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New federal regulations</a></span> aimed at preventing port-out hijacking are under review, but it’s not clear how far they will go in stopping the crime.</p>
    

<p>Port-out hijacking goes a step beyond hacking into a store, bank or credit card account. In this case, the thieves take over your phone number. Any calls or texts go to them, not to you. </p><p>When your own phone access is lost to a criminal, the very steps you once took to protect your accounts, such as two-factor authentication, can be used against you. It doesn’t help to have a bank send a text to verify a transaction when the phone receiving the text is in the hands of the very person trying to break into your account.</p>



<p>Even if you’re a relatively tech-savvy individual who follows every recommendation on how to protect your tech and identity, it can still happen to you. </p>
    
<p>Experts say these scams will only increase and become more sophisticated, and the data show they are on the rise.</p><p>I am not the most tech savvy person, but I am a law-school educated journalist who specializes in finance reporting. Due to the very online nature of my job, I was taught all the methods of staying safe online: constantly changing my passwords with multi-factor authentication, signing out of apps that I don’t use regularly and keeping my personal information off the internet.</p>
    

<p>Still, despite being safe, I was vulnerable to criminals. And it took a lot of time and legwork before I got my money and phone number back.</p><p>The FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center reports SIM-swapping complaints have increased <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220208" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 400% from 2018 to 2021</a></span>, having received 1,611 SIM swapping complaints with personal losses of more than $68 million.</p><p>Complaints to the FCC about the crime have doubled, from 275 complaints in 2020 to 550 reports in 2023. </p><p>Rachel Tobac, CEO of SocialProof Security, an online security company, says the rate of the crime is likely much higher since most identity thefts are not reported. </p><p>She also says two-factor authentication is an outdated way of keeping consumers safe, since it’s possible to find anyone’s phone number, birthday and social security number through any number of public or private databases on the web.</p><p>The ability of thieves to obtain your personal information was again made clear Friday when AT&amp;T said the data of nearly all of its customers was downloaded to a third-party platform in a security breach two years ago. Although AT&amp;T claims no personal information was leaked, cybersecurity experts have warned breaches involving telephone companies leave customers vulnerable to SIM swapping.</p>
    

<p>As of now, switching numbers from one phone to another is easy and can be done online or over the phone. The process takes less than a few hours so long as a criminal has your personal information on hand. </p><p>While consumers need to be smart about having a variety of different passwords and protections, consumers need to “put pressure on companies where its their job to protect our data,” Tobac said.</p><p>“We need them to update consumer protection protocols,” she said, since two-factor authentication is not enough.</p><p>FCC rules have recently changed to force companies to do more to protect consumers from this type of scam. </p><p>In 2023, the FCC <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-23-95A1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced rulemaking that require wireless providers</a></span> to “adopt secure methods of authenticating a customer before redirecting a customer’s phone number to a new device or provider” among other new rules. Companies could require more information when a customer tries to port over a phone number to another phone — from requiring government identification, voice verification or additional security questions. </p>
    

<p>The rules were scheduled to take effect on July 8, but the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-649A1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FCC on July 5 granted phone companies a waiver</a></span> that delays implementation until the White House Office of Management conducts a further review.</p><p>The wireless industry <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/101082552329416/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had sought the delay,</a></span> stating among other reasons that companies need more time to comply. CTIA, which lobbies on behalf of the companies, said the new rules will require major changes in technology and procedures both within the wireless companies and in their interactions with phone manufacturers.</p>
    

<p>But if the FCC rules had been in place, my phone number might have been harder to steal, experts say. </p><p>Ohio State University Professor Amy Schmitz says the new FCC rules make it easier for consumers to protect themselves, but it is still reliant on action and awareness of the consumers.</p><p>“I still question whether consumers will be aware of this, and will take action to protect themselves,” she said.</p><p>It took ten days to get my number back from Cricket Wireless — and that wasn’t until I told company representatives that I was writing a story about my experience. </p><p>In that period of time the scammer was able to access my bank account three times and eventually successfully transferred $19,000 from my credit card— even though I removed my number from the bank account, froze my credit, changed all my passwords, among other measures.</p><p>Bank of America worked to reverse the $19,000 wire after I visited a branch near the AP bureau in Washington. </p><p>Cricket apologized for the error and said in an email that its “expectation is to deliver a much better customer experience.”</p><p>“Fraudulent port-outs are a form of theft committed by sophisticated criminals,” reads a company statement that was emailed to me. “We have measures in place to help defeat them, and we work closely with law enforcement, our industry and consumers to help prevent this type of crime.”</p><p>An AT&amp;T representative told me in an email that “all providers are working to implement the FCC’s new rules on port-outs and SIM swaps.”</p><p>I’m still unsure of how this person got access to my accounts, whether through my social security number, phone number or date of birth, or possibly a recording of my voice.</p><p>It was a hard lesson in how vulnerable we are when you lose control of our personal information that is so publicly available. </p><h2></h2>

<p>Every qualified citizen of the United States receives payments for Social Security and other benefits throughout the month. Therefore, you could have the money available in the coming days if you qualify for any <strong>SSI, SSDI, and Social Security payments.</strong> But only a specific group of Americans get Social Security payments 2024 during the third week of July. To find out if you will receive the money or not, you must be eligible and a member of that specific group. </p>




<p>For half of the recipients, the Social Security Administration’s July payment schedule is already set. In any case, for two of the four categories of US retirees who receive a fresh benefit from the SSA each month, the money has already been distributed. Following the July 3 and July 10 Social Security and SSI payments, there will be many pay days throughout the summer.</p>




<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Social Security, SSI and SSDI Full List of Payments in the USA</strong></h2>



<p>Retirees can get their <strong>Social Security benefits</strong> on up to four different days each month, so keep that in mind. Another payment that is made on the first of every month is Supplemental Security Income, however it is subject to some limitations. While, there are no SSI payments made during the third week of the month for retirement benefits, whether or not they are from SSDI. </p>



<p><strong>July 17th is the Social Security July 2024 payment date,</strong> and there are two conditions we must fulfill in order to get a check. The beneficiary must have been receiving the benefit from May 1997 onwards, and the applicant must be born between the 11th and the 20th of any given month. To get your Social Security Administration benefit of up to $4,873 and collect the payment for that day, you only need to meet these two requirements.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Upcoming SSA July 2024 Payments</strong></h3>



<p>The <strong>17th and 24th of July, 2024, will see the mailing of the upcoming two Social Security Administration benefits</strong>. This indicates that, if we fulfill certain requirements, we will be eligible to get the benefit on the third or fourth Wednesday. We must have received the benefit since after May 1997 in order to be eligible to receive payment on July 17, 2024.</p>



<p>Having a birthdate between the eleventh and twentieth of any given month is another requirements that has to be fulfilled. On the other hand, the 24th of this month will mark the end of the July benefit payment. For the benefit to be applied on this day, the beneficiary’s birthday must fall between the 21st and the 31st of any given month.</p>





<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New SSI check from SSA in Weeks</strong></h3>



<p>After the July 24th payment is sent by the Social Security Administration, no more payments will be sent this month. That means we won’t be receiving a new check for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) until August. There might be two cases of this additional check in August. On the first of the month, the first payment will be made and on August 30 is when the second of these checks is supposed to be delivered. </p>



<p>Not all Americans will get payment on the same day of mailing, but the Social Security Administration will mail the checks on these two days. If we would want the check to arrive right away, we must enable direct deposit. If not, the money will not appear in our bank account until a few days later. The money will come through sooner or later, in any case.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SSDI July 2024 upcoming payments</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>On July 17, 2024, the SSA will make another payment. This means that if your birthday comes between 11 and 20, you will get money in your bank account provided you are not on SSI, did not receive benefits before to May 1997, and are not on any other programs.</li>



<li>Your next SSDI payment, if you were born after July 20, 2024, will be received on that day. August’s SSDI payouts fall on the second, 14, 21, and 28 and September 3, 11, 18, and 25.</li>



<li>However, average payouts are more regular and reasonable. An SSDI check or direct deposit as of May 2024 will typically pays $1,537.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SSA July Payment 2024 Requirements</strong></h3>



<p>On July 17, 2024, retirees will get their next Social Security Administration payout. The fact that these payments will only benefit a specific group of recipients. There are two things you need to do to get this check. Also a retirement pension from May 1997 onward is also a requirement. On July 17th, only then will we be eligible to receive the payment from the SSA. Remember that to get the payment the same day it is received, Direct Deposit must also be enabled.</p>

<p>The Social Security Administration will send out its next payment on July 17, 2024. This payment is not for every American. We must fulfill a few requirements in order to be eligible for this payment. In order to get this payout, you must:</p>



<ul>
<li>Have a birthday in any month between the 11th and the 20th.</li>



<li>Have been getting benefits from Social Security since after May 1997.</li>
</ul>



<p>The SSA will issue us a check on July 17th if we meet both of the conditions. It is true, though, that not every beneficiary in this group will be able to obtain a check on this specific day because the day a check is received depends on how it is collected.</p>
