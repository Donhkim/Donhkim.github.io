<li>Dine Brands, the parent company of Applebee's and IHOP, believes that its value-driven promotions can lure away customers from fast-food chains.</li>
<li>CEO John Peyton thinks that consumers are becoming increasingly price-sensitive and are seeking value for their money, leading to increased competition for diners' dollars.</li>
<li>To compete, Applebee's is offering promotions like the return of Dollaritas and the Whole Lotta Burger for $9.99, which is comparable to what fast-food chains offer for a similar price.</li>
<li>Dine Brands reported weaker-than-expected earnings and same-store sales for its Applebee's and IHOP brands in the first quarter, but still reiterated its full-year outlook.</li>
<li>The company will need to significantly improve its same-store sales growth to meet its forecast, which projected a range of flat to 2% growth for the full year, after falling 4.6% at Applebee's and 1.7% at IHOP in the first quarter.</li>

Dine Brands CEO John Peyton said full-service restaurants, fast-food chains and even eating at home are all competing for diners’ dollars.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>To rise above the competition, Applebee’s has been leaning into value with a slate of promotions that includes the return of Dollaritas, which makes Peyton confident that it can beat out the fast-food chains vying for its customers.</p><p>“The Whole Lotta Burger for $9.99 — if you can have our burger for $10, which is great quality, abundant and eat in our restaurant, in our experience, why would you eat a $10 burger out of a paper bag in your car?” he told CNBC.</p><p>Low-income consumers visited less frequently and spent more carefully when they did eat out in the first quarter, according to Peyton.

The company will need to improve its same-store sales significantly to meet the full-year outlook it reiterated this quarter, Raymond James analyst Brian Vaccaro wrote in a research note on Wednesday.

            “We are in the early stages of developing pocket tools without blades,” a spokesperson for Swiss firm Victorinox told CNN in a statement Tuesday, adding that they will compliment the existing range of multi-tools rather than replacing them.

            CNN contacted Victorinox after company CEO Carl Elsener Jr. told Swiss media outlet <a href="https://www.blick.ch/wirtschaft/ceo-carl-elsener-kuendigt-neue-taschentools-ohne-klingen-an-victorinox-leidet-unter-waffenregulierung-id19708348.html" target="_blank">Blick</a> that he is concerned about increasingly stringent regulations on knives in many markets.

            For example, increasing concern over the prevalence of knife crime means that the British government is considering new legislation on bladed articles, and Elsener himself referenced the country’s rules.

            “In England or certain Asian countries, you are sometimes only allowed to carry a knife if you need to have it to do your job or operate outdoors,” said Elsener. “In the city, however, when you go to school, to the cinema, or to go shopping, carrying pocketknives is severely restricted.”

            Elsener cited the fact that knives are seen as weapons rather than tools in some countries, and revealed that the company is working on new tools for specific sports or outdoor activities, such as cycling.
    </p>

            “I have a cool tool for cyclists in mind. We already have a tool specifically for golfers in our range,” he said. “Cyclists probably need special tools, but not necessarily a blade.”

                                        <p>LONDON (AP) — The pharma giant AstraZeneca has requested that the European authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine be pulled, according to the EU medicines regulator.</p><p>In an <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/vaxzevria-previously-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a></span> on the European Medicines Agency’s website Wednesday, the regulator said that the approval for AstraZeneca’s Vaxzevria had been withdrawn “at the request of the marketing authorization holder.”</p><p>AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine was first given the nod by the EMA in <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-authorizes-astrazeneca-vaccine-adults-18b545dd51ea56f422ff28cdeb2dd08b">January 2021</a></span>. Within weeks, however, concerns grew about the vaccine’s safety, when dozens of countries suspended the vaccine’s use after unusual but rare blood clots were detected in a small number of immunized people. The EU regulator concluded AstraZeneca’s shot didn’t raise the overall risk of clots, but <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84">doubts remained.</a></span></p><p>Partial results from its first major trial — which Britain used to authorize the vaccine — were clouded by a manufacturing mistake that researchers didn’t immediately acknowledge. Insufficient data about how well the vaccine protected older people led some countries to initially restrict its use to younger populations before reversing course.</p>
    

<p>Billions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were distributed to poorer countries through a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/poorer-countries-coronavirus-vaccine-0980fa905b6e1ce2f14a149cd2c438cd">U.N.-coordinated program,</a></span> as it was cheaper and easier to produce and distribute. But studies later suggested that the pricier messenger RNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna provided better protection against COVID-19 and its many variants, and most countries switched to those shots. </p>




    
<p>The U.K.'s national coronavirus immunization program in 2021 heavily relied on AstraZeneca’s vaccine, which was largely developed by scientists at Oxford University with significant financial government support. But even Britain later resorted to buying the mRNA vaccines for its COVID booster vaccination programs and the AstraZeneca vaccine is now rarely used globally.</p><h2>___</h2><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Have you been able to maintain it all the way until May? Or did it crash and burn in the first few weeks of the year?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">It's not surprising that a large number of people who make a New Year's resolution fail to see it through because they fail to make any adjustments to their lifestyle. When you're full of the vigor of the New Year, it is easy to purposefully do something, even if it means you have absolutely no follow-through whatsoever.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">The wonderful thing about spring weather (and with summer rapidly approaching) is that we're able to get outdoors more. This means that we can be more physically active, enjoy the sun on our skin, and hopefully see some improvements in our overall health.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">When it comes to the market, May always brings to my memory the need for healthcare investments. The healthcare sector is heavily regulated and heavily required. The older we get, the more we rely on prescription drugs, treatments, medical devices, and physicians - the more healthcare spending climbs. Medicare is one of the largest budget items in the entire U.S. government spending budget. The reason for this is that as we get older, we need more medical attention.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The Silver tsunami is raging as more Americans are about to be 65 years old than ever before. A record 4.1 million Baby Boomers will reach the traditional retirement age in 2024, marking the greatest surge in the retirement age population in the nation's history. Health spending often increases with age, as we generally have more health conditions and need more care as we grow older.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Around 95% of patients age 65 or older have a minimum of one chronic condition, and 80% have two or more. As humans live longer, the costs associated with these statistics become even more significant.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Global pharmaceutical and medical device companies perform cutting-edge research to discover drugs and treatments for critical illnesses and conditions and maintain exclusivity for decades, giving them a solid moat to keep competition at bay. We like this industry and its prospects in an aging America. However, it is difficult to cherry-pick winners due to the complexities and uncertainties involved in clinical trials.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As an income investor, I look at the market through the lens of how I can get paid. Billions of dollars flow through the market every single year. Record amounts of money are paid out to people willing to collect it in the form of dividends and distributions. My portfolio is fine-tuned to tap into the income flowing through the market and siphon off a portion to enrich my portfolio and fuel my lifestyle.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Today, I want to look at two highly diversified healthcare funds that will pay you handsomely going forward.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Let's dive in!</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Pick #1: HQH - Yield 11.7%</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>abrdn Healthcare Investors</strong> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HQH" title="abrdn Healthcare Investors">HQH</a>) is a CEF (Closed-End Fund) formerly known as "Tekla Healthcare Investors". Aberdeen acquired Tekla, along with all of its funds. Importantly, the management of the Tekla funds has remained unchanged. The skill of Tekla's staff is one of the reasons Aberdeen wanted to buy the company, as it lacked expertise in the healthcare segment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">HQH is a CEF that has withstood the test of time. Since its inception, HQH has outperformed the S&amp;P 500, even though healthcare has recently been an underperforming segment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/5/6/saupload_15e0fc3cdf76444dcf6f27f773edc81e.png" alt="Chart" class="sa-ycharts-img" data-width="635" data-height="366" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Data by <a href="https://ycharts.com" rel="nofollow">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The healthcare sector is a highly regulated sector, and most of the money flows either through Medicare or private insurance companies. As a result, it is a sector where the impacts of inflation are uneven, as prices are usually negotiated well in advance of a patient receiving the treatment or the product. Most businesses in the sector can't unilaterally decide to raise prices. There is a process, and that process takes time. As a result, there has been pressure on margins for many healthcare businesses as costs go up, but revenues haven't kept up. However, it is a pressure that will continue to diminish with time.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Fundamentally, the demand for healthcare is extremely strong, and will only continue to rise. The healthcare sector has faced challenges and dramatic changes in the past, including significant cuts from the government with the "balanced budget" in the late 1990s and the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which dramatically changed the playing field. Yet despite challenges, the sector has proven to be a long-term winner for investors. HQH has been through it all.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The CEF is primarily invested in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals: <em><a href="https://www.abrdnhqh.com/docs?editionid=5f458568-d8d4-43e3-8f18-b0af00fe0612" rel="nofollow noopener noopener">Source</a></em></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/4/19/16392-17135669177134972.png" alt="Table" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"></picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption">HQH Fact Sheet</p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In addition to the healthcare sector being down, HQH, in particular, is trading at a larger-than-normal discount to NAV. In the past 20 years, the only time HQH has traded at a larger discount was during the Great Financial Crisis. Currently, it is trading close to the same discount it traded at during the early days of the global pandemic.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/5/6/saupload_d7efb432f858eea1f1db8f18e5db1860.png" alt="Chart" class="sa-ycharts-img" data-width="635" data-height="366" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Data by <a href="https://ycharts.com" rel="nofollow">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Historically, buying HQH at a discount greater than 10% has worked out extremely well for investors.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The best part is that HQH pays a variable distribution based on 2.5% of NAV each quarter. So, while we pay the discounted market price, we receive our distribution based on NAV.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The healthcare sector is facing challenges, but it has successfully faced challenges in the past. Healthcare will forever be a highly politicized sector, and companies that operate in it will always face challenges keeping up with regulations. This is because it is very important to people.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As income investors, we want to own companies that produce things people use every day. With HQH, we gain access to companies that produce drugs and treatments that are essential for people to continue living. We are gaining exposure to a sector that will always have very strong demand. When the market lets us buy it at a huge discount, we are happy to seize the opportunity.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Pick #2: THQ - Yield 10.8%</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>abrdn Healthcare Opportunities Fund</strong> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/THQ" title="abrdn Healthcare Opportunities Fund">THQ</a>) is a CEF holding some of the largest and most prominent U.S.-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. <em><a href="https://www.abrdnthq.com/docs?editionid=45c8ccc0-6312-4224-82cc-b0af00e742c8" rel="nofollow noopener">Source</a></em></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/4/27/16392-17142138469994295.png" alt="Table" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"></picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption">THQ Fact Sheet</p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>THQ</strong> is actively managed, so fund managers will look to make portfolio changes to orient the fund to the best-performing picks. Consider a few of the CEF's top holdings, notably Eli Lilly (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY" title="Eli Lilly and Company">LLY</a>) which has appreciated by nearly 300% in price over the past three years, while Merck (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRK" title="Merck &amp; Co., Inc.">MRK</a>) has risen nearly 70%. AbbVie's (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABBV" title="AbbVie Inc.">ABBV</a>), blockbuster drug Humira (used to treat certain types of arthritis or inflammation-related disease) has enjoyed patent exclusivity for years. Even with the introduction of biosimilars into the market several months ago, the biopharma giant continues to uphold <a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/abbvie-s-humira-has-lost-only-4-percent-of-market-share-to-biosimilars-report/#:~:text=As%20of%20February%202024%2C%20Humira,%25%2C%20according%20to%20Samsung%20Bioepis.https://www.biospace.com/article/abbvie-s-humira-has-lost-only-4-percent-of-market-share-to-biosimilars-report/#:~:text=As%20of%20February%202024%2C%20Humira,%25%2C%20according%20to%20Samsung%20Bioepis." rel="nofollow noopener noopener noopener">an impressive 96% market share</a>. This achievement underscores the potency of drug patent exclusivity and the enduring value of brand recognition.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In February, THQ's monthly distribution was raised by 60% to $0.18/share, which calculates to a 10.8% yield.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Consider the valuation of abrdn World Healthcare Fund (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/THW" title="abrdn World Healthcare Fund">THW</a>), another CEF from the same management sporting a high yield. THQ has always traded at a rich premium. Given THQ's distribution raise, the yields of both these CEFs match, and THQ still trades at a deep discount.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/5/6/saupload_c8fe8dc352fe1d6fdca0a9d0fc926c84.png" alt="Chart" class="sa-ycharts-img" data-width="635" data-height="366" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Data by <a href="https://ycharts.com" rel="nofollow">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This makes THQ an excellent bargain for solid total returns.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Conclusion</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">From aspirin to emergency rooms, from retirement homes to convalescent care, healthcare is a wide-reaching sector. It covers everything from your local hospital to mega pharmaceutical corporations that are researching the next drug or treatment to try and improve our lives while boosting their profits. It can be difficult to try to pick the next big winner in new innovations. It is also a sector that is usually low on dividends and high on capital gains. It also can feel a little bit like playing roulette at a casino, hoping to pick the number where the ball will land. This is why I like to utilize the expertise of skilled portfolio managers to enjoy strong income from this critical sector, allowing them to do the research and due diligence and make the right investment decisions. I like to be able to sit back and collect the income that pours into my account from the diligent hard work of others.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">When it comes to retirement, you don't want to be working; you want to be enjoying your free time and pursuing new hobbies or spending time with loved ones. For many, investing can be a wonderful hobby, but it shouldn't become a full-time job. This is why having an income portfolio that pays you regularly regardless of what the market is doing is essential. Today, we discussed two funds that leverage the skill of experienced portfolio managers to allow you to have more free time as well as a solid income stream. Put your money to work. Don't let it sit idle and lazy in your portfolio. Your future will thank you for it.</p> <p class="before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That's the beauty of my Income Method.

            But carbon removal technologies such as DAC are still controversial. They have been criticized as expensive, energy-hungry and unproven at scale. Some climate advocates are also concerned they could distract from policies to cut fossil fuels.

            This technology “is fraught with uncertainties and ecological risks,” said Lili Fuhr, director of the fossil economy program at the Center for International Environmental Law, speaking about carbon capture generally.

            Climeworks started building Mammoth in June 2022, and the company says it is the world’s largest such plant. It has a modular design with space for 72 “<a href="https://climeworks.com/news/climeworks-mammoth-construction-update-mar23" target="_blank">collector containers</a>” — the vacuum<strong> </strong>parts of the machine that capture carbon from the air — which can be stacked on top of each other and moved around easily. There are currently 12 of these in place with more due to be added over the next few months.

            Mammoth will be able to pull 36,000 tons of carbon from the atmosphere<strong> </strong>a year<strong> </strong>at full capacity, according to Climeworks. That’s equivalent to taking around 7,800 gas-powered cars off the road for a year.

            Climeworks did not give an exact cost for each ton of carbon removed, but said it was closer to $1,000 a ton than $100 a ton – the latter of which is widely seen as a key threshold for making the technology affordable and viable.

            As the company scales up the size of its plants and bring costs down, the aim is to reach $300 to $350 a ton by 2030 before hitting $100 a ton around 2050, said Jan Wurzbacher, co-founder and co-CEO of Climeworks, on a call with reporters.

            There are already much bigger DAC plants in the works from other companies.

            But there may be a catch. Occidental says the captured carbon will be stored in rock deep underground, but its website also refers to the <a href="https://www.oxy.com/operations/performance-production/eor/" target="_blank">company’s use of captured carbon</a> in a process called “enhanced oil recovery.” This involves pushing carbon into wells to force out the hard-to-reach remnants of oil — allowing fossil fuel companies to extract even more from aging oil fields.

<p></p><p>Of the types of clean energy generated last year, hydroelectric dams produced the most. That’s the same as in most years.

<p></p><p>People used more electricity than ever last year, about 2% more, an increase of about as much as Canada uses in a year. Some of this new demand was for <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/heat-pump-apartments-energy-climate-carbon-emissions-13d77974c10496fc7b2f9245c5084daf">heat pumps</a></span>, which are an efficient way to both heat and cool buildings, and for <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/japan-nissan-evs-solid-state-battery-f22e11fd26c1c4533d798644fbf06163">electric vehicles</a></span>. It was also for electrolyzers, special machines used to get <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/green-hydrogen-g20-climate-change-renewable-energy-energy-transition-90271d6c410f16d9a0dace48d13449ee">hydrogen</a></span> out of water, for energy. These are all technologies that provide solutions to climate change. </p>
    

<p></p><p>Other increased demand was for electricity to feed new data centers and for air conditioning as places around the world become hotter. </p>
    
<p></p><p> Solar made up the biggest share of new clean energy last year. More than twice as much solar power was added as coal power. It was the 19th year in a row that solar was the fastest-growing source of electricity generation. A surge in solar installations happened at the end of the year and the report predicts 2024 will see an even larger jump.</p>
    

    
<p></p><p>China added more renewable energy than any other country last year — 51% of the new solar power and 60% of the new wind power globally. China, the European Union, the United States and Brazil together accounted for 81% of new solar generation in 2023. </p>
    

<p></p><p>Yet China was also responsible for 55% of coal generation globally and 60% of China’s electricity generation came from coal. The <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/fossil-fuels/coal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Energy Agency</a></span> says coal is the most carbon-intensive of the fossil fuels. </p>



<p></p><p>Scientists say emissions from burning fuels like coal must ramp steeply down to protect Earth’s climate, yet there was an increase in electricity made from burning fossil fuels. China, India, Vietnam and Mexico were responsible for nearly all of the rise. </p><p></p><p>The report said some countries burned coal to make up for the loss of hydroelectric power they experienced when drought caused their reservoirs to dry up. This is an example of a vicious cycle — when climate change prompts the use of more of the substances that cause climate change in the first place.</p><p></p><p>Despite all the growth in clean energy, fossil fuels still made up the majority of global electricity generated last year, causing a 1% rise in global power sector emissions. Scientists say even if we slashed all greenhouse gas emissions today, the planet would continue to warm for years because of the amount of pollutants already added to the atmosphere.</p>
    
<p></p><p>Analysts expect the world to use even more electricity in 2024. But renewable energy generation is forecast to grow even faster. That could mean a 2% drop (333 terawatt-hours) in energy generated from fossil fuels.</p>

The Canadian e-commerce company said it expects second-quarter revenue to grow at a high-teens percentage rate year over year, which is in line with consensus estimates for growth of 19.5%, but still represents a slowdown from recent quarters. Shopify has posted year-over-year revenue growth in the low-to-mid 20s for the past six quarters.</p><p>On a conference call with analysts, Shopify executives said consumer spending in the U.S. remains strong, but “we have factored in headwinds related to [foreign exchange] from the strong U.S. dollar and some softness in European consumer spending in our Q2 outlook.”</p><p>Gross margins for the second quarter are expected to decrease by about 50 basis points compared with the first quarter, as a result of the sale of Shopify’s logistics business to freight forwarder Flexport <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/04/shopify-offloads-logistics-business-to-flexport.html">last May</a>. Meanwhile, Shopify said it expects operating expenses to increase in the low- to mid-single digits quarter over quarter, while Wall Street had projected flat growth.</p><p>Baird analysts said in a note to clients Wednesday morning that the higher operating expense guide clouded “an otherwise solid Q1 report as the company is probably leaning into marketing and R&amp;D (AI/GenAI) investments.”</p><p>Shopify, which makes tools for companies to sell products online, in recent quarters has stepped up its artificial intelligence features for businesses, including “Shopify Magic,” which can automatically generate listings and edit images, among other things.

<li>China's Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) Composite Index has rallied by about 19% from its lows in 2024, reaching its highest level since September 2023.</li>
<li>The economic recovery in China has accelerated, with the country's economy expanding by 5.3% in the first quarter year-over-year, exceeding expectations and previous quarter's growth rate.</li>

    <div><div class="body__inner-container"><p>White-collar workers are so overwhelmed with emails, web chats, and meetings that they are using AI tools to get their jobs done—even if their companies haven’t trained them to do so, according to a work trends index published Wednesday by Microsoft and LinkedIn.</p><p class="paywall">Seventy-five percent of people in desk jobs are already using AI at work, and the amount of people using AI has nearly doubled over the past six months, the report found. The vast majority of workers using AI—regardless of whether they are baby boomers or Gen Z—are “bringing their own AI tools” rather than waiting for their companies to guide them.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p><p class="paywall">“People are overwhelmed with digital debt and under duress at work,” Colette Stallbaumer, general manager of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-windows-11-copilot-generative-ai-assistant-tips/">Microsoft’s chatbot Copilot</a> and cofounder of Workload, said in a video announcing the report’s results. “And they are turning to AI for relief.” Microsoft (which also owns LinkedIn) stands to win from the adoption of AI, and is already <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-google-earnings-generative-ai/">cashing in</a> on its generative AI tools.</p><p class="paywall">The new report is built on a survey of 31,000 people who work desk jobs across 31 countries, labor and hiring trends found in LinkedIn data, data from Microsoft 365, and research from Fortune 500 companies. It’s a look at how generative AI has affected the workplace since tools like ChatGPT became available in late 2022. While the rapid adoption of AI struck fears that it would <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-impact-on-work-mary-daly-interview/#:~:text=Some%20businesses%20are%20replacing%20people,impact%20on%20labor%20is%20murky.&amp;text=Forget%20artificial%20intelligence%20breaking%20free,and%20taking%20over%20the%20world.">replace jobs</a>, the report paints a different picture: of overburdened workers seeking their own solutions, and of managers eager to hire people who have skills utilizing AI—even as companies themselves are lagging in training workers how to use it.</p><p class="paywall">The report offers a bleak look at worker overload: Nearly 70 percent of people surveyed said they struggle with the pace and volume of their work, and nearly half feel burned out. Those using Microsoft 365 spend the majority of their workday communicating with other people in their company, and less time working in Word and PowerPoint—a larger problem that some <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/taking-baby-steps-toward-the-ai-meeting-singularity/">AI tools seek to solve</a>. The report also found that 46 percent of people want to quit their jobs this year. Conversely, they may need AI skills to get hired elsewhere.</p><p class="paywall">“It’s a hot skill set,” says Julie Schweber, senior HR knowledge adviser with the Society for Human Resource Management, who notes that some hiring managers are giving a leg up to job seekers with AI experience and skills. “We all know it’s coming. It’s going to impact everything in the workplace.”</p><p class="paywall">While the report shows AI use is picking up rapidly among office workers, its wider adoption may be slower. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SR_24.03.26_chat-bot_topline.pdf">Pew survey</a> earlier this year found that just 20 percent of US adults have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-proof-the-ai-boom-is-people-tapping-chatgpt-at-work/">used ChatGPT for work</a>, although that number had jumped from 12 percent of people in mid-2023.</p><p data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-1 viewport-monitor-anchor" data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click='{"pattern":"InlineRecirc"}' data-in-view='{"pattern":"InlineRecirc"}' data-include-experiments="true"></p><p class="paywall">Alongside the report, Microsoft also announced advances to its Copilot tool, including an autocomplete function that is meant to help people prompt the chatbot to receive better output. It also has a rewrite feature that will add context to simple prompts, and a “catch up” chat interface, which sends personalized reminders, like a notification of an upcoming meeting along with information people can use to prepare.</p></div></div>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>By Nick Carey and Christina Amann</p><p>LONDON/BERLIN (Reuters) -Top executives at BMW and Volkswagen on Wednesday warned against imposing EU import duties on electric vehicles from Chinese automakers, saying it could upend the bloc's Green Deal plan and harm automakers that import cars made in China.</p><p>The European Commission, which oversees trade policy in the 27-nation European Union, launched an investigation in October into whether fully-electric cars manufactured in China were receiving distortive subsidies and warranted extra tariffs.</p><p>"You could very quickly shoot yourself in the foot," BMW CEO Oliver Zipse told reporters after the German premium automaker reported quarterly results.</p><p>BMW imports Chinese-made Mini EVs and the iX3 into Europe.</p><p>Like its German rivals Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, BMW is heavily reliant on revenues from its Chinese business.</p><p>China is BMW's second-largest market after Europe, accounting for nearly 32% of sales in the first quarter.</p><p>"We don't think that our industry needs protection," Zipse told analysts on Wednesday, adding that operating on a global basis gives major automakers an industrial advantage. "You can easily endanger that advantage by introducing import tariffs."</p><p>Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker which also heavily relies on China, warned that potential duties generally carried a certain risk.</p><p>"There's always some sort of retaliation," Thomas Schaefer, CEO of the Volkswagen brand, told the FT's Future of the Car Summit.</p><p>In March, the Commission started customs registration of Chinese EV imports, meaning they could be hit by tariffs from that point if the trade investigation concludes they are receiving unfair subsidies.</p><p>The probe is due to conclude by November, but the EU could impose provisional duties in July. Brussels should publish a summary of proposed provisional duties by June 5 and these duties would be imposed by July 4.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in Berlin on Wednesday that Europe needed to take steps to prevent China from flooding the bloc's market with subsidised electric vehicles.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron and Von der Leyen urged Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday to ensure</p><p>more balanced trade with Europe.</p><p>Zipse told analysts that BMW and other automakers have "bilateral dependencies not only on the final product, but on the component side and raw material side."</p><p>Imposing duties could backfire as new EU CO2 emission standards that will require more EVs - that are reliant on Chinese battery materials - kick in next year.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="12" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>"There will be no single car in the EU without components from China," Zipse said.</p><p>He said that imposing tariffs would undo the EU's industrial plan to ensure the bloc is a frontrunner in cutting carbon emissions and developing the technology required to do so.</p><p>"There is no Green Deal in Europe without resources from China," Zipse said.</p><p>(Additional reporting by Philip Blenkinsop.
