The rate was 8% in patients treated with a standard drug, the trial found.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The results are the longest progression-free survival (PFS) outcomes ever recorded in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the world’s most common form of the disease. They were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Asco) in Chicago on Friday.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“To our knowledge these results are unprecedented,” said the study’s lead author, Dr Benjamin Solomon, a medical oncologist at the Peter MacCallum <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Cancer</a> Centre in Melbourne, Australia.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">In the phase 3 trial, 296 patients with advanced forms of non-small cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to receive either lorlatinib (149 patients) or crizotinib (147 patients, of whom 142 ultimately received treatment).</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Just over half of the patients were women. In about 25% of them their lung cancer had already spread to the brain when the study began.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The participants all had ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. Lorlatinib and crizotinib are both ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). ALK TKIs are targeted treatments that bind to the ALK protein found in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer and stop the growth of tumour cells.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Despite significant advancements with newer generation ALK TKIs, the majority of patients treated with second-generation ALK TKIs will have progression of their disease within three years,” said Solomon.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Lorlatinib is the only ALK TKI that has reported five-year progression-free survival, and even after this time, the majority of patients continue to have their disease controlled, including control of disease in the brain.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The five-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 60% in patients who took lorlatinib and 8% in the crizotinib group.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“You don’t need a magnifying glass to see the difference between these two drugs,” said Dr Julie Gralow, Asco’s chief medical officer. “Sixty per cent five-year progression-free survival in non-small cell lung cancer is just unheard of.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Dr David Spigel, the chief scientific officer of the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in London, a world-leading clinical trials facility specialising in new therapies for cancer patients, welcomed the findings. “These long-term data results are off the chart,” he said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Most of the patients experienced some side-effects. Treatment-related issues occurred in 77% of patients on lorlatinib and in 57% of patients on crizotinib. The most common side-effects reported in the trial that was funded by Pfizer were swelling, high cholesterol and elevated lipid levels.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Cancer Research UK’s chief clinician, Prof Charles Swanton, who was not involved with the study, said the “groundbreaking” results would offer fresh hope for patients with advanced lung cancer.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Despite progress in our understanding of the disease, it can be incredibly challenging to control cancers that have spread and there are limited treatment options for lung cancer,” he said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Showcasing the power of cancer-growth blocker drugs, this study could present us with an effective way of stopping cancer in its tracks and preventing it from spreading to the brain.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“The groundbreaking results show that over half of the patients who took lorlatinib did not suffer a progression in their disease after five years. In contrast, over half of the patients who took crizotinib experienced disease progression after just nine months.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Research like this is vital to find new ways to treat lung cancer and help more people survive for longer.”</p></div></div>

After all, the Wagoneer S, with its premium materials, high-tech components, and impressive performance capabilities, is very much not an affordable EV. The fully loaded First Launch edition will start at $71,995 — not exactly a price meant to spur mass adoption. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Still, Filosa says Jeep will rise to the challenge. But how long will it take? Timing is of the essence. EV sales are still growing but at a slower pace than previous years. Buyers are more discerning. They’re looking for vehicles that are fast charging with plenty of range but also priced in a way that’s affordable. Most experts have said a $25,000 EV could help that line graph turn from a gentle slope into a hockey stick. But when it comes to exact timetables, only Tavares seems to know for now. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component clear-both block md:float-left md:mr-30 md:w-[320px] lg:-ml-100"><div class="duet--article--article-pullquote mb-20"><p class="mb-10 h-[22px] w-[65px] bg-franklin"></p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup relative bg-repeating-lines-dark bg-[length:1px_1.2em] pb-8 font-polysans text-28 font-medium leading-120 tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20  dark:bg-repeating-lines-light dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple">“It’s a big challenge.

After that, a third unnamed vehicle will be announced the following year — though Filosa wouldn’t say whether it would be a battery-electric vehicle, plug-in hybrid, or perhaps both. “It will be affordable,” Filosa said, calling it “a smaller Jeep,” but likely not the $25,000 model referenced by Tavares.  </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Battery-electric vehicles represent a significant shift for Jeep, which has largely been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/5/23669768/jeep-wrangler-4xe-plug-in-hybrid-2024-photos-specs">focused on plug-in hybrid vehicles</a> in the US.

Shares dropped more than 2% on Friday despite the warehouse retailer’s after-the-bell quarterly beats on earnings and revenue. The stock closed Thursday’s regular session at a record high of just over $815. In 2024, Costco has gained 20% — more than double the S &amp; P 500 ’s advance and well above the 6% increase in the consumer staples sector over the same stretch. “If you’re disappointed, go to another stock,” Jim Cramer said during Friday’s Investing Club’s Morning Meeting . Jim said investors should not be concerned about the pullback because the stock often drops the day after earnings. “There’s nothing wrong with Costco whatsoever. It was a perfect quarter.” COST 1Y mountain COST 1-year stock performance. In addition to exceeding estimates on the top and bottom lines in its fiscal 2024 third quarter, Costco turned in a better-than-expected 6.5% comparable sales increase. Gross margins of 10.84% slightly missed the mark but still increased 52 basis points, or 0.52 percentage points, on a reported basis and 54 basis points excluding gas inflation. An area of growth discussed on the post-earnings conference call was e-commerce business. CEO Ron Vachris and CFO Gary Millerchip — both new to their respective positions — highlighted the need to invest in technology and alternative revenue streams, including digital advertising to monetize online traffic like Amazon and Walmart have done. Millerchip was CFO at Kroger before joining Costco in March. Vachris, who has spent the past 40 years in various roles at Costco, assumed the CEO post in January. In fiscal Q3, e-commerce sales grew 20.7% year-over-year driven by appliances, precious metals like gold and silver, and gift cards. This strength shows “COST is taking share in these areas online due to increased marketing and improved delivery with their Costco Logistics integration,” D.A. Davidson said in a research note Thursday. Warehouse store expansion in the U.S. and international markets is another growth opportunity for Costco. For the rest of fiscal year 2024, management said they plan to open 12 new locations – nine in the U.S., two in Japan, and one in Korea. Altogether that would be 28 new locations this fiscal year. Millerchip said he anticipates, somewhere between 25 to 30 new warehouses per year long-term. Store traffic during the quarter grew both globally and in the U.S. — up 6.1% and 5.5%, respectively. That was stronger than growth in the prior quarter. Redburn said in a Friday note that new warehouse growth internationally is where most of Costco’s markets are “still meaningfully underpenetrated” and added the strength of existing warehouses is “the main driver of membership growth.” Back in January, as longtime CFO Rich Galanti was getting ready to retire, he said that China holds “very good potential” for Costco. Another major catalyst Wall Street and investors like us are anticipating is a Costco membership fee increase. Even though we didn’t get an update on the potential for a fee increase this quarter, it’s still on the table, and we think it’s a matter of when, not if that will happen. A membership fee hike is historically overdue, but the company has said it does not want to exacerbate the elevated inflation environment by saddling customers with higher costs. Following the Costco earnings, we increased our price target on the stock to $875 per share from $800, while maintaining our 2 rating — meaning we view further pullbacks as buying opportunities.

  <p>Although that might seem like a minor aside for a global retail chain valued at $354 billion, Costco's low-cost dog has become an emblem of the company's commitment to delivering value. In short, it's great marketing.

portfolio.</p><p>And the productivity that we're driving is obviously the metrics that we're enjoying right now.</p><p>But we've got a lot of work to do.</p><p>You know, we're, we're very pleased we're taking a very quick victory lap but it's not a sprint.</p><p>It's a marathon for on what the signal is about the state of retail.</p><p>We want to bring in Dana Telsey Tea Advisory Group, CEO and Chief research Officer Dana.</p><p>It's great to see you.</p><p>So let's start with gap and then we can talk about where, what, what we're seeing elsewhere, uh industry, why?</p><p>But when it comes to gap's results last night, what do you think of what Dixon just had to say just in terms of they're not out of the woods just yet they have more work to do, but it does seem like their product is resonating a bit better here with the consumer.</p><p>I agree with what he had to say.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>It, it is a marathon, it's not a sprint.</p><p>I think there has been improvement.</p><p>The gap brand and certainly the marketing behind it with Gaps Linen moves has drawn appeal.</p><p>Now you have a collaboration with Doen.</p><p>I think the Banana Republic brand is still a ways away from showing consistent improvement given there's still search for a new leader there.</p><p>It was good to see that the core bottoms improved at Athleta, but it did take promotions in order to move that and always under the hood at Gap with expenses and mar margin management, they've done a good job.</p><p>Consistency of sales and acceleration is what the Wall Street's going to be looking at into the future for Gap.</p><p>I'm curious what you think was the single biggest driver in getting shoppers in the door at gap.</p><p>We are seen some reporting that the celebrity endorsements were part of what drove some of the traffic into stores to what extent do you think that that is a gap specific story or is that something that is a successful move across multiple retailers?</p><p>This cycle, one of the interesting things that we're seeing coming out of first quarter earnings so far is where the product is new, where there is innovation behind it, where this compelling marketing, it's resonating and yes, it was a gap brand.</p><p>But take a look at Birkenstock, take a look at Abercrombie and Fitch.</p><p>Take a look at Ralph Lauren and Deckers.</p><p>All were able to drive sales increases because of new marketing muscles put behind the product and the value pricing that some of the these products have with it because consumers today still remain what I call squishy.</p><p>They're being very cautious in where they decide to spend their dollars.</p><p>So then Dana, what does that tell us about the winners and losers to come here within the retail sector?</p><p>Will we see a further divide just in terms of the retailers that are working, that are resonating, that are doing the right thing here in terms of winning that consumer spending dollar versus those who continue to lag behind.</p><p>Yes, you you will.</p><p>I mean, overall the products gotta be worthy that the consumer deems valuable in order to add and take dollars out of their wallet.</p><p>So it's gonna be very interesting given some of the next names that are coming up.</p><p>I mean, next week you have Lululemon, you have PV H. We know there's been a lot of brand heat around what PV H is doing with the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brand.</p><p>We're gonna hear from Lulu what they are seeing in their business given every, all our checks in the stores that I've done lately.</p><p>We are seeing color, you are seeing more smaller sizes and one of the things we've heard is active continues to do well.</p><p>And so, Lulu obviously at the forefront of active after calling out that the consumer was more sluggish going into the first quarter.</p><p>It's gonna be interesting to see the rates of growth that are, that are reported next week.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Former President Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social, owned by Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (DJT), saw its shares rise 6% after Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records intended to influence the 2016 presidential campaign.</li>
<li>Trump Media went public on the Nasdaq after merging with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. and has since fallen about 10% since its public debut at the end of March.</li>
<li>Trump founded Truth Social after being kicked off major social media apps like Facebook and Twitter following the January 6, 2021 Capitol riots, and has since been reinstated on those platforms.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Most Master's Degrees Do Not Pay Off</strong>: According to a study by the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, nearly half (43%) of Master's degree programs actually leave students financially worse off, with the median ROI (return on investment) of all Master's degrees being around $50,000.</li>
<li><strong>Bachelor's Degrees Outperform Master's</strong>: In contrast, Bachelor's degree programs have a median ROI of $160,000, with some fields like engineering, computer science, nursing, and economics yielding a payoff of $500,000 or more.</li>
<li><strong>MBA's Have a Poor Payoff</strong>: The study found that even the MBA, one of America's most popular Master's degrees, frequently has a low or negative payoff, with the median ROI for MBA's being around $101,000.</li>
<li><strong>Tech and Business Fields Are Best for Boosting Earnings</strong>: The study suggests that students who want to increase their earnings potential should consider studying tech or business fields, with a Master's degree in computer and information sciences yielding a starting salary of around $105,894.</li>
<li><strong>Not All Majors are Created Equal</strong>: The article highlights that not all majors are created equal, with some fields like drama and art having a lower ROI compared to fields like engineering and computer science.</li>

<p>Quite the opposite: According to <a href="https://freopp.org/does-college-pay-off-a-comprehensive-return-on-investment-analysis-563b9cb6ddc5" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://freopp.org/does-college-pay-off-a-comprehensive-return-on-investment-analysis-563b9cb6ddc5" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">new research</a>, nearly half of master’s degree programs actually leave students financially worse off.</p>



<p>While 23% of bachelor’s programs yield a negative financial return on investment, this nearly doubles to 43% for master’s degrees, according to the study by the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity.</p>



<p>“Even the MBA, one of America’s most popular master’s degrees, frequently has a low or negative payoff,” the report warned. </p>



<p>FREOPP used the Department of Education’s College Scorecard and Census Bureau earnings data to estimate ROI for over 53,000 degrees and certificate programs—and found that all sectors of higher education contain negative ROI programs. </p><p></p>



<p>However, master’s degrees are the worst performers due to their high fees, time spent out of the workforce, and often modest earnings.</p>



<p>The median ROI—defined as the lifetime earnings a student can expect when they enroll in a degree program minus their cost of attendance and earnings lost while enrolled—for all master’s degrees is around $50,000. </p>



<p>For those with an MBA, this rises to $101,000. But in comparison, bachelor’s degree programs have a median ROI of $160,000—and that’s including those who take drama and art.</p>



<p>Bachelor’s degrees in engineering, computer science, nursing, and economics tend to have a payoff of $500,000 or more.</p>



<p>“One reason for this poor performance is that MBA students typically have high preexisting earnings potential, having often chosen high-ROI undergraduate majors such as finance and economics, so the MBA adds little value on top of that,” the research explains. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Want a six-figure job? Get a master’s degree in computer and information sciences </h2>



<p>That being said, Gen Zers who are still hell-bent on one-upping graduates with more qualifications to their name should look at studying tech or business fields if they actually want to up their earning potential. </p><p></p>



<p>Really, the only subject that may result in a six-figure starting salary is computer and information sciences.</p>



<p>The National Association of Colleges and Employers analyzed the starting salaries for the class of 2022 and found that those who had a master’s degree in computer and information sciences enjoyed an average starting salary of <a href="https://naceweb.org/job-market/compensation/00cf3736-e2f0-4b98-80f4-cec5332eac56" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://naceweb.org/job-market/compensation/00cf3736-e2f0-4b98-80f4-cec5332eac56" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">$105,894. </a></p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>In comparison, those with a bachelor’s degree in the same field earned around $20,000 less. </p>



<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of the top 10 master’s degrees with the highest average starting salaries are in STEM fields. </p>



<p>Those who graduated with a Master of Engineering earned an average starting salary of around $98,040.</p><p></p>



<p>Meanwhile, those with a master’s degree in mathematics and statistics walked into jobs paying upwards of $83,000. However, even those with a mathematics and statistics bachelor’s degree secured positions with salaries over $76,000.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The 10 master’s degrees with the highest average starting salaries</h2>



<p>1. Computer and information sciences: $105,890<br>2. Engineering: $98,040<br>3. Engineering technologies and related fields: $90,610<br>4.

<ol>
<li><strong>Skydance Media has made a revised offer to acquire Paramount Global</strong>: The revised offer reduces the amount Skydance and its partners would pay to Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder, and instead allocates more funds to non-voting Class B shareholders.</li>
<li><strong>The revised offer includes additional upfront cash</strong>: Skydance will put in more cash upfront to swing the deal, according to sources.</li>
<li><strong>The deal still involves an all-stock merger with Paramount Global</strong>: The agreement would value Skydance at around $5 billion and would not affect Paramount Global's publicly traded status.</li>
<li><strong>Redstone would sell her stake in National Amusements Inc. to Skydance</strong>: Redstone's 77% stake in National Amusements, which holds voting shares in Paramount Global, would be sold to Skydance.</li>
<li><strong>Sony Pictures and Apollo Global Management had previously considered bidding on Paramount Global</strong>: However, they have since backed away from their $26 billion all-cash offer to buy the entire company.</li>

	After months of on-again-off-again haggling, <a href="https://variety.com/t/skydance-media/" id="auto-tag_skydance-media" data-tag="skydance-media">Skydance Media</a> submitted a newly revised offer for <a href="https://variety.com/t/paramount-global/" id="auto-tag_paramount-global" data-tag="paramount-global">Paramount Global</a>. The revised bid would reduce the amount Skydance and its financial partners would pay Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, and reallocate that more equitably to the company’s nonvoting Class B shareholders, <em>Variety</em> has confirmed. Skydance would also put in more cash upfront to swing the deal, sources said.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The special committee established by Paramount’s board is currently reviewing Skydance’s revised proposal, sources said. Reps for Skydance and Paramount Global declined to comment. Reps for NAI and the Paramount board’s special committee did not respond to requests for comment. Skydance’s sweetened offer for Paramount was first <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/skydance-sweetens-merger-offer-for-paramount-31ff433c" target="_blank">reported</a> by the Wall Street Journal.

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The broad outlines remain the same on the offer from Skydance, headed by producer David Ellison, and financial backers RedBird Capital Partners and KKR. Redstone would sell her stake in National Amusements Inc., which holds 77% of the voting shares in Paramount Global, to Skydance, whereupon Skydance would merge with Paramount Global in an all-stock deal that would value Skydance at around $5 billion. Paramount Global would remain a publicly traded company. 


</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Under the previous Skydance offer, Redstone was to have received up to $2 billion for her NAI stake while Skydance was to provide an additional $3 billion cash infusion to the company. Sources did not have details on how much additional upfront cash Skydance is willing to commit or how much of the capital would be reallocated to Paramount Global’s Class B shareholders under the revised offer.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Meanwhile, Sony Pictures and private-equity giant Apollo Global Management <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/sony-apollo-paramount-global-acquisition-offer-cash-1235981220/">emerged as prospective bidders for Paramount Global</a> but have since backed off their $26 billion all-cash offer to buy the entire company, the New York Times <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/business/paramount-sony-apollo-assets.html" target="_blank">reported</a>.

<p>TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:</p>



<p>I am returning herewith without my approval H.J.Res. 109, a resolution that would disapprove of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121).</p>



<p>SAB 121 reflects considered technical SEC staff views regarding the accounting obligations of certain firms that safeguard crypto-assets.  By virtue of invoking the Congressional Review Act, this Republican-led resolution would inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to set forth appropriate guardrails and address future issues.  This reversal of the considered judgment of SEC staff in this way risks undercutting the SEC’s broader authorities regarding accounting practices.  My Administration will not support measures that jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors.  Appropriate guardrails that protect consumers and investors are necessary to harness the potential benefits and opportunities of crypto-asset innovation.  My Administration is eager to work with the Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities, which will promote the responsible development of digital assets and payment innovation and help reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system.</p>



<p>Therefore, I am vetoing this resolution.</p>



<p>                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>



<p>THE WHITE HOUSE,</p>
