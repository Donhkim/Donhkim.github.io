    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Shift in the housing market</strong>: According to Compass cofounder and CEO Robert Reffkin, the US housing market is now favoring buyers, as they are pushing back against high home prices and sellers are having to lower their asking prices.</li>
<li><strong>Price drops</strong>: Reffkin stated that 30% of the inventory on the market has seen a price drop, which is the highest rate in 10 years, and 16% more inventory is available, making it a more buyer-friendly market.</li>
<li><strong>Regional variability</strong>: The market is exhibiting different trends regionally, with the South, particularly Florida, being hit by a surge in home insurance costs, which have increased 40% year-over-year, affecting asking prices.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on sellers</strong>: Reffkin warned that sellers need to be aware of the shift and price their homes competitively to attract buyers, as overpriced homes will sit on the market and potentially suffer further price drops.</li>
<li><strong>High-end buyers bolstered</strong>: Wealthy buyers investing in the stock market are less concerned about mortgage rates and can afford higher prices, making them less price-sensitive and more likely to drive demand in the high-end housing market.</li>

    <div><p>The U.S. housing market is now tilting in favor of buyers, who are pushing back against the high home prices that sellers are demanding, according to <a href="https://fortune.com/company/compass/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/compass/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Compass</a> cofounder and CEO Robert Reffkin.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>He told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/22/compass-ceo-robert-reffkin-on-housing-market-we-are-now-seeing-more-sellers-than-buyers.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/22/compass-ceo-robert-reffkin-on-housing-market-we-are-now-seeing-more-sellers-than-buyers.html" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/22/compass-ceo-robert-reffkin-on-housing-market-we-are-now-seeing-more-sellers-than-buyers.html" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">CNBC on Wednesday</a> that 30% of the inventory on the market has seen a price drop, which is more than anytime in last 10 years. Meanwhile, the market has seen 16% more inventory.</p>



<p>“It is a different environment. We are now seeing more sellers than buyers,” he said.</p>



<p>Reffkin said there have been more price cuts in the South, which had seen steep increases earlier as Americans left more expensive states during the pandemic.</p>



<p>Florida’s housing market has also been hit by a spike in home insurances costs, which have soared 40% year over year and are weighing on asking prices, he explained.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“Sellers bringing their homes on the market during this period need to be aware of how buyers are pushing back,” Reffkin said. “If your home is well priced in this environment, it will sell quickly. But if it’s not, it will sit on the market. Then you’re going to have to have a price drop. Then buyers will see they get a price drop. The sharks come out, and it will hurt you even more.”</p>



<p>Buyers at the high end of the housing market have also been bolstered by recent stock market gains, he told CNBC.</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>While the surge in mortgage rates earlier this year combined with high home prices to further erode affordability, that’s less of a concern for buyers enjoying the wealth effect from their investments.</p>



<p>“You don’t need lower mortgage rates if your stock portfolio is at an all-time high,” Reffkin said.</p>



<p>His comments follow a report released earlier this month that showed <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/16/housing-market-outlook-texas-and-florida-are-now-buyers-markets-heres-why-it-could-be-time-to-move-to-the-south/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/16/housing-market-outlook-texas-and-florida-are-now-buyers-markets-heres-why-it-could-be-time-to-move-to-the-south/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/16/housing-market-outlook-texas-and-florida-are-now-buyers-markets-heres-why-it-could-be-time-to-move-to-the-south/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Texas and Florida</a> dominated the best places for buyers in <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/market-heat-index-april-2024-34052/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.zillow.com/research/market-heat-index-april-2024-34052/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Zillow’s new market heat index</a>, which takes into account the share of homes that have an accepted offer from a buyer within 21 days or fewer, the share of homes that have a price cut, and engagement with active listings on the website and app</p>



<p>“Would-be buyers who witnessed intense competition in sunny Texas and Florida markets earlier on in the pandemic aren’t seeing such a frenzy now,” according to <a href="https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Zillow</a>.</p>



<p>Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman has also sounded optimistic about the housing market in the latter half of 2024 after hitting “<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/23/housing-market-outlook-2024-top-real-estate-ceo-rock-bottom-improvement-high-home-prices-mortgage-rates-redfin/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/23/housing-market-outlook-2024-top-real-estate-ceo-rock-bottom-improvement-high-home-prices-mortgage-rates-redfin/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/23/housing-market-outlook-2024-top-real-estate-ceo-rock-bottom-improvement-high-home-prices-mortgage-rates-redfin/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">rock bottom</a>” in the first quarter.</p>



<p>But that outlook depends on rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, he cautioned, warning that sales could slow or even decline without any.</p>



<p>For now, he’s not ready to “have a party here and drink a bunch of champagne,” Kelman said. “It’s just a little bit better, it’s a little bit better—and that’s worth noting.”</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The authors of the article, Tasha and Helen, were members of the board of OpenAI, a company that aims to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of humanity.</li>
<li>Despite the company's innovative approach to self-governance, the authors believe that the pressure of profit incentives can undermine the public good and lead to irresponsible AI development.</li>
<li>OpenAI's unusual structure, which includes a non-profit subsidiary and a for-profit subsidiary, was intended to protect the company's mission and ensure responsible AI development.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the authors argue that OpenAI's self-governance model did not work as intended, and profitability pressures ultimately took precedence over the public good.</li>
<li>The authors conclude that governments must begin building effective regulatory frameworks now to ensure that the development and deployment of AI benefits everyone, not just the shareholders.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Slow progress on EV charging stations</strong>: Despite the Biden administration's goal to build half a million electric vehicle (EV) charging stations along U.S. highways by 2030, only eight have been built since President Biden signed the legislation two years ago.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges in building charging stations</strong>: Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg explained that building a charger is more complex than just plugging a device into the ground, requiring utility work and federal investment.</li>
<li><strong>Investment in EV charging programs</strong>: The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act allocate $7.5 billion for EV charging programs, with the goal of expanding the country's charging infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>American focus for EV revolution</strong>: Buttigieg emphasized that the Biden administration is focused on making sure the electric vehicle revolution is American-led.</li>
<li><strong>Limited adoption of EVs due to charging concerns</strong>: A separate report cited in the article suggests that many consumers are staying away from EVs due to a lack of charging availability, highlighting the need for continued investment in the country's charging infrastructure.</li>

<li>
<p>Off-price retailers like TJX Companies (T.J. Maxx) and Ross are still posting sales gains and taking market share from rivals, despite challenging conditions in the retail industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The growth of these retailers is not just due to consumers seeking value, but also due to persistent inflation and rising prices for essentials like food and gas, which are causing shoppers to trade up to department stores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Department stores like Macy's and Kohl's are benefiting from consumers seeking value and convenience, with discounters like TJ Maxx and Ross offering a more affordable and trendy shopping experience.</p>

<li>
<p>The off-price retailers have become cooler places to shop, particularly among younger consumers, who are attracted to the treasure hunt-like experience and the opportunity to discover unique and affordable products.</p>

<p>The success of off-price retailers like TJ Maxx and Ross is not limited to their value proposition, but also reflects a shift towards more experiential and entertaining retail experiences that prioritize discovery and surprise over traditional shopping experiences.</p>

But they’ve also become cooler places to shop, particularly among younger consumers, and their assortments have gotten better because brands increasingly view them as a growth channel as department stores <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/01/macys-store-closures-target-kohls-tjx-could-benefit.html#:~:text=Macy's%20is%20closing%20about%20150,to%20Jefferies%20and%20Earnest%20Analytics.">continue to shrink</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/20/macys-kohls-nordstrom-earnings-department-stores-younger-shoppers.html">lose share</a>. </p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>“They have trusted brands at a cheaper price. They’re more on-trend, they’re designer-led, they lean into categories that the customer is much more interested in,” said Jessica Ramirez, a senior research analyst with Jane Hali &amp; Associates. “In terms of categories that maybe are not resonating as well, they pull back from them and they have that ability because of their … strategy. A department store doesn’t have that.”</p><p>TJX and Ross both reported fiscal first quarter earnings last week that came in better than Wall Street expected, even as both companies lapped outsize growth from the prior-year period. </p><p>TJX, which runs brands like TJ Maxx, Marshalls and Homegoods, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/marshalls-owner-tjx-jumps-after-earnings-what-investors-love-about-the-report.html">saw sales grow 6%</a> to $12.48 billion, compared to estimates of $12.46 billion, according to LSEG. That’s on top of the 3% sales increase the retailer saw in the prior-year period. </p><p>Ross, which runs Ross Dress for Less and dd’s Discounts, posted an 8% jump in sales, bringing revenue to $4.86 billion, compared to estimates of $4.83 billion, according to LSEG. That’s on top of the 3.7% gain it posted in the prior-year period. </p><p>Both companies have grown substantially since 2019 and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/16/tjx-companies-tjx-earnings-q2-2024.html">posted banner results</a> throughout 2023.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p></div><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><div class="group"><p>The particularly strong performance last year led some Wall Street analysts to wonder if they’d be able to continue to grow sales up against tougher comparisons. They’ve managed to do just that – and the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/14/off-price-retail-keeps-taking-market-share-why-is-tjxs-stock-stuck.html">party isn’t expected to end</a> anytime soon. </p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline0"></a>Consumers are still prioritizing value </h2><div class="group"><p>As consumers contend with persistent inflation, rising debt and stubbornly high interest rates, they’ve been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/20/consumer-pullback-ceos.html">more selective about where they’re spending</a> their precious discretionary dollars. Value has been top of mind. </p><p>“We think that the off-price sector is still healthy and we think that results this quarter, both for [TJX] and Ross, are showing consistent traffic-driven comp increases, which indicate that the consumer is still looking for value and the consumer still finds off price’s business model of branded goods at value prices as an attractive buying opportunity,” Goldman Sachs analyst Brooke Roach told CNBC. She said she expects both companies to continue to grow this year, on top of the sales increases they saw last year.</p><p>The low-to-middle income consumer has been feeling the burn a bit more acutely than their higher income counterparts, but even shoppers with deeper wallets have been turning to discounters for not just necessities, but also discretionary items. </p><p>During a call with analysts on Wednesday morning, TJX’s finance chief John Klinger said the company is seeing comparable sales increase in areas where the average household income is both above and below $100,000 – a theme the retailer has seen consistently over the last year. </p><p>Ross’s Chief Operating Officer Michael Hartshorn said the company is also continuing to attract a broad array of consumers across a variety of income levels. </p><p>Even discounters like <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-11"><a href="/quotes/WMT/">Walmart</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> and <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-12"><a href="/quotes/DLTR/">Dollar Tree</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> are making gains with high-income consumers. On May 16, Walmart beat quarterly earnings and revenue expectations in part because of the work it’s done to win over <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/16/walmart-wmt-q1-2025-earnings-.html">more high-income shoppers</a>. Earlier this year, Dollar Tree said its fastest growing demographic makes more than $125,000 annually. </p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline1"></a>‘We’ve become a cooler place to shop’ </h2><div class="group"><p>The consumer’s flight to value has undoubtedly helped TJX and Ross boost sales over the last year, but both companies have steadily grown over time and tend to do well in any economic cycle. </p><p>“That’s because they’re providing consistent value to the consumer – and that’s branded consistent value to the consumer at a discount price,” said Roach. “So if you look, historically, in times of economic strength, these businesses were still market share gainers. We see no reason why that should change.” </p><p>Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst for BMO Capital Markets, said off-price has managed to grow steadily in part because consumers are starting to see the stores in a different light.</p><p>“We need to also recognize that [TJX] convinced shoppers that they were fashionistas, not penny pinchers, and I think that was a very powerful and probably healthy shift in mindset,” said Siegel. “They took something that was embarrassing and turned it into a badge of honor. They took a transaction, turned it into an experience. It was no longer find something and hide it and wear it as if you bought it full price. Instead it became acceptable and exciting.” </p><p>Siegel said the growth in off-price says just as much about consumer psyche and health as it does about this change in perception.</p><p>During TJX’s earnings call, CEO Ernie Herrman said the company has “become a cooler place to shop” and has made major inroads with the young Gen Z customer. </p><p>“We are the only retailer right now that I see that is able to take brands and fashion and quality and put all of that together in this treasure hunt format,” said Herrman. </p><p>The dynamic is a bit different at Ross, which has more exposure to the lower- and middle-income consumer than TJX does and competes more on price, said Siegel. During the first fiscal quarter, TJX’s growth was “entirely driven by customer transactions,” which means more people were shopping there. Ross cited higher average selling prices, offset by fewer units per transaction. </p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline2"></a>Brands’ best kept secret </h2><div class="group"><p>In the past, the off-price sector was seen as a place for brands to offload last season’s inventory, or items that didn’t pass quality control tests. These days, the chains have become a destination for companies looking to grow wholesale revenue, even if they’re not broadcasting it. </p><p>“Companies will continue to talk about [putting fewer of] their products<strong> </strong>in the off-price channel at the same time that they may very well be sending orders straight to them,” said Siegel.</p><p>The aisles at off-price retailers aren’t filled with private label junk, but instead, the kinds of household names that consumers know and love like <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-14"><a href="/quotes/NKE/">Nike</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span>, <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-15"><a href="/quotes/ADS-DE/">Adidas</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span>, Michael Kors and <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-16"><a href="/quotes/RL/">Ralph Lauren</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span>. </p><p>For a while, many of those big names tried to cut the number of items they were selling in the off-price channel — and through wholesalers overall — so they could grow sales in their <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/03/levi-strauss-levi-earnings-q1-2024.html#:~:text=The%20retailer%20now%20expects%20adjusted,of%20%241.21%2C%20according%20to%20LSEG.">own websites and stores</a>. But many brands are starting to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/12/nike-ceo-acknowledges-it-went-too-far-in-direct-push.html">retreat from that strategy</a> and are increasingly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/10/why-direct-to-consumer-darlings-casper-allbirds-peloton-now-struggle.html">seeing the value</a> that wholesale partners of all varieties can offer. </p><p>“If you’re a large brand, you’re watching department stores give up share and you realize that [direct-to-consumer] is no longer the Holy Grail that you thought it once was, there are shrinking places to sell a lot of units,” said Siegel. “And if you’re a large brand, you need to sell a lot of units.” </p><p>As brands have seen consumers change how they view off-price stores, they’re more willing to sell to chains like TJX and Ross, especially because they can do so “invisibly,” said Siegel. </p><p>Department stores like Macy’s, for example, have a massive online presence and regularly blast out promotions on name brand items, which can have a dilutive effect on brand equity. In comparison, the bulk of TJX’s and Ross’s business is done in stores, so the markdowns aren’t as obvious or visible. </p><p>“As off-price becomes a bigger part of the U.S. apparel ecosystem, we’ve seen that off-price has become more important to brands across the apparel and accessories sector,” said Roach. ”[TJX] specifically has talked about strengthening relationships and the ability to be better partners with those brands, and that they are an attractive partner because they are growing and those brands can grow with them.” </p><p>The CEOs of both TJX and Ross talked about their strong vendor relationships and how they’re getting access to better products at scale. </p><p>“At a high level, the merchants improved the value offerings that they had, whether it’s different assortments, broader assortments, better quality, better products. So I think we’ve taken our first step forward there,” said Ross CEO Barbara Rentler. “We feel like there’s room for us to improve and if we continue to improve, even this low-income customer, if we can satisfy her, we should do fine.” </p><p>TJX’s CEO put it a bit more bluntly. </p><p>“More and more vendors, they have even more reasons to want to sell us versus others because their goods in our store now hang with the best,” said Herrman. “They’re dealing with a buying team that’s very straightforward and a company that has cash and will be paying.” </p></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

In the early 2010s, the company was sold to private equity firm Golden Gate Capital which sold Red Lobster-owned real estate, making them beholden to landlords and leases. In 2016, Thai Union Group, one of the world's biggest producers of canned tuna, took a minority stake in Red Lobster. This year, they decided to <a href="https://www.thaiunion.com/en/newsroom/press-release/1675/thai-union-group-announces-intention-to-pursue-exit-of-minority-investment-in-red-lobster">cut bait</a> as the company continued to lose money, citing the pandemic and rising debts.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Haddon spoke with <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast"><em>Today, Explained</em></a> guest host David Pierce about how Red Lobster became a restaurant icon and what contributed to its decline.

Red Lobster is not closing all of its restaurants but they have closed several dozen, and they have about 600 total. They are seeking bankruptcy protection basically to deal with nearly $300 billion in debt to their creditors. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">By late last year, they only had $30 million left in cash, which is just not enough money to run a big, complicated business like this. And they were unable to pay a lot of their suppliers. Clearly, this is a situation that has been piling up for some time, but this is where it's ended up. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">I am confident that there is more going on here than the unlimited shrimp. And I want to get to all of it, but I have seen some people connect the dots, more or less saying unlimited shrimp cost this company so much money that it went into bankruptcy. What happened there? </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">So Red Lobster certainly has run these kinds of bottomless promotions in the past where you could get all the shrimp that you want from a certain part of the menu. But they tended to run it as a limited-time offer, you know, one day a week for a limited time or just for a certain period. The company last June said,<em> </em>“Hey, we're going to run this all the time so you can come in and pay $20 and you can get as much shrimp as you want.” So it drove a lot of traffic, but the profits did not go along with those sales. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">That's the sort of thing that makes sense to me when it's unlimited breadsticks. Unlimited shrimp — I can imagine how that would become a bad financial deal pretty fast. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">I've actually talked to some restaurant executives since about that. Shrimp prices fluctuate quite a bit. And when they go up, particularly, that's just going to cost you a lot of money. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">You mentioned not all the stores are going to close. What happens at this moment for a company like Red Lobster? </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">They're in the bankruptcy protection process. They have a CEO who is a restructuring specialist who was brought on to prepare for this bankruptcy process, when the company was already on very shaky ground.  The goal was to get some new terms with their landlords and try to restructure into a new company and go forward. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Okay, so Red Lobster will continue to be open, at least for some people. Do you think the experience of going to Red Lobster is going to be really different after this bankruptcy proceeding? </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">At some point, they'll probably try to get it in a place where it could sell.  But if you look at the filing, it talks about the history of Red Lobster and its legacy. So I wouldn't expect a lot of immediate changes, but maybe moving away from some of those limited-time offers.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Where did Red Lobster come from in the first place? This company has been around a pretty long time and is an American food institution. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">They were founded in the late ’60s by Bill Darden, who is known as the father of casual dining. It was one of the first casual dining chains around, a place you could bring your family or a date and have a nice meal out and not break the bank. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">And there wasn't a ton of that at the time, right? </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">No, this was new.  In the ’70s, General Mills invested in the company and that really helped it expand its reach in the US. From there they developed all these kind of fun, kitschy things like Lobster Fest and popcorn shrimp and coconut shrimp — things they really became known for. By the 1980s and ’90s, they're the biggest seafood restaurant chain in the US. They really hit on something that consumers liked. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Looking back, when was peak Red Lobster? </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">I'd probably say the ’90s were a heyday for them. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">And when do things start to — I'm very sorry — flounder. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Darden Restaurants had an activist investor, Starboard, who was basically agitating for change and they wanted the company to be more profitable. Bill Darden, who I believe was still heading the company, was like, “All right, I'm going to deal with you by spinning off Red Lobster<em>.</em>” They sold Red Lobster in 2014 to the private equity firm Golden Gate Capital to deal with this activist. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Golden Gate Capital very quickly had the company sell off all its real estate, which gave them an infusion of cash. But it meant that Red Lobster was going to be forever leasing back their real estate. In 2016, Thai Union Group comes along, one of the world's biggest producers of canned tuna, and takes a minority stake in Red Lobster. Then in 2020, after the pandemic hit, they bought it out wholesale. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">How common a story is that in the restaurant world? These private equity firms have a reputation for taking over companies and stripping them for parts. Is that something that happens a lot in the restaurant world? </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Golden Gate has owned quite a number of restaurants. Private equity owning restaurants is pretty common, in part because they generate a lot of cash. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Were there any other sort of contributing factors to this? I know one of the things that showed up in Red Lobster's bankruptcy filing was that it just has an unbelievable amount of debt compared to the amount of money that it has coming in. Where did all of that come from? </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">In 2021, labor costs just shot through the roof because restaurants didn't have enough labor. They were really fighting to get workers and as a result had to really increase how much they were paying them. Then you have inflation in 2022 sending menu prices up and people starting to get unhappy about paying those prices. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">By June 2023, things are starting to look a little better but consumers at this point are just not going out to restaurants as much. Consumers are just tightening their belts and then comes Red Lobster offering this shrimp deal in June 2023.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Some of that sounds like things that hit every restaurant, and to some extent every industry, during the pandemic. But it also seems like maybe sort of a perfect storm for Red Lobster in particular. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">That's absolutely right. A lot of sit-down chains and independent sit-down restaurants have been struggling. They're more labor intensive than fast food and when that labor gets more expensive, that's really tough. Commodity costs have gone up for these restaurants, and the consumer is just not loving it lately. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">What's specific to Red Lobster is the all-you-can-eat promotion. And being run and owned by their supplier was very unusual: The restructuring CEO has actually raised questions about whether Thai Union structured a deal that benefited them more than Red Lobster. According to this filing, they cut out some of the other shrimp suppliers, giving them a preferred status.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">So does it feel like we're at the end of an era right now? We had decades of there being Red Lobsters and things like it in every strip mall everywhere. You practically couldn't turn around without finding one of these fast casual restaurants. Are we at the end of that part of our lives in history now? </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">I don't think we're at the end of the era, but it is definitely changing. You see chains like Applebee's, even Chili's closing locations. I do think we are seeing a little bit of shaking out in casual dining where units are closing and,  talking to the restaurant analysts, they think it could actually rightsize the business a bit better, that we just have too many of these restaurants and we need fewer of them to serve the amount of consumers there are for their food. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Red Lobster in particular, I feel like was very clever about being slightly elevated in what it was for a really long time — it didn't feel quite as casual as some of the other casual restaurants — and I wonder if that's what Red Lobster lost over the years was it felt fancy? </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Absolutely. And some of that is a cultural shift. You know, when this chain started, a lot of people didn't have a seafood restaurant, especially if you're in the middle of the country. I'm from New Jersey where you go to the Jersey Shore and have seafood; a lot of people didn't have that. A lot of the consumers I talked to had vivid memories of going out and having their birthday parties when there were 10 at Red Lobster. It was seen as a treat, an occasion, and something to celebrate. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">So if these restaurants aren't doing well, have we seen anyone that has been on a huge upswing as a result of some of the changes you're talking about? </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Some of these fast casual chains are doing pretty good. But I would say in general, this is not a great time for restaurants — even Starbucks and McDonald's aren't doing good. I think we're going to have to see what happens later this year, if consumers start to feel a little looser with their money. I think that there are going to be price promotions and value wars coming this summer.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">So for Red Lobster, is there any hope for this storied brand at this point, or are we in kind of a slow, inexorable decline? </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">The current CEO certainly believes there's hope that this restructuring process will work. And the firm he works for, they've done this before. So I wouldn't lose all hope for Red Lobster.</p></div></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Joe Stiglitz, a left-leaning economist and author, has expressed concerns about the current state of capitalism and the rise of neoliberalism. He believes that neoliberal capitalism rewards dishonest people and leads to a lack of trust.</li>
<li>Stiglitz has a personal history of participating in civil rights protests in the 1960s, including the March on Washington where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous "I Have a Dream" speech.</li>
<li>Despite being a "pro-capitalist progressive", Stiglitz disagrees with the idea that socialism is the answer to the problems with capitalism. Instead, he advocates for a well-regulated capitalism that prioritizes community and social interests over individual self-interest.</li>
<li>Stiglitz believes that neoliberal capitalism has led to a lack of trust and is unsustainable in the long run. He argues that countries that have failed to protect citizens from the marketplace have seen the rise of populism and authoritarianism.</li>
<li>Stiglitz has expressed concern about the potential return of Donald Trump to the presidency in November, believing that it would be "terrible for the economy" and "even worse" for society.</li>

<p>Stiglitz says the protest movement gripping his institution and many others “does hit home” and recalled his own history as a civil-rights protester in the 1960s. “This may sound hard to believe,” he says, “but I was there in the march in Washington in August 1963, with Martin Luther King. And I was there when he gave the ‘<a href="https://kr.usembassy.gov/martin-luther-king-jr-dream-speech-1963/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://kr.usembassy.gov/martin-luther-king-jr-dream-speech-1963/" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">I Have a Dream</a>’ speech.” This had an influence on his thinking as a young man, he says, and “an enormous impact on the direction of our country, at least for a while.” </p>



<p>This mournful tone fits much of Stiglitz’s career, as the left-leaning economist and author finds himself in increasingly lonely company: the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/12/billionaires-tax-wealth-elon-musk-jeff-bezos/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/12/billionaires-tax-wealth-elon-musk-jeff-bezos/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">pro-capitalist progressive</a>.

But Stiglitz has all along maintained that socialism is not the answer; rather, a well-regulated capitalism is sorely needed. At the same time, he has decried the hard-right turn in American political and business culture, to the point where he doubts the impact of Reverend King’s famous speech. </p>



<p>“Neoliberal capitalism devours itself,” Stiglitz tells <em>Fortune</em>, arguing that it rewards dishonest people and leads to a lack of trust. It’s not sustainable, in his view, because it places self-interest above any sense of community and the broader interests of society. “We’re seeing it begin to fray now,” he adds.</p>



<p>Everywhere, countries have done too little to guard against the neoliberal turn, he argues, and these countries that have done too little to protect citizens from the marketplace have seen the rise of populism and authoritarianism. Obviously, he fears Trump’s return in November. “I think it’ll be terrible for the economy. And even worse, for our basic rights.” But he also says Americans are underrating the international reaction. Businessmen abroad have expressed a “kind of nervousness” about Trump’s re-election, he says. “And the closer we get to the election, the more nervous they say they feel.”</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Freedom for the wolves</h2>



<p>The title of Stiglitz’s book is an implicit callback to one of Regan’s favorite thought leaders, the Austrian economist <a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/reflections-reagan-intellectual" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cato.org/commentary/reflections-reagan-intellectual" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Friedrich Hayek</a>, who preached the <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/12/31/late-capitalism-technofeudalism-markets-2023-outlook-bezos-musk-inflation-central-banks/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2022/12/31/late-capitalism-technofeudalism-markets-2023-outlook-bezos-musk-inflation-central-banks/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">efficiency of free markets</a> above all in his landmark work “<a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Road%20to%20serfdom.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://cdn.mises.org/Road%20to%20serfdom.pdf" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">The Road to Serfdom</a>.” As Stiglitz writes, freedom has more than one meaning, and in the America of the 21st century, there’s “freedom for the wolves and death for the sheep.” (Stiglitz notes this is a paraphrase of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/04/neoliberalism-freedom-markets-hayek/678124/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/04/neoliberalism-freedom-markets-hayek/678124/" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Isaiah Berlin</a>, an anti-Communist, pro-capitalist liberal intellectual from the Cold War era.)</p>



<p>In Stiglitz’s book, he argues the country’s neoliberal turn since the days of Ronald Reagan has pushed the American Dream further out of reach for everyone, especially Gen Z. He tells <em>Fortune</em> the media likes to tell “nice stories” akin to the 19th-century young-adult novelist <a href="https://horatioalger.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://horatioalger.org/" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Horatio Alger</a>: of upward mobility being rewarded, reinforcing the idea that anybody can make it if they work hard. “But from the point of view of social science, the question is, what is the likelihood, and it’s very rare,” he adds, citing data of worse outcomes for the United States than any other advanced economy. “I would say it’s a myth.”  </p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>But the American Dream is also about freedom, which includes freedom from harm and freedom to live up to your potential. “And again, America does more poorly,” he says, specifically citing the epidemic of gun violence that grips the country. “An important freedom is freedom from fear. And from a very early age, we tell our kids to be afraid.” </p>



<p>We should listen to our children, he adds: “The disparity between what they were told and the reality is very large.” As they enter the labor market, being raised on notions of the American Dream, he adds, “they know it’s going to be really hard to get to own a home…they know the average college graduate has about $30,000, $40,000 in student debt, so it’s going to be a noose around their neck for a long while.” </p>



<p>Stiglitz declines to be drawn on the question of excessive police brutality in breaking up the Columbia protests, citing the long tradition of peaceful protests from Martin Luther King back to Mahatma Gandhi, but also a tension with civil disobedience that may be warranted by a specific cause. “I’m<strong> </strong>aware of the tensions between various freedoms,” he says, adding that he usually wishes for a civil dialogue that arrives at a peaceful resolution.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The coercion of the traffic light</h2>



<p>As for a fix, Stiglitz uses the word “coercion” in his book, but he offers up a potentially illuminating metaphor: the stoplight. “You can’t go through an intersection when it’s red. And if you do, you’ll see all kinds of consequences. You’ll be arrested. So it’s coercion unambiguously. But in New York, or London, if you didn’t have stoplights, you couldn’t move at all. And you’d have gridlock.”<br><br>When <em>Fortune</em> brings up the biggest economic gridlock going these days, the housing market, Stiglitz refers back to his previous work. </p>



<p>While cautioning that he hasn’t studied the current housing market closely, he has studied mortgage financing, a “peculiar system” where the government bears roughly 90% of the risk through underwriting, unchanged since the great crash of 2008. “Remarkably, for me, [is that] in the 16 years since then, we haven’t really fixed the financial part.” We still have a system where a lot of the profits go to the financial sector, but the government continues to bear most of the risk. If this were a stoplight, in other words, it might be blinking yellow without directing traffic efficiently at all.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The article suggests that the current situation with high car prices in the US is similar to the OPEC Oil Crisis of 1972, where a worldwide energy crisis led to a spike in oil prices.</li>
<li>In the 1970s, American car manufacturers failed to build cheap, efficient, and fuel-efficient cars, allowing Japanese manufacturers like Toyota, Nissan, and Honda to fill the gap and become popular in the US market.</li>
<li>In response to the energy crisis, Japanese automakers began building manufacturing plants in the US to produce affordable and efficient cars that Americans wanted but couldn't get from American automakers.</li>
<li>The US has a unique reliance on cars, with 92% of daily trips made by car, compared to 45% in Europe and 30% in Asia. This is partly due to the country's sprawling suburbs and lack of public transportation.</li>
<li>As a result of the energy crisis and the rise of Japanese automakers, American car companies focused on selling to their most profitable customers, while losing market share to Japanese manufacturers among the middle and lower income groups.</li>

<hr>
<p>Perhaps Biden has forgotten the last time America’s land yachts, marketed to the most affluent, became impossibly expensive symbols of conspicuous consumption. It was the same year he entered Congress after all, 52 years ago. But America and its car companies have indeed faced almost exactly the same situation as they face now, and responded very differently. And America’s car companies thrived.</p>
<p>There are similarities and differences of course. History doesn’t repeat, it merely rhymes (thanks, Mark Twain, American author). What happened in 1972 that is a lot like what’s happening now? It was an energy crisis, the OPEC Oil Crisis to be specific. A bunch of non-American countries that produced a lot of oil that America needed for its profligate ways decided to shut off the taps, causing a spike in oil prices.</p>
<p>Prior to that, the USA was awash in cheap foreign and domestic oil, and hence gasoline. Detroit’s average vehicle weighed two of those weird Imperial American tons. Today, American cars average 2.05 American tons. The supersizing of American automobiles today has an almost identical echo from the past. But when OPEC shut off the taps, those land yachts were suddenly incredibly expensive and inconvenient.</p>
<p>What happened? Toyota, Nissan, and Honda were building cheap, reliable, efficient cars because they weren’t Americans. Japan was emerging as an economic and industrial powerhouse. Fears about it eclipsing America were starting to arise. North American automakers failed miserably to build cheap, affordable, and fuel efficient cars.</p>
<p>Enter Japanese automakers. America (i.e., Detroit) embraced them to build the cheap, efficient, low-margin cars that American automakers weren’t interested in building. In 1982, 1983, and 1984, Honda, Nissan, and Toyota respectively opened American car manufacturing plants for the cheap cars Detroit couldn’t build. A lot of Americans who suddenly couldn’t afford land yachts could buy the cars that are so necessary for America’s unusual man-spreading suburbs.</p>
<p>And unusual it is. 92% of American’s daily trips are by car, compared to 45% for Europe and 30% in Asia. One of these things is not like the other. In North America, cars are incredibly hard to live without. In the rest of the world, they are usually a status symbol, sometimes a flaunting inconvenience, and often easy to live without.</p>
<p>Did American car companies disappear? No, they kept selling cars to their most profitable customers, the top 40% of American income earners. The middle 20% to 40% stopped wasting salespeople’s time kicking tires and bought Japanese cars. The bottom 20% to 40% had different used cars to buy. American car companies did just fine.</p>
<p>That’s history. During an energy transition in the USA, foreign car companies came in that could build and sell cars at low margins that less affluent Americans needed in order to live in the urban sprawl that a weird confluence of American nuclear war paranoia, racism, and corporate antipathy to transit had created. It worked out somewhat adequately. Was it without controversy? Not even remotely.</p>
<p>In the article “Can America Win the Car War?” in <em>Reader’s Digest</em>, Ronald Schiller highlighted the concerns about Japanese automakers, suggesting that American car manufacturers were struggling to compete with the high-quality, efficient production of Japanese companies. He emphasized the dire state of American competitiveness, framing the situation as a critical economic battle​. U.S. auto executives frequently testified before Congress about the challenges posed by Japanese imports. They often argued that Japanese companies were benefiting from unfair trade practices and government support, while American manufacturers faced high tariffs and restrictive standards in Japan. These testimonies often included stark warnings about the potential collapse of the U.S. auto industry if corrective actions were not taken​. Reagan, responding to industry pressures, negotiated a “voluntary export restraint” with Japan in 1981. He described the situation as one where American automakers needed “breathing room” to catch up to Japanese competitors, implying that without intervention, the U.S. industry could be overwhelmed by Japanese imports​.</p>
<p>Does any of this sound familiar? Is there any reason that the <em>Chinese-cars-are-coming</em> hysteria of today is different from the <em>Japanese-cars-are-coming</em> hysteria of the 1980s?</p>
<p>There was another thread emerging in American culture. While post-WWII America lifted all boats unequally, at least it lifted almost all boats. Black GIs may not have received the preferential rate mortgages for suburban homes that white GIs did, but America was a leading global manufacturer and there were jobs, jobs, jobs. Black people, women, and Hispanics may not have been receiving anywhere near the same pay or increases in pay as white men, but they were receiving incomes that were bigger. American manufacturing, grown to extraordinary size during the war, was trying, almost desperately, to find something to do with both that capacity and the returning GIs. The women who had been a mainstay of American manufacturing during the war were encouraged to return to kitchen and bedroom duties while the newly returned men did manly work.</p>
<p>Then came Reaganomics. That’s when very rich, mostly white men realized that money could buy tax breaks for themselves. Supply side economics, also known as voodoo economics, also known as the free market wet dreams of Friedman and Hayek — or at least their much less nuanced and much more predatory disciples — came into play. That’s when in America, the rich got richer while the temporarily embarrassed millionaire class — everyone outside of the 1% to 10% — started getting poorer.</p>
<p>From 1980 to recently, the bottom 80% — the massive majority — had flat or even declining real money incomes and buying power, while the top 20% and especially the top 1% accelerated away from most Americans. The Gini Index — the measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income or wealth inequality within a nation — for the USA went the other direction from most other western liberal democracies. In the USA, unlike most of Europe and Canada, the rich got a lot richer while everyone else didn’t get rich at all, or even lost real wealth.</p>
<p>That has had horrible consequence, but I’ll try to stick to the plot of Chinese vs US EVs. It’s easy to tell stories related to widespread and deserved grievances exploited by populist Republicans in the past decade, but the point is Biden’s 100% tariffs on EVS.</p>
<p>Related to EVs is the ability of the average American to buy a new car vs. a used car. The top 20% buy new cars every 1 to 4 years. Some of the 60% to 80% find it in their means to buy a new car every 4 to 8 years. Everyone else buys used cars that are increasingly old. In 1980, the average age of cars in the United States was about 5.6 years. By 1990, this average had increased to around 7.8 years. In 2023, it was 12.5 years.</p>
<p>Some of this is due to cars actually being better. They last longer now because all the bits are better. But a lot of it is due to rich people being able to afford new cars, American car companies shifting their product lines to pander to the richest and highest profit customers, and no one else being able to afford SUVs and oversized pickups.</p>
<p>Remember, in 1970, American cars were huge, gas was cheap, and then the crunch came. Now American cars are huge, only 20% of Americans can afford them, and a reality check has arrived.</p>
<p>Can American car companies adapt and sell the equivalent of Japanese econoboxes from the early 1980s? Not a chance, just as they couldn’t do it then. Could America say to Chinese automobile firms, sure, sell cheap cars that the average person can afford in North America, just do it with Chinese cars built in Chinese-owned factories on American soil, mostly employing Americans? Of course.</p>
<p>That’s what America did in the 1980s, and American car companies did okay. Of course, now Japanese car firms with factories in North America are the American car companies of 1970, also selling only higher margin SUVs and pickups to the top 20% of US income earners. They aren’t going to save America from itself because they now have a related corporate COVID, where plug-in hybrid vehicles are one of the symptoms.</p>
<p>Why is Biden, instead of following in Reagan’s footsteps and opening the doors to cheap Chinese EVs that will be great for the bottom 80% but not expensive ones that will compete with American or Japanese firms selling to the top 20%, putting 100% tariffs on cheap Chinese EVs? It’s obviously a destructive choice for most Americans, America’s economy, and America’s climate goals.</p>
<p>I think there are four or five things going on.</p>
<p>The first is that Biden is beholden to the union power block. This was apparent when unionized GM was feted as the leader in electric vehicles when it managed to sell 40 vehicles in a quarter while non-unionized Tesla was ignored. Unions are great until they aren’t. They are inherently protectionist of jobs for workers and that’s playing out around the world. Why? Electric vehicles are a lot simpler, so a lot fewer workers are required to do the assembling. Unions aren’t pleased with this. Workers’ organizations in multiple countries are fighting electrification because it might require fewer workers and hence less political power for the unions and workers’ organizations. Is this to say that unions are bad? Not at all. Just that like all human organizations, they have both good and bad impulses that express themselves in good and bad ways.</p>
<p>The second is America’s institutional Sinophobia. When Japan was threatening American industry, it was the defeated evil, the bombed enemy, the MacArthur pacified island nation, its flag lowered and its leaders bowing to Americans. America never defeated China. In the various east and southeast Asia proxy wars from 1950 to 1975, America didn’t exactly have any resounding successes. Korea? Vietnam? Cambodia? Laos? These aren’t celebrated in USA’s annual days of martial victory.</p>
<p>Third, there’s a lot of basic xenophobia and racism inherent to the USA. The amount of “China can’t do x or y because they are inferior because a or b” I’ve heard from Americans is mind boggling. China is graduating a lot more STEM PhDs than the USA annually, both domestically and in every educational institution abroad, and these are not buy-a-PhD children of Chinese mandarins. The quality 20 years ago was easy to consider inferior, but not today. Similarly, China’s patents have outstripped Americas, and they are not crap patents, if they ever were.</p>
<p>Next, there’s another ugly underbelly of America. Like all countries, it likes to have an external, dehumanized enemy it can rally most of its populace around. For 60 years, that’s been any country that could in any way have the label Communist attached to it. It’s invaded multiple tiny, barely defended countries since 1970 with overwhelming force based on the C-word. That it’s won a lot of battles and lost the vast majority of wars should be a cause for reflection, but it’s not. Now China is the great Communist boogey man, although CCP really should be extended to the Chinese Confucianist Party Regulating a Vibrant Market Economy.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s the march of history. While Ray Dalio’s principles and algorithms have turned out to be more commonly overridden by Dalio’s gut than observed, his <em>Changing World Order</em> is a reasonably good framework for understanding the world, a better and more dispassionate one than Allison’s <em>Destined for War</em>. The USA is in the moderately stagnant end phases of empires, likely but not inevitably required to cede its globetrotting swagger to the next empire, even if one founded a lot more on trade and commerce than guns and bombs. However, the title of Allison’s book is vastly more internalized in Washington than the soft-peddled lesson of the book that <em>the USA is the problem</em>, never mind Dalio’s transition of empires phases or Mahbubani’s or Jacques’ discussions of the realities of China and the USA.</p>
<p>Japan was the defeated enemy and a client state of the USA. Welcoming it to manufacture cars on American ground helped everyone. China should be welcomed in, as it’s only the imagined martial enemy because Washington’s politicians and military industrial complex require an external, Communist boogey man. But they can’t simultaneously vilify and embrace China. They were able to make it clear Japan was inferior while accepting superior Japanese cars, but even then the cognitive dissonance was powerful.</p>
<p>Not so much China. It has vastly more people than the USA. It is just as big geographically. Its economy has already surpassed the USA’s in real economic output based purchasing power parity, and it is one which is still growing much faster than the USA’s. It is the only scaled manufacturer of most of the products the world needs to decarbonize, offerings that the USA ceded entirely to China in pursuit of quarterly stock prices and dividends for shareholders over all else for the past 40 years.</p>
<p>Japan was humbled, hence acceptable and controllable. China isn’t.</p>
<p>And so we have Biden’s massive failure of a 100% tariff on cheap Chinese EVs. It’s not about what is best for Americans. It’s not about what is best for climate change. It’s not about what is best for American car companies that have proven themselves unable to service the bottom 80% of Americans for the past 40 years. It’s about China being scary and probably superior, with no illusions except the boogeyman of Communism to hide behind.</p>

As Mickey D's is “laser-focused on affordability,” Burger King has come up with its own $5 meal deal. The two companies are known to be each other's competitors. However, the latter appears to be taking the first jab as it plans on rolling out its value deal ahead of McDonald's.</p> <figure class=""> <span> <picture> <source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/26/400x225/fast-food-chicken-nuggets-taste-test_1716749051707_1716749059915.webp" alt="Burger King and McDonald's are fighting to attract customers with $5 meal deals while Wendy's is offering a special $3 English Muffin deal." title="Burger King and McDonald's are fighting to attract customers with $5 meal deals while Wendy's is offering a special $3 English Muffin deal."> <img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/26/550x309/fast-food-chicken-nuggets-taste-test_1716749051707_1716749059915.webp" alt="Burger King and McDonald's are fighting to attract customers with $5 meal deals while Wendy's is offering a special $3 English Muffin deal." title="Burger King and McDonald's are fighting to attract customers with $5 meal deals while Wendy's is offering a special $3 English Muffin deal."> </source></picture> </span> <figcaption>Burger King and McDonald's are fighting to attract customers with $5 meal deals while Wendy's is offering a special $3 English Muffin deal.</figcaption> </figure> </div> <h2>Burger King escalates plans for release of $5 meal</h2><p>While McDonald's $5 meal is set for late June, Burger King is “accelerating its value offers after three quarters of leading the industry in value traffic.

<p><em>Editor’s Note: This story has been updated to clarify that the recall was initiated in March and classified by the FDA last week, and to add in comment from the company.</em></p>



<p>TOPEKA (<a href="https://www.ksnt.com/news/kansas/nearly-1-9-million-cases-of-water-impacted-by-fda-recall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KSNT</a>) – The Food and Drug Administration (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FDA</a>) has determined thousands of cases of bottled water affected by a March recall are “not likely to cause adverse health consequences” in a new update. </p>



<p>In March, the FDA announced Natural Waters of Viti Limited was <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/?Event=94172" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/?Event=94172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voluntarily recalling</a> more than 78,000 cases of “<a href="https://www.fijiwater.com.au/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.fijiwater.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fiji Natural Artesian Water</a>” due to manganese and three bacterial genera.</p>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDC</a>) reports <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/tsp/toxfaqs/toxfaqsdetails.aspx?faqid=101&amp;toxid=23#:~:text=Exposure%20to%20excess%20levels%20of%20manganese%20may%20occur,the%20brain%2C%20liver%2C%20kidneys%2C%20and%20the%20developing%20fetus." data-type="link" data-id="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/tsp/toxfaqs/toxfaqsdetails.aspx?faqid=101&amp;toxid=23#:~:text=Exposure%20to%20excess%20levels%20of%20manganese%20may%20occur,the%20brain%2C%20liver%2C%20kidneys%2C%20and%20the%20developing%20fetus." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manganese </a>as a trace element that is needed in small amounts in our food and water. However, exposure to more than the usual requirement of manganese can lead to brain damage.</p>



<p>Last week, the FDA classified the recall as <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/postmarket-requirements-devices/recalls-corrections-and-removals-devices#2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Class III</a>, a status given to recalled products that are “not likely to cause adverse health consequences.”</p>



<p>The water was sent to the state of Washington before distribution nationally to customers through online retailers like Amazon.com, according to a March <a href="https://x.com/FIJIWater/status/1767632812235264379" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/FIJIWater/status/1767632812235264379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> from the company. </p>





<p>“The FDA classification announced yesterday relates to a matter from several months ago that never posed any health or safety risk,” a company spokesperson said in a statement to Nexstar’s KSNT. “It affected products that were sold through only one distributor, and 99% of all those affected bottles were reclaimed with the remainder in warehouses to be returned. There is no higher priority to us than the safety and quality of Fiji Water. There is no health or safety risk posed from manganese or bacteria in the recalled lots of FIJI Water. Moreover, FIJI Water conducts regular testing to ensure consumers enjoy the soft, smooth taste of FIJI Water that they expect and love.”</p>





<p>The water cases contained 24 bottles of water apiece, meaning about 1,884,792 individual bottles were affected. More details on the recalled cases can be found below: </p>



<ul>
<li>Case UPC Code –  6 32565 00004 3</li>



<li>Bottle UPC Code – 6 32565 00001 2</li>



<li>Production dates – Nov. 11, 2023; Nov. 12, 2023; Nov. 13, 2023; Nov. 24, 2023 and Nov. 25, 2023</li>
</ul>



<p>Affected bottles of Fiji Water were only sold between February 1 and March 3 this year, according to the company.</p>

<h3>US</h3><p>Core PCE deflator data will also be released on Friday. Consensus estimates suggest a 0.3% increase in April, with the annual rate cooling to 2.7% from 2.8, marking a small but favorable directional move. A downward surprise could reignite optimism that the disinflationary trend, which began in late 2023 but stalled earlier this year, is back on track, strengthening the case for the <a href="https://www.dailyfx.com/fomc" title="FOMC">FOMC</a> to pivot to a looser stance at some point in the fall. This should be bearish for the U.S. dollar but positive for stocks and <a href="https://www.dailyfx.com/gold-price" title="gold">gold</a>.</p><p>Conversely, if inflation numbers exceed forecasts, interest rate expectations could shift in a hawkish direction, delaying the Fed’s timeline for initiating rate cuts. In this scenario, November or December could become the new baseline for a potential move by the U.S. central bank. Such a development could propel bond yields and the greenback higher, creating a more challenging environment for equities and precious metals.</p><p>For an in-depth look at the variables that may impact financial markets in the coming week, explore the comprehensive forecasts and analysis offered by the DailyFX team.
