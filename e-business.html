The company raised its dividend by 8% to 13 cents per share, its first increase in six quarters.</p><p>Here’s how Levi’s performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:</p><ul><li><strong>Earnings per share:</strong> 16 cents adjusted vs. 11 cents expected</li><li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $1.44 billion vs. $1.45 billion expected</li></ul><p>The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 26 was $18 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.6 million, or zero cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Levi’s posted earnings of $66 million, or 16 cents per share. </p><p>Sales rose to $1.44 billion, up about 8% from $1.34 billion a year earlier. However, the sales jump is coming off of an easier comparison.</p><p>In the year-ago period, sales were down 9% after Levi’s shifted its wholesale shipments from its fiscal second quarter into its fiscal first quarter. The shift reduced sales last year by about $100 million, the company said previously. Excluding the shift, as well as the exit of Levi’s Denizen business, sales would have been up by about 1% in its most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period. </p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>Finance chief Harmit Singh attributed the sales miss to unfavorable foreign exchange conditions and weak sales at Docker’s. During the quarter, the khaki and chinos brand saw $82.4 million in sales, up 8.6% from $75.8 million in the year ago period. It’s not clear how sales at Docker’s were affected by the timing of Levi’s wholesale orders. </p><p>While Levi’s posted a strong earnings beat, it only reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which was in line with estimates. The company continues to expect full-year earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27, which now includes a 5 cent hit coming from the company’s new distribution and logistics strategy. </p><p>Levi’s said it is transitioning from a primarily owned-and-operated distribution and logistics network in the U.S. and Europe to one that relies more on third parties. </p><p>“In the near term, these changes require the parallel operation of new and old facilities for the rest of 2024, resulting in a transitory increase in distribution costs,” the company said. </p><p>The change allows Levi’s to shift the responsibility of final mile delivery to third parties. It noted that it has new terms with its supplier that result in Levi’s taking ownership of inventory closer to the point of shipment rather than its eventual destination. Levi’s distribution network was built for a business that primarily sold to wholesalers and now it needs to change into one that’s more focused on selling directly to consumers.</p><p>The changes are necessary because <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/03/levi-strauss-levi-earnings-q1-2024.html">nearly half of Levi’s sales</a> these days are coming from its own website and stores.</p><p>Direct to consumer sales jumped 8% during the quarter, representing 47% of overall sales. Online sales increased 19%.</p><p>“Our transformational pivot to operating as a DTC-first company is yielding positive results around the world, giving me great confidence that we will achieve accelerated, profitable growth for the rest of the year and beyond,” CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement. </p><p>During the quarter, wholesale revenue grew 7%, but excluding the shift in timing of wholesale orders, sales in the channel decreased 4%. </p><p>By building out its own direct channels, Levi’s enjoys higher profits, better data on its consumers and less reliance on shaky wholesalers like Macy’s and Kohl’s, which are continuing to shrink and fall out of favor with consumers. </p><p>However, selling directly can also be more expensive, and can come with unexpected hiccups that can impact sales and drain profits. For example, when someone buys a pair of Levi’s from Macy’s and wants to return them, Macy’s typically bears that cost. Under a direct model, that responsibility, including the cost and logistics, would fall on Levi’s. </p><p>Nike has come to be known as a cautionary tale for retailers long reliant on wholesalers that try to expand direct sales. </p><p>For a while, Nike’s focus on direct sales boosted revenue and profits, but some critics said the strategy shift led to a slowdown in innovation and ultimately, market share losses. </p><p>Recently, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/12/nike-ceo-acknowledges-it-went-too-far-in-direct-push.html">company acknowledged</a> that it erred when it cut off so many of its wholesale partners and said it has since “corrected” that. </p><p>Read the full earnings release <a href="https://www.levistrauss.com/news/pressroom/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Netflix is not the sole winner of the streaming wars</strong>: Despite being widely recognized as a pioneer and leader in the streaming industry, Netflix is not necessarily the winner of the streaming wars. According to Alex Sherman, YouTube is actually the most watched streaming platform, and has been leading the entire streaming space in overall time watched for 15 consecutive months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>YouTube's dominance is accelerating</strong>: Not only is YouTube the most watched streaming platform, but its dominance is also accelerating. More than half of all YouTube viewing is now done on a traditional television, and the platform is still growing at an incredible rate, even despite its massive size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disney+ is a close second to YouTube</strong>: While Disney+ is a strong contender in the streaming wars, YouTube still outperforms it in terms of overall time watched. Disney+ is, however, growing at a rapid rate, and its popularity is likely to continue to grow as the streaming wars heat up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The streaming wars are all about growth rate</strong>: According to Rich Greenfield, what matters most in the streaming wars is the growth rate. YouTube is still growing at an incredible pace, even despite its massive size, which is likely to continue to put pressure on other streaming services to innovate and grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The traditional TV landscape is changing</strong>: The article highlights the changing nature of the traditional TV landscape, with more and more people turning to streaming services to consume their favorite shows and content. This shift is likely to continue, and will require traditional TV networks and streaming services alike to adapt and innovate in order to stay relevant.</p>

    Andrew Ross Sorkin: The
transition from traditional television to streaming services
has led to a major cord cutting across the country. So did Netflix just win
the latest round of the streaming wars? Victoria Greene: I see them as
winning the streaming wars. Alex Sherman: Netflix the great
media disruptor, a company that turned the entertainment
industry on its head in light of Netflix's ability to just be and
be the king in this sandbox, as established media companies
struggle to turn a profit on their own streaming services,
many pundits crown Netflix the winner in the streaming wars,
the OG of subscription streaming, the king of digital content. Tom Rogers: I always say the
crown as a program may be over, but it has been crowned the most
successful media company and most valuable, and it will continue. Alex Sherman: Netflix makes up
more than 7% of total TV usage in the US. But surprise, it's
technically not winning the streaming wars. YouTubers: I'm gonna spend the
next 50 hours buried alive in this coffin. Gotta be honest. I
kinda think I can do? Expert, no, no, no, no. Alex Sherman: The most watched
streaming platform is YouTube. YouTubers: Hi, friends. I kind
of have a different take on this. Alex Sherman: YouTube, of
course, isn't new. You know that already It was founded in 2005
but what is new is its accelerating domination of the
living room. More than half of all YouTube viewing is now done
on a traditional television the alphabet owned video streaming
platform has led the entire streaming space in overall time
watched for 15 consecutive months ahead of Netflix. And if
you zoom out to the entire TV world, we're talking cable,
broadcast and streaming. YouTube has still watched more than
every other media company's platforms other than Disney,
which owns Disney plus Hulu, ESPN, ABC and other cable
networks like FX and Nat, Geo. Rich Greenfield: whether we're
talking Disney plus or Hulu or Paramount plus. You look at
who's still growing, growing the greatest share year over year.
It is insane that YouTube is still dominating the growth
rate, even despite their size, Kevin Mayer: any competitor for
time and attention is obviously not good for streamers. If Alex Sherman: YouTube is already
this far ahead and growing, should other streamers be
worried, even Netflix, it's been almost two decades
since Netflix moved to online streaming kicked off a massive
shift in the entertainment industry, a Race to the Top that
would eventually be deemed the streaming wars. Currently,
almost every major media entity is represented in the space in
one way or another, all vying for the attention of a massive
digital audience dominated by younger viewers. Rich Greenfield: So many media
executives that we would run into is they, they always sort
of tried to silo and say, Okay, there's this thing called
premium content, that's what you make for TV or for streaming,
and then there's this other stuff that you watch on YouTube. Alex Sherman: Now you may be
thinking, isn't YouTube a social media site? Is calling it a
streaming service comparing apples to oranges? Rich Greenfield: When you think
about time spent, it's absurd to separate it into different
buckets, whether you're watching the NFL or whether you're
watching Tiktok or whether you're watching YouTube. It
doesn't matter. It's just time. Alex Sherman: When Google bought
YouTube back in 2006 it paid 1.6 5 billion for a platform that
was only a year old at the time. Fast forward to today, and
analyst Michael Nathanson says YouTube alone could be worth
$400 billion that's not only worth more than Netflix, it's
worth more than Disney and Comcast combined. Kevin Mayer: YouTube is still
the intercom gorilla in this space, and I do believe they're
a pretty unstoppable juggernaut globally, Alex Sherman: YouTube is the
second most visited website in the world, sitting just behind
its parent company Google, in monthly traffic. Kevin Mayer: So they have two
modalities, the traditional, horizontal video, they have the
vertical video. They have a personalization engine that I
think is kicking in in a big way, Tara Walpert Levy: that is
increasingly one of the biggest and fastest growing platforms
we're on. And when people are sitting down to watch TV,
they're increasingly turning on YouTube, and you see a lot of
what you'd expect, which is that they are watching longer
sessions, longer content. A lot of our biggest creators are
starting to make longer content for the TV. Unknown: More than a billion
hours of YouTube content is watched on TVs every day, with
150 million connected TV viewers tuning in each month, the amount
of YouTube creators who say the majority of their watch time
comes from TV climbed more than 400% in just three years. Rich Greenfield: We're not
talking about your mobile phone, your laptop that I'm sure you
see your kids using all the time, but on the biggest screen
in the house, the TV 25% of the. Streamed content is coming from
YouTube. Every executive has to be paying attention. Another Unknown: major factor behind
YouTube's success is the cost or lack of it. While younger
audiences have shied away from $100 per month for cable TV,
nothing is more appealing or user friendly than free. Brittany Broski: YouTube makes a
lot of money because they keep it free the minute you put up
that wall, a literal paywall between the product you're
trying to push and the people you want to push it to people
aren't gonna care. Unknown: And that brings us to
YouTube's other secret weapon. It's content and content creators Tara Walpert Levy: they're
producing at a level that is consistent with what we've
traditionally expected from Hollywood. Unknown: The beauty of it, and
the evolution of what the platform has become, is that
whatever you want to find on YouTube, you will find it. Alex Sherman: YouTube's bread
and butter is its user generated content, or what YouTube likes
to call creator led content. YouTube sees about 3.7 million
new videos uploaded to its platform daily. That's more than
271,000 hours of fresh content each day. The responsibility of
content generation falls solely on creators, not the company.
Saving YouTube billions of dollars. Tara Walpert Levy: Our business
is much more about scale and audiences and technology, and
that's the base that we came from, and that's why you see us
typically not also getting into the traditional Studio business Michelle Khare: From the Creator
side. It's something that I think is very, very exciting, in
the sense of creators can have their work viewed on a
television and the only barrier to entry is the Upload button. Alex Sherman: For years,
traditional media executives viewed YouTube's creator led
content as low quality, thinking, sure, it's free, but
eventually, users will want to watch something with more
substance. But recently, the evidence suggests otherwise. A
2023 survey found the majority of both Gen Z and younger
millennials say user generated content is their preferred
entertainment method. According to a Pew Research Study, 71% of
teens say they use YouTube daily, with one in five claiming
they're on YouTube almost constantly. Unknown: I grew up on YouTube. I
think that's a big difference. Is I've seen the way that it has
evolved, and it has filled in the space between the streaming
platforms. I think there's a lot of like viewers fatigue. There's
so much media out there that when you find a person that you
really like or that you really resonate with, or a type of
content that you like, it fits into a routine of your life. Alex Sherman: Part of the draw
is reliable, consistent contact, like a relationship, even if
it's through a screen. YouTubers are available to their
audiences. Viewers aren't waiting for new seasons or
renewals of their favorite series, and comments and
analytics mean creators get real time feedback on what is and
isn't working during covid, with millions of people stuck in
their houses around the world, YouTube provided people with
something more than just passive content. It gave them social
connection. People feel Unknown: like they know me
because I'm a friend to them, they can throw me up on the TV.
And I'm sharing parts of my life. I'm sharing my opinions,
what I'm doing every day. A lot of people work from home now,
it's just throwing something in the background. That is, it's
not risking missing out on a chapter. It's just for company,
to be honest, what Michelle Khare: I've appreciated
about being a YouTube creator is having the opportunity to
iterate, create content and receive feedback from an
audience immediately. We have so many creators like red and link,
Jimmy Donaldson, MatPat, people who have spent years building
their channels into something where you watch those channels
and qualitatively can't tell the difference between what we think
as traditional and what we think as as what you would expect
potentially from digital Rich Greenfield: so if you Think
about it, from the Creator standpoint, they are getting
something that no other platform can give them, which is massive
global reach on every device in every language all over Alex Sherman: the world.
YouTube's revenue largely comes from advertising, and while
traditional media companies have struggled in recent years to
attract ad dollars as cable TV subscriptions have declined,
YouTube has soaked up the revenue in q1 this year, YouTube
saw ad revenue growth of 21% year over year. YouTube's global
advertising revenue in 2023 was around $31.5 billion to put that
in perspective, Paramount global one of the largest entertainment
companies in the world had total revenue in 2023 of 29 point 6
billion. That's for the entire company, not just advertising.
YouTube shares its profits with its creators. Over the past
three years, YouTube's Partnership Program has paid out
$70 billion why Unknown: would. I create a show
and sell it to a network when I could just put it on YouTube,
you're self funding. But if the money you're making from AdSense
is going right back into your content to make more money, why
do you even have to contact that third party? Because Michelle Khare: what we're
trying to do here is not like take what's working on TV and
throw it on YouTube. We're trying to iterate on it. We're
trying to be additive to it, put our own spin on it, and
ultimately develop our own version of storytelling. Putting Rich Greenfield: yourself onto
Paramount plus, would be like a death sentence to these
creators, because you would be constricting the visibility to
such a small level. Alex Sherman: It's unclear if
YouTube's still growing popularity presents an
existential crisis to traditional media, but it's at
least worth considering that streamers, including Netflix may
soon need a YouTube strategy to address changing consumption
habits, especially among younger viewers. Can Rich Greenfield: you create a
competitor? I'm sure you could. It's certainly not in the DNA of
any of these companies. Now that being said, you are seeing
talent that grew up in the UGC world start to make inroads into
the streaming world. Tara Walpert Levy: You need to
make sure you got the scale, you need to make sure you got the
technology capability, and you need to make sure you got the
balance sheet, and there's probably only a couple companies
that can do that, Rich Greenfield: definitely
having an impact on traditional television now. Then you layer
on things like Netflix and Amazon Prime doing advertising
now, and you know, you have a recipe for a very, very
difficult next decade for traditional linear television. Unknown: Not that long ago,
traditional media companies saw Netflix as a companion service,
rather than a competitor. Then Netflix got so popular that it
started to compete for shows and movies against the media
companies who supplied it with content. It's fair to wonder, Is
YouTube ultimately a companion or a competitor? Tara Walpert Levy: Well, presume
that the street the other streamers are our competitors.
They're some of our best partners, right? Because I think
the strategy I see them leaning into is using supplementary
distribution platforms like YouTube to get out their
content, their marketing, their engagement with younger people
and younger audiences. Kevin Mayer: At the end of the
day, Disney is a storytelling machine, and we used YouTube,
that's short form video on YouTube as more of a promotional
device. Now you can still make money on it. Now you can put a
trailer for frozen two, a two minute trailer on YouTube, and
actually have advertising attached to it and sponsorship
attached to it. So you can kind of kill two birds with one
stone. You can promote your product and you can monetize on
YouTube. This Alex Sherman: video you're
watching right now is an example of this exact strategy. CNBC, a
cable television network utilizing YouTube to expand its
reach. Think about how often you see SNL or Late Night with Jimmy
Fallon clips go viral online. YouTube is expanding reach,
which is great for media companies, but YouTube is also
competing against these same company, streaming services, and
the more time you all watch YouTube, the less time you watch
everything else Kevin Mayer: sports is also
subject to the same phenomenon where young people are watching
highlights and highlights only, and the whip arounds like the
Red Zone network. What we're seeing Rich Greenfield: from all of
these traditional media companies is they don't have
enough content, and it's too expensive to produce the types
of premium content at scale that they need, and so maybe YouTube,
or maybe the UGC economy, is a place they look not to create
their competitor, but as a lower cost way to add content to their
services. Tara Walpert Levy: The magic of
YouTube is the ability to have all of these types of content
and all of these business models side by side in one place,
because we originated from the Creator ecosystem. You.

<li>The price target for NVIDIA has been raised to $140, with the analyst citing the company's strong performance in the data center segment, where they have only penetrated 8-9% of the market and have a long runway ahead.</li>
<li>The analyst believes that the pace of innovation at NVIDIA is not yet fully priced in by the market, citing the company's announcement of an annual cadence for new technology releases, which is a "seismic shift" that will continue to drive growth.</li>
<li>The company's dominance in the data center segment is due to its "wholistic" approach, which includes not only GPUs but also CPU and networking fabric, making it difficult for competitors to catch up.</li>
<li>The analyst believes that there are still opportunities for other companies to succeed in the industry, citing Broadcom's ability to compete in the inference market and AMD's efforts in GPU development. However, they believe that NVIDIA will continue to hold the dominant share.</li>
<li>The analyst notes that the return on investment (ROI) for A.I. is still an "enigma" today, citing the need for more data to understand the long-term benefits of investing in A.I. technology.</li>

            Sales of newly built homes dropped last month as mortgage rates remained elevated.

            New home sales, which make up only about 10% of the market, fell 11.3% in May from the prior month, to 619,000, according to government data released Wednesday. That was the steepest monthly decline since September 2022 and marks the lowest level since November.

            May’s level was below the 647,500 economists projected in a FactSet poll. Mortgage rates soared to the highest level of the year in early May and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/20/economy/mortgage-rates-june-20/index.html">have since trended down.</a> Borrowing costs are expected to ease this year, but not by much: Federal Reserve officials penciled in just one rate cut this year. Inflation will need to continue to drift closer toward the Fed’s 2% target for the central bank to begin cutting interest rates, and some officials have said it’s possible the Fed may not end up <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/economy/fed-officials-talking-down-rate-cut/index.html">cutting at all this year</a>.

            High interest rates, and expectations that they’ll remain elevated for longer than expected, are weighing on America’s homebuilders. US homebuilder sentiment soured in May for the second month in a row, according to the latest National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index out last week.

            That’s also taking a toll on the construction of new US homes. Housing starts fell 5.5% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.28 million units, the lowest level since 2020, also registering well below economists’ expectations. Building permits, seen as a bellwether of future construction, dipped 3.8%.

            “Persistently high mortgage rates are keeping many prospective buyers on the sidelines,” NAHB chairman Carl Harris said in a release. “Home builders are also dealing with higher rates for construction and development loans, chronic labor shortages and a dearth of buildable lots.”

            High prices and elevated mortgage rates, coupled with the persistent housing shortage, have undermined this year’s critical spring homebuying season.

            While that means Americans are stuck dealing with low housing affordability, it’s also proving to be a headache for the Fed: Inflation overall has eased substantially since reaching a four-decade high two years ago, but shelter costs have remained stubbornly elevated. It is effectively making the final stretch of the Fed’s inflation battle more difficult. Fed officials, including Fed chief Jerome Powell, have said that it’s only a matter of time until declining rents show up in official government measures of inflation. Renters are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/23/business/stocks-week-ahead-america-housing-crisis-worsen/index.html">very much still struggling</a> in today’s tough US housing market.

            The Biden administration has laid out its own solutions to the country’s housing crisis. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday announced $100 million in funding over the next three years “to support the financing of affordable housing,” according to a release. On Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris and Housing and Urban Development Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman announced $85 million in grant funding toward a housing program that “aims to identify and remove barriers to affordable housing production and preservation, and lower housing costs.”

            Brainard touted the Biden administration’s cap on annual rent increases for the 2 million households in “low-income housing tax credit” units and a reduction in Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance premiums that took effect in the spring, which she said has helped nearly 700,000 homeowners save roughly $900 annually.

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- Stocks struggled for direction in the final stretch of a strong quarter that’s seen a small group high-flying technology shares lead the way.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>A renewed bout of volatility hit Nvidia Corp., which slipped during its annual shareholder meeting. The poster child of the artificial-intelligence frenzy has been on a roller-coaster ride, mostly driving broad-market direction. Fellow megacap Amazon.com Inc. reached a $2 trillion valuation in a rally that took the e-commerce giant deeper into record territory.</p><p>A recent market attempt to broaden out of the megacap group was short-lived, with a bevy of measures still showing how market breadth remains weak — boosting uncertainty about the rally’s staying power. Bifurcation between S&amp;P 500 performance and breadth has reached one of the worst levels in three decades, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.</p><p>“The stock market is way too reliant on big tech — period and end of story,” said David Bahnsen at The Bahnsen Group. “Whether or not the past week’s volatility in tech is the start of something deeper or if that reckoning is still forthcoming remains to be seen, but excessive investor sentiment, euphoria and overdone momentum always ends the same.”</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 hovered near 5,470. Micron Technology Inc.’s more than $62 billion artificial intelligence-driven rally will face a test when it reports earnings after the closing bell. FedEx Corp. surged on a bullish forecast and buyback plans. The Federal Reserve will release the results of its annual bank stress tests later Wednesday.</p><p>Treasury 10-year yields topped 4.3%. A $70 billion sale of five-year notes showed signs of strong demand. The dollar hit the highest since November. The yen’s slide to the weakest since 1986 is boosting risk of intervention.</p><p>“The market’s ‘Engine Warning Light’ is on as we head into the hot summer months,” said Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler. “Investors in the tech-heavy indices are experiencing F.O.M.O, while investors in the rest of the market feel R.O.M.O (regret of missing out) as overall market breadth remains weak outside a handful of mega-cap stocks. We believe the S&amp;P 500 is overdue for maintenance.”</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is on track to deliver a strongly positive performance for the first six months of the year, fueled by a rally in the market’s largest names. Dividing the 500 Index stocks by capitalization quintiles shows a steady stairstep pattern of performance: the larger the stock, the better it did, according to Jack Ablin at Cresset.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>“Much of the divergence is attributable to a ‘higher for longer’ interest rate environment,” Ablin noted. “Investors reckon that megacap tech companies – thanks to their ability to generate cash – are less reliant on borrowing and, those companies that need to borrow have much easier access to capital than do their smaller brethren. So, where are markets headed in the second half of 2024?”</p><p>Ablin expects US equity markets to broaden later this year as the possibility of lower rates comes into focus.</p><p>“That means high-quality companies, particularly those with persistent dividend growth, will likely continue to lead their lower-quality counterparts in an incremental restrictive borrowing environment,” he added.</p><p>Bloomberg Intelligence’s sector rotation model says its time for a new leadership to emerge — and favors energy, health care and financials as the best-supported sectors to lead the index in the second half.</p><p>“Tech and the tech-adjacent communications sector have the strongest price momentum — but waning earnings dominance and lofty relative multiples pushed both groups down our ranks, wrote BI strategists led by Gina Martin Adams.</p><p>Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management, says that while Nvidia’s volatility has driven sentiment, the structural investment case for artificial intelligence remains intact on positive AI adoption and monetization trends. He also holds a constructive outlook for broader equities amid solid fundamentals.</p><p>“We maintain our positive view on the AI story, but believe rightsizing tech exposure is key to navigate volatility while maintaining strategic exposure to the technology that we think is set to drive growth in the coming years,” he added.</p><p>For the second-quarter earnings season, the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps are still expected to account for the bulk of the growth for the overall S&amp;P 500, according to Ryan Grabinski at Strategas.</p><p>“What remains encouraging to us is that the estimates for the remaining 493 are improving starting in the third quarter as growth rates for both the top of the market and the rest of the market normalize,” he noted. “Should this broadening come to fruition, it would be an encouraging sign for the sustainability of the bull market.”</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is on pace to enter the second half with a gain of about 15% since the start of 2024. And July has ranked as the strongest month of the year for the S&amp;P 500 both since its inception and more recently over the past two decades, according to data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group.</p><p>“What is more interesting is that zeroing in on the past 20 years, July’s outperformance is the eye of the storm,” Bespoke noted. “July is sandwiched between June, August, and September — which all rank as the three worst months of the year averaging declines of 0.17%, 0.10%, and 0.7%, respectively.”</p><p>Corporate Highlights:</p><ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"><li><p>Interactive Brokers Group Inc. took a $48 million hit after a New York Stock Exchange trading disruption this month and is considering its options to recover the money, including possible legal action.</p></li><li><p>Whirlpool Corp. surged after Reuters reported that Robert Bosch GmbH is considering an offer for the appliance maker.</p></li><li><p>A top McDonald’s Corp. executive reiterated that the company’s previous US test of plant-based meat didn’t work out and added that the burger chain’s diners don’t go to its restaurants for salads.

<li>CDK Global, a company that provides dealership management systems to over 15,000 car dealerships in North America, has announced that its systems will not be back online before the end of June due to the aftermath of two cyberattacks.</li>
<li>CDK was first hit by an attack on June 19, which forced the company to shut down its systems, and a second "cyber incident" occurred later that evening.</li>
<li>The attacks have disrupted business operations for car dealerships that rely on CDK's systems to conduct routine transactions, and the company is facing two potential class-action lawsuits in federal court in Illinois.</li>
<li>The lawsuits claim that CDK neglected to safeguard sensitive personal information and are seeking damages from the company. The plaintiffs are a former customer and employee of dealerships that used CDK's systems.</li>
<li>The cyberattacks have significant implications for the automotive industry, as CDK's systems are critical to the daily operations of car dealerships across North America. The company has not disclosed the extent of the damage or the nature of the attacks, but the incident highlights the importance of cybersecurity measures in mitigating the risks of data breaches and system disruptions.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>FedEx conducting strategic analysis of LTL segment</strong>: FedEx is conducting a strategic analysis of its less-than-truckload (LTL) segment, FedEx Freight, to assess its value to the company and determine whether it should be sold or spun off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FedEx Freight is the company's best-performing segment</strong>: FedEx Freight has operating margins of 20% for the past two years, compared to margins of 11.8% for Ground and 2% for Express in 2023. During the fourth quarter, operating income increased by $58 million.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FedEx Freight is efficient and largest LTL carrier in the nation</strong>: FedEx Freight is the largest LTL carrier in the nation and has an operating ratio of 80%, second only to Old Dominion Freight Line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experts predict spinoff of FedEx Freight</strong>: Satish Jindel, founder and president of parcel transport consultancy ShipMatrix Inc., predicts that FedEx will spin off FedEx Freight, creating an independent company and issuing shares to current investors, which he believes would maximize shareholder value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spinoff would provide greater shareholder return</strong>: Jindel argues that spinning off FedEx Freight would provide greater shareholder return compared to selling it, as it would allow the company to tap into the public market and unlock its full value.</p>

<p data-beyondwords-marker="d4706d99-2bed-4d48-9482-29cc8cb7ce10">FedEx <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/fedex-retires-one-fifth-of-boeing-757-freighter-fleet">is conducting a strategic analysis </a>of the company’s less-than-truckload segment and its relative value to the company, suggesting that FedEx Freight could be sold or spun off so the company can focus on its parcel and logistics business.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="be23b65b-46e5-4998-b45f-05421fc6ee7f">“With the recent completion of the FY 2025 planning process, we have turned our focus to the next phase of our long-term stockholder value creation plans. As a part of this work, our management team and the board of directors, along with outside advisers, are conducting an assessment of the role of FedEx Freight in our portfolio structure and potential steps to further unlock sustainable shareholder value,” CEO and President Raj Subramaniam said Tuesday on a call with analysts following the announcement of fourth-quarter results. “We’re committed to completing this review thoroughly and deliberately by the end of the calendar year.”</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="a4198362-e333-48d4-8e86-d845dfdc20fe">FedEx Freight is the corporation’s (NYSE: <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FDX/" target="_blank">FDX</a>) best-performing segment, with operating margins of 20% each of the past two years compared with margins of 11.8% for Ground and 2% for Express in 2023. During the fourth quarter, operating income increased by $58 million, as  focus on revenue quality and cost management overcame the soft demand environment and drove higher yields.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="e4f5c1f0-ad07-4c52-b008-6e69723229a3">FedEx Freight is the largest LTL carrier in the nation and is extremely efficient, with an operating ratio of 80% – second only to Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL). </p>
<div id="omeda-post-content">


<p data-beyondwords-marker="98095767-447c-4004-a463-acde925d4dfa">Satish Jindel, the founder and president of parcel transport consultancy ShipMatrix Inc., predicted in an interview that FedEx will spin off the Freight subsidiary.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="d9ca51da-3696-4cc5-9c9c-37e2cd10fff5">The best option for maximizing shareholder value is creating an independent company with FedEx Freight, the largest LTL carrier in the nation, and issuing shares to current investors, he argued.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="f9a4ff55-1ec0-4a44-b8db-69f922bb6d75">“You will have the greater shareholder return with a spinoff to the public market, not a sale,” because the next-largest carriers – ODFL and Saia  – don’t need FedEx Freight and it is too expensive for anyone else to buy, he said.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="32cd5383-7b7c-4f91-ab73-14a7c12dc308">Jindel urged FedEx founder Fred Smith, in an open letter nearly three years ago, to make Freight a stand-alone company because – by his estimate – it had a market capitalization of $34 billion compared to $61 billion for the entire FedEx enterprise.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="20de7f78-8161-45f8-acb9-bf2bb384108b">FedEx Freight’s revenue has increased 16.5% since then to $9.1 billion, and its estimated valuation is now more than $50 billion, so a spinoff is even more justified now, Jindel insisted.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="e3c76071-0f17-4c84-a755-78d1e233e1b1">“No carrier is big enough to be able to buy FedEx Freight,” he said, knocking down speculation that XPO, another large LTL carrier, would bid for the FedEx unit. “And you can’t integrate two carriers” because LTL networks are so asset-intensive there would be huge redundancy in terminals.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="3470b84d-5eef-4618-b7c2-2093e1ca93b7">“The public markets don’t have enough choices. That’s why you have more people buying the stocks of Saia, ODFL and XPO. The moment they have a choice of a fourth carrier,” they will invest there, Jindel told FreightWaves.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="041d5047-fd5e-4db3-9416-163448609a20">Another major LTL player is ABF Freight System, but its expansion into household goods movement and third-party logistics means LTL is less than half its business now.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="8bfd43ed-b65c-4b23-95db-1cec25387dc7">Stifel analyst Bruce Chan also said a spinoff of Freight is the most likely outcome. “The division has quietly grown from the family outcast to the most profitable division in the portfolio, and with peer valuations at nearly double that of FedEx, such a move makes sense to us,” he wrote in a research paper.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="9f4061db-15e3-400a-8bf8-ef9261e7d240">Markets looked favorably on the prospect of a Freight deal and improved profit figures. FedEx’s stock price was up about 14.5% to $293 in midday trading from Tuesday’s close.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="dc62c96e-24a4-4263-8d59-94f1d1320429">BMO Capital Markets analyst Fadi Chamoun said in a client note that FedEx shares could be valued at $310 to $338 per share if Freight is divested during the current fiscal year, with the value shooting as high as $408 per share in fiscal year 2026 if there is a deal.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="65b58ead-ce05-4af1-9ea2-210d847be665">FedEx rival UPS (NYSE: <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UPS/" target="_blank">UPS</a>) in 2021 sold its LTL unit to Canada-based trucking company TFI International.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="ea2fa916-849b-43be-b790-b78249e2218e">In related news, FedEx completed the consolidation of Express, Ground and Freight into one integrated air and ground operating network. Subramaniam said future results will be reported under Express and Freight, with Ground absorbed into the Express organization. FedEx Freight will now include FedEx Custom Critical, a premium service that previously was included in the Express organization.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="c5ddac5c-2d88-44ba-80b2-95a2fc31a7ab">(<em>Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly inflated FedEx Freight’s revenues. They were $9.1 billion in the prior fiscal year, not $19 billion</em>.)</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Nvidia's recent performance reminds Stifel managing director Barry Bannister of Cisco's performance during the dot-com bubble</strong>, in that both companies experienced rapid growth and high valuations, only to subsequently see their earnings grow to justify their prices over time.</li>
<li><strong>Bannister believes that the current AI sector is experiencing similar optimism and high valuations as the dot-com bubble</strong>, with many companies trading at high price-to-earnings (PE) multiples.</li>
<li><strong>The similarities between the two periods include narrow markets, high valuations, and extreme optimism</strong>, which Bannister believes are reminiscent of the feeling environment in the early 2000s when the dot-com bubble was forming.</li>
<li><strong>Bannister is warning investors to remember that the high PE multiples of the dot-com era ultimately contracted as earnings grew</strong>, and that similar repricing could occur in the AI sector if expectations are not met.</li>
<li><strong>The article also offers a link to watch a full episode of Morning Brief, which features expert insights and market analysis</strong>, likely including further discussion of the AI sector and its valuations.</li>

So the earnings went up dramatically, as was expected. This happened with the nifty 50 stocks in the early 70s. They earned very well, but their PE multiples were too high ... those companies had these mid-30s, 40-time multiples. They earned into it over the course of a decade," Bannister explains.</p><p>He outlines the similarities between the dot-com bubble and the AI sector today: "But what we have today is extreme optimism on new technology. Then it was the internet, now it's AI. Narrow markets, increasingly narrow markets with a high valuation. Equity ownership was very high. And the day traders and all that.

    <p>Here are five key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Elevated interest rates</strong>: Interest rates on select savings accounts, including CD accounts, have been elevated in recent years, providing a way for savers to buffer the effects of inflation and higher borrowing costs.</li>
<li><strong>Potential earnings</strong>: Depending on the account chosen, the rate secured, and the amount deposited, savers can earn hundreds and even thousands of dollars with the right account opening now.</li>
<li><strong>CD accounts</strong>: Certificates of deposit (CD) accounts are a type of savings account that offers a fixed interest rate for a set period, typically ranging from a few months to several years.</li>
<li><strong>Consider a $100,000 deposit</strong>: For conservative savers, a $100,000 deposit into a long-term CD may be worth considering now, given the elevated interest rates and potential for significant earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Evolving interest rate climate</strong>: The benefits of these accounts will evolve as the interest rate climate changes, so it's essential for savers to monitor interest rates and consider their options as the market shifts.</li>

As the interest rate climate evolves, however, the benefits of these accounts will evolve, too.</p><p>This is particularly true for <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whats-a-certificate-of-deposit-cd/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">certificates of deposit (CD)</a></span> accounts, which come with locked <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-todays-cd-interest-rates/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">rates</a></span> for the full <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cd-terms-everything-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">CD term</a></span>, no matter what happens in the greater rate climate.

But is a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-much-will-100000-earn-in-a-cd/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">$100,000 long-term CD</a></span> worth opening now or will savers be better served by parking their money elsewhere? That's what we will break down below.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fis-a-100000-long-term-cd-worth-opening-now&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fis-a-100000-long-term-cd-worth-opening-now%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=556c812d-4a6a-4da6-af45-57a582b8ee12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See how much you could be earning with one of today's top CD rates here now</a>.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Is a $100,000 long-term CD worth opening now?</strong></h2><p>As is the case with most personal financial decisions, the value of a $100,000 deposit into a long-term CD (longer than 12 months) is specific to the individual. That said, there are some pros and cons of making this deposit amount into a CD right now that can help you decide. Here's what to consider:</p>

    
<p id="leader-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="leader-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-leader-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"leader-plus-outstream-middle"'>
    </p>
<h3><strong>Why you should deposit $100,000 into a long-term CD now</strong></h3><p>The interest rate is a major motivating factor for making a deposit amount this high now. You can secure a 4.61% rate on a 3-year CD now and a 4.50% rate on a 5-year CD (although it may involve <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fis-a-100000-long-term-cd-worth-opening-now&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fis-a-100000-long-term-cd-worth-opening-now%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=556c812d-4a6a-4da6-af45-57a582b8ee12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shopping around</a> and the use of an <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/should-you-open-a-cd-account-online/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">online bank</a></span> to obtain those rates). A $100,000 deposit, then, would result in a $14,477.36 return on the 3-year option and a $24,618.89 return on the 5-year one. </p><p>That's a significant amount of money to be earned simply by leaving your money untouched in one of these accounts. And it will be a guaranteed, predictable return, regardless of what happens in the broader economy. Even if the bank you have your funds with fails, you'll be insured up to $250,000 per account, so you'll be completely protected with a $100,000 deposit. </p><p>So who should consider opening a long-term CD with this deposit? Anyone who can comfortably part with $100,000 for the full term may want to look into this option (if you can't, and need to withdraw it early, you'll get stuck with a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cd-early-withdrawal-penalties-what-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">penalty</a></span> for doing so). </p><p>Conservative savers who want to earn a return but don't want to deal with the risks of playing the stock market or investing in <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rental-property-investment-real-estate/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">real estate</a></span> or <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/investing-gold-pros-cons/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">alternative assets</a></span> may also want to pursue this sort of CD. Parents and <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/should-seniors-add-long-term-cds-to-their-investments-experts-weigh-in/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">seniors</a></span> who have money they want to leave to beneficiaries may also find this deposit amount in this type of CD beneficial now. Those who think that today's CD rates are fading and want to capitalize as much and as quickly as possible may also find this CD combination helpful. </p>

Investing in other, more volatile assets, instead, is likely (but not guaranteed) to result in bigger returns. $100,000 could also be used as a deposit on a home, to start a new business or to pay down (or off) high-interest debt. It could also be used to <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/best-summer-renovations-to-raise-your-home-value/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">renovate</a></span> your home, thus improving its value far greater than any return you'd make on a $100,000 long-term CD. </p><p>But all of these alternatives will require work and, in some cases, substantial risk. Savers will need to weigh those cons against the pros mentioned above to truly determine if this is the best option for their money. </p><h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>Only you will know if a $100,000 deposit into a long-term CD is truly valuable. Carefully weigh the pros and cons of doing so before acting but don't delay a decision too far into the future, either. With inflation cooling and interest rate cuts growing more likely, the rates on CDs won't stay this high for much longer. So, if you decide to act, now would be a good time to do so. </p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fis-a-100000-long-term-cd-worth-opening-now&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fis-a-100000-long-term-cd-worth-opening-now%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=556c812d-4a6a-4da6-af45-57a582b8ee12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more about all of your CD options online now</a>. </p>

<p>Mate Rimac, founder of Rimac, launched a new level 4 autonomous electric car brand called Verne and coming to market in 2026.</p>



<span id="more-369247"></span>



<p>Rimac is best known for its electric hypercar, the Nevera, and for its surprising takeover of Bugatti through its partnership with Porsche.</p>



<p>But now it is stepping into the other side of the EV spectrum: from hypercars to autonomous cars.</p>



<p>Mate Rimac, along with two other Rimac executives, have launched a new brand called Verne. It’s not clear how the Rimac Group plays into this beyond sharing employees, but it sounds like it is part of it, as the brand was launched at Rimac’s headquarters in Croatia today.</p>



<p>Verne is using Mobileye’s level 4 autonomy system and therefore, it’s core technology is more the vehicle platform than the autonomous driving system.</p>



<p>They wrote about the new vehicle:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The vehicle is built on a completely new platform designed around safety and comfort, engineered solely for autonomous driving using the Mobileye Drive autonomous platform. It is completely rethought, conceived, designed, and engineered as a safe and comfortable autonomous vehicle. Built from the ground up it is free from the compromises and disadvantages necessary in using a legacy platform built for human driving.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here are some pictures of the new Verne autonomous electric vehicle:</p>

<p>As you can see, it’s a two-seater built around the passenger experience since the vehicle is driverless.</p>



<p>There’s an extensive sound system and a giant screen with a UI built for a variety of passenger experiences.</p>




	<p>It is built for ride-hailing systems with a high level of customization. Verne says that the customers are going to be able to customize the experience via an app before the vehicle arrives:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It’s a re-envisioning of the ride-hailing app and mobility platform. The customers can personalise the vehicle’s settings via app before ordering a ride. That way, the vehicle will be set exactly how you like it with the comfort, lighting, temperature and even scent. Even though the customer will never own the vehicle, it will be tailored to feel like your own. On the backend, Verne uses all the benefits an autonomous connected fleet provides to make the service run smoothly and efficiently in every city.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Verne is going to launch first in Zhagreb in 2026, and the company plans to expand in Europe and the Middle East shortly after.</p>



<p>The company claims to already have deals with 11 cities.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>5 US cities with "impossibly unaffordable" housing markets</strong>: According to a report, the cities of San Diego, Los Angeles, Honolulu, San Jose, and San Francisco have the least affordable housing markets in the US.</li>
<li><strong>Methodology</strong>: The report compared average incomes with average home prices to determine the least affordable cities. The researchers found that in these cities, the average home price is difficult to afford for the average household.</li>
<li><strong>San Diego tops the list</strong>: San Diego has the least affordable housing market, with a median home price of $660,000 and an average household income of $83,000, making it difficult for residents to afford homes.</li>
<li><strong>The problem is widespread</strong>: While these 5 cities are identified as the most unaffordable, the issue of unaffordable housing affects many cities across the US, making it difficult for people to find affordable housing.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on residents</strong>: The affordable housing crisis can have significant impacts on residents, including increased stress, financial burdens, and limited access to housing options, which can affect overall quality of life.</li>
