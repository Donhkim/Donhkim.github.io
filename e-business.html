<ol>
<li><strong>EU Tariffs on Chinese BEVs</strong>: The European Union will impose tariffs on China-made battery electric vehicles (BEVs) starting July 5, 2024, with rates ranging from 17.4% to 37.6% depending on the company.</li>
<li><strong>Tariffs for Specific Chinese Automakers</strong>: The EU has set specific tariffs for the big three Chinese companies - BYD, Geely, and SAIC - and for BEV manufacturers who cooperated with the European Commission's investigation.</li>
<li><strong>EU Investigation into Subsidies</strong>: The investigation found that Chinese states were providing subsidies across the entire local supply chain for BEV production, affecting domestic and foreign companies and the final price of fully-assembled BEVs shipped to Europe.</li>
<li><strong>Provisional Tariffs</strong>: The new tariffs will be provisional and will be in place until EU member states finalize their implementation through a vote, which is expected to happen in four months.</li>
<li><strong>Bank Guarantees</strong>: Customs authorities will request bank guarantees from Chinese BEV exporters while Member states vote on the new tariffs, which could affect the import of BEVs to the EU.</li>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The European Union’s (</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">EU) tariffs on China-made battery electric vehicles (BEVs) will be implemented starting Friday, July 5, 2024.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>



<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The EU released details about the upcoming tariffs on China-made BEVS last month. Initially, the tariffs reached up to 38.1%. In late June, The </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.teslarati.com/european-union-tariff-chinese-ev-imports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">EU revised part of the proposed tariffs</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for specific Chinese automakers. </span></p>



<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The tariffs are not the same for each company shipping BEVs from China. The EU set specific tariffs for the big three Chinese companies. The new tariffs will be imposed on top of the EU’s 10%. </span></p>



<ul><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BYD: 17.4%</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Geely: 19.9%</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SAIC: 37.6%</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BEV manufacturers in China who cooperated with the European Commission’s (EC) investigation [i.e., Tesla and BMW]: 20.8%</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BEV producers in China who did not cooperate with the EC’s investigation: 37.6%</span></li></ul>







<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In 2023, the European</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Commission initiated an anti-subsidy probe on Chinese electric vehicle imports.

<p>According to <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/07/04/eu-confirms-steep-tariffs-on-chinese-electric-vehicles-effective-immediately" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">local media outlets in Europe</a>, the new tariffs will be provisional, and the rates will be imposed until EU member states finalize their implementation through a vote. The first vote on the new tariffs will be in two weeks. The EU member states are expected to finalize their decision in four months.</p>



<p>Customs authorities will request bank guarantees from Chinese BEV exporters while Member states vote on the new tariffs. As a result, BEV customers may not be immediately affected by the tariffs.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Aerolane's "flying piano" technology</strong>: A US start-up called Aerolane is developing a technology that enables small aircraft to "surf" on air currents, similar to how geese fly in a V-formation.</li>
<li><strong>Inspired by migratory birds</strong>: The technology is inspired by the way migrating birds, such as geese, use air currents to fly more efficiently. Aerolane's founders are trying to replicate this phenomenon in a controlled environment.</li>
<li><strong>Towed aircraft testing</strong>: Aerolane is testing its technology by towing small aircraft behind a larger plane, creating the air currents that allow the smaller plane to "surf" through the air.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for air cargo disruption</strong>: Aerolane's technology has the potential to disrupt the market for air cargo, as it could enable smaller, more agile planes to carry goods more efficiently and sustainably.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for reduced emissions</strong>: The technology also has the potential to reduce emissions, as the smaller planes could use less fuel to travel the same distances as larger, traditional cargo planes.</li>

When you see them flying in a v-formation, they are surfing on the air currents created by formation members ahead and around them.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">At an airfield in Texas, Todd Graetz is hoping to use that concept to disrupt the market for air cargo.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Aerolane has been mimicking the tricks used by migrating birds, aided by modified planes towed into the air by another aircraft.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Smoke released from the leading plane allowed cameras installed in the towed aircraft to capture vortices in the air that a glider can exploit to stay aloft.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Their latest test aircraft is known as the “flying piano” because of its poor gliding characteristics. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Its twin engines idle for electrical power while it glides along with propellers turning for purely aerodynamic purposes.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Other tests have measured the tension in the towing line.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">They spotted when the line went slack, indicating the glider is surfing along on currents generated by the aircraft ahead.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Aerolane's plan is to feed all this data into a program that will guide an unmanned cargo plane through wakes and turbulence to exploit the possibilities of gliding long distances without burning fuel.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">One or more such cargo planes could be towed by a jet, also carrying cargo, to their destination where they would land autonomously.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The only fuel costs would come from supplying the towing aircraft’s engines.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In theory this should work like a truck pulling a trailer, with air currents doing much of the heavy lifting. This is what Mr Graetz calls “a combination of gliding and surfing”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The same idea occurred to Airbus, which tested the technique in 2021 with two A350 airliners flying 3km (1.9 miles) apart across the Atlantic.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Although the aircraft were not connected by a tow line, the experiment saw one aircraft winning an uplift from the lead A350’s wake to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel burn.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dOZXmm"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-13b8515c-1 bbjeKz"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6cdc/live/e366d5a0-288a-11ef-8be4-eb2649a65fb5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6cdc/live/e366d5a0-288a-11ef-8be4-eb2649a65fb5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6cdc/live/e366d5a0-288a-11ef-8be4-eb2649a65fb5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6cdc/live/e366d5a0-288a-11ef-8be4-eb2649a65fb5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6cdc/live/e366d5a0-288a-11ef-8be4-eb2649a65fb5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6cdc/live/e366d5a0-288a-11ef-8be4-eb2649a65fb5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6cdc/live/e366d5a0-288a-11ef-8be4-eb2649a65fb5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6cdc/live/e366d5a0-288a-11ef-8be4-eb2649a65fb5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Airbus An Airbus A350 flying behind the contrail of another jet in blue skies" class="sc-13b8515c-0 hbOWRP"><span class="sc-13b8515c-2 iuvLSH">Airbus</span></div></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Airbus has experimented with flying a jet in the wake of another to conserve fuel</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Graetz, a pilot with 12 years’ experience, founded Aerolane with Gur Kimchi, a veteran of Amazon’s drone delivery project, on the basis that “there has got to be a better way to get more out of existing aircraft". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The project has raised eyebrows among experienced pilots.

That’s their business!”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Fred Lopez spent 36 years in aviation operations at cargo giant UPS.

But the prospect of serious fuel savings won him over and now he sits on their advisory board.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Cutting fuel costs is an obsession in civil aviation. When the upturned wing-tips we see out of a cabin window became a standard design feature airlines cut fuel costs by around 5%.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But gliders only consume the fuel required by their tow plane. If that too is a cargo aircraft, a pair of gliders drawn by one jet represents a significant reduction in fuel consumption on a large shipment.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The initial Aerolane design uses their autopilot plus what Mr Lopez terms a human “safety pilot”. This should make certification from the FAA easier.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“Aerolane is not trying to change everything at one go” he says.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Their ultimate goal is autonomous operation using AI, or as Mr Lopez puts it “to pull the pilot out of the seat".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And, if the flying piano can surf, then who knows what's possible?</p></div><div data-component="links-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 jyIQlN"><div class="sc-93223220-0 sc-46222299-0 ctbOlq hmFIuq"><span data-testid="links-title" class="sc-46222299-2 gdGcRT">More Technology of Business</span></div></div></article></div>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text drop-letter-i" id="BoeeBD"><strong><span role="text"><span aria-hidden="true" class="dropcap-outer"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span><span class="sr-only">In</span></span> the spring of 2010</strong>, Juan José Plascencia, founder of Tijuana-based restaurant group <a href="https://www.grupoplascencia.com/">Grupo Plascencia</a>, and his son, Juan José Plascencia Jr., were strolling down the legendary strip Avenida Revolución when they learned that Caesar’s Restaurant was closing. The Tijuana institution that created <a href="https://www.eater.com/24162636/best-caesar-salad-recipe-bon-appetit-andrea-nguyen">Caesar’s salad</a> — arguably the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-10-16-ca-6598-story.html">world’s most famous salad</a> — seemed fated to fade away like the Prohibition-era Hollywood elite and bootlegging mobsters that once commanded the same streets. There was no public outcry, no final celebrations, and no line out the door for one last order of crisp romaine leaves coated in garlicky dressing. The furniture, including its iconic rolling salad carts, was out on the sidewalk; the restaurant’s owners had been evicted and locked out for failing to pay rent.   </p>
<p class="p-large-text" id="zylfJT">“My father and brother saw that all the equipment was out on the street, so they called Armando Avakian, the owner of the building, right away and he asked if we were interested in renting it,” says chef Javier Plascencia, Juan José Plascencia Sr.’s son and owner of Valle de Guadalupe’s <a href="https://sandiego.eater.com/2022/12/5/23494798/michelin-guide-california-star-award-san-diego-restaurants">Michelin-starred</a> Animalón.</p>
<p id="5SedIv">Springing into action, the Grupo Plascencia’s team held an emergency meeting to discuss taking over the historic restaurant, which originally opened in 1923. “My dad thought it was sad to see this institution go away,” Javier says. Avakian, relieved to hand over the keys to a family of respected restaurateurs, signed the deal. Within months, using old photos provided by Avakian as a reference, the restaurant’s much-neglected dark wood interior and black-and-white checkerboard tiled floors were restored to their roaring twenties glory. On July 24, 2010, Caesar’s reopened in its new iteration with Plascencia in place as executive chef. </p>

<p class="p-large-text" id="LwVy17"><strong>The Caesar’s salad came to</strong> prominence before the worldwide fascination with Tijuana-style carne asada and birria de res, both created in the 1950s, and decades before the first lobster joint opened in Puerto Nuevo, which sealed Baja California as a destination for seafood-loving tourists. Long before Valle de Guadalupe grape farmers decided to produce wine instead of selling their crops to make cheap brandy, there was Caesar’s salad. It’s a dish as Tijuana — as Mexican — as a bowl of menudo con pata. July 2024 marks the apparent 100-year anniversary of the invention of Caesar’s salad, now featured widely on restaurant menus, its components sold in plastic supermarket bags across the United States. Tijuana can celebrate the salad’s local roots, but the recipe’s legacy is grounded in its malleability: the Caesar, as it’s more widely referred to today, can be topped with blackened chicken or a salmon filet, its dressing infused with black garlic or made vegan with avocado. The recipe parallels its border town origins, reflecting cross-cultural culinary ingenuity without demanding strict adherence to tradition. </p>
<p id="8lGayj">There’s strong consensus that Caesar’s Restaurant popularized the salad recipe in Tijuana, but its creator and details of its emanation remain somewhat in dispute. According to one theory, the iconic Caesar’s salad was developed by Italian immigrant owner Caesar Cardini (born Césare Cardini) and his brother, the restaurant’s chef, Alex Cardini. However, a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/dining/caesar-salad.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share"><em>New York Times</em> report</a> suggests it may have originated through the mother of one of the restaurant’s cooks, Livio Santini. </p>
<p id="XSogJ2">Its purported anniversary date only adds to the mystique. According to legend, Caesar’s first served its famous salad on July 4, 1924 — a convenient intersection with Independence Day in the United States. Such a date might have appealed to Caesar’s American clientele, who, following the ratification of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution</a> in 1919 and the passage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volstead_Act">Volstead Act</a> by Congress later that year, frequented the border towns of Mexico. During the summer season, businesses in Tijuana, including Caesar’s, seized the opportunity to sell alcohol, gambling, and Caesar’s salad. </p>

<p id="wqkzMY">But by 1933, just under a decade after the dawn of the Caesar, Tijuana’s appeal as a destination for American drinkers waned. The passage of the 21st Amendment repealed Prohibition in the United States and dealt a serious blow to the town’s economy. Once again, Hollywood could stay home for its libations — no need for clandestine trips across the border. As for Caesar’s salad, it was gaining traction in places far-flung from Tijuana.

By that time, Cardini, himself, had moved north to Hollywood to run an Italian grocery store and prepare and package his version of the dressing.  </p>
<p id="z9Drcu">Meanwhile, Tijuana had gradually become a family-friendly tourist destination for day trips to buy souvenirs, take photos with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zonkey_(Tijuana)">zonkeys</a> on La Revu, and eat local Mexican food. In the 1980s, the street surrounding Caesar’s Restaurant became a magnet for Southern California college students (this author among them) heading south to get hammered on dollar beers, eat cheap bacon-wrapped hot dogs, and party ‘til the sun came up. The wild scene sent families hastily scurrying back across the border at dusk — and Tijuana locals, off to more civilized environs — away from the nightly bacchanalia. By the late 1980s, Caesar’s and its glowing invention had sunk into the shadows. Plascencia recalls seeing “shitty green cans” of Kraft Parmesan cheese when eating salads at Caesar’s with his grandfather, and a strip club blossomed in the back of the restaurant. Fallen from its pedestal, Caesar’s had also lost the resonance of its salad’s origin story.</p>
<p id="c0SOZx">“Back in the day, no one gave a shit … The salad was popularized by Americans, not by us,” says Javier, who only recently succeeded in gaining support from the local tourism board to promote the centennial. “[State and city] tourism boards didn’t really pay attention until now.” </p>
<p id="BuKRyd">Further lending to its enigmatic status, the original Caesar’s recipe did not include anchovies, an ingredient now considered indispensable to its composition. According to Mosby, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___et__p_23955662__t_w__d_D&amp;id=66960X1516589&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/lubbock-evening-journal-caesar-salad-sto/41896214/&amp;referrer=eater.com&amp;sref=https://sandiego.eater.com/2024/7/4/24191621/caesar-salad-history-mexican-restaurant-tijuana-anniversary-mexico-javier-plascencia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-cdata='{"rewritten_url":"https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___et__p_23955662__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516589\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/lubbock-evening-journal-caesar-salad-sto/41896214/\u0026referrer=eater.com\u0026sref=https://sandiego.eater.com/2024/7/4/24191621/caesar-salad-history-mexican-restaurant-tijuana-anniversary-mexico-javier-plascencia","subtag_max_length":50,"subtag_delim_length":3,"subtag_key":"xcust","subtag_data":{"xcust":"___et__p_23955662__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder","id":"66960X1516589","xs":"1","url":"https://www.newspapers.com/article/lubbock-evening-journal-caesar-salad-sto/41896214/","referrer":"eater.com","sref":"https://sandiego.eater.com/2024/7/4/24191621/caesar-salad-history-mexican-restaurant-tijuana-anniversary-mexico-javier-plascencia"},"encode_subtag":false}'>foundational recipe</a> included “romaine lettuce, a one-minute egg, garlic croutons, Parmesan or Romano cheese, lemon juice, garlic, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, white pepper, pear vinegar, and olive oil.” Over time, the salad became a base from which to continuously refine and reinvent and refine once more. A simple search for Caesar salad recipes on Google delivers hundreds — if not millions — of variations, from a <a href="https://www.yummy.ph/recipe/filipino-style-caesar-salad-recipe-a439-20230103-lfrm">Pinoy-style Caesar</a> with calamansi juice to a <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/broccoli-caesar">broccoli Caesar</a> that forgoes romaine for sturdier brassicas. Globally, the iterations are boundless; its makeup <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/04/something-weird-happening-caesar-salads/678092/">more an idea</a> than the sum of specific ingredients. </p>
<p id="P3HSap">So it may not be surprising to learn that even the Caesar’s salad at Caesar’s in Tijuana has undergone an evolution. After taking over the restaurant in 2010, Javier realized he needed a veteran of Tijuana’s salad wars to make a change to its long-held recipe. <a href="https://sandiego.eater.com/21508079/caesars-tijuana-salad-iconic-efrain-montoya-interview">Efrain Montoya, a longtime waiter</a> and employee trainer at Caesar’s restaurant, had prepared salads under the previous owners before leaving to work for <a href="https://classicsandiego.com/restaurants/victors-tijuana/">Victor’s</a>, a Caesar’s competitor that opened in 1955. Victor’s was known for the Victor’s salad — a more cost-effective version of the salad made with local cotija cheese and fewer ingredients. Victor’s closed, somewhat fortuitously, at the time Grupo Plascencia moved to reopen Caesar’s. Naturally, Plascencia went after Montoya and his institutional knowledge of the Caesar’s approach.</p>
<p id="CI5SFH">With help from Montoya, the restaurant group restored the Caesar’s salad recipe to its roots, sourcing extra crisp romaine lettuce and Italian Parmigiano-Reggiano from Southern California, while integrating more modern touches. The anchovies, not in Cardini’s original recipe but later the standard in the restaurant, come from U.S.-based <a href="https://rolandfoods.com/">Roland Foods</a>. “We use a 50/50 blend of extra virgin olive oil from either <a href="https://casamagoni.com/en/">Casa Magoni</a> or <a href="https://lacetto.mx/">L.A. Cetto</a> [Valle de Guadalupe wineries], and regular olive oil to cut the bitterness,” says Javier, who has also substituted limes for the original lemons used by Cardini. “Limes are just a better product in Mexico, and more available for us,” he says. Grupo Plascencia was given lots of memorabilia from Avakian, including old menus and photos; former customers donated photos of relatives that now hang on the restaurant’s walls.</p>

<p class="p-large-text" id="vTrnD8"><strong>Caesar’s Restaurant entered the 21st Century</strong> with uncertainty. American tourists still shopped on Avenida Revolución but ventured elsewhere to dine. Then, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/25/travel/escapes/25tijuana.html">La Querencia opened in 2001, placing the spotlight on Baja-Med cuisine</a>. The thrill of eating carnitas at Carnitas Uruapan, or catching the aerial consomé show performed by flashy taqueros at Tacos Fitos, lured in burgeoning food tourists. Soon, food media zeroed in on Tijuana cuisine and the Prohibition-era salad became a footnote, along with Al Capone.</p>
<p id="EpS9zi">Plascencia, his restaurant group, and Montoya, have vigorously fought to spread awareness of their Caesar’s salad since reopening in 2010, during a precarious time in the history of Mexico’s famous border town. Mexico was four years into a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world/la-xpm-2012-dec-01-la-fg-wn-mexico-calderon-cartels-20121130-story.html">violent drug war waged under President Felipe Calderón</a>, combined with the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2007/12/21/E7-24691/oral-declarations-no-longer-satisfactory-as-evidence-of-citizenship-and-identity">2008 WHTI passport requirement to cross the border by land</a>, which brought border crossing to a standstill. (The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic">2009 swine flu pandemic</a> further depreciated its tourism industry.) Tijuana tourism was at another crossroads as businesses shuttered their doors along the once-prosperous Avenida Revolución. </p>
<p id="2IyfKD">Caesar’s reopening in 2010 was a harbinger for the area’s eventual renaissance, paving the way for a fresh bloom of restaurants, breweries, and third-wave coffee shops. Now, on the eve of the salad’s centennial anniversary, local families and tourists alike regularly make the trek to Avenida Revolución for a tableside Caesar’s, even more special when Montoya is your waiter-cum-garde-manger. Plascencia, who says that he is actively looking for the right space and partner to open a new restaurant in San Diego, is proud of his family’s work to save the restaurant and preserve Tijuana’s most famous salad recipe. This vaunted bed of greens is served on innumerable menus around the world, from the room service selections at InterContinental Athénée Palace in Bucharest to a grab-and-go option at the Wolfgang Puck Express inside <a href="https://la.eater.com/2017/5/23/15647702/best-lax-restaurants-guide">LAX’s Terminal 7</a>. Modern iterations include a tableside homage at San Diego’s own <a href="https://sandiego.eater.com/2017/9/14/16301770/born-and-raised-steakhouse-cocktail-bar-little-italy#0">Born and Raised</a>, and a talked-about Thai interpretation with fish sauce, lemongrass, and rice paper croutons at <a href="https://la.eater.com/2023/8/30/23851438/poltergeist-restaurant-button-mash-echo-park-los-angeles-service-check">Los Angeles’s Poltergeist</a>. </p>
<p class="c-end-para" id="K2FRIV">In the end, Caesar’s salad remains an icon dressed in legend. </p>

Mogan</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3>Video Transcript</h3><p>That's the closing bell on Wall Street on the short end, trading day and time.</p><p>Now for market domination over time.</p><p>Let's see where the major averages ended up here for the day.</p><p>We've got Jared Bry also standing by with a closer look at some of the movement that we have been seeing.</p><p>But another record setting day here on the street, we've got the NASDAQ closing up just about 9/10 of a percent, taking a look at the S and P 500.</p><p>That's also at another record here closing up about a half of a percent.</p><p>We also take a look at some strength even within the Russell 2000 closing up just about nearly 2/10 of a percent here to the upside.</p><p>Take a look at some of that sector action, why we're seeing some gains at least here for the S and P and the NASDAQ and some of that having to do with NVIDIA.</p><p>When you think about the biggest contributor here, at least to the S and PS gains, you look at NVIDIA closing just around 4.5% when you take a look at that three day charts and that momentum that we have seen for NVIDIA.</p><p>And I, I guess too much of a different of a picture here as you take a look at what has certainly been a volatile couple of trading days here for NVIDIA over the last several days.</p><p>But again, closing up just above 100 and 28 bucks a share on a sector basis.</p><p>Still looking at a bit of a mixed picture, Jared over to you.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>And I'll note that XL K was the only sector that's tech sector that closed at a record high.</p><p>And also we've been seeing some strength here today in materials and also consumer discretionary.</p><p>And I would remind people that consumer discretionary just had a big breakout yesterday.</p><p>The two biggest components, Tesla and Amazon and Amazon closed down today down about 1.2%.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="28"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>But I want to take a look at Tesla up 6.5% over these last three days.</p><p>Up basically 25%.</p><p>That is a huge gain.</p><p>And when you take a look at the longer term picture, you can see, well, you know, it still hasn't climbed all the way up to the mid point quite yet of this very extended trading range over the last five years.</p><p>But it's quickly getting there.</p><p>I think some place around 260 or so, probably due for a pause if not a little bit before.</p><p>But let's also take a look at some of the other leaders that we've seen emerge today.</p><p>It was a great day for chip stocks.</p><p>Also solar bouncing back cannabis stocks, Chinese stocks disruption.</p><p>So that would be unprofitable tech.</p><p>And let's just dig into a couple of those.</p><p>Here are the art components boosted mainly by Tesla.</p><p>But we're also seeing some green by beam therapeutics up 5% China I mentioned was also in the green today here we got T com.</p><p>That's trip.com up 4% Alibaba up 2.5, Baidu up and a half percent.</p><p>So another area that's been under pressure kind of bouncing back.</p><p>But all in all, I just bring it to the fact that July the 1st 10 trading days of July the most bullish of the year when you take into consideration the beginning of a month or an end of a month.</p><p>So especially going into this holiday shortened week.</p><p>Not a lot of surprise to see the bulls in charge here.</p><p>We'll have to see what comes Friday, which is kind of an odd day for us with the employment situation report falling after this market holiday.</p><p>Thank you, Jared stocks close and mix on this holiday shortened trading day with the S and P hitting its 33rd record high of the year for more on what this means for investors entering the second half gonna bring in Tyler Ellard Portfolio Manager Gradient Investment.</p><p>So Tyler, it's good to see you.</p><p>Um as my colleague Jared was just saying there bulls have been in charge S and P hitting its 33rd record high of the, of the year.</p><p>What do you make of that, Tyler, what do you tell your clients about it?</p><p>Do you think the good times continue?</p><p>Yeah, I mean, I think generally speaking, good times could continue, but the back half of this year certainly gonna be choppy.</p><p>Obviously, we, we, we're getting a contentious election coming up, who knows who the the candidates are officially gonna be on the, on the Democratic side after the news today.</p><p>Um So it's definitely gonna be a choppy second half.</p><p>But if you look historically, statistically speaking, second half on a, on a election year, presidential election year and on a year, that's been this strong, you typically get decent performance in the back half.</p><p>But I think from a, from a broader perspective, certainly start taking some pro profits on these names that have done well and try and diversify the portfolio a little bit.</p><p>We don't need to risk everything on betting, betting it all on NVIDIA right now.</p><p>Obviously, it's, it's done very well, but I think you get a, a happier client with a more diversified portfolio from the, the top six.</p><p>So what are you diversifying into there, Tyler?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>You know, I think energy is a, is a good option right now.</p><p>Um We like Schlumberger or Slb as they kind of changed their name.</p><p>A little bit or Sun Core Energy uh Canadian name, those are a couple.</p><p>Uh you could look at some of the in industrial side.</p><p>So from the infrastructure Bill Crh, a cement company is, is certainly one that we like.</p><p>Um, but you know, that doesn't say that we're, we're taking everything off the table from these mega caps, right?</p><p>We still like the Googles, we still like Meta and we still like Amazon.</p><p>We still think there's room for to run, but we may just be a little bit underweight on the nvidia's and Apples and Microsoft's right now.</p><p>What about healthcare, Tyler?</p><p>I see that in my notes here.</p><p>That's also a sector you're bullish on.</p><p>We are, we are generally speaking, most of the health care play right now has been towards G LP ones, at least for the last call a year and a half.</p><p>I do think there's some, some opportunity outside of those names in, in the more the diabetes space.</p><p>Dexcom being one of them is, is kind of my top pick right now.</p><p>Um Their ability to, to reach from, from just the US market into international markets and the new products that they're bringing on.</p><p>You know, I think this company has a pretty strong growth trajectory in front of them.</p><p>Um, and, and plenty of tail winds behind them.</p><p>So I, I think from a uh health care side, that would be the name that I would go with Tyler when you take a look at how calm the market's been, really, we've had this absence of volatility.</p><p>Now, for quite some time, is that going to change with earnings season?</p><p>Do you think that might, could potentially introduce maybe this next wave of volatility leading up to then?</p><p>Obviously, the election, I do.</p><p>Certainly, investors are going to be paying attention to Q two and, and how those earnings go Q four of last year, Q one of this year has been strong so far.</p><p>Um Earnings revisions have actually been positive, but I think more of the focus is gonna be on the election and, and what those policies are are going to tell us uh just like Monday, for example, interest rates spiked on, on potential policy actions of, of either party.</p><p>So I think yes, Q two is gonna be important but I think sentiment and, and focus is gonna be more towards the election and, and how, and, and diving deep into the policies of, of either candidate and how that's really going to affect the market for the next six months to a year.</p><p>Tyler, we, we got through this almost entire interview.</p><p>We, we didn't even mention the Fed.</p><p>Um which in itself is kind of interesting.</p><p>I mean, d does you as an investor or, or how, how close are you mining the fed?</p><p>Whether the FED cuts this year?</p><p>Do you think that's, that's critical to whether the market can keep moving higher.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Look, I think as we entered the year, the consensus was 6 to 7.</p><p>We initially thought based on, on our expectations was 1 to 2.</p><p>Um, data was strong, growth was strong, fed was holding tight.</p><p>Uh Their, their commentary didn't suggest they were gonna cut.</p><p>Now, we've kind of pivot a little bit but we still think we might get one or not.</p><p>No cut at all.</p><p>Um I know the Fed likes to be apo but I would say that a cut in front of a contentious election that could be construed as, as a political action.</p><p>I don't think the Fed wants to get involved in that.</p><p>So I think your best bet is probably around December.</p><p>And despite all that data has still remained strong on the economic front.</p><p>So there really isn't any reason for them to, to make any cuts at this point unless if we do start to see, you know, more deterioration um through September and, and October Tyler.</p><p>When you take a look at some of the expectations here for inflation, we have seen a bit of this disinflationary trend or disinflation trend.</p><p>Powell was commenting on it uh earlier this week out of Portugal saying that he has been encouraged by that progress.</p><p>What do you think that last mile as the Fed works to get back to that 2% goal?</p><p>Is that something that's going to be very tough?</p><p>Take a long time?</p><p>I guess, how are you evaluating that as you lay out some of those opportunities that you're finding within the market.</p><p>It's certainly gonna be tough for them to get to that 2% and, and certainly don't expect it to be at 2% by the end of this year.</p><p>And, and Paul has even said that.</p><p>So for us, what's important is looking at, obviously, housing data is, is one of the stickier components.</p><p>But then you also do get some headwinds from last year's disinflation and from some of the the uh consumer durables, you know, some they had some negative prints last year.</p><p>And so I think there could be some headwinds that could pop up this year.</p><p>So I think generally speaking, you need housing to come down or slow.</p><p>I should say as well as some of the the energy prices and food prices.</p><p>I think that's gonna be the the biggest headwind um and keeping inflation this sticky.</p><p>So it's gonna be a challenge and I don't expect them to get to that 2% target anytime uh this year.</p><p>All right, Tyler Eligard.</p><p>Great to have you.</p><p>Thanks so much for talking with us here.</p><p>All right, we got the latest reading on the housing market, mortgage rates higher for the first time in five weeks.</p><p>We wanna bring in Yahoo Finance's Rebecca Chen joining us now with the details.</p><p>Hey, Rebecca, hey, Shana, we have seen mortgage rate, the fixed 30 year average rate increase about nine basis points this week according to Freddie Mac.</p><p>Now, this is the first time since May, that rate has increased.</p><p>And also the first time in over four weeks that it went up, uh, we've seen rates hover around the 7% mark for a while now.</p><p>And one housing actually said this has helped inventory to come back to the market.</p><p>And the reason is because with a more stabilized mortgage rate, more homeowners are willing to list their home by giving up their lower mortgage rate because and the reason is because they are getting a lot more used to the higher rate environment that we are seeing today.</p><p>Um What has been happening is as Americans you know, move on with their life.</p><p>Maybe they have a new baby, maybe they need a new school district.</p><p>It's getting to a time where some people have to move and put that inventory on the market.</p><p>Now from the home buyer side, we have yet to see a return of demand at the activity on the mortgage activity.</p><p>Mortgage application is still very low according to the latest statistics.</p><p>But housing experts are saying that as we see mortgage rates stabilize or even decline, we will see more inventory on the market.</p><p>And in turn, that will help with the housing prices and bring buyers back, Rebecca.</p><p>Thank you, appreciate it.</p><p>Have a great fourth with a rich history dating back to the 19th century.</p><p>Eli Lilly has faced struggles and successes but a booming market cap has quickly turned it into the biggest pharmaceutical brand in the world.</p><p>Let's dive into Lily's biggest moments with beyond the ticker bidding.</p><p>Big A made in America Walmart launching a line of T shirts from direct to consumer brand American Giant just in time for the fourth of July holiday.</p><p>And it's a move to also combat the rise of fast fashion.</p><p>Joining us now is Byard Winthrop.</p><p>He is American giants, founder and Ceo Byard.</p><p>It's great to have you and congratulations on this partnership that you just reached with Walmart.</p><p>I'm curious what kind of insight you can give us just in terms of the ability, I guess the ease at which you have been able to 100% manufacture your items within the US and, and some of the biggest challenges maybe that you have had faced running up here and to ultimately uh reaching the significant partnership here with Walmart.</p><p>Well, thanks for having me on Shana.</p><p>You know, the the US textile base has been under a lot of pressure over the last 35 years, is so much of offshoring has hit that industry particularly hard.</p><p>Um And like a lot of other offshore manufacturing bases, um It is increasingly dependent on orders that are one month out, two months out with a real inability to invest longer term in the automation and innovation and job retraining and hiring that's required to stay competitive uh on an international basis.</p><p>And so, um though this, this partnership with Walmart, um never easy to hit that kind of volume that Walmart requires.</p><p>Um it was a real breakthrough moment, I think for our brand and for textiles more broadly, when you have a partner, like Walmart, stepping up to a long term commitment and a volume commitment that allows uh the supply chain partners to really rethink the way they're thinking about um producing apparel in the United States again.</p><p>So it's an important moment, I think for the industry and for and for us as a brand and beer.</p><p>I, I guess two questions for you.</p><p>I'm just curious um first is what, why, you know, it was so important Bayer to you to, to make the product here in America.</p><p>Why was that such a, a core value to you?</p><p>A core mission?</p><p>And secondly, I'm just curious, Baer kind of just the economics of your business.</p><p>I mean, how much is more does it cost you to make the product here than it would if you, you know, did like so many of your rivals did and just made it overseas?</p><p>Well, well, it costs more.</p><p>Josh and I, and I would argue it should, I mean, I think one of the real benefits about manufacturing domestically is you, when you make things here, you do it within the constraints of the American system, which includes human rights protections, environmental protections, child labor protections, living wages, things that I think we all as Americans really.</p><p>And, and there's a bit of an inconsistency in my judgment when we allow our biggest brands to manufacture overseas, getting around many of those constraints while we hold our domestic facilities to those uh those high standards, we got to pick a lane one or the other.</p><p>Um, and I felt the impact of that over the last 35 years was hitting middle class, working Americans really hard.</p><p>And um if we have as, as, as many of us know, middle class wages have been stagnant over the last 35 years.</p><p>Um And that dynamic doesn't end well for America broadly.</p><p>And I think we have to start investing again into the communities that are making things here.</p><p>So we begin to give good opportunities to those towns, those cities that want to have good, viable and dignified work.</p><p>And so that, that was a real founding mission for, for our brand.</p><p>Um But, but maybe to the root of your question, it make it costs more to make things in the United States.</p><p>And that put, put uh most of American giants pricing in the premium end of the market.</p><p>And it really was out of reach for a lot of working Americans that need to have access to good quality products, ideally good quality American made products at places that make sense for them.</p><p>And this Walmart partnership really has broken into that tier in a, in a way that I had begun to wonder if it was going to be possible for us to do that without that kind of commitment and volume from a big partner like Walmart.</p><p>So it opens up a whole new consumer segment for us and it really has caused us to think really rethink and reimagine what a domestic textile capability can be.</p><p>And hopefully that challenge begins to make its way into the big brands in the US.</p><p>By.</p><p>Have you heard interest from other big brands to similarly try to take on by sorry, sorry to cut you off there.</p><p>You you dropped for a second on Mike, but Mike, my question is you certainly obviously now have this partnership with Walmart, are you having any sort of conversations?</p><p>Seeing some interest from some of the other larger brands at this point?</p><p>Iii I think the larger brands and retailers have as a generalized statement, have tried to be a part of the solution here and I think this now points a way forward for them to, to join the conversation.</p><p>So I I'll leave it there, but I think there's a lot of interest um but there's been confusion about how to do it.</p><p>And I think this is a, this is a good example of how to get it done.</p><p>And so hopefully that's gonna encourage others to join in all.</p><p>Have you been able to find it, it's still a tight labor market.</p><p>It's hard out.</p><p>It's hard for employers really to find the labor that they need.</p><p>Are you, have you been able to hire the workers that you need to expand at the rate at which you were hoping to do?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>It's a good question.</p><p>I mean, I think we manufacture typically in, in rural and urban communities that need work.</p><p>And so we've been pretty lucky in that regard that there's a lot of talented workers that are looking for good durable jobs by and large.</p><p>Uh We've been able to hire the people and the talent that we need.</p><p>Um So I think there's lots of communities, maybe it doesn't show up in the labor numbers, but a lot of communities that need, they need good employers there and, and where textiles are domiciled, it's often in those communities that need that work.</p><p>And so we've had good success in that regard by, I'm curious, what's next for your company?</p><p>Um Do you, do you wanna stay private or, or would you be considering testing the public markets at some point?</p><p>Uh You know, I I it's not something I spend a lot of time thinking about other than to say, I think as a private entity, you're allowed to make decisions that are longer term in nature.</p><p>And I think that's pretty fundamental with an American manufactured footprint that you're not beholden to quarterly reporting and you can think longer term.</p><p>So we tried to think of our investor base and our planning in that way.</p><p>And so I think that makes it likely that we will stay private for as far forward as I can see.</p><p>Bard, give us a sense of the broader retail landscape right now.</p><p>What are some of the trends that you're seeing from the consumer?</p><p>Are you in fact seeing the consumer remain under pressure, maybe adjusting their spending as a result.</p><p>I I, you know, I I'm probably not the person to speak to that in a lot of depth.</p><p>I can just give you my anecdotal view of it, which is I think that in, in categories like apparel, I think the premium end of the market has been under some pressure.</p><p>Um I think that the consumers are looking for value now.</p><p>I think, I think the the uh the the pressure of inflation and day to day goods uh is, is hampering people's ability to spend on things that are more discretionary.</p><p>And so we're seeing at the high end of at least in our business, some pressure, we have a lot more activity at the lower end of our pricing paradigm and we expect to see that follow through in this Walmart Partnership as well.</p><p>Byard, it was great to have you on the show today.</p><p>Enjoy the fourth.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Happy fourth to you both, smartphone innovation has largely slowed it down over the past few years.</p><p>But A I could soon change all that.</p><p>At least that's what smartphone makers are hoping.</p><p>Joining us now is Yahoo Finance's very own, Dan Hale.</p><p>Dan.</p><p>That's right.</p><p>Josh, we're expected to see some big announcements from major companies in the coming weeks.</p><p>About A I and how it relates to their smartphones up first.</p><p>Uh is Samsung which is going to host its Galaxy unpacked event in Paris on July 10th.</p><p>They're expected to announce some A I updates, potentially some of their new foldable phones uh as well.</p><p>And how A I fits into that Samsung's already uh revealed its Galaxy A I that was part of its S 24 line of phones that came out earlier this year.</p><p>But there really weren't too many big features uh that took really a lot of advantage of generative A I.</p><p>It was more about photo editing and uh translation apps.</p><p>Uh We also have Google coming in August with an event made by uh Google where they're going to launch their next generation pixel smartphones.</p><p>They're gonna obviously have a lot of A I uh to do with that.</p><p>Both companies have basically been saying uh in so many words, we're having A I as part of these phones, it's going to be a big part.</p><p>Samsung has a splash campaign.</p><p>They put out billboards across the world.</p><p>Google has a youtube uh ad saying exactly that.</p><p>Uh and so the companies really seem to be uh wanting to push A I front and center as the main reason for their new phones.</p><p>This is similar to what we've seen from Apple, which rolled out its Apple Intelligence last month uh at its WW DC event, that's gonna be a big piece of their iphone 16 and smartphones going forward since the features only work on the iphone 15 pro line right now, not even the iphone 15.</p><p>So all three of these companies, big smartphone players, mostly Samsung and Apple, the two largest in the world are now going to be head going, head to head with A I.</p><p>It's no longer gonna be uh not necessarily, not lo longer, but the focus isn't gonna be as much on cameras or screen size.</p><p>It's going to be about what A I can do.</p><p>Now, the big question is, do consumers care about that?</p><p>And I think what Apple laid out at WW DC was how generative A I can fit across its ecosystem and benefit consumers, not just be kind of a photo editing kind of feature that Samsung had initially rolled out Google as well.</p><p>Uh And so what I'm looking for for Samsung to do is to provide some kind of broader ecosystem features that would fit with generative A I.</p><p>But the, the big thing here I think is expect plenty of these companies to start talking up their A I capabilities even more so and putting them forward as a way for them to distinguish themselves from their competition.</p><p>All right, thank you, Dan.</p><p>Appreciate it.</p><p>Now, let's take a look at what to watch for the rest of the week.</p><p>The markets will be closed tomorrow for the fourth of July holiday.</p><p>But there are some news to watch over the UK.</p><p>Tomorrow is election day in the United Kingdom.</p><p>British voters will elect a new prime minister and parliament and polls suggest it will be a landslide victory for the labor party.</p><p>Moving on to Friday, July 5th.</p><p>The full jobs report for June is coming out that morning.</p><p>Economists forecasting non farm payrolls to drop down to 190,000 while the unemployment rate holds steady at 4%.</p><p>Hourly wages also expected to grow by 0.3% slightly slower compared to the prior reading.</p><p>Now this coming after a better than expected jobs opening print yesterday in ad P employment though coming in lower than expected today and moving over to the fed, we get some fed commentary from New York fed President John Williams Friday morning, Williams is giving the keynote to a lecture organized by the Reserve Bank of India.</p><p>This coming after comments from Williams today in Portugal about the real neutral rate of interest expressing skepticism that the neutral rate has risen.</p><p>Happy birthday to meta's threads.</p><p>The social media site turning one this week, its launch began with a bang meta scooped up nearly 100 million or 100 monthly act 100 million monthly active users.</p><p>I believe in the first three months of threads launch.</p><p>But since then growth has slowed meta Ceo Mark Zuckerberg announcing this morning that the app owes more than 100 and 75 million monthly users.</p><p>Now, the app was originally marketed, it's a quote unquote friendlier version of X, the site formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>And there's still a wide gap between the two X A and March and it sees around 550 million users monthly here.</p><p>So again, they've got a ways to go to catch up.</p><p>We talked a lot about it.</p><p>Threads was debuted.</p><p>You tried threads?</p><p>I've tried it.</p><p>Have you?</p><p>Yeah, I, I did.</p><p>You know, it's not something I check regularly, but I have dabbled with it a little bit.</p><p>Yeah, I'm not, let's just say, I'm not really surprised that we haven't seen dramatic growth here over the last year.</p><p>Well, that is a wrap on today's market domination over time.</p><p>Be sure to come back Friday at 3:30 p.m. Eastern for market domination have a great fourth of July.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>

<li>A typical Fourth of July cookout in the US will cost $71.22 for a group of 10 people, a 5% increase from last year and a 30% increase from 2019, making it the most expensive level on record.</li>

<li>Meat is the most expensive line item for a barbecue, with 2 pounds of ground beef costing an average of $12.77, up 11% from last year, due to a combination of factors including low cattle inventory and record-lows in beef in cold storage.</li>
<li>On the other hand, chicken prices are expected to be lower than last year, with an average cost of 2 pounds of chicken breast at $7.83, a 4% drop from 2023 and 13% lower than the record-high in 2022, due to increased biosecurity measures and efforts to offset losses and keep prices affordable.</li>
<li>The higher costs are attributed to inflation, which has been affecting the economy and the farm economy over the past several years, according to the American Farm Bureau report.</li>

It marks the most expensive level on record, and is the first time ever that prices have topped more than $7 per person.</p><p>Driving the increase are a number of barbecue staples, including ground beef, pork chops, hamburger buns, cheese slices, strawberries, potato chips, ice cream and lemonade.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/high-inflation-is-changing-way-americans-retire" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HIGH INFLATION IS CHANGING THE WAY AMERICANS RETIRE</strong></a></p> <p>"Your grocery bill may be a shock, but it is in line with the inflation that has roiled the economy – including the farm economy – over the last several years," the report said.</p><div class="inline image-ct"> <div class="caption"><p><span>A family hosts a barbecue in the backyard of their home.</span><span> (iStock / iStock)</span></p></div></div><p>Meat is the most expensive line item for a barbecue. This year, 2 pounds of ground beef will cost an average of $12.77, up more than $1, or 11%, from one year ago. The increase in beef prices is likely because cattle inventory in the U.S. is the smallest that it has been in 73 years, and beef in cold storage is setting record lows for recent years. </p><p>Pork chop prices have also ticked higher, climbing about 8% nationally to an average of $15.49. </p><p>However, Americans can expect to pay less for chicken than they did one year ago. The average cost of 2 pounds of chicken breast is about $7.83, a 4% drop from 2023 and down more than 13% from the record-high in 2022. More poultry farmers implemented biosecurity measures to stop the spread of the avian flu and to help their flocks recover.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>High CD interest rates</strong>: Certificate of deposit (CD) accounts have been a smart and effective way to grow your money in recent years, thanks to inflation and a higher rate climate. Rates on CDs have grown exponentially, making it easy to find accounts with rates of 4% or higher.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment required</strong>: Unlike other savings vehicles, CDs require savers to commit to leaving their money in the account for a specified period of time, known as the term.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation report upcoming</strong>: The next inflation report is set to be released on July 11, which may impact CD rates in the future. Savers may want to take advantage of the current high rates by opening a long-term CD now.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term CDs recommended</strong>: With the next inflation report upcoming, long-term CDs may be a good option for savers who are willing to lock their money up for a longer period of time.</li>
<li><strong>CDs offer stability</strong>: CDs offer stability and security, as they typically offer a fixed interest rate and a guaranteed return, making them a good option for savers who want to grow their money with minimal risk.</li>

But with the next inflation report scheduled for release on July 11 (detailing June's inflation rate), some savers may be wondering which option is better for them now. For many, the answer is clear. Below, we'll explain why you should open a long-term CD before the July inflation report is released.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-long-term-cd-before-the-july-inflation-report&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-long-term-cd-before-the-july-inflation-report%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=5be0b79d-d991-44c9-a2ce-f99ee79d4b05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See how much more interest you could be earning with a top long-term CD here</a>.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Why you should open a long-term CD before the July inflation report</strong></h2><p>Here are three reasons why you should strongly consider opening a long-term CD before the next inflation report is released.</p>

    
<p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'>
    </p>
<h3><strong>Rates are only slightly lower than short-term CDs</strong></h3><p>Sure, rates on short-term CDs are slightly higher than long-term accounts right now (<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-short-term-cds-have-higher-rates-than-long-term-ones-right-now/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">a direct reversal from historic trends</a></span>). But the difference is negligible (generally less than a full percentage point). So it makes sense to take advantage now. You could potentially earn <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-make-hundreds-of-dollars-with-a-cd-now/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">hundreds</a></span> and even <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-earn-thousands-of-dollars-with-a-cd-now/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">thousands</a></span> of dollars right now, depending on the amount you deposit and the rate you lock in. CD rates change often, however, so you should <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-long-term-cd-before-the-july-inflation-report&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-long-term-cd-before-the-july-inflation-report%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=5be0b79d-d991-44c9-a2ce-f99ee79d4b05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shop around</a> and consider being proactive while rates this high are still readily available.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-long-term-cd-before-the-july-inflation-report&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-long-term-cd-before-the-july-inflation-report%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=5be0b79d-d991-44c9-a2ce-f99ee79d4b05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get started with a top long-term CD here now</a>.</p><h3><strong>Rates will likely fall soon</strong></h3><p>As inflation continues to fall, a cut to the federal funds rate becomes more likely. And while those cuts may not come as often <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/interest-rate-cut-2024-when-will-fed-cut-rates-inflation-experts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">as many anticipated</a></span> at the start of the year, there's likely to be at least one cut before the end of 2024. When that comes, rates on savings vehicles like CDs will fall in tandem. So don't wait for that to happen. And remember that even a hint at an imminent rate cut could reduce what lenders offer on these products, so there may be less time to take advantage of today's high rates than it seems.</p><h3><strong>Your returns will be locked - and predictable</strong></h3><p>CD rates, as mentioned, are locked and will remain the same for the full CD term. That's a major advantage right now in the face of rate cuts. No matter what rates drop to during your long-term CD account lifespan, you'll still earn the high rate you opened the account with. These returns, unlike those that can be earned with <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fixed-vs-variable-interest-rate-which-is-better-for-your-savings-now/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">variable-rate high-yield savings accounts</a></span>, will be both locked and predictable. In an evolving rate climate that's a major advantage when <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-a-cd-is-better-than-these-popular-alternatives/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">compared to other popular alternatives</a></span>. </p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'>
    </p>
<h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>Whle both short-term and long-term CDs are advantageous to open now, there's a strong argument to be made for pursuing a long-term one as soon as possible, preferably before the next inflation report release. Rates on these accounts are still comparable to many alternatives (even if they're slightly lower). And considering that these rates are locked and that, if you wait, you could be shopping for a CD in a lower rate climate, it makes sense to lock in the highest rate long-term CD you can find now. Just be careful to only deposit an amount you're comfortable parting with for the full CD term or you could wind up paying the early withdrawal penalty to regain access to your funds.</p>

<p>The bills use printed patterns to generate holograms of the portraits facing different directions, depending on the angle of view. Japan's National Printing Bureau, which is responsible for printing <a class="internal-link" href="/en/japans-yen-dips-to-34-year-low-against-us-dollar/a-68680268">yen</a>, claimed it is the world's first for paper money.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Fumio Kishida praised the "historic" state-of-the-art features of the new 10,000 yen, 5,000 yen and 1,000 yen notes.</p>

<p>"I hope the people will like the new bills, and they will help energize the <a class="internal-link" href="/en/japanese-angst-as-india-set-to-overtake-as-4th-largest-economy/a-69044686">Japanese economy</a>," he told reporters at the Bank of Japan after the unveiling ceremony.</p>

<p>Local media confirmed that following the launch of the new currency, the older bills will remain valid.</p>

<p>Japan is still a cash-heavy economy where cashless payments have been slower to gain traction.</p>

<p>"Although the world is moving toward cashless interactions, we believe cash remains important as a way for safely settling payments anywhere and anytime," said Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda.</p>

<h2>About the new Japanese banknotes</h2>

<p>Kishida noted that the people featured on the new currency celebrate capitalism, equality for women and scientific innovation.</p>

<p>The 10,000 yen bill, worth about €57.5 or $62, has the face of Eiichi Shibusawa who is known as "the father of Japanese capitalism." </p>

<p>Shibusawa is a key figure in building Japan's modern economy and is credited with founding hundreds of companies.</p>

<p>The 5,000 yen bill, worth about €28 or $30, features Umeko Tsuda who was a pioneer feminist and educator.</p>

<p>The 1,000 yen note, worth about €5.75 or $6.20, portrays physician and bacteriologist Shibasaburo Kitasato. He was instrumental in the research of tetanus and the bubonic plague.</p>

<p>The backs of each of the bills feature Tokyo Station, wisteria flowers and ukiyo-e artist Katsushika Hokusai's <a class="internal-link" href="/en/japan-deaths-on-mount-fuji-ahead-of-climbing-season/a-69488977">Mount Fuji.</a></p>

<p>The banknotes also feature larger print, making them easier for the nation's aging population to read.  </p><div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"><h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Tourists bask in the glow of Japan's weak yen" class="headline"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"><g fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"></path></g></svg>Tourists bask in the glow of Japan's weak yen</h2><div class="render-container"><div class="hh5424a s1xhie46 sd4yz45"><div class="bg-poster"><video id="video-68699081" dir="ltr" controls="" playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-duration="01:29" data-play-btn-title="Play video" class="dw-player video-js vjs-fluid"><source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/vps/webvideos/ENG/2024/BUSI/BUSIENG240329_QWIYen_CMS_01SMW_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"><p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p></source></video></div></div></div></div>
