    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Donald Trump</strong> opposes the Biden administration's policy to promote electric vehicles, calling it a "radical plan" that would harm the economy in automaking states.</li>
<li><strong>Voters' concerns</strong>: Some voters, like Jim Cagle, a retired Jeep assembly-line worker from Toledo, Ohio, are concerned about the practicalities of owning an all-electric vehicle, such as how they would charge it, especially in areas with limited charging infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Partisan politics</strong>: Trump and his allies are using the electric vehicle issue to attack the Biden administration and Democrats, while Democrats are promoting their climate reduction goals and advocating for homegrown technology over competition from China.</li>
<li><strong>Regional sentiments</strong>: The issue of electric vehicles is particularly significant in industrial heartlands like Ohio and Michigan, where voters may decide the winner of the presidential and Senate elections.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty and nuance</strong>: Despite the partisan rhetoric, interviews with voters suggest a more complicated and nuanced dynamic than a simple Republican-Democrat divide, with voters' opinions ranging from practical concerns to environmental concerns.</li>

                                        <p>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) — <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></span> says the Biden administration’s policy to promote electric vehicles is a “radical plan” that would kill the economy in automaking states.

Cagle parks his car on the street because he does not have a garage. </p><p>“Can you imagine having a cord running out to the street?” Cagle said as he cleaned his minivan at a car wash near a General Motors transmission plant that later this year is set to begin building electric drive units.</p>
    

<p>Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and others say Biden’s push for EVs is unfair for consumers and amounts to government overreach, and ultimately will be a liability for Democrats. Trump even squeezed in an attack at the top of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-2024-campaign-trial-4629840240cb308c5eae335532ad17ed">his remarks</a></span> Friday after his criminal conviction in New York. </p>
    

<p>Democrats have been less vocal and more nuanced, advocating Biden’s climate reduction goals while promoting homegrown technology over competition from China.</p>



<p>But interviews with about 20 voters in the pivotal industrial heartlands of Ohio and Michigan reveal a more complicated dynamic among people who may decide the winner of November’s presidential and Senate elections.</p>

<p>The Toledo area is itself a crossroads for the issue. It’s an automotive city <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-ohio-toledo-af8c97a41debc383157e4fd0884ee19b">making the shift</a></span> from the internal combustion engine to electric power, like neighboring Michigan, a presidential swing state that is synonymous with the auto industry.</p>
    
<p>Toledo has not only produced Jeeps since World War II, but it is also home to oil refineries that supply gasoline across the Midwest and to parts manufacturers for gas and diesel vehicles.</p>
    


    

<p>It’s here where people like Cagle say issues such as the cost of gas and groceries will be more important than EVs when they vote. But during the interviews with people across the political spectrum, many were skeptical of the vehicles and critical of the Democratic president’s tax credits.</p><p>“You cannot be shoving EVs down our throat,” said Joe Dempsey of Oregon, Ohio, who drives a Toyota gas-electric hybrid that does not require charging. “Let the American people decide if it’s going to happen.” </p><h2>VULNERABLE SENATE DEMOCRAT IS A TARGET</h2><p>The issue has put some Democrats in a tricky spot — perhaps none more so than Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, one of the Republicans’ top targets as the GOP looks to win Senate control.</p><p>He is having to navigate a changing auto industry and his support for the president’s environmental goals in a state that Trump carried twice by 8 percentage points.</p>
    

<p>A petroleum manufacturing industry group has spent about $16 million on advertising criticizing Biden’s policy to promote EVs, and that total includes about $1.5 million in Ohio criticizing Brown for his support, according to AdImpact and the group’s reporting. In addition to Ohio, the ads are airing in six other swing states and Montana, a GOP-leaning state where Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is seeking reelection. </p>
    

<p>Republicans, long unable to crack Brown’s blue-collar backing, see linking him to Biden’s sweeping 2022 <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-inflation-reduction-climate-anniversary-9950f7e814ac71e89eee3f452ab17f71">Inflation Reduction Act</a></span>, which created tax credits for EV buyers, as one way to do it in an election year.</p><p>Brown voted for the act, aimed at fighting climate change in part by providing a $7,500 tax credit for new EV sales to spur steps toward the president’s goal of making EVs 50 percent of all new vehicle sales by 2030. Republicans and their allies routinely refer to the policy incorrectly as a government mandate.</p><p>But Brown has pledged to oppose a rule change this summer proposed by Biden to allow EVs that are built in the United States but include Chinese-made components to qualify for the credit. </p>
    

<p>“This will allow China to infiltrate the American auto supply chain, at American taxpayers’ expense,” Brown said in a statement in May. “American tax dollars should support American manufacturing and American workers — not enrich Chinese companies.”</p>
    

<p>Brown, a progressive with a pro-worker mantra, has little to worry about in maintaining his party’s base. But he appears to be aware of the risks of being seen as allying too strongly with Biden, who is unpopular in Ohio, said former Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, a fellow Democrat. </p><p>“Sherrod doesn’t have to worry about Democrats. They love him,” Ryan said. “The question is, can he make up the middle? I think he can. And if he is seen as disagreeing with the left, it’s only good for him.”</p><h2>BIDEN, DEMOCRATS MAKE THEIR CASE</h2><p>Biden has visited EV plants and grinned as he <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-detroit-north-america-auto-show-e30f83b1d6e7df491b1a7953507dbaa4">test drove</a></span> the new electric Cadillac at the Detroit Auto Show. His chief surrogate in Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, has advocated for Biden’s policy, but with an eye on protecting the industry vital to her state. </p>
    

<p>“We’ve got to incentivize innovation. There’s no question,” Whitmer said in an interview before Trump visited the state in May, where he railed against EVs. “We cannot let Chinese companies be the only ones innovating around electric vehicles because then they will eat our lunch.”</p><p>Biden’s campaign notes that the president’s policies are aimed at moving EV jobs, many of which were left in China during the Trump administration, into the United States.</p><p>“Donald Trump would rather lie about President Biden’s policies than face his own betrayals to the middle class,” Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa said in a statement. “President Biden wants the future of auto manufacturing built in America, not China.”</p><p>According to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in April, relatively small shares of Americans — around 3 in 10 or less — see a benefit from electric vehicles for themselves personally, the economy or the U.S. auto industry.</p><p>John Hiskey, a Vietnam veteran from Toledo, said he thinks EVs are a great idea and he doubts the industry would be this far along without a push from the government. But he has no interest in getting one until he can visit his grandkids without making multiple stops and taking time to charge the vehicle.</p><p>“I don’t want to wait a half-hour unless they start putting them in bars,” said Hiskey, adding that his vote will not be influenced by which party or politician backs EVs. </p><p>Others said the vehicles are cost-prohibitive, even with the tax credit. </p><p>“How can they afford electric vehicles when it’s hard to afford living?” said Dru Wilson, 21, who attends college outside Toledo. </p><p>Although the petroleum manufacturers represent a fraction of what the two major parties’ political action committees are spending in battleground states, it dwarfs the counterprogramming on the part of pro-EV and environmental groups.</p><p>Environmental Defense Action Fund and a related group have spent a little more than $772,000 on ads, according to AdImpact, and little of it is targeted in key presidential or Senate states.</p><p>Climate Power, a strategic communication group promoting Biden’s climate reduction goals, has committed to spending $80 million on promoting the administration’s measures, including on advertising in battleground states. The group declined to specify how much it expects to spend on advertising and noted that its efforts will also include voter outreach on an array of Biden measures, including promoting EVs. </p><p>Missing is one unifying call for Americans to embrace the technology, akin to President John F. Kennedy’s 1961 moon landing goal within the decade, said veteran Democratic strategist Joel Benenson, who was a pollster and senior adviser to Barack Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaigns. </p><p>“No one’s telling an inspiring story for EVs. So, how do you develop that story and what it’s going to mean for America going forward?” Benenson said. “That could be a powerful narrative.”</p><h2>______</h2><p>Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

    <div><p class="drop-cap preview">For technology to change the global balance of power, it needn't be new. It must simply be known.</p><p class="preview">Since 2017, the Chinese Communist Party has laid out careful plans to eventually dominate the creation, application, and dissemination of generative artificial intelligence — programs that use massive datasets to train themselves to recognize patterns so quickly that they appear to produce knowledge from nowhere. According to the CCP's plan, by 2020, China was supposed to have "achieved iconic advances in AI models and methods, core devices, high-end equipment, and foundational software." But the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in fall 2022 caught Beijing flat-footed. The virality of ChatGPT's launch asserted that US companies — at least for the moment — were leading the AI race and threw a great-power competition that had been conducted in private into the open for all the world to see.</p><div class="premium-content"><p class="premium">There is no guarantee that America's AI lead will last forever. China's national tech champions have joined the fray and managed to twist a technology that feeds on freewheeling information to fit neatly into China's constrained information bubble. Censorship requirements may slow China's AI development and limit the commercialization of domestic models, but they will not stop Beijing from benefiting from AI where it sees fit. China's leader, Xi Jinping, sees technology as the key to shaking his country out of its economic malaise. And even if China doesn't beat the US in the AI race, there's still great power, and likely danger, in it taking second place.</p><p class="premium">"There's so much we can do with this technology. Beijing's just not encouraging consumer-facing interactions," Reva Goujon, a director for client engagement on the consulting firm Rhodium Group's China advisory team, said. "Real innovation is happening in China. We're not seeing a huge gap between the models Chinese companies have been able to roll out. It's not like all these tech innovators have disappeared. They're just channeling applications to hard science."</p><p class="premium">In its internal documents, the CCP says that it will use AI to shape reality and tighten its grip on power within its borders — for political repression, surveillance, and monitoring dissent. We know that the party will also use AI to drive breakthroughs in industrial engineering, biotechnology, and other fields the CCP considers productive. In some of these use cases, it has already seen success. So even if it lags behind US tech by a few years, it can still have a powerful geopolitical impact. There are many like-minded leaders who also want to use the tools of the future to cement their authority in the present and distort the past. Beijing will be more than happy to facilitate that for them. China's vision for the future of AI is closed-sourced, tightly controlled, and available for export all around the world.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">In the world of modern AI, the technology is only as good as what it eats. ChatGPT and other large language models gorge on scores of web pages, news articles, and books. Sometimes this information gives the LLMs food poisoning — anyone who has played with a chatbot knows they sometimes hallucinate or tell lies. Given the size of the tech's appetite, figuring out what went wrong is much more complex than narrowing down the exact ingredient in your dinner that had you hugging your toilet at 2 a.m. AI datasets are so vast, and the calculations so fast, that the companies controlling the models <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/technology/ai-language-models-anthropic.html" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="20">do not know why they spit out bad results, and they may never know</a>. In a society like China — where information is tightly controlled — this inability to understand the guts of the models poses an existential problem for the CCP's grip on power: A chatbot could tell an uncomfortable truth, and no one will know why. The likelihood of that happening depends on the model it's trained on. To prevent this, Beijing is feeding AI with information that encourages positive "social construction."</p><p class="premium">China's State Council wrote in its 2017 Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan that AI would be able to "grasp group cognition and psychological changes in a timely manner," which, in turn, means the tech could "significantly elevate the capability and level of social governance, playing an irreplaceable role in effectively maintaining social stability." That is to say, if built to the correct specifications, the CCP believes AI can be a tool to fortify its power. That is why this month, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's AI regulator, launched a chatbot trained entirely on Xi's political and economic philosophy, "Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era" (snappy name, I know). Perhaps it goes without saying that ChatGPT is not available for use in China or Hong Kong.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image  breakout  premium" data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

                          </figure><p class="premium">For the CCP, finding a new means of mass surveillance and information domination couldn't come at a better time. Consider the Chinese economy. Wall Street, Washington, Brussels, and Berlin have accepted that the model that helped China grow into the world's second-largest economy has been worn out and that Beijing has yet to find anything to replace it. Building out infrastructure and industrial capacity no longer provides the same bang for the CCP's buck. The world is pushing back against China's exports, and the CCP's attempts to drive growth through domestic consumption have gone pretty much nowhere. The property market is distorted beyond recognition, growth has plateaued, and deflation is lingering like a troubled ghost. According to Freedom House, a human-rights monitor, Chinese people demonstrated against government policies in record numbers during the fourth quarter of 2023. The organization logged 952 dissent events, a 50% increase from the previous quarter. Seventy-eight percent of the demonstrations involved economic issues, such as housing or labor. If there's a better way to control people, Xi needs it now.</p><p class="premium">Ask the Cyberspace Administration of China's chatbot about these economic stumbles, and you'll just get a lecture on the difference between "traditional productive forces" and "new productive forces" — buzzwords the CCP uses to blunt the trauma of China's diminished economic prospects. In fact, if you ask any chatbot operating in the country, it will tell you that Taiwan is a part of China (a controversial topic outside the country, to say the least). All chatbots collect information on the people who use them and the questions they ask. The CCP's elites will be able to use that information gathering and spreading to their advantage politically and economically — but the government doesn't plan to share that power with regular Chinese people. What the party sees will not be what the people see.</p><p class="premium">"The Chinese have great access to information around the world," Kenneth DeWoskin, a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan and senior China advisor to Deloitte, told me. "But it's always been a two-tiered information system. It has been for 2,000 years."</p><p class="premium">To ensure this, the CCP has constructed a system to regulate AI that is both flexible enough to evaluate large language models as they are created and draconian enough to control their outputs. Any AI disseminated for public consumption must be registered and approved by the CAC. Registration involves telling the administration things like which datasets the AI was trained on and what tests were run on it. The point is to set up controls that embrace some aspects of AI, while — at least ideally — giving the CCP final approval on what it can and cannot create.</p><p class="premium">"The real challenge of LLMs is that they are really the synthesis of two things," Matt Sheehan, a researcher and fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told me. "They might be at the forefront of productivity growth, but they're also fundamentally a content-based system, taking content and spitting out content. And that's something the CCP considers frivolous."</p><p class="premium">In the past few years, the party has shown that it can be ruthless in cutting out technology it considers "frivolous" or harmful to social cohesion. In 2021, it barred anyone under 18 from playing video games on the weekdays, paused the approval of new games for eight months, and then in 2023 announced rules to reduce the public's spending on video games.</p><p class="premium">But AI is not simply entertainment — it's part of the future of computation. The CCP cannot deny the virality of what OpenAI's chatbot was able to achieve, its power in the US-China tech competition, or the potential for LLMs to boost economic growth and political power through lightning-speed information synthesis.</p><p class="premium">Ultimately, as Sheehan put it, the question is: "Can they sort of lobotomize AI and LLMs to make the information part a nonfactor?"</p><p class="premium">Unclear, but they're sure as hell going to try.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">For the CCP to actually have a powerful AI to control, the country needs to develop models that suit its purpose — and it's clear that China's tech giants are playing catch-up.</p><p class="premium">The e-commerce giant Baidu claims that its chatbot, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-chatgpt-reportedly-bans-users-from-mentioning-winnie-the-pooh-2023-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="60">Ernie Bot</a> — which was released to the public in August — has 200 million users and 85,000 enterprise clients. To put that in perspective, OpenAI generated 1.86 billion visits in March alone. There's also the Kimi chatbot from Moonshot AI, a startup backed by Alibaba that launched in October. But both Ernie Bot and Kimi were only recently overshadowed by ByteDance's Doubao bot, which also launched in August. According to Bloomberg, it's now the most downloaded bot in the country, and it's obvious why — Doubao is cheaper than its competitors.</p><p class="premium">"The generative-AI industry is still in its early stages in China," Paul Triolo, a partner for China and technology policy at the consultancy Albright Stonebridge Group, said. "So you have this cycle where you invest in infrastructure, train, and tweak models, get feedback, then you make an app that makes money. Chinese companies are now in the training and tweaking models phase."</p><p class="premium">The question is which of these companies will actually make it to the moneymaking phase. The current price war is a race to the bottom, similar to what we've seen in the Chinese technology space before. Take the race to make <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-xi-jinping-crush-tesla-elon-musk-american-ev-industry-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="80">electric vehicles</a>: The Chinese government started by handing out cash to any company that could produce a design — and I mean any. It was a money orgy. Some of these cars never made it out of the blueprint stage. But slowly, the government stopped subsidizing design, then production. Then instead, it started to support the end consumer. Companies that couldn't actually make a car at a price point that consumers were willing to pay started dropping like flies. Eventually, a few companies started dominating the space, and now the Chinese EV industry is a manufacturing juggernaut.</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-quote="The generative-AI industry is still in its early stages in China." data-quote-updated="true" data-source="Add source (optional)" data-source-updated="false" class="premium">

Historically, DeWoskin told me, party-issued production mandates have "good and bad effects." They have the ability to get universities and the private sector in on what the state wants to do, but sometimes these actors move slower than the market. Up until 2022, everyone in the AI competition was most concerned about the size of models, but the sector is now moving toward innovation in the effectiveness of data training and generative capacity. In other words, sometimes the CCP isn't skating to where the puck's going to be but to where it is.</p><p class="premium">There are also signs that the definition of success is changing to include models with very specific purposes. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a recent interview with the Brookings Institution that, for now, the models in most need of regulatory overhead are the largest ones. "But," he added, "I think progress may surprise us, and you can imagine smaller models that can do impactful things."<strong> </strong>A targeted model can have a specific business use case. After spending decades analyzing how the CCP molds the Chinese economy, DeWoskin told me that he could envision a world where some of those targeted models were available to domestic companies operating in China but not to their foreign rivals. After all, Beijing has never been shy about using a home-field advantage. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-xi-jinping-crush-tesla-elon-musk-american-ev-industry-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="80">Just ask Elon Musk</a>.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">To win the competition to build the most powerful AI in the world, China must combat not only the US but also its own instincts when it comes to technological innovation. A race to the bottom may simply beggar China's AI ecosystem. A rush to catch up to where the US already is — amid investor and government pressure to make money as soon as possible — may keep China's companies off the frontier of this tech.</p><p class="premium">"My base case for the way this goes forward is that maybe two Chinese entities push the frontier, and they get all the government support," Sheehan said. "But they're also burdened with dealing with the CCP<strong> </strong>and a little slower-moving."</p><p class="premium">This isn't to say we have nothing to learn from the way China is handling AI. Beijing has already set regulations for things like deepfakes and labeling around authenticity. Most importantly, China's system holds <em>people </em>accountable for what AI does — people make the technology, and people should have to answer for what it does. The speed of AI's development demands a dynamic, consistent regulatory system, and while China's checks go too far, the current US regulatory framework lacks systemization. The Commerce Department announced an initiative last month around testing models for safety, and that's a good start, but it's not nearly enough.</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-right" data-quote="The digital curtain AI can build in our imaginations will be much more impenetrable than iron, making it impossible for societies to cooperate in a shared future." data-quote-updated="true" data-source="Add source (optional)" data-source-updated="false" class="premium">

The Xi Jinping Thought chatbot is a warning. If China can make one for itself, it can use that base model to craft similar systems for authoritarians who want to limit the information scape in their societies. Already, some Chinese AI companies — like the state-owned iFlytek, a voice-recognition AI — have been hit with US sanctions, in part, for using their technology to spy on the Uyghur population in Xinjiang. For some governments, it won't matter if tech this useful is two or three generations behind a US counterpart. As for the chatbots, the models won't contain the sum total of human knowledge, but they will serve their purpose: The content will be censored, and the checks back to the CCP will clear.</p><p class="premium">That is the danger of the AI race. Maybe China won't draw from the massive, multifaceted AI datasets that the West will — its strict limits on what can go into and come out of these models will prevent that. Maybe China won't be pushing the cutting edge of what AI can achieve. But that doesn't mean Beijing can't foster the creation of specific models that could lead to advancements in fields like hard sciences and engineering. It can then control who gets access to those advancements within its borders, not just people but also multinational corporations. It can sell tools of control, surveillance, and content generation to regimes that wish to dominate their societies and are antagonistic to the US and its allies.</p><p class="premium">This is an inflection point in the global information war. If social media harmfully siloed people into alternate universes, the Xi bot has demonstrated that AI can do that on steroids. It is a warning. The digital curtain AI can build in our imaginations will be much more impenetrable than iron, making it impossible for societies to cooperate in a shared future. Beijing is well aware of this, and it's already harnessing that power domestically, why not geopolitically? We need to think about all the ways Beijing can profit from AI now before its machines are turned on the world. Stability and reality depend on it.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="premium"><a target="_blank" rel="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/linette-lopez" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100"><em><u>Linette Lopez</u></em></a><em> is a senior correspondent at Business Insider.</em></p></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Saudi Aramco's dominance</strong>: Saudi Aramco, a state-run oil company, produces 9 million barrels of oil per day, more than any other firm, and has the largest remaining proven reserves of oil, which would last into the second half of the century.</li>
<li><strong>Profitability</strong>: Aramco generated an eye-watering $282 billion in total net profit over the past two years, thanks to its low production costs of $3 per barrel.</li>
<li><strong>Carbon emissions</strong>: Aramco's oil emits less carbon than rival companies when extracted from geological formations, making its product appealing in a world concerned about climate change.</li>
<li><strong>Market share</strong>: As less competitive rivals fall by the wayside, Aramco's market share is likely to rise with minimal investments in maintaining reservoirs.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic importance</strong>: Aramco is a key part of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman's strategy to end Saudi Arabia's reliance on oil, diversify its economy, and decarbonize its energy production.</li>

The state-run oil colossus produces 9m barrels of oil a day, more than any other firm and nearly a tenth of the world’s total (see chart 1). It boasts by far the largest remaining proven reserves of the stuff, which would last into second half of the century at current pumping rates. Its piddling production costs of $3 a barrel, a tenth of what many Western private-sector rivals must content themselves with, allowed it to generate an eye-watering $282bn in total net profit over the past two years. And though its oil burns as dirtily as any other, Aramco emits less carbon liberating it from geological formations than competitors do. That makes the company’s product appealing in a world increasingly concerned about global warming but still <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/03/14/oils-endgame-could-be-highly-disruptive" data-analytics="in_body:link_1:para_1">hooked on hydrocarbons</a>.</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0">As less generously endowed rivals fall by the wayside, Aramco’s market share would, in other words, be almost certain to rise with a few modest investments in maintaining reservoirs. Yet the company’s employees are busier than ever. That is because Aramco is the linchpin of the strategy of <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2022/07/28/mbs-despot-in-the-desert" data-analytics="in_body:link_2:para_2">Muhammad bin Salman</a>, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto ruler, to end his country’s reliance on oil, diversify its economy and decarbonise its energy production.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Successful entrepreneurs don't focus on being different</strong>: Evan Davis, presenter of The Bottom Line, argues that entrepreneurs who have achieved success are not obsessed with being unique or innovative. Instead, they focus on building a solid business.</li>
<li><strong>The desire to escape "wage slavery"</strong>: Davis quotes a common aspiration among entrepreneurs - to step out of the daily grind and create a business that can provide financial freedom and retirement income.</li>
<li><strong>Learning from successful entrepreneurs</strong>: The article highlights the value of learning from successful entrepreneurs through interviews and case studies. Davis is hosting a series called The Decisions That Made Me a Leader, featuring interviews with several successful entrepreneurs.</li>
<li><strong>No single path to success</strong>: Davis notes that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to entrepreneurship success. Successful entrepreneurs have different experiences, skills, and motivations, and there is no single formula for achievement.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on hard work and perseverance</strong>: The article suggests that successful entrepreneurs often share a willingness to work hard, take calculated risks, and persevere through challenges, ultimately leading to their success.</li>

Preferably a business that will be more than a mere lifestyle for you - one that you can sell and from which you can retire on the proceeds?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf">You want to step out of the world of wage slavery, and set up a business of your own? Preferably a business that will be more than a mere lifestyle for you - one that you can sell and from which you can retire on the proceeds?</b></p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Well, in thinking about your chances of success, it helps to look at those who have trodden that path and ended up with a flourishing enterprise to their name.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In the interview series The Decisions That Made Me a Leader, we spoke to half a dozen successful entrepreneurs - too small a sample from which to draw statistically useful generalisations, but large enough to spot some interesting patterns.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">I was struck by three intriguing attributes that may not guarantee business success, but which do seem to help.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">First, I noticed the degree of rebelliousness exuded by several of them. They never quite fitted in - perhaps not into school, or university, or into the first jobs they tried.</p></div><div data-component="links-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 jyIQlN"><div class="sc-5b94fa74-0 sc-46222299-0 izIHRV eluqFz"><span data-testid="links-title" class="sc-46222299-2 gdGcRT">Decisions That Made Me a Leader</span></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Duncan Bannatyne, famous as one of the original big stars of the Dragons Den TV series, certainly never fitted into the navy, from which he was court-martialed and dishonourably discharged after getting into a fight with an officer. “I just thought it was right thing to do - he was poking me and shouting at me,” recalls Mr Bannatyne.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">His attitude, he tells me, is that “authority should not be accepted”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Simon Beckerman, founder of online marketplace Depop, draws a similar conclusion about himself. “I'm quite a disobedient person in my own right," he says. "I think I am unemployable."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And it’s true that when you don’t find it easy to work for anyone else, going it alone is the obvious alternative career route.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Before she created the tea mixology brand Bird &amp; Blend Tea Co, Krisi Smith had stumbled through many jobs - including cleaning out cat pens in a cattery (even though she is allergic to cats) and working as a "shot girl" selling spirits to club-goers.</p></div><figure><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Krisi Smith says she set up her own business after calling out employers for their behaviour</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"I was always asking questions and wanting to know why we were doing something and making suggestions,” she recalls. “And I think that that tended to put people's back up." After seeing her employers treat staff and customers badly, she decided she wanted to run her own business ethically.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The second attribute that I noticed was a kind of impatience hard-wired into their personalities. It seems there is always an itch. They never stand still.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"></p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But if you thought their success in business came out of some kind of life-plan upon about which they had reflected and consciously embarked, you would be missing the point.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">These entrepreneurs grabbed at opportunities, and indeed grabbed opportunities to make opportunities for themselves.</p></div><figure><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">While still a teenager, Timo Armoo was making his first steps in business</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Timo Armoo, who set up the social media marketing company FanBytes, says he started his first venture at school, charging other pupils to help them with their maths assignments. Then, at the age of 17, he managed to secure interviews with Sir Richard Branson, Lord Sugar and James Caan after emailing the organisers of a business summit and offering to set out chairs in exchange for a press pass.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“I sent it and within 20 minutes I get back an email saying, ‘You're crazy and yes, let's do it'," recalls Mr Armoo.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The impatience that one can observe even extends to the entrepreneurs leaving the very businesses they created. Self-aware founders understand the skills they have and do not have, and know that when a business matures, it often needs a management that can do the painstaking work of delivering sustainable growth, rather than one with the flair of creation and discovery.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">At that point, impatience is exactly the wrong attribute. And anyway, the entrepreneurs we spoke to, being impatient, are ready to move on once the business is solid, so their minds wander to selling.</p></div><figure><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">After leaving Lastminute.com, Martha Lane Fox became the House of Lords' youngest female member and has advised successive governments</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Take Martha Lane Fox, co-founder of Lastminute.com at the height of the dot-com boom during the late 1990s. She was the poster child of a new youthful entrepreneurial culture that sprung up at that time, as kids showed the grown-ups exactly what the internet was capable of.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But at the age of 31, she made the decision to step down as managing director of the company. “It was like being in a pop band where you had this one mega hit, and I didn't want that to be the only thing that defined my life," she says.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">So to a third and final entrepreneurial attribute, which follows from the others: it’s a willingness to actually do things, rather than merely think about them. Or overthink them.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">I feel this is what marks out those people - in business or perhaps even in charities or public service - that are of a genuine entrepreneurial spirit. They are the people who seem to get things done.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Some of it comes down to a kind of optimism. They believe that their own actions have a good chance of achieving something, so they are less likely than most of us to descend into a fatalistic stupor. It gets them out of bed in the morning.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Richard Walker comes from a family with a track record in business - his father was the founder of the supermarket chain Iceland, where Richard is now executive chairman. But as a young qualified chartered surveyor, Richard says, "I also had this entrepreneurial itch to do my own thing".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He was advised by the legendary property developer Tony Gallagher to move to Poland. “So I did, because they just joined the EU. They were the size of Germany, 40 million people, very well-educated. There were no Brits living out there full-time running a private property company. So I decided I would."</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">I’ve met a lot of entrepreneurs, and I sometimes wonder if they are deluded in their optimism. Many massively overrate their chances of success, and they often can’t even imagine the many things that may go wrong with the next idea they are toying with. They have too vivid a picture of what can go right.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But as delusions go, optimism is a blessing if you refuse to be daunted by the disappointments.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Of course, the far biggest attribute anyone in business needs is good luck. Things eventually worked out for all our guests and luck surely played a part in that.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">We have not heard from the unknown names who tried to build a business, but whose efforts foundered. They may have had great judgement, business nous, all the right characteristics - but just hit the wrong product at the wrong time. That doesn’t have to have been their own fault. Things sometimes turn out bad. In business, they <i id="mostly" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog">mostly</i> turn out bad. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Entrepreneurs are not some kind of special breed. We all have our eccentricities, our impatience and we all get things done. And we don’t want to be fatalistic in thinking that you are either born with entrepreneurship or you’re not. The skills of business can be learned and developed to some extent.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But if you are asking yourself, whether you are cut out to venture into a life like those of the stars of our series, it is certainly worth examining the characters they have - the flaws that turn out to be strengths and the work they have put in.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/bbcindepth" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"><i id="BBC InDepth" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog">BBC InDepth</i></a><i id=" is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

	<p><span class="big-cap-wrap"><span class="big-cap">C</span></span>HICAGO — The cancer drug Enhertu stalled the growth of tumors by more than a year, significantly longer than standard chemotherapy did in women with the most common form of metastatic breast cancer — a clinical trial result that once again promises to rewrite the rules for the treatment of the disease.</p>
<p>The makers of Enhertu, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca, said the new data, if cleared by regulators, could shift the way physicians treat hormone receptor-positive, metastatic breast cancer, and create a new standard of care in which patients with breast tumors that express even the faintest amount of HER2 protein can benefit.</p>
<p>“It’s not an overestimation to say that trastuzumab deruxtecan is the most potent drug ever developed for breast cancer,” said Paolo Tarantino, a medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, using the scientific name for Enhertu. “It does come with side effects that we’re learning to manage, but with that said, I’ve never seen data like what’s being reported here.”</p>

    <p>Here are five key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Federal Reserve actions have made it harder to cut rates</strong>: Despite the central bank's signal in November that it would soon halt rate hikes and consider rate cuts, the market has already priced in multiple rate cuts, making it more difficult for the Fed to actually cut rates.</li>
<li><strong>Financial conditions are more favorable than ever</strong>: According to the Bloomberg US Financial Conditions Index, credit availability and cost are more favorable today than they were when the Fed began raising rates in March 2022.</li>
<li><strong>The market has reacted strongly to the Fed's signal</strong>: The S&amp;P 500 stock index has added $9 trillion in market capitalization since the Fed's pivot in November, a gain equivalent to about 50% of last year's consumer spending.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal stimulus has fueled economic growth</strong>: The federal government's spending on infrastructure, green energy initiatives, and semiconductor production capacity has continued to fuel economic growth, making the economy strong despite inflation concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation remains a concern</strong>: While the economy has remained strong, inflation readings have come in above forecasts, prompting Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to warn that interest rates could stay high "as long as needed" to bring inflation back down to the Fed's 2% target.</li>

    <div><p>The Federal Reserve has talked financial markets into creating an easier environment, which paradoxically makes lowering rates a more difficult task for the central bank, a top economist said.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>The Bloomberg US Financial Conditions Index indicates that the availability and cost of credit across money, bond, and equity markets are significantly more favorable today than when the Fed began raising rates in March 2022, according to Apollo Chief Economist Torsten Sløk.</p>



<p>That’s due to the central bank’s pivot in November, when Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that inflation was cooling enough to halt rate hikes and start thinking about when rate cuts could begin. </p>



<p>Wall Street interpreted the comments, incorrectly as it turned out, to mean easing would be imminent and that as many as six cuts would happen in 2024, sparking a massive stock market rally.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.apolloacademy.com/the-fed-cut-reflexivity-paradox/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.apolloacademy.com/the-fed-cut-reflexivity-paradox/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.apolloacademy.com/the-fed-cut-reflexivity-paradox/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">blog post</a> on Wednesday, Sløk estimated that the S&amp;P 500 stock index has added $9 trillion in market cap since then and compared it to the $19 trillion in consumer spending last year.</p><p></p>



<p>“In other words, in a few months, the household sector has experienced a windfall gain corresponding to about 50% of last year’s consumer spending!” he wrote.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the federal government has been spending trillions of dollars on infrastructure, green-energy initiatives, and semiconductor production capacity. </p>



<p>As a result, the economy has remained strong as this fiscal stimulus continues to fuel growth while easier financial conditions offset Fed rate hikes, Sløk noted. </p>



<p>In fact, the economy was so strong earlier this year that inflation readings came in above forecasts and showed signs of reaccelerating. That forced Powell to warn that rates could stay high for “<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/17/jerome-powell-inflation-economy-interest-rates-higher-longer/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/17/jerome-powell-inflation-economy-interest-rates-higher-longer/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/04/17/jerome-powell-inflation-economy-interest-rates-higher-longer/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">as long as needed</a>” because inflation appeared to be taking longer than anticipated to reach the Fed’s 2% target.</p>



<p>Still, he later acknowledged that <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/01/jerome-powell-stagflation-1970s-inflation-economic-growth-interest-rates/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/01/jerome-powell-stagflation-1970s-inflation-economic-growth-interest-rates/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/01/jerome-powell-stagflation-1970s-inflation-economic-growth-interest-rates/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">further rate increases were unlikely</a> and reaffirmed that the Fed’s next move—whenever that will be—is likely a rate cut. </p><p></p>



<p>And that’s precisely the mistake Powell is making, in Sløk’s view. </p>



<p>“Looking ahead, with the stock market hitting fresh all-time highs and fiscal policy still supportive, the expectation in markets should be that the economy will continue to accelerate over the coming quarters,” he wrote. “You can call this the Fed Cut Reflexivity Paradox: The more the Fed insists that the next move in interest rates is a cut, the more financial conditions will ease, making it more difficult for the Fed to cut.”</p>



<p>To be sure, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/economy-gdp-growth-high-interest-rates-1-6/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/economy-gdp-growth-high-interest-rates-1-6/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/economy-gdp-growth-high-interest-rates-1-6/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">GDP growth slowed</a> in the first quarter from the fourth quarter, and was revised down to an annualized rate of 1.3% from a prior reading of 1.6%. The latest report also showed that fiscal stimulus was having a smaller effect. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>But consumer spending on services remained strong, and more recent data on jobless claims showed the labor market continues to hold up.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-economy-inflation-minutes-interest-rates/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-economy-inflation-minutes-interest-rates/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-economy-inflation-minutes-interest-rates/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">minutes from the Fed’s last policy meeting</a> revealed that the economy’s resilience in the face of rates at 23-year highs had prompted some officials to wonder whether all their tightening was exerting enough pressure on growth. High interest rates “may be having smaller effects than in the past,” the minutes said.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has reiterated his “Overweight” rating and $310 per share price target for electric vehicle maker Tesla (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASDAQ:TSLA</a>). In his comments, the analyst discussed Tesla’s upcoming 2024 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, as well as the potential results of the vote surrounding Elon Musk’s 2018 compensation plan. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, Elon Musk’s 2018 CEO Performance Award was rescinded by a Delaware Judge, which resulted in Tesla asking its shareholders to ratify the 2018 compensation plan at the 2024 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting. The company has been putting in a lot of effort to encourage shareholders to vote for the ratification of Musk’s pay plan, as well as Tesla’s redomestication to Texas. </p>



 



 




<p>The Morgan Stanley analyst, for his part, noted that Elon Musk likely needs Tesla now more than ever amidst the <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-must-find-ways-to-reward-musk-jefferies/">emerging AI industry</a>. Jonas also noted that TSLA stock would likely see volatility due to the shareholder vote surrounding Musk’s 2018 CEO Performance Award. </p>



<p>“We’ve encouraged investors to pay close attention to the June 13th shareholder vote due to its significance to the long-term strategic direction of the company. We believe that CEO Elon Musk needs Tesla now more than ever, as Al is a capital game – the broader collection of Elon Musk’s businesses may collectively invest many tens of billions of dollars in Al infrastructure in coming years, and cost of capital is deterministic for Al supremacy. </p>



<p>The Morgan Stanley analyst noted that based on an <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-shareholders-urged-vote-for-ratification-musk-2018-pay-plan/">investor survey</a> that it conducted, it appears that TSLA shareholders will vote in favor of Musk’s compensation plan. Following is a summary of the results of Morgan Stanley’s survey, which was gathered from 109 respondents. </p>



 



<p>“The majority of respondents (57%) expect Elon’s compensation package to be approved, outnumbering respondents who do not expect approval (23%) by more than 2:1. If Elon’s comp package is approved, majority (68%) expect Tesla stock price to react positively over the next three trading days (24% expect TSLA shares up 6-10%+, 44% expect TSLA shares up 3-5%, outnumbering those who expect the stock to be down upon approval by almost 6x.</p>



<p>“ If Elon’s comp package is approved, 20% expect a neutral stock price reaction (+/- 2%) over the subsequent three trading days, whereas if the comp package is not approved, only 7% expect a neutral stock price reaction. In the event that the package is not approved, the vast majority (81%) of respondents expect the stock price to be down, and 54% expect the stock to be down significantly (-6-10% or more),” the analyst wrote. </p>

<li>Jeep has unveiled its first electric SUV, the Wagoneer S, which will go on sale this fall with a starting price tag of $72,000.</li>

<li>The EV market has faced challenges recently, including high prices and higher interest rates, making higher-end EVs out of reach for many Americans.</li>

    <div><p>Manalapan is a small slip of a town in South Florida with just over 400 year-round residents, around 70 lots, and not much else. Most people, even some who live in nearby Miami, have never heard of it.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>But among those in the know—including Billy Joel and Tony Robbins—interest in moving to Manalapan has skyrocketed since the COVID-19 pandemic, local realtors and residents say. Unlike those moving to other parts of Florida, though, new Manalapan residents are much more likely to be billionaires, thanks to the town’s expansive oceanfront estates, relative privacy, and outsized listing prices.</p>



<p>Estates are currently <a href="https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/1040-S-Ocean-Blvd_Lantana_FL_33462_M65502-31175?from=srp-list-card" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/1040-S-Ocean-Blvd_Lantana_FL_33462_M65502-31175?from=srp-list-card" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">listed for up to $80 million</a> with a median price of $16.8 million, but the typical home value was around $4.3 million in April, according to <a href="https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">Zillow</a>, making Manalapan one of the most expensive places to live in the country. </p>



<p>“Much of that has to do with the migration of people <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/13/florida-jeff-bezos-600-million-ultra-high-net-worth-individuals-nirvana/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/13/florida-jeff-bezos-600-million-ultra-high-net-worth-individuals-nirvana/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">moving to Florida for tax reasons</a>—many have brought their businesses here,” says Nick Malinosky, a realtor with the Exclusive Group at Douglas Elliman.</p>



<p>For the price, buyers get what resident and former Manalapan mayor Stewart Satter calls “a magical little oasis.” The estates are situated between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway, with generous lot sizes and a quiet that draws away residents from nearby Palm Beach. The town, notes Malinosky, is “in the middle of a ton of action”—near not only Palm Beach but also Delray and Boca Raton. And it boasts its own police and fire departments.</p><p></p>



<p>“The police department knows every resident,” says Robert Burrage, a local builder who’s worked in the area for 17 years. “If your gate gets left open after dark, the police call to make sure everything is okay. It’s a very wealthy but quaint place.”</p>

<p>Though it’s easy to travel to nearby cities for restaurants, shopping, and nightlife, Manalapan itself is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the Miami area. And that privacy has made it attractive to residents looking for a slower pace and less traffic, including billionaire <a href="https://fortune.com/company/oracle/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/oracle/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">Oracle</a> cofounder Larry Ellison, who recently dropped a staggering $173 million to purchase a Manalapan estate—the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-23/billionaire-larry-ellison-buys-173-million-estate-setting-florida-record" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-23/billionaire-larry-ellison-buys-173-million-estate-setting-florida-record" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">largest residential sale</a> in the state’s history. The property features 33 bedrooms, 34 bathrooms, a guest house, two cottages, a bird sanctuary, tennis courts, a PGA-standard golf course, and multiple tunnels under the road to connect the two parts of the property.</p>



<p>Tunnels are a big feature of life in Manalapan: Many residents have built them under State Road A1A, which bisects much of the town. The tunnels—painted with murals, or acting as art galleries, in some cases—connect the homes to the ocean, making it easier to get from one part of the estate to the other. (They are not without controversy, as building them requires <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2000/09/06/tunnel-work-closes-beach-road/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2000/09/06/tunnel-work-closes-beach-road/" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">shutting down the public road for days at a time</a>.) “People flip when you say you have a tunnel,” says Satter.</p>



<p>Another draw of Manalapan is, of course, its natural beauty. Many properties boast private docks to launch boats, and residents enjoy secluded beaches, where sea turtles nest and manatees swim. Homes are either situated on the oceanfront, with access to the Intracoastal Waterway, or vice versa. Those with homes not directly on the ocean are allowed to build 1,500-square foot beach homes to make up for it.</p>



<p>“You get the best of both worlds—it’s super unique,” adds Malinosky.</p>

<p>Satter’s experience in the area exemplifies how much the area has changed over the past few years. In 2004, the investor bought four properties in Manalapan for around $20 million total. He <a href="https://thecoastalstar.com/profiles/blogs/manalapan-estate-becomes-florida-s-priciest" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://thecoastalstar.com/profiles/blogs/manalapan-estate-becomes-florida-s-priciest" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">sold a single lot for $40 million</a> in early 2022. Earlier this year, he purchased a 1989 mansion for $28 million, which he plans to tear down and rebuild into something more modern (<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/24/luxury-vacation-home-buyers-pickleball-courts-million-dollars/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/24/luxury-vacation-home-buyers-pickleball-courts-million-dollars/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">perhaps with a pickleball court</a>). </p><p></p>



<p>Rebuilding is common in Manalapan, and another draw for wealthy residents who don’t like to hear the word “no.” Burrage says the town is much more open to different architectural styles than other nearby enclaves of the ultra-wealthy.</p>



<p>“Manalapan is open to the homes that people want to create,” Burrage says. “I’ve seen very little pushback.”</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>And of course, Florida’s lack of state income tax is the cherry on top, says Satter, who resigned as mayor after the <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/local-news/investigations/form-6-will-it-lead-to-exodus-of-small-town-elected-officials-in-florida" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.wptv.com/news/local-news/investigations/form-6-will-it-lead-to-exodus-of-small-town-elected-officials-in-florida" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">passage of a new financial disclosure law</a> in the state.</p>



<p>“People are saying, I’ve had enough of the weather, the high tax, my kids are grown up,” he says of deciding to move south. “It’s an absolutely beautiful little community. It’s special.”</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Learn how to take control of your personal finances with Get Your Due, our six-week email bootcamp. </p><a href="https://fortune.com/newsletters/get-your-due?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=get_your_due" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/newsletters/get-your-due?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=get_your_due" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

<li>Nvidia's market capitalization has soared over 200% in the past year, and it is rapidly closing in on Microsoft and Apple in terms of market value.</li>
<li>Beth Kindig, a lead tech analyst at the I/O Fund, predicts that Nvidia's market cap will surge another 270% to $10 trillion in the coming years.</li>
<li>Nvidia's success can be attributed to its leading position in the AI chip market, driven by high demand for its chips in data centers that train large language models.</li>
<li>The company's software, including its CUDA platform, is also a key advantage, as it allows software engineers and AI engineers to program GPIs, locking them in to Nvidia's ecosystem.</li>
<li>Kindig believes that Nvidia will "grab the lion's share" of the AI market, outpacing rivals such as AMD and Intel, and will remain the dominant player in the industry.</li>

<p>(NEXSTAR) — If you think portion sizes are getting smaller at your favorite fast-food joint, you’re not alone. Social media is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askTO/comments/uauvsd/has_anyone_noticed_how_small_the_food_portions/">filled with complaints</a> from customers who say they’re not getting enough bite for their buck these days. </p>



<p><a href="https://fox8.com/tag/chipotle/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fox8.com/tag/chipotle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chipotle</a> is the latest company facing backlash over this common gripe. Just last month, food influencer Keith Lee — widely known for his viral review of a <a href="https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2023-02-27-ITS-OFFICIALLY-OFFICIAL-CHIPOTLE-TO-LAUNCH-NEW-FAJITA-QUESADILLA-INSPIRED-BY-VIRAL-TIKTOK-TREND-ON-MARCH-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quesadilla hack that landed on the Chipotle menu</a> — expressed dissatisfaction with a recent order from the restaurant.</p>



<p>While doing a taste test, he noticed one ingredient was lacking in his burrito bowl. “Where’s the chicken?” he said in a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@keith_lee125/video/7364650719380770094?q=keith%20lee%20chipotle&amp;t=1717118280529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok video</a> that’s been viewed more than 17 million times since May 3.</p>



<p>He then begins to scrape through his bowl with a fork, searching for a chunk of Adobo chicken. Once he finally finds a piece, he launches another complaint: “I don’t taste much flavor. Everything is freezing cold.”</p>



<p>“I don’t know if it’s the quality. I don’t know if it’s the seasonings, the time, I don’t know what it is,” he continued. “And the amount of chicken … I think I can see like four pieces of chicken.”</p>





<p>Lee wasn’t pleased with his quesadilla either, rating it a 2.5/10. (He previously gave it a perfect score in a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@keith_lee125/video/7182410912446483758?q=keith%20lee%20chipotle%20hack&amp;t=1717118715241">separate review</a>.) His recent burrito bowl rating was slightly lower at 2/10.</p>





<p>“This is my opinion you can take it with a grain of salt,” he said. “I just had to be honest. I don’t mean no harm.”</p>



<p>All wasn’t bad, however. The 39-year-old gave his chicken tacos an 8/10, saying they were “flavorful,” and the meat was charred “really well.”</p>



<p>Soon after Lee posted his video, a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=chipotle%20portions%20&amp;t=1717118326769" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media firestorm erupted</a>, with people calling on Chipotle to improve its portion sizes. Some have even <a href="https://twitter.com/FearedBuck/status/1794758788810940511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1794841234185584824%7Ctwgr%5E92839607b2107d4de450a4eb57790ee941f71d91%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fiframe.nbcnews.com%2FEZcpVej%3F_showcaption%3Dtrueapp%3D1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filmed employees preparing their orders</a>, hoping to get more food due to the camera pressure. Not everyone agrees with this approach.</p>



<p>“This is just rude,” <a href="https://twitter.com/thedesign59/status/1794761396758171848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one user wrote</a> on the social media platform X, where someone shared a video of workers being recorded. </p>





<p>“I feel so bad for the people that work at Chipotle,” <a href="https://twitter.com/copygraham/status/1794898869731594651">another person said</a>.</p>





<p>Despite the backlash, Chipotle told Nexstar that its portion sizes haven’t actually changed.</p>



<p>“Our intentions are to provide a great experience every time, and our meals have always been completely customizable so guests can vocalize or digitally select their desired portions when choosing from the list of real ingredients,” said Laurie Schalow, Chipotle’s chief corporate affairs and food safety officer, in a statement.</p>



<p>“There have been no changes in our portion sizes, and we have reinforced proper portioning with our employees. If we did not deliver on our value, we want our guests to reach out so we can make it right,” she added.</p>





<p>Back in March 2022, Burger King faced similar criticism from customers who sued the chain over the size of its Whoppers. The plaintiffs argued that advertisements depict burgers that are approximately 35% larger than the ones they received. A federal judge in Florida refused Burger King’s request to dismiss the class-action lawsuit last August, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/burger-king-lawsuit-ad-whopper-fast-food-87cb60fb553c56c852884c2a62456f25">The Associated Press</a> reported. </p>
