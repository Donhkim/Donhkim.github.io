<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Alphabet (Google's parent company) is in talks to acquire cybersecurity start-up Wiz for around $23 billion</strong>, which would be the largest acquisition in the tech group's history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The acquisition would be a test case for antitrust regulators</strong>, who have been cracking down on tech companies buying out emerging companies in the sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wiz is a cybersecurity start-up based in New York and founded four years ago</strong>, led by Israeli founder and former Microsoft executive Assaf Rappaport. It has raised around $2 billion from investors and was most recently valued at $12 billion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wiz helps companies secure programs in the cloud</strong>, which has led to a surge in revenue as corporations increasingly operate their software and store data online. The company has hit around $350 million in annual recurring revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The deal would be among the largest acquisitions of a company backed by venture capital</strong>, and would mark a further major push into cybersecurity for Alphabet, which acquired Mandiant for $5.4 billion two years ago.</p>

<p>Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is in talks to buy cybersecurity start-up Wiz for about $23 billion, in what would be the largest acquisition in the tech group’s history, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Alphabet’s discussions to acquire Wiz are still weeks away from completion, said one person with direct knowledge of the matter, while people briefed about the transaction said there was still a chance the deal would fall apart, with a number of details still needing to be addressed in talks.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>If a deal were to be reached it would be a test case for antitrust regulators, which in recent years have been cracking down on tech groups buying out emerging companies in the sector. Alphabet’s last big deal came more than a decade ago with the $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Wiz would mark a further big push into cyber security for Alphabet, two years after it acquired Mandiant for $5.4 billion.</p>
<p>New York-headquartered Wiz has raised about $2 billion from investors since its founding four years ago, according to data provider PitchBook. The start-up, led by Israeli founder and former Microsoft executive Assaf Rappaport, was most recently valued at $12 billion. Its backers include venture capital firms Sequoia and Thrive.</p>
<p>Wiz, which counts multinational groups including Salesforce, Mars, and BMW as customers, helps companies secure programs in the cloud. That has led to a surge in revenue as corporations increasingly operate their software and store data online—Wiz has said it has hit about $350 million in annual recurring revenue, a metric often used by software start-ups.</p>
<p>A deal would be among the largest acquisitions of a company backed by venture capital.</p>
<p>Wiz declined to comment on the talks, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

A brighter economic outlook, as well as expectations that the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, has boosted demand for services from banks such as Goldman Sachs.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">That is likely to translate into larger bonuses, including for Goldman’s 6,000 UK staff, who will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/24/uk-financial-regulators-scrap-cap-on-bankers-bonuses" data-link-name="in body link">no longer be bound by a banker bonus cap</a> that previously limited bonuses to twice the individual’s salary.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The UK bonus cap was originally part of changes introduced after the 2007-08 banking crash, and aimed to stamp out a bonus culture blamed for encouraging short-term profits over longer-term stability.

<li>GM has removed the EV production capacity target for 2025 from its plans, and will instead focus on being flexible to meet changing market demands.</li>

The stock prices of gun makers jumped accordingly, with shares of Ruger and Smith &amp; Wesson hitting all-time highs approaching the $90 and $35 threshold, respectively.</p>



<p>The market appeared to bottom out by 2022 as sales fell to around 17.4 million total guns, down from almost 22.7 million during the pandemic, per SafeHome.org, but gun makers appear confident about future sales. In its latest earnings call, Smith &amp; Wesson<a href="https://ir.smith-wesson.com/news-releases/news-release-details/smith-wesson-brands-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-fiscal-0" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://ir.smith-wesson.com/news-releases/news-release-details/smith-wesson-brands-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-fiscal-0" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://ir.smith-wesson.com/news-releases/news-release-details/smith-wesson-brands-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-fiscal-0" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci"> reported </a>over $159 million in net sales, up almost 10% from the comparable quarter last year.</p>



<p>“While the summer months will be highly competitive as we navigate the traditionally slower season for firearms,” President and CEO Mark Smith said, “we continue to expect healthy demand overall for firearms in fiscal [year] 2025, and Smith &amp; Wesson is well positioned to deliver another solid year of growth.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Impact of presidential election on gun sales remains unclear </h2>



<p>Gun sales have historically increased during presidential elections, Rommel Dionisio of Aegis Capital <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/27/trends-shaping-gun-industry.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/27/trends-shaping-gun-industry.html" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/27/trends-shaping-gun-industry.html" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">told CNBC in August</a>.

With rhetoric surrounding gun control limited compared to previous election cycles, less Americans might be motivated to buy guns out of fear over potential bans.</p><p></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A new EV road trip planning feature in FLO’s EV charging app lets drivers customize their journey, optimize routes and find charging stops at more than 30 networks</h2>
<p>Planning a road trip this summer with your electric vehicle? There’s an app for that. </p>
<p>As the summer road trip rush gets into high gear, FLO EV Charging is offering a new trip-planning feature in its app.</p>
<p>The new tool allow EV drivers to program in their desired routes that are then matched to convenient charging stops along the way. Drivers can select their specific EV make and model, set precise charge levels for both departure and arrival and even account for factors like the number of passengers, climate control, extra weight and weather conditions.</p>
<p>With those details, the trip planner will identify the optimal route using over 100,000 stations across more than 30 charging networks. It will recommend essential charging stops, estimate costs and calculate the charging time needed for your trip. </p>
<p>Drivers can then transfer the route to Apple Maps or Google Maps.</p>
<p>“EV drivers can then start their journey with a clearer sense of how their range is expected to evolve between departure and arrival points and where they can expect to charge along the way based on their inputs and the feature’s estimates,” says Nathan Yang, FLO chief product officer in a <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/summer-adventures-await-flo-introduces-personalized-ev-road-trip-planning-in-the-flo-app-808588149.html">press statement.</a> </p>
<p>The trip planner feature on the FLO app is currently available for iOS and soon for Android. </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Other features of the app</h3>
<p>FLO says this latest update is part of its ongoing commitment to “provide EV drivers with the best charging experience.”</p>
<p>Last summer, the company introduced a convenience feature that allows users to monitor their charging sessions directly from their phone’s lock screen (eliminating the need to unlock the phone or open the app).</p>
<p>This feature works with both public and home charging stations on the FLO network, as well as major roaming partners.</p>
<p>Additionally, FLO’s app includes a suite of other functions including helping users locate FLO network and partner network charging stations, view the real-time availability of chargers and manage their FLO HomeTM X5 charging stations.</p>
<p>The FLO app (and the road trip feature) are free for drivers to download.</p>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Chair Jerome Powell said Monday that the Federal Reserve is becoming more convinced that inflation is headed back to its 2% target and said the Fed would cut rates before the pace of price increases actually reached that point. </p><p>“We’ve had three better readings, and if you average them, that’s a pretty good pace,” Powell said of inflation in a question-and-answer question at the Economic Club of Washington. Those figures, he said, “do add somewhat to confidence” that inflation is slowing sustainably.</p><p>Powell declined to provide any hints of when the first rate cut would occur. But most economists foresee the first cut occurring in September, and after Powell’s remarks Wall Street traders boosted their expectation that the Fed would reduce its key rate then from its 23-year high. The futures markets expect additional rate cuts in November and December.</p>
    

<p>“Today,” Powell said, “I’m not going to send any signals on any particular meeting.”</p><p>Rate reductions by the Fed would, over time, reduce consumers’ borrowing costs for things like mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. </p><p>Last week, the government reported that consumer prices <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-rates-economy-federal-reserve-biden-8d15ca77433a1ae072a1e63dfc089f24">declined</a></span> slightly from May to June, bringing inflation down to a year-over-year rate of 3%, from 3.3% in May. So-called “core” prices, which exclude volatile energy and food costs and often provide a better read of where inflation is likely headed, climbed 3.3% from a year earlier, below 3.4% in May.</p>



<p>In his remarks Monday, Powell stressed that the Fed did not need to wait until inflation actually reached 2% to cut borrowing costs. </p>
    
<p>“If you wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2%, you’ve probably waited too long,” Powell said, because it takes time for the Fed’s policies to affect the economy. </p><p>Powell also commented on the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-assassination-attempt-what-happened-734900d303fcfbf349162047f8059601">attempted assassination</a></span> of former President Donald Trump Saturday, saying it was a “sad day for our country” and adding that violence had no place in U.S. politics. </p>
    

<p>After several high inflation readings at the start of the year had raised some concerns, Fed officials said they would need to see several months of declining price readings to be confident enough that inflation was fading sustainably toward its target level. June was the third straight month in which inflation cooled on an annual basis. </p><p>After the government’s latest encouraging inflation report Thursday, Mary Daly, president of the Fed’s San Francisco branch, signaled that rate cuts were getting closer. Daly said it was “likely that some policy adjustments will be warranted,” though she didn’t suggest any specific timing or number of rate reductions. </p><p>In a call with reporters, Daly struck an upbeat tone, saying that June’s consumer price report showed that “we’ve got that kind of gradual reduction in inflation that we’ve been watching for and looking for, which ... is actually increasing confidence that we are on path to 2% inflation.”</p><p>Many drivers of price acceleration are slowing, solidifying the Fed’s confidence that inflation is being fully tamed after having steadily eased from a four-decade peak in 2022.</p>
    

<p>Thursday’s inflation report reflected a long-anticipated decline in rental and housing costs. Those costs had jumped in the aftermath of the pandemic as many Americans moved in search of more spacious living space to work from home. </p><p>Hiring and job openings are also cooling, thereby reducing the need for many businesses to ramp up pay in order to fill jobs. Sharply higher wages can drive up inflation if companies respond by raising prices to cover their higher labor costs. </p><p>Last week before a Senate committee, Powell noted that the job market had “cooled considerably,” and was not “a source of broad inflationary pressures for the economy.” </p>

Sales in the Americas also dropped by 23%.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In May this year, the company had announced a 40% fall in full-year profits. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Burberry is not the only luxury brand to suffer from the downturn. In March, luxury goods company Kering issued a profit warning after it said demand for its Gucci brand had slumped in China.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Pauline Brown, former boss of the luxury group LVMH for North America, said a change in consumer attitudes in China was affecting sales of mid-range brands particularly.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"We see that happening in every market that transitions from an emerging market to a more mature one.

<p>More details are coming to light about the AT&amp;T hack, which saw the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal data</a> of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/12/massive-att-data-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around 110M customers compromised</a> – including records of who they called and texted.</p>



<p>It’s reported that the carrier made a Bitcoin ransom payment in return for the hacker deleting the data, and that public disclosure of the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">security</a> breach was delayed for two months in response to a request from the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/fbi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBI</a> …</p>



<span id="more-958418"></span>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-massive-at-amp-t-hack">The massive AT&amp;T hack</h2>



<p>The carrier disclosed the hack last week.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>A massive AT&amp;T data breach has seen hackers able to steal the personal data of almost every customer the company has – a total of some 110 million Americans. In an incredible security fail, the stolen data includes not only customer phone numbers, but also records of who contacted whom – a potential privacy minefield.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The carrier said the data was obtained from a third-party cloud platform, and this is now believed to be Snowflake – where data from other companies was also obtained. This includes obtaining the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/04/ticketmaster-hack-560-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal data of 560M TicketMaster customers</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-carrier-paid-a-ransom">Carrier paid a ransom</h2>



<p><em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/atandt-paid-hacker-300000-to-delete-stolen-call-records/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a></em> provides evidence that AT&amp;T paid a ransom to the hacker in return for them deleting the data. The hacker originally demanded $1M in Bitcoin, and the amount finally paid was the equivalent of $373k.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The hacker, who is part of the notorious ShinyHunters hacking group that has stolen data from a number of victims through unsecured Snowflake cloud storage accounts, tells WIRED that AT&amp;T paid the ransom in May. He provided the address for the cryptocurrency wallet that sent the currency to him, as well as the address that received it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Both <em>Wired</em> itself and crypto-tracing firm TRM Labs were able to independently confirm transactions matching the hacker’s claim. Additionally, a security researcher who acted as a go-between also confirmed the payment, and provided proof.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-at-amp-t-delayed-disclosure-at-fbi-request">AT&amp;T delayed disclosure at FBI request</h2>



<p>Normally, the law requires companies to report data breaches to the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/27/data-breaches-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">within four days of discovery</a>. This requirement is intended to protect shareholders, rather than customers.</p>



<p>However, in this case <em><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/12/business/att-customers-massive-breach/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a></em> reports that AT&amp;T contacted the FBI first, and the agency asked the carrier to delay public disclosure, granting it an exemption from the SEC requirement.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The company said the US Department of Justice Department determined in May and in June that a delay in public disclosure was warranted. The FBI said AT&amp;T reached out shortly after learning about the hack, but the agency wanted to review the data for potential national security or public safety risks.</p>



<p>“In assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting… due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety,” the FBI said in a statement.</p>



<p>This appears to be the first cyber incident in which the Justice Department has asked a company to delay filing a disclosure with the SEC because of potential national security or public safety concerns.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The FBI made at least one arrest using the information provided.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Recent signs of easing inflation</strong>: The consumer price index (CPI) dipped in June for the first time in over four years, a key sign that inflation is easing, paving the way for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.</li>
<li><strong>Fed likely to lower interest rates</strong>: Fed officials expect to reduce the benchmark rate once in 2024 and four additional times in 2025, which could bring relief to households struggling with high borrowing costs.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on variable-rate debt</strong>: A rate cut would lower the prime rate, affecting interest rates on variable-rate debt such as private student loans and credit cards, making it a good time for consumers to review their debt and consider refinancing or consolidating.</li>
<li><strong>Consumers should prioritize debt management</strong>: With a potential rate cut on the horizon, consumers should focus on managing their debt, reviewing their spending habits, and exploring options for growing their money.</li>
<li><strong>Fed officials expect to reduce inflation further</strong>: The Fed's longer-term goal is to reduce inflation to around 2%, and officials believe that the recent decline in CPI is a sign that inflation is indeed cooling, setting the stage for further rate cuts in the future.</li>

Watch your variable-rate debt</h2><div class="group"><p>With a rate cut, the prime rate lowers, too, and the interest rates on variable-rate debt — such as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/01/credit-cards-gaining-steam-again.html">credit cards</a>, adjustable-rate mortgages and some private student loans — are likely to follow, reducing your monthly payments.</p><p>For example, credit card holders could see a reduction in their annual percentage yield, or APR, within a billing cycle or two. But even then, APRs will only ease off extremely high levels.</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/how-to-get-lower-interest-rates-without-a-fed-rate-cut.html">Rather than wait</a> for a small adjustment in the months ahead, borrowers could switch now to a zero-interest balance transfer credit card or consolidate and pay off high-interest credit cards with a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/cost-of-personal-loans/">personal loan</a>, Tayne said.</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107374951" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"></p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Olga Rolenko | Moment | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>Many homeowners with ARMs, which are pegged to a variety of indexes such as the prime rate, Libor or the 11<sup>th</sup> District Cost of Funds, may see their interest rate go down as well — although not immediately as ARMs generally reset just once a year.</p><p>In the meantime, there are fewer options to provide homeowners with extra breathing room. “Your better move may be waiting to refinance,” McBride said.</p><p>Private student loans also tend to have a variable rate tied to the prime, Treasury bill or another rate index, which means once the Fed starts cutting interest rates, the interest rates on those private student loans will start dropping.</p><p>Eventually, borrowers with existing variable-rate private student loans may also be able to refinance into a less expensive fixed-rate loan, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. </p><p>Currently, the fixed rates on a private refinance are as low as 5% and as high as 11%, Kantrowitz said.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline1"></a>2. Lock in savings rates</h2><div class="group"><p>While borrowing will become less expensive, those lower interest rates will hurt savers. </p><p>Since rates on online savings accounts, money market accounts and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/certificate-of-deposit/">certificates of deposit</a> are all poised to go down, experts say this is the time to lock in some of the highest returns in decades.</p><p>For now, top-yielding online savings accounts and one-year CDs are paying more than 5% — well above the rate of inflation.</p></div><blockquote data-test="Pullquote"><div class="Pullquote-pullquote"><p class="Pullquote-quotemark"><span class="Pullquote-quotemark1"></span><span class="Pullquote-quotemark2"></span></p><div><p class="Pullquote-quote">The opportunity to earn 5% annually on those cash investments may not last much longer.</p><div class="Pullquote-sourceWrapper"><p class="Pullquote-sourceAccentWrapper"></p><p class="Pullquote-source">Howard Hook</p><p class="Pullquote-info">wealth advisor with EKS Associates</p></div></div></div></blockquote><div class="group"><p>“One thing you may want to do is consider investing any idle cash you have into a higher-yielding money market fund,” said certified financial planner Howard Hook, a senior wealth advisor at EKS Associates in Princeton, New Jersey.</p><p>“Money market brokerage accounts usually pay higher rates than money market or savings accounts at banks,” he said in an emailed statement. “If the Fed is indeed looking to reduce rates five times over the next eighteen months (as currently projected), then the opportunity to earn 5% annually on those cash investments may not last much longer.”</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline2"></a>3. Put off large purchases</h2><div class="group"><p>If you’re planning a major purchase, like a home or car, then it may pay to wait, since lower interest rates could reduce the cost of financing down the road.</p><p>“Timing your purchase to coincide with lower rates can save money over the life of the loan,” Tayne said.</p><p>Although mortgage rates are fixed and tied to Treasury yields and the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/us-economy/">economy</a>, they’ve already started to come down from recent highs, largely due to the prospect of a Fed-induced economic slowdown. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is now just above 7%, according to Bankrate.</p><p>However, lower mortgage rates could also boost homebuying demand, which would push prices higher, McBride said. “If lower mortgage rates lead to a surge in prices, that’s going to offset the affordability benefit for would-be buyers.”</p></div><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><div class="group"><p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/auto-loans/">auto loans</a>, there’s no question inflation has hit financing costs — and vehicle prices — hard. The average rate on a five-year new car loan is now nearly 8%, according to Bankrate.</p><p>But in this case, “the financing is one variable, and it’s frankly one of the smaller variables,” McBride said. For example, a quarter percentage point reduction in rates on a $35,000, five-year loan is $4 a month, he calculated.</p><p>In this case, and in many other situations as well, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/27/why-a-good-credit-score-matters-and-how-to-improve-your-number.html">consumers would benefit more from improving their credit scores</a>, which could pave the way to even better loan terms, McBride said.</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO</h2></div></div></div></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

<li><strong>Understanding Social Security Payment Dates is crucial</strong>: For people with disabilities who live in the United States, understanding the Social Security SSI and SSDI payment dates is vital for surviving, especially if their disability prevents them from working.</li>
<li><strong>SSI Payment Dates 2024</strong>: SSI benefits are typically paid on the 1st of the month, with the full payment being done on the business day before if the 1st falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday.

<li><strong>Eligibility Requirements</strong>: To qualify for SSI, you must meet certain eligibility requirements, which include having a disability that prevents you from working, having limited income and resources, and being a U.S. citizen, national, or qualified alien.</li>
<li><strong>Getting Ready for COLA 2025</strong>: If you are an SSDI or SSI disability beneficiary, you should be aware that COLA 2025 (Cost of Living Adjustment) may affect your benefits.

<p>In situations when a disability keeps you from working, <strong>Social Security SSI and SSDI Payment Dates 2024</strong> might be a lifeline in terms of surviving. Understanding the SSI and SSDI Payment Dates 2024 is vital for people with disabilities who live in the United States.</p>




<p>With regard to the <strong>SSI Payment Dates 2024 and COLA 2025 New SSDI and SSI possible amounts,</strong> this article seeks to provide you with full details. You could be concerned about your future and COLA 2025 affect on SSDI and SSI disability beneficiaries if you have a recent disability that keeps you from working.</p>




<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SSI and SSDI Payment Dates 2024</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>This program guarantees payments each month to cover basic living expenses. People who fulfill the <strong>SSI Payment 2024 Eligibility Requirements</strong> sometimes also qualify for Social Security payments. You and certain family members may be eligible for Social Security benefits if you have paid enough taxes into the program and have earned enough job experience. It’s crucial to remember, however, that the Social Security benefit payout schedule and the <strong>SSDI Payment Dates 2024</strong> are not the same.</li>



<li>You can go through your Statement first if you must apply for SSDI because of your disability. Therefore, your benefit should be larger if you file for SSDI three years later and have been employed throughout that time. It takes 9.5 years of employment for a 60-year-old to qualify for disability insurance. Some people fear that their impairment will take their life and that they won’t be able to support their family financially.</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SSI Payment Dates 2024 For Next 6 Months</strong></h3>



<p>SSI benefits are often shared on the 1st of the month. The full payment is done on the business day before if the first day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday. On the other hand, those who started receiving benefits prior to May 1997 always received their SSI payments on the third day of the month, regardless of weekends or holidays.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>July:</strong> Monday, 1st of the month</li>



<li><strong>August:</strong> Thursday, 1st of the month</li>



<li><strong>September:</strong> Friday, 30th of August</li>



<li><strong>October:</strong> Tuesday, 1st of the month</li>



<li><strong>November:</strong> Friday, 1st of the month</li>



<li><strong>December:</strong> Friday, 29th of November</li>
</ul>





<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SSDI Payment Dates 2024 For Next 6 Months</strong></h3>



<p>To make sure that benefits are still adequate to offset increases in living expenses, Social Security modifies payouts annually. The <strong>Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program saw a 3.2% rise in benefits by 2024.</strong> Social Security beneficiaries, as well as those who receive SSDI and SSI, will already see this rise in effect for the complete fiscal year 2024.</p>



<p>Beneficiaries will be able to handle rising daily costs with the assistance of this rise, even though it is smaller than in the past. When determining who is eligible to receive disability, survivor, retirement, and stimulus checks, the Social Security Administration (SSA) uses birthdates to make this decision.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Month</strong></td><td><strong>Birth dates: 1st–10th</strong></td><td><strong>Birth dates: 11th-20th</strong></td><td><strong>Birth dates: 21st-31st</strong></td></tr><tr><td>July</td><td>7/10</td><td>7/17</td><td>7/24</td></tr><tr><td>August</td><td>8/14</td><td>8/21</td><td>8/28</td></tr><tr><td>September</td><td>9/11</td><td>9/18</td><td>9/25</td></tr><tr><td>October</td><td>10/9</td><td>10/16</td><td>10/23</td></tr><tr><td>November</td><td>11/13</td><td>11/20</td><td>11/27</td></tr><tr><td>December</td><td>12/11</td><td>12/18</td><td>12/24</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>COLA 2025 New SSDI and SSI possible amounts</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Although Social Security will make its announcement on the 2025 COLA rise in October, beneficiaries of <strong>SSI and SSDI disability benefits</strong> might make some predictions ahead of time. It’s possible that the COLA rise in 2025 won’t be as large as many American disabled recipients had anticipated. The Senior Citizens League states that the Cost of Living Adjustment may be less. They even claim that the COLA in 2025 may be as high as 2.57%. As a result, it is much less than the 3.2% COLA increase in 2024. Despite the fact that they both appear to be less amount, there is a significant difference when considering the overall gain annually as opposed to monthly.</li>



<li>Although the maximum <strong>Social Security Disability Insurance payment is $3,822,</strong> very few people actually get this amount. Among users of disabilities benefits, average payments are far more prevalent. After the 2.57% COLA rise, your new disability payment may be $1,576 if your typical SSDI check is worth $1,537. So, handicap beneficiaries may get an additional $39 a month or $468 annually. In 2024, the average amount that beneficiaries of Supplemental Security Income get is $698. After the COLA increase in 2025, their new amount may be $715. Thus, the extra amount will only be around $17 a month or $204 annually.</li>
</ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">













</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>COLA 2025 affect on SSDI and SSI disability beneficiaries</strong></h3>



<p>The problem is that Social Security bases its benefits on the Consumer Price Index for clerical and urban workers. Because workers do not purchase the same items as people with disabilities, this may not rightly reflect reality. </p>



<p>Therefore, the R-CPI-E, or Consumer Price Index for Americans 62 and Over, would be a superior option. Because both seniors and those receiving disability benefits may require additional medical costs, this can show the read needs. Furthermore, a low COLA might mean less purchasing power.</p>
