<ol>
<li>Fed Chair Jay Powell has expressed increasing concern about the cooling labor market, which is a sign that the central bank may be considering cutting interest rates.</li>
<li>Powell stated that the labor market is now "getting pretty much in balance" and that the central bank is paying attention to both inflation and employment in its decision-making.</li>
<li>The unemployment rate has been trending upward, rising to 4.1% in June, and Powell has acknowledged the risks posed by a cooling labor market.</li>
<li>Fed watchers believe that a rate cut may be imminent, potentially as early as September, although Powell did not provide a specific timeline.</li>
<li>Powell emphasized that more data is needed to confirm that inflation is on a downward trajectory to the central bank's target rate of 2% before any rate cuts can be made.</li>

	<a href="https://deadline.com/tag/skydance/" id="auto-tag_skydance" data-tag="skydance">Skydance</a> CEO <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/david-ellison/" id="auto-tag_david-ellison" data-tag="david-ellison">David Ellison</a> said <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/tom-cruise/" id="auto-tag_tom-cruise" data-tag="tom-cruise">Tom Cruise</a> of <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/paramount/" id="auto-tag_paramount" data-tag="paramount">Paramount</a>’s <em>Mission Impossible</em> and <em>Top Gun </em>franchises “is supportive of the planned merger and that the “outreach that we have received from the entertainment community has been pretty remarkable and humbling.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	“I think there’s a great opportunity, the fact that we’ll have one of the first owned and operated studios, that will be that will be stable, that can think long term. That’s not just going to have to focus on tomorrow but can focus on several years from now. We really are going to take the long-term approach to this business. And it’s been it’s been really exciting, encouraging and humbling that the greatest filmmakers in the world and artists are supportive of this transaction,” he said today in an interview with CNBC.

	</p>

<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Skydance has made nine movies with Cruise, he said, calling the actor “one of the greatest, most talented artists in the world.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Ellison also offered a peek into his family’s investment philosophy and how it informed the deal on his end, telling the network, “We’re really comfortable with businesses in transition.”

</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	“I think if you look at the technological prowess we have on the family side, and the transition that Oracle just went through, that was a time period where … we bought more stock and emerged in that transition stronger than ever. Remember similar conversations around Tesla when we made that bet, obviously, as a family. And what we believe in here [with Paramount] is the ability to transition this business, to double down on our core competencies and invest in technology and actually create that media company of the future where art and technology can work hand in hand. And believe that when we come out of this, Paramount will definitively be winner.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Ellison’s father is billionaire Oracle co-founder <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/larry-ellison/" id="auto-tag_larry-ellison" data-tag="larry-ellison">Larry Ellison</a>, who is a backer of Skydance and its planned acquisition of and merger with Paramount in a two-step transaction.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Asked about Larry Ellison’s possible involvement in the New Paramount as it’s being called now — which everyone from Wall street to Hollywood is curious about — he said, “So obviously, you know, I’m running the company with Jeff Shell. But please understand, I’ve got an amazing relationship with my father. We talk every day.”

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Pressed on that, he said there are some things “in this interim period I can’t speak to” and noted how Skydance and Oracle had partnered to create “studio in the could” — a cloud-based animation studio.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	“It’s been an incredible privilege of being able to learn from him, and learn from other mentors like Steve Jobs and David Geffen.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	 “What I really want to say is when you go back to Skydance 15 years ago, the core thesis of the founding, of the foundation of Skydance, was that this bridge was going to get built between Silicon Valley and Hollywood, and that that was going to create a tremendous amount of disruption. And Skydance is very much a pure play content engine that was the tip of the spear for that disruption, that believes in where entertainment is heading. And really, Paramount is a business that needs to follow suit and make that transformation and be able to meet this particular moment in time.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Skydance and <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/shari-redstone/" id="auto-tag_shari-redstone" data-tag="shari-redstone">Shari Redstone</a>, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, danced around a deal for months before coming to terms and announcing a proposed transaction Sunday night. That started the clock ticking on a 45-day “go shop” period for any other interested bidder to make a move. Otherwise, the deal is expected to fly past regulators and might close sooner than the nine months anticipated earlier this week. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	“There could be a pathway here for this to be a lot tighter and quicker in the review process, but it’s not in our control,” said <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/gerry-cardinale/" id="auto-tag_gerry-cardinale" data-tag="gerry-cardinale">Gerry Cardinale</a> of <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/redbird-capital/" id="auto-tag_redbird-capital" data-tag="redbird-capital">RedBird Capital</a>, Skydance’s partner and investor in the deal, who appeared with Ellison on CNBC.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	The deal calls for Skydance and backers including Larry Ellison and RedBird to acquire Shari Redstone’s family holding company National Amusements, which controls Paramount. The Skydance group will invest $1.5 billion in Paramount and merge with the storied company. Paramount is publicly traded and Skydance is offering to buy out all Class A voting shares for $23 each, and a chunk of non-voting Class B shares for $15.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Hollywood is happy that the historic backlot will be preserved, that private equity, which has been known to destroy value, won’t have free rein, and that Par’s new owner is passionate about the business. Paramount staff may be more apprehensive as Ellison outlined an unspecified but whopping $2 billion in cost savings, vs the $500 million in cuts identified this spring by the outgoing trio of CEOs — which is included in the total. Industry insiders have noted over the past year that Paramount’s already been cut pretty close to the bone over the years. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	What’s mainly known of the merged company management-wise so far is that Ellison will be CEO and Jeff Shell president.</p>

<p>AMD is to buy Finnish artificial intelligence startup Silo AI for $665 million in one of the largest such takeovers in Europe as the US chipmaker seeks to expand its AI services to compete with market leader Nvidia.</p>
<p>California-based AMD said Silo’s 300-member team would use its software tools to build custom large language models (LLMs), the kind of AI technology that underpins chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. The all-cash acquisition is expected to close in the second half of this year, subject to regulatory approval.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>“This agreement helps us both accelerate our customer engagements and deployments while also helping us accelerate our own AI tech stack,” Vamsi Boppana, senior vice president of AMD’s artificial intelligence group, told the Financial Times.</p>
<p>The acquisition is the largest of a privately held AI startup in Europe since Google acquired UK-based DeepMind for around 400 million pounds in 2014, according to data from Dealroom.</p>
<p>The deal comes at a time when buyouts by Silicon Valley companies have come under tougher scrutiny from regulators in Brussels and the UK. Europe-based AI startups, including Mistral, DeepL, and Helsing, have raised hundreds of millions of dollars this year as investors seek out a local champion to rival US-based OpenAI and Anthropic.</p>
<p>Helsinki-based Silo AI, which is among the largest private AI labs in Europe, offers tailored AI models and platforms to enterprise customers. The Finnish company launched an initiative last year to build LLMs in European languages, including Swedish, Icelandic, and Danish.</p>
<p>AMD’s AI technology competes with that of Nvidia, which has taken the lion’s share of the high-performance chip market. Nvidia’s success has propelled its valuation past $3 trillion this year as tech companies push to build the computing infrastructure needed to power the biggest AI models. AMD started to roll out its MI300 chips late last year in a direct challenge to Nvidia’s “Hopper” line of chips.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Peter Sarlin, Silo AI co-founder and chief executive, called the acquisition the “logical next step” as the Finnish group seeks to become a “flagship” AI company.</p>
<p>Silo AI is committed to “open source” AI models, which are available for free and can be customized by anyone. This distinguishes it from the likes of OpenAI and Google, which favor their own proprietary or “closed” models.</p>
<p>The startup previously described its family of open models, called “Poro,” as an important step toward “strengthening European digital sovereignty” and democratizing access to LLMs.</p>
<p>The concentration of the most powerful LLMs into the hands of a few US-based Big Tech companies is meanwhile attracting attention from antitrust regulators in Washington and Brussels.</p>
<p>The Silo deal shows AMD seeking to scale its business quickly and drive customer engagement with its own offering. AMD views Silo, which builds custom models for clients, as a link between its “foundational” AI software and the real-world applications of the technology.</p>
<p>Software has become a new battleground for semiconductor companies as they try to lock in customers to their hardware and generate more predictable revenues, outside the boom-and-bust chip sales cycle.</p>
<p>Nvidia’s success in the AI market stems from its multibillion-dollar investment in Cuda, its proprietary software that allows chips originally designed for processing computer graphics and video games to run a wider range of applications.</p>
<p>Since starting to develop Cuda in 2006, Nvidia has expanded its software platform to include a range of apps and services, largely aimed at corporate customers that lack the in-house resources and skills that Big Tech companies have to build on its technology.</p>
<p>Nvidia now offers more than 600 “pre-trained” models, meaning they are simpler for customers to deploy. The Santa Clara, California-based group last month started rolling out a “microservices” platform, called NIM, which promises to let developers build chatbots and AI “co-pilot” services quickly.</p>
<p>Historically, Nvidia has offered its software free of charge to buyers of its chips, but said this year that it planned to charge for products such as NIM.</p>
<p>AMD is among several companies contributing to the development of an OpenAI-led rival to Cuda, called Triton, which would let AI developers switch more easily between chip providers. Meta, Microsoft, and Intel have also worked on Triton.</p>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Tax preparation and financial software company Intuit announced an AI-focused reorganization plan Wednesday that includes laying off about 10% of its workforce.</p><p>The company behind QuickBooks and TurboTax said it was laying off 1,800 employees, but that it expects to hire at least that many in fiscal 2025 as it accelerates its focus on incorporating artificial intelligence into its products and services.</p><p>In an email to employees, CEO Sasan Goodarzi said more than 1,000 of the layoffs were employees that were not meeting the company’s elevated expectations.</p><p>Another 300 positions are being eliminated “to streamline work and reallocate resources toward key growth areas,” the email said.</p><p>Mountain View, California-based Intuit will also close offices in Boise, Idaho and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada where more than 250 employees work. Some of those workers will transfer to new locations, the company said. </p>
    

<p>“The era of AI is one of the most significant technology shifts of our lifetime,” Goodarzi said in the opening of his email to staff. ”Companies that aren’t prepared to take advantage of this AI revolution will fall behind and, over time, will no longer exist.” </p>



<p>As for severance, Intuit said that all its laid off U.S. employees will get a minimum of 16 weeks of pay, plus two additional weeks for every year of service and “at least” six months of health insurance coverage. U.S. employees received 60 days notice of their termination, with a last day of Sept. 9. </p><p>In a regulatory filing, Intuit estimated the reorganization plan will incur between $250 million and $260 million in charges, mostly coming in its fiscal fourth quarter ending July 31.</p><p>Intuit shares fell 3.6% in morning trading to $626.29 per share.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>A US judge has dismissed a case filed by former Twitter employees, who claimed that Elon Musk unfairly denied them approximately $500 million in severance payments owed after his takeover of the company.</li>
<li>Judge Trina Thompson ruled that the employees failed to prove that their claims were protected by federal law, specifically the America's Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).</li>
<li>The dismissal is a win for Elon Musk, who acquired Twitter in 2022 and immediately laid off thousands of employees, sparking multiple lawsuits from former staff and vendors.</li>
<li>The complaint, filed in 2023 by former Twitter head of total rewards Courtney McMillian, alleged that employees were provided only one month's worth of pay as severance instead of the promised two months of salary and contributions towards health insurance.</li>
<li>The case is one of several still pending in court, including another brought by former Twitter leaders. Judge Thompson noted that while the court lacks jurisdiction in this case, plaintiffs may still have opportunities to prove their claims in other lawsuits.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>FTC plans to sue three health companies</strong>: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is planning to sue three large pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) over their practices as middlemen in the US healthcare system.</li>
<li><strong>Targeting PBMs accused of inflating costs</strong>: The lawsuits are expected to target Optum Rx (UnitedHealth Group), Caremark (CVS Health), and Express Scripts (Cigna), as the FTC argues they inflate costs for patients by negotiating higher prices for medications such as insulin.</li>
<li><strong>Middlemen accused of inflating US drug prices</strong>: The FTC says that market consolidation has allowed these PBMs to exert significant influence over drug prices, resulting in higher costs for patients and the healthcare system as a whole.</li>
<li><strong>FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan testifies</strong>: FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan has already testified about the issue, stating that the agency is committed to addressing the problem of inflated drug prices and ensuring that patients have access to affordable healthcare.</li>
<li><strong>Lawsuits expected to be filed soon</strong>: The lawsuits are expected to be filed soon, although no specific timeline has been announced. The development is significant, as it marks the FTC's effort to address the growing concern over high drug prices in the US.</li>

class="dcr-iy9ec7">Microsoft said it had seen significant progress by OpenAI’s new board, which was formed after the dramatic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/22/sam-altman-openai-ceo-return-board-chatgpt" data-link-name="in body link">sacking and reinstatement</a> of the chief executive, Sam Altman, last year. It said OpenAI was going in the right direction, including a commitment to safety and building a “great culture”.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,” said Microsoft, which has invested $13bn (£10.2bn) in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/openai" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">OpenAI</a>.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">However, it is understood that Microsoft believed the observer role was causing concern among competition regulators. In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/08/uk-competition-watchdog-to-review-microsoft-and-openai-partnership" data-link-name="in body link">reviewing</a> whether the partnership has resulted in “an acquisition of control”, while in the US the Federal Trade Commission is also <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/01/ftc-launches-inquiry-generative-ai-investments-partnerships" data-link-name="in body link">looking at the partnership</a>.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The European Commission has decided not to conduct a formal merger review into Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI but is scrutinising exclusivity clauses in the agreement between the companies.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">An OpenAI spokesperson said that the San Francisco-based startup was establishing a new approach to “informing and engaging key strategic partners” such as Microsoft and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Apple</a> as well as other financial investors.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Moving forward, we will host regular stakeholder meetings to share progress on our mission and ensure stronger collaboration across safety and security. We look forward to continuing to receive feedback and advice from these key stakeholders,” the spokesperson said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">OpenAI will no longer have board observers under the new approach, which rules out Apple taking up such a role. It was reported this month that Apple was set to place the head of its app store, Phil Schiller, on the board as part of an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/10/apple-ai-product-launch" data-link-name="in body link">agreement announced in June</a>.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>New AAA study finds car safety systems may lead to distracted driving</strong>: A study conducted by the American Automobile Association (AAA) suggests that multiple systems designed to make driving safer and easier may actually be placing drivers in danger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Car safety systems under scrutiny</strong>: The AAA study calls into question the effectiveness of various car safety systems, including lane departure warnings, blind spot detection, and adaptive cruise control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Systems may be creating distractions</strong>: The study suggests that these safety systems may be creating distractions for drivers, which can lead to accidents. The researchers found that drivers who were exposed to these systems were more likely to engage in distracted driving behaviors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Driver attention split between multiple systems</strong>: The study found that the more safety systems a car had, the more likely a driver was to split their attention between multiple systems, which can increase the risk of accidents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential implications for driver safety</strong>: The findings of the AAA study suggest that the widespread adoption of these car safety systems may have unintended consequences for driver safety. The study's authors are urging manufacturers and policymakers to reconsider the design of these systems and to prioritize driver safety.</p>

<li><strong>Number of Tiny Home Villages</strong>: Over the past five years, 100 tiny home villages have been built in the United States to address homelessness, quadrupling from 34 in 2019 to 123 today.</li>
<li><strong>Private Funding</strong>: At least 43% of these villages are privately funded through donations from philanthropists, businesses, and corporations, with some notable donors including Sobrato Philanthropies, James M. Cox, and the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation.</li>
<li>** Geographic Distribution**: Tiny home villages have been built in various locations, including California cities such as San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland, as well as Austin, Texas, and rural North Carolina.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations</strong>: While tiny home villages can provide temporary housing for some individuals, they may not address the root causes of homelessness, which include a lack of affordable housing and social services. The construction of tiny homes can also be slow and costly due to permit and financing issues.</li>
<li><strong>Scale of the Crisis</strong>: The article highlights the severity of the homelessness crisis in the United States, with over 650,000 people without housing, emphasizing that even with the growth of tiny home villages, the scale of the problem remains significant.</li>

The Michael and Susan Dell Foundation is a key donor behind a 51-acre tiny home community in Austin, Texas. And in rural North Carolina, the Oak Foundation has supported the construction of a tiny home village for the severely mentally ill and chronically homeless.</p><p>As ambitious as these efforts may be, they serve only a fraction of the estimated homeless population. While tiny homes — which typically are 100 to 400 square feet and sometimes include a kitchen and a bathroom — can be built quickly and cheaply, the larger tasks of securing permits, financing, and local government approval can add big costs and delays.</p><p>Skeptics worry that the construction of tiny homes doesn’t remedy the bigger issue, which is the widespread lack of affordable housing.</p><p>At best, tiny homes are a short-term solution to the country’s long-term issue of insufficient housing and social services for low-income Americans, said Margot Kushel, director of the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at the University of California San Francisco.</p><p>“I would say that tiny homes are an absolutely important part of the ecosystem, but they are not housing,” Kushel said.</p><p>Rural tiny homes</p><p>In Chatham County, North Carolina — where the median sale price for a home is <a href="https://www.redfin.com/county/2025/NC/Chatham-County/housing-market" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:around $690,000;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16">around $690,000</a> — it has taken eight years to open a community of tiny homes. The Tiny Homes Village at the Farm at Penny Lane was the brainchild of local health and wellness nonprofit Cross Disability Services, or XDS, which is affiliated with the University of North Carolina and owns the 40-acre farm.</p><p>“We were providing all these expensive, great services for people, but they don’t have a place to live. They don’t have anything permanent. And that’s a huge problem,” said Thava Mahadevan, executive director of XDS.</p><p>XDS wanted to create housing that would cost less than $400 in monthly rent and be located at the farm. The UNC School of Social Work came on as a partner in 2016. The Oak Foundation, a longtime UNC funder, provided two grants totaling $1,050,000.</p><p>XDS’s first move was to ensure it could win county approval of the zoning for the village and that there was adequate underlying infrastructure, such as county water pipelines connected to the farm’s well. Construction workers then broke ground for the village in March 2020, but work was delayed by the pandemic.</p><p>The 15-unit tiny home village, which will open to residents in the fall, will provide affordable housing to people with serious mental illness. Each home will be about 400 square feet with a bathroom, kitchen, living area, and front porch. Medical and mental health services will be provided. And residents can live in the homes indefinitely.</p><p>The county is now looking into how it might encourage developers to build additional low-cost housing options for its population of roughly 79,000 as housing prices continue to climb, said Karen Howard, vice chair of the Chatham County board of commissioners.</p><p>Skyrocketing living costs have been especially tough for minimum wage workers in rural areas like Chatham County. North Carolina has one of the highest eviction rates in the country, and more than <a href="https://nchousing.org/release-of-2023-county-profiles/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1 million;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="17">1 million</a> of its households pay over 30% of their income on housing. Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina have higher eviction rates than large cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, according to <a href="https://evictionlab.org/more-than-200000-rural-families-face-an-eviction-every-year/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="18">research</a> from Princeton University’s Eviction Lab.</p><p>West Coast efforts</p><p>But nowhere is the housing and homeless crisis as severe as in California, where more than 181,000 people are without permanent housing. Last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed to provide 1,200 tiny homes for this population. So far, only about 150 have been purchased and none have opened, CalMatters <a href="https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2024/05/tiny-homes-not-filled/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recently reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="19">recently reported</a>.</p><p>Philanthropy has backed efforts to construct the homes more quickly, typically in partnership with local governments. Last year, the Sobrato Family Foundation said it would lease a two-acre lot of private land to San Jose for the construction of 75 tiny homes for $1 a year over the next decade. San Francisco-based nonprofit Dignity Moves is managing the development of the community and providing social services, with support from the James M. Cox and Valhalla foundations. The nonprofit was also part of the team that developed San Francisco’s <a href="https://dignitymoves.org/san-francisco/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:70-unit tiny home village;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="20">70-unit tiny home village</a> and similar communities throughout the state.</p><p>“In our model, philanthropy pays for the construction, and then the expectation is that the city will pay for the ongoing supportive services,” said Dignity Moves CEO Elizabeth Funk.</p><p>This kind of interim housing is fairly new and is different from the kinds of congregate homeless shelters that cities have typically funded, she said. With interim housing, everyone has their own room and can stay for at least six months to two years rather than for a night or two, Funk added.</p><p>Tiny home communities offer more stability and can be places where social services can be effectively administered “because people aren’t in crisis mode,” she said.</p><p>California, Oregon, and Washington are the states with the greatest concentration of tiny home villages, according to data compiled by Missouri State University. Some communities have also tried to deal with unsheltered homelessness in more punitive ways. The town of Grants Pass, Oregon, wants to fine and jail people found sleeping in public spaces and mounted a legal challenge to a court ruling blocking the policy. The Supreme Court <a href="https://apnews.com/article/grants-pass-oregon-supreme-court-homeless-encampments-a8dcddb518bd76b11d409666c06701b8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heard arguments;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="21">heard arguments</a> for the case in April and could issue a decision as soon as this month.</p><p>Building tiny homes is better than penalizing people for living on the streets, but that isn’t enough, said Jesse Rabinowitz, campaigns and communications director at the National Homelessness Law Center.</p><p>“It’s good that cities and states are doing things to address the fact that people are living outside. Nobody should live outside, especially in the richest country in the world,” he said.</p><p>However, he said, “I am personally conflicted around tiny homes.” It seems to be a way of ushering people into interim housing rather than providing the more permanent affordable housing options that many homeless people want, Rabinowitz said.</p><p>Funk bristles at the criticism that tiny homes aren’t part of the housing-first approach that prioritizes permanent housing for people experiencing homelessness. Interim housing is a stage in that process, which is fundamentally about getting people off the streets and sheltered, she said.</p><p>“It is true that this is not a long-term solution. It’s a waiting room,” Funk said. “It is a dignified waiting room.”</p><p>_____</p><p><a href="mailto:stephanie.beasley@philanthropy.com" data-ylk="slk:Stephanie Beasley;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="22">Stephanie Beasley</a> is a senior writer at the Chronicle of Philanthropy, where you can read the <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/foundations-are-funding-tiny-home-villages-for-the-homeless-is-it-a-worthwhile-effort" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:full article;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="23">full article</a>.

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>A company called American Rounds has installed computerized vending machines in grocery stores in Alabama, Oklahoma, and Texas that sell ammunition, allowing customers to purchase bullets along with everyday items like milk.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The vending machines use facial recognition software and identification scanners to verify the buyer's age, a feature that advocates believe is necessary to prevent underage gun ownership and reduce gun violence.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The company claims that its age-verification technology makes transactions more secure than online sales or in-store purchases, where shoplifting is a risk.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocates, including Nick Suplina from Everytown for Gun Safety, express concern that selling ammunition in grocery stores will lead to more gun violence and normalize the sale of guns and ammunition, making it easier for individuals to access them.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**According to the article, there have been 15 mass killings involving a firearm in 2024 so far, compared to 39 in 2023, highlighting the ongoing issue of gun violence in the United States.</p>

But advocates worry that selling bullets out of vending machines will lead to more shootings in the U.S., where gun violence killed at least 33 people <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gun-violence-shootings-july-fourth-90bd7b9473e280e14429489decafd552" target="_blank">on Independence Day alone</a>.</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">The company maintains the age-verification technology means that the transactions are as secure, or more secure, than online sales, which may not require the purchaser to submit proof of age, or at retail stores, where there is a risk of shoplifting.</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">“I’m very thankful for those who are taking the time to get to know us and not just making assumptions about what we’re about," CEO Grant Magers said. “We are very pro-Second Amendment, but we are for responsible gun ownership, and we hope we’re improving the environment for the community.”</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">There have been 15 mass killings involving a firearm so far in 2024, compared to 39 in 2023, <a href="https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/mass-killings/index.html" target="_blank">according to a database</a> maintained in a partnership of The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University.</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">“Innovations that make ammunition sales more secure via facial recognition, age verification, and the tracking of serial sales are promising safety measures that belong in gun stores, not in the place where you buy your kids milk,” said Nick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety. “In a country awash in guns and ammo, where guns are the leading cause of deaths for kids, we don’t need to further normalize the sale and promotion of these products.”</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">Magers said grocery stores and others approached the Texas-based company, which began in 2023, about the idea of selling ammunition through automated technology. The company has one machine in Alabama, four in Oklahoma and one in Texas, with plans for another in Texas and one in Colorado in the coming weeks, he said.</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">“People I think got shocked when they thought about the idea of selling ammo at a grocery store," Magers said. "But as we explained, how is that any different than Walmart?”</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">Lowe’s Market CEO Alan Buxkemper, who lives in Canyon Lake, told <a href="https://mycanyonlake.com/lowes-adds-ammo-vending-machines-to-canyon-lake-stores/" target="_blank">My Canyon Lake </a>that they plan to add a second American Rounds vending machine at another area store.</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">Buxkemper told the newspaper they’re “doing it in a safe and responsible way.”</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">Federal law requires a person to be 18 to buy shotgun and rifle ammunition and 21 to buy handgun ammunition. Magers said their machines require a purchaser to be at least 21.</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">The machine works by requiring a customer to scan their driver’s license to validate that they are age 21 or older. The scan also checks that it is a valid license, he said. That is followed by a facial recognition scan to verify “you are who you are saying you are as a consumer,” he said.</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">“At that point you can complete your transaction of your product and you’re off and going," he said. "The whole experience takes a minute and a half once you are familiar with the machine.”</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">The vending machine is another method of sale, joining retail stores and online retailers. <a href="https://smokinggun.org/report/underage-ammo-sales/">A March report</a> by Everytown for Gun Safety found that several major online ammunition retailers did not appear to verify their customers’ ages, despite requirements.</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">Last year, an online retailer settled a lawsuit brought by families of those killed and injured in a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-us-news-ap-top-news-greg-abbott-shootings-32220cb5316b4fbf9dd7f9d5b125c6f9">2018 Texas high school shooting</a>. The families said the 17-year-old shooter was able to buy ammunition from the retailer who failed to verify his age.</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">Vending machines for bullets or other age-restricted materials is not an entirely new idea. Companies have developed similar technology to sell alcoholic beverages. A company has marketed automated kiosks to sell cannabis products in dispensaries in states where marijuana is legal.</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">A Pennsylvania police officer created a company about 12 years ago that places bullet-vending machines in private gun clubs and ranges as a convenience for patrons. Those machines do not have the age verification mechanism but are only placed in locations with an age requirement to enter, Master Ammo owner Sam Piccinini said.</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">Piccinini spoke with a company years ago about incorporating the artificial intelligence technology to verify a purchaser’s age and identity, but at the time it was cost-prohibitive, he said. For American Rounds, one machine had to be removed from a site in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, because of disappointing sales, Magers said.</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">Magers said much of the early interest for the machines has been in rural communities where there may be few retailers that sell ammunition. The American Rounds machines are in Super C Mart and Fresh Value grocery stores in small cities, including Pell City, Alabama, which has a population over 13,600, and Noble, Oklahoma, where nearly 7,600 people live.</p><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 CGHCP htMUPQ article-text">“Someone in that community might have to drive an hour or an hour and a half to get supplied if they want to go hunting, for instance,” Margers said. “Our grocery stores, they wanted to be able to offer their customer another category that they felt like would be popular.”</p></section><p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 jnAGvX copyright">Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Target will no longer accept personal checks</strong>: Starting July 15, Target will stop accepting personal checks from customers, citing "extremely low volumes" of checks. This is another retailer to stop taking checks, aiming to simplify checkout processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Checks are falling out of use</strong>: Although around 61% of Americans still write checks, the frequency is decreasing. This trend is particularly true for younger consumers, such as Gen Z and Millennials, who write fewer checks than older generations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact on older consumers</strong>: The phase-out of personal checks may disproportionately affect older consumers, who may rely more heavily on this payment method. According to retail analyst Neil Saunders, "there will be small pockets of people, including more elderly consumers, who will lament that they are being phased out."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative payment methods available</strong>: Target will continue to accept various payment methods, including Apple Pay, SNAP/EBT, buy now/pay later services, Target Circle Cards, its store card, cash, credit, and debit cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retailers moving away from checks</strong>: Target follows other retailers in discontinuing personal checks. As payment technologies continue to evolve, it's likely that more retailers will follow suit, ultimately leading to a decline in the use of checks in everyday transactions.</p>

<li>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported a 40% year-over-year increase in revenue for the second quarter, with growth attributed to demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips.</li>
<li>TSMC's revenue for the second quarter was $207.87 billion, with a net year-over-year increase of 32.9%.</li>
<li>Despite a 9.5% decrease in revenue from May, TSMC's revenue for the first half of 2023 is up 28% year-over-year, driven by surging demand for AI chips.</li>
<li>The company's 40% revenue growth is the fastest pace seen in about two years, and analysts are expecting pricing power for TSMC as demand remains strong.</li>
<li>TSMC's supply of AI chips is in high demand, particularly for NVIDIA and Apple's most advanced chips, which is driving the company's revenue growth.</li>

	With the media and entertainment industry continuing to undergo unprecedented change, streaming bundles, sports rights, the overall state of film, TV and tech, as well as the current political climate are in the mix at the conference, which has been hosted annually since 1983 by boutique investment bank Allen &amp; Co. <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/open-ai/" id="auto-tag_open-ai" data-tag="open-ai">Open AI</a> co-founder <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/sam-altman/" id="auto-tag_sam-altman" data-tag="sam-altman">Sam Altman</a> is attending, with Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and CEO Andy Jassy.

	The executive crowd and wealthy political donors will be mingling with some of the nation’s most dynamic Democratic governors including Wisconsin’s Gretchen Whitmer and Maryland’s Wes Moore Pennsylvania Gov. <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/josh-shapiro/" id="auto-tag_josh-shapiro" data-tag="josh-shapiro">Josh Shapiro</a> was invited but is remaining in Harrisburg for ongoing budget negotiations. All have doubled down on support for President Biden amid <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/biden-donors-outrage-abigail-disney-barry-diller-1236001923/">calls for him to step away</a> as a presidential candidate f<a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/biden-debate-trump-travel-schedule-1236000406/">ollowing that disastrous debate </a>performance two weeks ago.

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Whitmer, who was the target of an (unsuccessful) kidnapping plot, has been out and about this week defending Biden and talking about her new book, <em>True Gretch: What I’ve Learned About Life, Leadership, and Everything in Between.</em></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Shari Redstone, meanwhile, may be turning the page on Allen &amp; Co. after this year as she prepares to exit the biz. She’s explored potential deals and partnerships for several years at the event but arrived at Sun Valley 2024 having literally just clinched Paramount’s sale to Skydance. It’s unlikely she’d ditch Ellison after so many months spent tinkering with a combination that she favors for a combination of reasons. But Paramount is a publicly traded company <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/skydance-paramount-merger-cuts-tech-streaming-tech-partnerships-breakup-fee-1236003134/">and under the terms of the agreement anyone can step up in the next month and a half.</a></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Sun Valley sports a few other former or potential suitors. <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/sony/" id="auto-tag_sony" data-tag="sony">Sony</a> Pictures Entertainment, with Apollo, was looking at Paramount’s books but has retreated for now amid regulatory complications and Skydance’s ascendance. “There might have been other scenarios that could have played out in other ways, but this seems to be currently the scenario for the moment,” <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/paramount-skydance-sony-tom-rothman-1236004165/">SPE chief Tom Rothman told Deadline this week.</a> <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/kenichiro-yoshida/" id="auto-tag_kenichiro-yoshida" data-tag="kenichiro-yoshida">Kenichiro Yoshida</a>, CEO of SPE parent Sony Corp., which also spans music, games and electronics, will be in Sun Valley with Hiroki Totoki, the giant company’s COO and CFO.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Warner Bros. Discovery David Zaslav, who also talked with Redstone about a possible combination, would not miss Sun Valley where, in recent years, he’s speculated on deals to come as WBD gets its financial house in order post-merger. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Merger mania overall has been dampened by challenges, or threat of them, from an extremely proactive FTC and federal regulators although that could change if the next administration is Republican. Deals that have percolated through Sun Valley run from Jeff Bezos’ acquisition of The Washington Post and AT&amp;T’s Warner Media merger, to, back in the day, AOL buying Time Warner and Disney acquiring ABC.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Most pressing for Zaslav at the moment may be basketball with WBD seen likely to lose its longstanding rights deal with the <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/nba/" id="auto-tag_nba" data-tag="nba">NBA</a>. Here’s a shot to charm the league’s Commissioner <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/adam-silver/" id="auto-tag_adam-silver" data-tag="adam-silver">Adam Silver</a>, also at the confab, into giving the company a few games.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	A number of sports potentates will be making the Idaho scene, at a moment when tens of billions of dollars are changing hands in pursuit of ever-valuable rights. With the NBA is poised to announce a new set of rights deals, multiple reports in recent weeks have indicated Disney/ESPN has renewed its deal, with Amazon Prime Video and NBCU coming aboard as new rights holders. WBD’s Turner, which has carried NBA games since the 1980s, appears to be on the outside looking in, but its close relationship with the league and contractual right to match rival offers could keep it in the mix. Turner operates NBA.com and handles production for NBA TV, which could make it difficult for the league to cut ties. Talent and fans alike have also been howling about the potential end of TNT’s <em>Inside the NBA</em>, the most popular sports studio show in existence.  

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Once NBA rights are finalized, the biggest remaining property will be the UFC. Disney took over the rights from Fox in 2018, paying $1.5 billion. The price tag is expected to climb significantly, given Disney’s deal came in 2018, before major streaming players Prime Video, Apple and Netflix started buying into live sports in a big way.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Streaming will be a major topic at the conference, as it is in everyday conversations throughout the industry. Partnerships and bundles have started to gain traction, with two recent examples being Warner Bros. Discovery’s package with Disney+ and Hulu as well as a sports bundle involving Fox, ESPN and WBD’s Turner. Those ventures are significant, but industry watchers and Wall Streeters are waiting for a bigger milestone to point the way to a more profitable tomorrow.</p>

	Paramount Global has loudly telegraphed its interest in forming a streaming partnership. The company’s current leadership has described “significant” inbound interest, with reports indicating WBD’s Max and NBCUniversal’s Peacock as potential dance partners. Ellison has talked about improving the tech stack at Paramount with the aim of boosting Paramount+ but also has said joint ventures or partnerships would be considered, especially outside the U.S.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The consumer price index (CPI) is expected to show that prices rose 3.1% in June, down from 3.3% in May, indicating a slight easing of inflation.</li>
<li>The monthly inflation reading is expected to rise 0.1%, compared to no change in May, suggesting a slow retreat in inflation.</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve's target rate is 2%, and the central bank is closely watching the inflation report to determine when to cut interest rates and by how much.</li>
<li>The Fed has indicated that it needs "greater confidence" that inflation is coming down before easing policy, which is why many investors expect the Fed to begin cutting rates in September or November and are penciling in just two reductions this year.</li>
<li>Inflation has put severe financial pressures on most U.S. households, particularly low-income Americans, who are forced to pay more for everyday necessities like food and rent, and whose already-stretched paychecks are heavily impacted by price fluctuations.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The stocks of big banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Bank of America, have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index by more than 20% since January, with the big banks' stocks climbing roughly double the gains of the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The big banks are expected to report their second-quarter results on Friday (JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Citigroup) and Tuesday (Bank of America), respectively, which will test investor confidence in the banks' ability to thrive in a slowing interest rate environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investors are optimistic about the big banks' performance due to the Federal Reserve's expected interest rate cuts, regulatory changes, and a resurgence in Wall Street dealmaking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyst Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets believes that the Fed's policy path, which includes one or two rate cuts in 2024 and more in 2025, will benefit the big banks over the next year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite the optimism, the actual results from the big banks in the second quarter are not expected to be particularly impressive, with JPMorgan's headline number likely to be the focus of attention.</p>

The same goes for the other three big banks.</p><p>Even the biggest banks have been struggling with this measure as deposit costs stay elevated, loan demand remains weak, and the Fed takes longer than expected to bring interest rates back down.</p><p>"Investors are hoping to see that net interest income for the second quarter will, ideally, be the trough for big banks this year," Siefers added.</p><p>The results from the big banks are also likely to reveal the cautionary stance these lenders are taking on credit as higher rates pose more challenges for their borrowers.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="27"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>New provisions set aside to cover future loan losses at the big four banks are expected to rise 26% from last quarter. By comparison, the pace of loan loss provisions across all commercial banks began to stabilize earlier this year, rising 0.30% over the quarter, according to Federal Reserve data.</p><p>Where results should be considerably brighter are within the Wall Street operations of these big banks as dealmaking stages a comeback from poor performances in 2023 and 2022.</p><p>The big four banks, along with Wall Street specialists Goldman Sachs (<a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GS/" data-ylk="slk:GS;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="28">GS</a>) and Morgan Stanley (<a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MS/" data-ylk="slk:MS;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="29">MS</a>), are all expected to show sizable jumps — an average of more than 30% — in investment banking fees compared with a year ago.
