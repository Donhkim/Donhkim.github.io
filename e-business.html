<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Russian cybersecurity giant Kaspersky will lay off dozens of staff and leave the U.S. market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/20/us-bans-kaspersky-software-security-risk-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following a U.S. government order in June</a> banning the sale of the company’s software, citing security risks.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Kaspersky said it will “gradually wind down” its U.S. operations beginning July 20, when the ban comes into effect, adding that its U.S. business is “no longer viable.”</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Independent journalist Kim Zetter <a href="https://www.zetter-zeroday.com/kaspersky-lab-closing-u-s-division-laying-off-workers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first broke the news</a> on Monday of the company shutting down its stateside business. Zetter said the number of employees affected by the layoffs is “less than 50” in the United States. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Kaspersky spokesperson Sawyer VanHorn confirmed the company’s statement and layoffs to TechCrunch in an email Tuesday. The spokesperson was also part of the layoffs, said VanHorn.  </p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Kaspersky initially planned to challenge the ban, saying at the time the ban was announced that it “does not engage in activities which threaten U.S. national security,” and that it would “pursue all legally available options to preserve its current operations and relationships.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In June, the U.S. Commerce Department announced the “first of its kind” ban on the sale of Kaspersky’s antivirus software to U.S. consumers, citing increased security and privacy risks because the company is headquartered in Russia. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“Russia has shown it has the capacity, and even more than that, the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans,” U.S. Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo, said in a call with reporters at the time.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Once the ban comes into effect, Kaspersky will no longer be allowed to sell its software to U.S. consumers directly or through U.S.-based resellers of Kaspersky software, some of whom have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/26/how-the-kaspersky-ban-will-hit-resellers-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized the ban for affecting their businesses</a>. After September 29, Kaspersky will no longer be allowed to push software or security updates to U.S. customers. That will result in degraded protection from the antivirus software.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Commerce Department said it took a staggered approach to the ban to allow U.S. consumers to find an alternative to Kaspersky software.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The U.S. Treasury also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/21/u-s-government-sanctions-kaspersky-executives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sanctioned several senior Kaspersky executives</a>, effectively barring U.S. customers from paying Kaspersky for its software or transacting with any future company run by its executives. Chief executive Eugene Kaspersky was not sanctioned, the Treasury said. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The U.S. government has acted against Kaspersky during both the Trump and Biden administrations. In 2017, the Trump administration <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/13/kaspersky-executive-branch-ban-dhs-homeland-security/">banned the use of Kaspersky software across the federal government</a> after Russian government hackers earlier that year stole U.S. classified documents from an intelligence contractor’s home computer, which was running Kaspersky software at the time.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">By their nature, antivirus products typically have broad, if not complete, access to the devices they are installed on to identify malicious cyber threats. </p>

	
	


	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">When seen by TechCrunch on Tuesday, Kaspersky’s products were unavailable for purchase on its U.S. website. “For legal compliance purposes, Kaspersky products cannot be purchased from your country,” its website reads.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><em>Updated with Kaspersky comment.</em></p>

<li>Investors are increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates by the end of its September meeting, with markets pricing in a 100% chance of a rate cut.</li>

<li>Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday that recent data has added "somewhat" to the central bank's confidence that inflation is falling to its target, but declined to specify what this means for the Fed's cutting timeline.</li>

"Second, monthly inflation is volatile and there is always a risk of a temporary reacceleration, which could make a September cut awkward to explain. Starting in July would sidestep that risk."</p><p>Hatzius also noted that while the Fed has pledged its independence from the upcoming election, cutting in July would avoid further speculation about a political motive behind its policy decisions. As of Tuesday morning, two weeks until the Fed's next meeting starts, investors are pricing in just a 7% chance of a cut in July, per the CME FedWatch Tool.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="21"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell speaks during a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on the Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress at the Capitol on July 9, 2024, in Washington, D.C.

<p>“The potential scale of Nvidia in the most optimistic outcome is both way higher than I’ve ever seen before and could lead to a market cap of double-digit trillions,” James Anderson, former partner at investment giant Baillie Gifford, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4c9b009f-7d33-4975-b4be-a36c714bf1a8" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.ft.com/content/4c9b009f-7d33-4975-b4be-a36c714bf1a8" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">told the <em>Financial Times</em></a>. “This isn’t a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia’s lead is intact.” </p>



<p>The chipmaker behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT has soared thanks to <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/fortune-500-analytics-microsoft-nvidia-ai-banks-interest-rates-profitability-market-capitalization/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/fortune-500-analytics-microsoft-nvidia-ai-banks-interest-rates-profitability-market-capitalization/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">the AI boom</a>, which has minted <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/08/ai-stock-boom-us-millionaires-600000-nvidia-meta-microsoft-sp500/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/08/ai-stock-boom-us-millionaires-600000-nvidia-meta-microsoft-sp500/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">half-a-million new millionaires</a> who invested in the tech that has begun to revolutionize the workplace and media consumption. Nvidia, along with tech giants Amazon, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">Google</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/apple/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/apple/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">Apple</a>, are worth $14.5 trillion and make up <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/07/nvidia-win-race-4-trillion-market-cap-big-tech-outlook-google-microsoft-amazon-apple/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/07/07/nvidia-win-race-4-trillion-market-cap-big-tech-outlook-google-microsoft-amazon-apple/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">about 32% of the S&amp;P 500</a>. With the AI darling’s data center revenue growing at about 60%, Anderson calculated, should the pattern continue over the next decade, the company would have a market capitalization of about $49 trillion. That’s more than the entire value of every company in the S&amp;P 500, <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_market_cap" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_market_cap" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">which is roughly $45.84 trillion</a>. Anderson estimated a 10% to 15% probability of this outcome.</p>



<p>Anderson’s projection is a lofty one, but his hunches have proved correct before. With a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-08-18/tesla-amazon-visionary-leaves-uk-fund-firm-baillie-gifford-down-100-billion" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-08-18/tesla-amazon-visionary-leaves-uk-fund-firm-baillie-gifford-down-100-billion" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">go-big-or-go-home mentality</a>, he was one of Amazon’s and Tesla’s biggest champions (for the EV giant, Anderson’s investments were second only to CEO Elon Musk’s). From 2005 to 2021, Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, managed by Baillie Gifford, saw returns of 2,240%. It invested in Nvidia in 2016. Lingotto Investment Management, where Anderson is now an investor, has <a href="https://qz.com/nvidia-market-cap-james-anderson-amazon-tesla-1851592353" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://qz.com/nvidia-market-cap-james-anderson-amazon-tesla-1851592353" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">a $650 million fund</a> with Nvidia as its largest position.</p>



<p>Nvidia didn’t have a clear path to success when Anderson first began investing in the company, he said. It remained to be seen if it would be a gaming, crypto, or AI company. But it did have the advantage of early success, unlike Amazon and Tesla, which “didn’t start from highly profitable and dominant positions but had to get there.” In some ways, Anderson still sees Nvidia as a nimble company.</p><p></p>



<p>“It is the long duration of the development of [graphic processing units] usage in AI—and not just AI—from excitement, through potential pauses, to transformation of industries that is most important to us,” Anderson said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Not so fast</strong></h2>



<p>Other finance experts don’t share Anderson’s bullish take on Nvidia. Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, argues Nvidia is riding a wave of early AI optimism.</p>



<p>“The momentum is clearly with Nvidia,” Damodaran <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG-tfDsVfao" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG-tfDsVfao" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">told CNBC</a> in May. “They can do nothing wrong. Everything they touch turns to gold.”</p>



<p>Damodaran said Tesla experienced a <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/03/03/nvidia-stock-surge-echoes-tesla-rally-2020-investors-ponder-ai-evs-comparison/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/03/03/nvidia-stock-surge-echoes-tesla-rally-2020-investors-ponder-ai-evs-comparison/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">similar rally in 2020</a>, when its market cap soared, peaking in 2021 at $1.2 trillion, only for shares to plummet about 30% this year alone. Meta and Google also grappled with increased competition that have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4ff64604-a421-422c-9239-0ca8e5133042" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.ft.com/content/4ff64604-a421-422c-9239-0ca8e5133042" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">loosened their grip</a> on the tech world. While Nvidia has the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-earnings-stock-split-jensen-huang-blackwell-ai/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-earnings-stock-split-jensen-huang-blackwell-ai/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">earnings</a> to back up its sky-high value, the expectations for the future of the company may be too steep, he argued. Damodaran said the AI chip market is not worth $1 trillion alone, and the AI market more broadly is worth about $2 trillion or $3 trillion, meaning Nvidia would have to tap into several big AI markets to maintain and grow its value.</p>



<p>“It’s clearly a possibility,” Damodaran said. “But is it plausible? I don’t think so.”</p><p></p>



<p>It’s too early to say if Nvidia has the juice to lead Big Tech into the AI frontier in the long term, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Doug Clinton said. Nvidia’s colossal growth may appear scary, but it’s sustainable, particularly as the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/tech-companies-ai-nuclear-power-plants/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/07/01/tech-companies-ai-nuclear-power-plants/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">demand for AI</a> is expected to increase.</p>



<p>“Despite all of us worrying that eventually this demand for chips will slow down, we haven’t really seen that slowdown happen yet,” Clinton <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQXjNPAZ9aE" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQXjNPAZ9aE" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">told Yahoo Finance</a> last month. “And it may take longer to slow down than we think.”</p>



<p>With Nvidia making up over <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2024/03/08/what-you-need-to-know-about-nvidia-and-the-ai-chip-arms-race/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.marketplace.org/2024/03/08/what-you-need-to-know-about-nvidia-and-the-ai-chip-arms-race/" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">80% of the global GPU semiconductor market</a>, the company will likely continue to ride high in the foreseeable future, Clinton said.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“Can Nvidia maintain its dominant position providing the brains to these artificial intelligence models?” he said. “I think they can for the next three to five years.”</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><strong>Recommended Newsletter: </strong><p>CEO Daily provides key context for the news leaders need to know from across the world of business.

<li>North Shore University Hospital and NYU Langone-Long Island have been ranked as two of the top hospitals in the country for the second consecutive year according to U.S. News &amp; World Report.</li>
<li>Several Long Island institutions were highlighted in the annual hospital rankings, with Northwell Health's North Shore University Hospital tying for first place in the New York state rankings.</li>
<li>The rankings are based on inpatient and outpatient clinical outcomes, facility staffing and technology, and patient and physician surveys. While the designation can be helpful for patients, experts say the research may not be as relevant for average patients who are considering factors like doctor recommendations, insurance coverage, and travel.</li>
<li>NYU Langone Hospital, which had data for its Mineola, Manhattan, and Brooklyn hospitals collectively assessed, also made the national honor roll and tied for first place in New York State rankings.</li>
<li>The New York list saw little change from last year, with most of the institutions remaining the same, except for Stony Brook University Hospital which moved up one spot and Peconic Bay Medical Center which joined the list for the first time.</li>

The outlet named the Manhasset and Mineola hospitals on its "honor roll" of 20 top institutions nationwide. Long Island hospitals made up more than 30% of the roughly 30 best facilities in New York State, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report.</p><p>Hospitals — and their marketing teams — are quick to highlight the data behind these designations. U.S. News &amp; World Report compiles its lists by assessing inpatient and outpatient clinical outcomes, factoring in facility staffing and technology, and incorporating patient and physician surveys. Although the designation can be helpful for patients, experts say the research isn't as relevant for the average patient, who is considering their doctor's recommendations, insurance coverage and ability to travel. </p><p>"It's an objective, mostly objective, view of hospitals," said Dr.  Peter Silver, senior vice president and chief quality officer at Northwell Health. "I'm not that surprised by these rankings … but I want our patients and our communities to have that confidence in us also. These surveys are important for that."</p><p>Northwell's North Shore University Hospital tied for first place in the New York rankings, along with three other organizations. Five other Northwell facilities made the state list: Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Peconic Bay Medical Center and the Huntington, Plainview and South Shore University hospitals.</p><p>NYU Langone Hospital — which had data for its Mineola, Manhattan and Brooklyn hospitals collectively assessed — also made the national honor roll and tied for first place in New York State.</p><p>Most of the institutions highlighted on the New York list were the same as last year.

The outlet named the Manhasset and Mineola hospitals on its "honor roll" of 20 top institutions nationwide.

            Persistently high prices for services — which include haircuts, hotels and restaurants — as well as escalating trade tensions are propping up inflation and raising the prospect that interest rates will stay high for a while yet, the IMF cautioned Tuesday in its latest World Economic Outlook.

            The Bank of England emphasized that “monetary policy needs to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipates.”

            In its report Tuesday, the IMF said it still expected major central banks to reduce<em> </em>borrowing costs in the second half of the year. It anticipates one cut by the Fed before the end of the year, chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told journalists.
    </p>

            The IMF thinks<em> </em>global inflation will slow to 5.9% this year, from 6.7% last year, in line with its<em> </em>forecast in April.
    </p>

            The agency blamed sticky services price inflation — partly driven by higher wages — for “holding up progress” on reducing overall inflation.
    </p>

            “Energy and food price inflation are now almost back to pre-pandemic levels in many countries, while overall inflation is not,” Gourinchas said. “Rising services prices and wages may keep overall inflation higher than desired,” posing a “significant risk” to economic growth, he added.

            The IMF also noted that rising<em> </em>trade tensions “could further raise near-term risks to inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods.”
    </p>

            The US and the European Union have in recent months hiked tariffs on electric cars made in China, driven by concerns that local jobs and strategic industries could be wiped out by cheap Chinese imports. The US has also increased tariffs on a raft of other products from the world’s no. 2 economy, including steel, batteries, semiconductors and critical minerals.

            Gourinchas said the “surge in unilateral measures,” including tariffs, was a “key concern” for the IMF.

            “If anything, it will distort trade and resource allocation, spur retaliation, weaken growth, diminish living standards and make it harder to coordinate policies that address global challenges, such as the climate transition,” he added.

            The IMF sees the global economy expanding 3.2% this year, as it forecast in April. But the agency downgraded its forecast for US growth to 2.6% — 0.1 percentage point lower than projected in April.

            The IMF also made upward revisions to its 2024 growth forecasts for India and China, which it now expects to expand by 7% and 5% respectively — up from forecasts of 6.8% and 4.6% in April. The projected growth in the two countries would account for half of global expansion.

            “Asia’s emerging market economies remain the main engine for the global economy,” Gourinchas said.

<li>The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk is committed to donating $45 million a month to a pro-Trump Super PAC, further cementing his support for a second Trump term. (However, Musk later denied this report on Twitter.)</li>
<li>Government policies associated with Trump's potential return to the White House could have significant ramifications for Tesla, including the potential to roll back EV tax credits and favor traditional fossil fuel industries.</li>
<li>Musk's endorsement of Trump is not isolated; other billionaires are also outwardly supporting Trump, although Musk's commitment to a second Trump term is notable given the potential impact on Tesla's business.</li>

All south shore beaches were closed to swimming by the town just after 11 a.m. as a result of the debris.</p><p>"The water is closed to swimming on all south shore beaches, due to large floating debris and sharp fiberglass shards," Nantucket Harbormaster Sheila Lucey said. "You can walk on the beaches, however we strongly recommend you wear footwear due to sharp, fiberglass shards and debris on the beaches."</p><p>Vineyard Wind disclosed Monday that one of its turbine blades suffered damage Saturday during an "offshore incident." The exact nature of the incident is not yet known, but there were no injuries to any Vineyard Wind personnel or other mariners.</p><p>Vineyard Wind stated Tuesday that it is "mobilizing debris recovery teams on Nantucket to survey the southern-facing beaches of the island for the recovery of debris following the blade damage incident that took place on Saturday, July 13, 2024. In addition, Vineyard Wind remains focused on ensuring the safety of personnel and mariners in the offshore area, and continues to work with the U.S. Coast Guard to maintain a safety zone of 500 meters around the impacted turbine offshore."<br></p></div><div class="w-full"><figure>
