<ol>
<li>Ed Dwight, who was initially passed over to become the first Black astronaut in 1963, finally reached space on Sunday when he flew on a Blue Origin rocket.</li>
<li>The launch was the first crewed spaceflight by Blue Origin since 2022, when its New Shepard rocket was grounded due to a mid-flight failure.</li>
<li>Dwight's flight on the NS-25 mission marked the first time he had traveled to space, achieving a goal he had set for himself 61 years ago.</li>
<li>The mission was a significant milestone for Dwight, who had faced numerous obstacles throughout his career, including being passed over for the astronaut program in 1963 due to racial bias.</li>
<li>The launch from west Texas marked a new chapter in space exploration, with Blue Origin's founder Jeff Bezos present to witness the historic moment.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nvidia (NVDA) is expected to report strong Q1 earnings and revenue, with triple-digit increases, and will likely provide guidance that will impact its stock and two other assets tied to the AI investing boom.</li>
<li>According to Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick, if Nvidia beats estimates, raises guidance, and beats the raised guidance in the next quarter, the AI trade will continue to proceed apace. However, if there is any sign of weakness, the stock will suffer.</li>
<li>Nvidia's stock has surged 90% in 2024 due to investor interest in the company's AI prospects, and its performance will likely impact other stocks, including those in the utilities sector.</li>
<li>The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) has increased in value, and Bank of America reported that utility funds saw $700M in inflows over the past week, the largest inflow since November 2022, driven in part by the demand for electricity from corporate adoption of generative AI.</li>
<li>The demand for electricity from AI adoption is driving demand for copper, which is used in industrial applications, including electrical systems, and is expected to drive up copper prices and ultimately affect the performance of utility stocks.</li>

    <div><div> <p>What Nvidia (<span class="ticker-hover-wrapper">NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA" title="NVIDIA Corporation">NVDA</a></span>) says about its Q1 performance and potential guidance will hold sway over not only its stock but at least two other assets tied to the AI investing boom, according to Interactive Brokers (IBKR). </p> <p>The contract chip maker<span class="paywall-full-content invisible"> behind powering ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence applications is expected on Wednesday to report triple-digit increases in </span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/earnings/estimates" class="paywall-full-content invisible">Q1 earnings and revenue</a><span class="paywall-full-content invisible">. </span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">“If [NVDA] can continue their enviable, remarkable string of beating estimates, raising guidance, then beating the raised guidance next quarter, that means that the AI trade can and will proceed apace,” IBKR Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick said in a note this week. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">“If there is even the slightest sign of weakness, however, much more than that stock alone will suffer,” he said. Nvidia’s (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA" title="NVIDIA Corporation">NVDA</a>) stock has surged ~90% in 2024 as investors latch onto the company’s AI prospects. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Meanwhile, there’s been a “parabolic rise” in copper prices to record highs recently and a sharp gain in the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLU" title="Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF">XLU</a>). “It is not difficult to imagine that some of the recent (copper) demand is related to the current AI-mania. The ‘tell’ comes from the recent action in utilities stocks,” he said. The ETF serves as a benchmark for the Utilities sector on the S&amp;P 500 (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500" title="S&amp;P 500 Index">SP500</a>)(<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV" title="iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF">IVV</a>)(<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO" title="Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF">VOO</a>). Bank of America this week said utility funds notched $700M in inflows over the past week, the largest inflow since November 2022. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Sosnick said investors are seeing numerous reports projecting robust demand for electricity from the widespread corporate adoption of generative AI. That loops in copper, with its multitude of industrial uses, including in electrical systems. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">“The utilities would of course be the ones to supply it – hence the excitement about those stocks. And if utilities need to build new capacity, that will require copper wiring — hence the demand for the commodity,” Sosnick said. Copper futures (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HG1:COM" title="Copper Futures">HG1:COM</a>) have jumped ~18% over the past month and were up ~30% YTD. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">The S&amp;P 500 (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500" title="S&amp;P 500 Index">SP500</a>) Utilities sector is up ~14% this year. It has shifted from being the worst S&amp;P 500 (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY" title="SPDR S&amp;P 500 Trust ETF">SPY</a>) sector performer to being the third-best. </p> <p class="before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder"></p>
<p class="paywall-full-content invisible">But for Sosnick, the “rapidity” of the price moves does not make sense. “Power plants take years to get approved and built. The change may occur, but it won’t be overnight.” </p> </div> </div>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>OpenAI employees can lose vested equity if they don't comply</strong>: The company has a policy that requires employees to sign a non-disparagement agreement upon leaving the company. If an employee doesn't sign the agreement, they can lose vested equity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No one has ever been penalized for non-compliance</strong>: however, despite the policy, OpenAI has never enforced the rule and therefore, no former employee has lost vested equity for not signing the agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CEO Sam Altman admits to being embarrassed</strong>: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has acknowledged that he was not aware of the policy and should have been more involved in monitoring it. He has expressed embarrassment and has vowed to eliminate the clause from future exit paperwork.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reasons for resignations of Sutskever and Leike</strong>: Ilya Sutskever, a board member and co-founder, left the company amid rumors of a power struggle between him and Altman. Jan Leike, another co-founder, resigned due to concerns over OpenAI's "safety culture" and prioritization of product development over safety processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OpenAI's employee compensation package</strong>: The company offers a unique compensation package that includes a flat base salary of $300,000, a yearly grant of around $500,000 in PPUs (profit participation units), and other incentives.</p>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- The meme-stock revival was over almost as quickly as it began.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. — the poster children of 2021’s frenzy — saw shares surge at the start of the week only to fizzle, with the bulk of those gains erased just days later. Other speculative corners of the market, mainly beaten-down stocks that have drawn the scrutiny of short-selling hedge funds, saw their booms mostly go bust while the broader US stock market powered to record highs.</p><p>Read MLIV Pulse: Meme-Stocks Pop Signals Too Much Froth in Stocks</p><p>An X post from Keith Gill — one of the masterminds behind the Covid-era spike in GameStop, better known as “Roaring Kitty”— set social media platforms abuzz into Monday morning as traders, both amateur and professional, pounced on old day-trading standbys and other stocks that seemed susceptible to a short squeeze. However, unlike the 2021 delirium that lasted weeks and resulted in congressional hearings and lawsuits, the revival of meme stocks was a flash in the pan.</p><p>With the rally quickly losing its shine, AMC shares have slipped more than 60% from an $11.88 intraday year-to-date high while GameStop gave back almost all of its gains. The differences between the two frenzies — if you can call the latest iteration that — were quickly apparent. In 2021, GameStop soared more than 1,000% in a matter of days, making this week’s peak look tame as the pair only held onto mere double-digit gains for the week.</p><p>Still, a more than 100% rally over four weeks is nothing to completely shrug off for the video-game retailer. The stock has put together four consecutive weeks of gains, adding some $3.6 billion over that stretch, though it’s still more than 80% below a 2021 high.</p><p>Both companies moved to capitalize on the rallies to shore up their cash reserves this week. GameStop arranged to sell up to 45 million shares in a so-called at-the-market program, enabling its bank to create shares for sale, with the proceeds being added to its balance sheet.</p><p>For AMC, the beleaguered movie chain was able to raise more than $250 million through share sales and a debt-for-equity swap though it still faces more than $4 billion in debt, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. This week’s gains look like a blip given it’s still down some 90% over the past 12 months.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>An aspect of 2024’s meme stock moment is how fleeting it was and the lack of follow-through from retail traders. Yes, GameStop saw more than 10-times its recent average number of shares traded at the start of the week while AMC had more than 1.7 billion shares change hands over the five-day span, but the notional value is nothing compared to 2021.</p><p>Even with the jump in volume, activity for retail traders on things like Fidelity’s platform was a fraction of levels seen three years ago with retail traders placing sell orders roughly matching those that were placed to buy.</p><p>Options markets also whipsawed traders, with short-term GameStop and AMC prices implying well over 500% annualized volatility at one point, before dropping to about half that by week’s end. Even as shares retreated below $40, some traders were buying GameStop calls that would only pay out if the stock rocketed back up above $128 by Friday.</p><p>The sky-high costs attracted the attention of noted bond trader Bill Gross, who said he sold so-called straddles on both companies, betting the wild swings would become more muted.</p><p>The rally in AMC and GameStop ate away at profits for short sellers, traders who gain on a stock’s decline, meaning billions in paper losses for the group as the stocks surged. Of course, those losses were partially reversed when the shares fell back to earth.</p><p>The exuberance for the top meme stocks lifted shares of other companies that are also popular with the retail crowd and often trade more on sentiment than fundamentals. This group — which includes Tupperware Brands Corp., Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. and Lucid Group Inc. — has high short interest as a percentage of float, meaning that contrarian traders have borrowed most available shares to bet against them.</p><p>With the markets placid once again, some of the companies that got lifted in the meme-stock resurgence remain beaten down over the past year.</p><p>Take Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc.; shares have surged about 2,000% this week, but are still down some 98% over the last 12 months.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

Weirdly, that’s seemed to have little impact on their willingness to open their wallets. </p>
<p id="RSZHuQ">Retail sales surged during the pandemic as home-bound workers clicked “complete purchase” on everything from <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21345534/peloton-bike-review-2020">Pelotons</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2020/5/19/21221008/how-to-bake-bread-pandemic-yeast-flour-baking-ken-forkish-claire-saffitz">sourdough starter.</a> In 2020, <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/04/ecommerce-sales-surged-during-pandemic.html">e-commerce sales rose by 43 percent</a>. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/23998805/pandemic-excess-savings-us-economy-recession">Stimulus checks</a> gave Americans newfound savings and excess money to burn.

<p id="LD7sBJ">That was all supposed to come crashing down at some point. For more than a year, economists warned about the “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-retail-sales-unexpectedly-rebound-november-weekly-jobless-claims-fall-2023-12-14/#:~:text=%22The%20death%20of%20the%20consumer,Alliance%20in%20Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina.">death of the consumer</a>” and a resulting recession — neither of which have materialized. Consumers were expected to retreat as inflation skyrocketed, hitting a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/12/heres-the-inflation-breakdown-for-december-2022-in-one-chart.html">9.1 percent peak in June 2022</a> and remaining stubbornly above the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2 percent. </p>

<p id="91lhcr">There is a sign that Americans’ shopping spree might be finally coming to an end: Retail spending <a href="https://apnews.com/article/retail-sales-april-economy-inflation-422c54d68a519b9beb05bfe9813b0ab5">stayed the same</a> in April as compared to the previous month, falling short of analyst projections for growth. </p>
<p id="nUeXQ4">However, those numbers don’t capture spending on services — for example, <a href="https://www.vox.com/health-care" data-source="encore">health care</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/transportation" data-source="encore">transportation</a>, and insurance — which has increased markedly this year. And both <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/people/preston-caldwell">Preston Caldwell</a>, a senior US economist at Morningstar, and <a href="https://credittrends.moodys.com/economists/74/Scott-Hoyt">Scott Hoyt</a>, a Moody’s Analytics economist, said those numbers could easily bounce back next month, even if they’re expecting spending to cool by the end of the year.</p>
<p id="AKzKMf">“I am anticipating that we do see eventually a consumer slowdown over the course of this year,” Caldwell said. “It’s premature to say that that’s already playing out right now.”</p>
<p id="AvG5vx">Indeed, spending is bound to come down at some point under the pressure of high interest rates, which the Fed <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/5/1/24145696/interest-rates-inflation-federal-reserve-fed-powell-stock">isn’t expected to cut until later this year</a> — or <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-05-16/rokos-hedge-fund-executive-rules-out-any-fed-rate-cuts-in-2024-lw967x6o">potentially at all in 2024</a>. So why, despite all the doom and gloom among consumers, has spending been so resilient?</p>
<h3 id="sDXETr">Who is driving high spending?</h3>
<p id="pzYbgP">Two things are simultaneously true: People feel really negatively about the economy, and that’s not stopping them from spending. In May, the University of Michigan recorded its lowest consumer sentiment reading in six months — an index of 67.4 out of 100 — as part of its <a href="http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/">long-running survey</a>. </p>
<p id="RIuNvc">That’s up from this time last year, but still well below <a href="https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/charts.php#">pre-pandemic consumer sentiment readings</a>, which hovered in the upper 80s and 90s. The trend in sentiment was widespread across demographic lines: Consumers “expressed worries that inflation, unemployment and interest rates may all be moving in an unfavorable direction in the year ahead,” the University of Michigan report reads.</p>
<p id="EDACxa">It’s hard to reconcile that with high spending figures. But in short, the rich currently feel rich and account for a large share of overall spending. The middle class feels a little better off too, and likely still has some savings built up they can burn through. They might not yet have felt the pressure of high interest rates and inflation to the same degree as people who rent and have fewer investments. (But that’s due to change.) </p>
<p id="y8N9bn">High-income consumers — households in the top 20 percent of income <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cex/tables/calendar-year/mean-item-share-average-standard-error/cu-income-quintiles-before-taxes-2022.pdf">earning at least $244,025</a> before taxes as of 2022 — have been largely cushioned from economic headwinds and are flush with cash to spend. </p>
<p id="xF9rxF">The pandemic saw Americans’ average percentage of income saved increase to <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/personal-savings#:~:text=Personal%20Savings%20in%20the%20United,U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis">an all-time high of 32 percent</a> in April 2020 after many households received stimulus checks. That has helped fuel spending, but unlike in <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/10/spending-down-pandemic-savings-is-an-only-in-the-u-s-phenomenon/">other high-income countries</a> where consumers have proved more thrifty, Americans are close to depleting those savings.</p>
<p id="TGF2aG">“The excess savings [are] still kind of sloshing their way through the system. Depending on how you estimate excess savings, they will be depleted sometime in the middle of 2024 or maybe by as late as mid-2025,” Caldwell said.</p>
<p id="0fJZVR">Many high-income consumers also locked in low interest rates on their mortgages before the Federal Reserve started raising rates in March 2022, and they’re seeing their home values continue to go up nonetheless. The average US home price <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/housing-market-price-trends-zip-code-map/">increased</a> from $287,000 in 2019 to $450,000 in 2024. This is in part due to persistent low inventory: High interest rates have kept would-be sellers on the sidelines because their mortgage payments would be higher if they bought a new place.</p>
<p id="4yQEHc">High-income consumers have also seen their investment portfolios balloon in the last year. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/stock-market" data-source="encore">stock market</a> repeatedly tested new highs in recent months, with the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/05/15/sp-500-hits-record-high-on-strong-cpi-inflation-reading/?sh=74c9c6c77a24">latest record set on Thursday</a> in the wake of new data showing that inflation is slowing. And wealthy older Americans who allocate more of their portfolios to government bonds are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-economy-wealth-rates-federal-reserve-cuts-9290216e89cbd7a3a0d2be66041aeaf8">benefiting from higher interest rates</a>. </p>
<p id="B14Ulg">“That sort of gives consumers an incentive to spend out of their newfound wealth,” Hoyt said. “And since this set of consumers still has excess savings left over from the pandemic, that gives them the easy, relatively liquid monies to do so.”</p>
<p id="Zvxolh">The question is how long the stock market can sustain this run. Some analysts think stocks are currently overpriced and due for a correction — which might cause some people to finally close their wallets. </p>
<p id="uT5SV4">“Equity prices are starting to move more into arguably overvalued territory,” Caldwell said. “So that’s probably not going to be a tailwind [for spending] over the next year.”</p>
<p id="smtQQV">At the same time, the factors currently fueling spending at the highest income levels aren’t universal. Not all consumers can afford to spend more.</p>
<p id="pniz1l">Even though inflation has come down significantly from its 2022 peak, low-income Americans are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-low-income-squeeze-profits-93d0614a3a0d0a93cf9e15e0985a7271">struggling with higher prices</a>. Consumers in general say they are budgeting <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-state-of-the-us-consumer">more on everyday essentials</a> like fresh produce and baby supplies. </p>
<p id="eVjjbo">Among people living paycheck to paycheck, pandemic savings (if they ever really had any) might be long gone.</p>
<p id="9zvVot">Low and moderate-income consumers are also increasingly weighed down by credit card debt and struggling to pay it down due to high interest rates, which research suggests could be a <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32163">major contributor </a>to overall economic pessimism.</p>
<p id="iZAOfz">Though credit card debt levels dipped during the pandemic, they are now returning to pre-pandemic levels, with the average balance per consumer increasing by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/16/credit-card-balances-jump-8point5percent-year-over-year-delinquencies-rise.html">8.5 percent in the last year to $6,218</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/business/economy/interest-rates-inequality.html#:~:text=They%20are%20likelier%20to%20carry,those%20earning%20more%20than%20%24100%2C000.">More than half</a> of people earning less than $25,000 carry a balance on their credit cards.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>April's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed that inflation is not heating back up, providing welcome reassurance.</li>
<li>However, services inflation, which includes housing costs and medical care, rose 3.15% over the prior year, marking a slowdown from March's rate but higher than readings in December, January, and February.</li>
<li>Housing costs, which account for two-thirds of the increase in core inflation, rose 5.5% over the prior year in April.</li>
<li>Bank of America economist Michael Gapen believes that services and shelter will cool as the year goes on, with shelter taking a step lower in August and moderating growth in economic activity weighing on remaining services inflation.</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve will likely be cautious in managing inflation, given its past miscalculations, and will not want to declare victory too early, according to the article.</li>

    <div><div class="relative text-base article-alias_articleBodyStyles__zkPMo article-alias_articleWrapper__atgO6" id="articleBody"><p><meta charset="utf-8"></p><p dir="ltr">(Kitco News) – The gold market had plenty of significant economic data and in-depth Fed speak to digest this week, and the result was one of the most dramatic moves for precious metals markets this year. </p><p dir="ltr">Spot gold kicked off the week trading at $2,361.17 and spent Sunday and Monday treading water while eagerly awaiting the key inflation data to come. Tuesday morning brought a mixed PPI report, but markets took comfort in comments from Fed chair Jerome Powell two hours later when he told the Foreign Bankers’ Association that he was confident the central bank would not need to hike again. Gold prices turned positive on the week early Wednesday morning, and when the April CPI report showed month-over-month improvement, that was all traders needed to begin pushing the yellow metal higher still. </p><p dir="ltr">Wednesday evening’s triple top at the $2,400 level stalled momentum in the near term, with spot gold trending steadily downwards through Thursday's session. But by the North American market open on Friday, the bulls had returned in force, and once they propelled gold decisively through $2,400 per ounce around 10:00 am EDT, they never looked back. </p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">The latest Kitco News Weekly Gold Survey has the overwhelming majority of industry experts believing gold prices could reach or surpass their all-time highs, while retail traders are a little more restrained on the precious metal’s prospects.</p><p dir="ltr">“I am bullish on Gold for the coming week,” said Colin Cieszynski, Chief Market Strategist at SIA Wealth Management. “The US Dollar appears to be backing off a bit along with treasury yields. Also, if it does break out over $2400 resistance, technically that could open the door to a potential run at the $2,500 big round number.”</p><p dir="ltr">James Stanley, senior market strategist at Forex.com, also believes gold has further to fly in the near term.</p><p dir="ltr">“Bulls put on a show this week and the move was pretty clean for the most part,” he said. “That continued the breakout from the falling wedge/bull flag in the prior week, and this week was all higher-highs and lows with a really strong move on Friday morning.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Chasing fresh highs is always a challenge but the 2400 level has quite a bit of reference given the tests last month, and so far on Friday there’s been indications of acceptance above that price,” Stanley added. “This keeps the door open for a possible run up to $2500.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Unchanged,” said Adrian Day, President of Adrian Day Asset Management, who expects gold will have trouble holding Friday’s lofty highs. “We shall likely see another attempt to cross $2,400 and then a small retreat. But gold’s resilience has been impressive, and sooner rather than later it will breach that level.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Dip buyers showed up in a big way over the past week, and the buzz around gold is building,” said Adam Button, head of currency strategy at Forexlive.com. “There are signs the US economy is slowing; more of that would bring rate cuts forward.”</p><p dir="ltr">Button said that this recent move is a continuation of the broader rally, and it’s being driven by the same source.</p><p dir="ltr">“This rally started in China, and China continues to show up,” he said, adding that recent data show Turkey and much of the Middle East are also buying bullion.</p><p dir="ltr">Button pointed out that this week’s meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping is also very bullish for gold prices.</p><p dir="ltr">“If you're a gold bull, the picture of Xi and Putin hugging is as good as it gets,” he said. “They're trying to create a multipolar world, and you can't do that if you're relying on the dollar.”</p><p dir="ltr">This week, 14 Wall Street analysts participated in the Kitco News Gold Survey, and after Friday’s breakout, the bullish sentiment was as strong as it’s been this year. Eleven experts, representing 79%, expected to see gold prices climb higher still next week, with only two analysts, or 14%, predicting a price decline. One lone expert, representing 7% of the total, saw gold trending sideways during the coming week.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, 144 votes were cast in Kitco’s online poll, with Main Street investors positive but not to the same degree. 83 retail traders, or 58%, looked for gold to rise next week. Another 30, or 21%, predicted it would be lower, while 31 respondents, representing 21%, expect the precious metal to remain rangebound during the week ahead.</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">After this week’s inflation data drama, markets will get a bit of a break next week. Wednesday will see the release of U.S. existing home sales for April, along with the FOMC minutes from the April/May monetary policy meeting. On Thursday, markets will receive the S&amp;P Flash Manufacturing and Service Sector PMIs, weekly jobless claims, and April new home sales, and Friday will feature the April durable goods report.</p><p dir="ltr">Marc Chandler, Managing Director at Bannockburn Global Forex, sees evidence that gold prices are a little too high after this week’s breakout.</p><p dir="ltr">“Gold reclaimed the $2400 level ahead of the weekend and is poised to post a record high close (spot market),” he said. “The momentum indicators give the yellow metal scope to challenge the intraday high from April 12 near $2431.50. A note of caution is from the Bollinger Band, set two standard deviations above the 20-day moving average. Gold is trading above it. Also, I suspect that the US rate adjustment (lower with the 2yr yield bottoming near 4.70%) and softer dollar (euro is up for five consecutive weeks) is over or nearly so.”</p><p dir="ltr">Darin Newsom, Senior Market Analyst at Barchart.com, thinks gold may give back some of its recent gains.                                            </p><p dir="ltr">“Purely a technical read as June looks to be nearing a potential top of its 5-wave short-term uptrend,” he said. “Daily stochastics indicate the contract is sharply overbought. As of early Friday morning, I have a reversal pattern telling me the trend is set to change, but there is a lot of week left today. We’ll see what happens through Friday’s close or possibly early Monday morning.”</p><p dir="ltr">Sean Lusk, co-director of commercial hedging at Walsh Trading, was watching the entire commodity complex catch fire on Friday, with precious metals leading the way.</p><p dir="ltr">“We're at $2,410, we're back up to high,” he said. “Silver's caught fire here, copper's caught fire as an industrial metal, platinum. It's really been a hell of a ride.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You can make an argument that crude's underperformed, still up a little over 10 on the year, nothing crazy,” he added. “But if that gets going that's going to bring everything else up. We’ll probably get a real hot summer here.”</p><p dir="ltr">Lusk told Kitco News that the combination of high inflation, massive debt issuance, and runaway central bank currency printing is pushing market participants into precious metals and other commodities.</p><p dir="ltr">“We've just printed too much money, and now you see the result of it,” he said. “Where are they putting all the money? Aside from, buying dips in equities, big money is going into metals as an inflation hedge. And not just us, but even economies around the world are doing the same thing. They're increasing their holdings, and nobody knows where to be.”</p><p dir="ltr">Lusk said that he can’t imagine a better situation than the current one to drive gold prices higher.</p><p dir="ltr">“It's a perfect storm of bullishness,” he said. “You have geopolitical worries. You had the pandemic. And what does our government do right after that? Prints more for all these funding projects that really haven't started yet. Now you're in a campaign year, so all those things, as they relate to gold, just create more uncertainties on the back end, and that's why you continue to run here.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It just goes back to the old adage, any time we create more of something, it's worth less,” Lusk said.</p><p dir="ltr">“Gold is headed higher, likely to take out $2,448.8 in the days ahead,” said Michael Moor, Founder of Moor Analytics. “We held exhaustion at $2,288.5 with a $2,285.2 low and rallied $138.5. The break back above $2,302 (+1.6 per/hour) has brought in $121.7 of strength.  We took out final exhaustion at $2,385.3.”</p><p dir="ltr">And Kitco Senior Analyst Jim Wyckoff sees further gains for gold prices next week. “Higher, as charts firmly bullish,” he said.</p><p dir="ltr">Spot gold last traded at $2,414.99 per ounce at the time of writing, up 1.60% on the day and 2.31% on the week.</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p> </p></div></div>

            The Rubyglow pineapple –— bred for its distinctive red exterior and its sweetness — costs $395.99 at Melissa’s Produce, a California-based seller of specialty fruit and veggies. It took Del Monte, a wholesaler which sells a variety of produce but specializes in pineapple, a decade and a half to develop the red-hued fruit. A limited crop was first available in China early this year. Recently, Del Monte decided to see how the item would fare in the United States, and Melissa’s starting selling it at the astronomical price.

            Americans have become interested in particular for new fruit varieties in recent years, paying a premium for Honeycrisp apples, Cotton Candy grapes, Sumo Citrus and vertically-grown Japanese strawberries. Now, they are hungry for different types of fruit, and are ready to shell out for exciting new options.
    </p>

            But a $400 pineapple? That’s a bit rich.
    </p>

            When the Honeycrisp was introduced over 30 years ago, there weren’t many apple options in the supermarket.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw988bjr000d3b6jaoghb14c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Red Delicious, Golden Delicious and, in some areas, McIntosh apples were standard fare, recalled Jim Luby, a professor in the horticultural science department at the University of Minnesota. But that was about it. “If you didn’t go out to a local orchard, you didn’t have that many choices.”
    </p>



    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw988bjr000e3b6j20b78fp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            People were hungry for more, and Honeycrisp fit the bill — sweet, crisp and novel.
    </p>

            “It became popular in Minnesota amongst our growers,” said Luby, who was part of the team that developed the variety.<strong> </strong>“There wasn’t that much production. So it was priced high. And yet it kept selling.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw988bjr000g3b6j4wtrxw59@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Marketing new produce is a costly affair. Researchers have to breed and cross-breed, wait out the growing cycle, and start over if the fruit disappoints. Finding something that is both delicious and resilient enough to be commercially successful takes time, and a lot of painstaking work. Then plant scientists have to convince growers to make an investment in an unproven fruit, devoting resources that could be used for old favorites.
    </p>

            But the Honeycrisp helped show that the risk can be justified.

            Since the apple’s success, variety in the produce section has increased. Over roughly the past decade, per capita availability — a good proxy for consumption — of higher-priced fruit, like berries, mango and avocados, has increased, according to Rabobank, which drew from USDA data. In that time, availability of cheaper fruit like apples and bananas has essentially stayed flat.
    </p>

            Some specialty fruits have even developed cult followings: those Cotton Candy grapes, named for their sweetness, hit the scene in 2011 and quickly became popular. Sumo Citrus, a hybrid of navel oranges, pomelos and mandarins, was more of a slow burn, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/31/business/sumo-citrus-fruit/index.html">but has exploded in recent years</a>.
    </p>



    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw9fbzfr0008356jw6d4d3nr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            In these cases, consumers have been willing to spend a little bit more. But those items are cheap in comparison to Oishii’s specialty strawberries, grown indoors in a climate-controlled vertical farm. When its berries first became available to the public in 2018, Oishii charged $50 for a pack of eight.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw988bjr000l3b6jigaeli3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Oishii is selling more than just berries: It’s selling a luxury item. The berries are packed in flat boxes that spotlight each individual fruit, more like a package for hand-crafted chocolate truffles than the mold-hiding plastic containers you see at a supermarket. Each fruit is supposed to be perfect.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw988bjr000o3b6jbd6223x0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “Even at $50, we had thousands of people on the waitlist constantly,” said Oishii CEO Hiroki Koga.
    </p>



    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw988bjr000p3b6jm11ylxay@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Buzzy or not, $50 for strawberries is not a sustainable price. Today, after rounds of funding and improved technology, Oishii’s products are more readily available, and much cheaper. You can get Oishii berries at mainstream grocers for around $10-$14 per pack.

            Del Monte’s researchers have been coming up with different types of pineapples for years, designing proprietary fruit and often optimizing for taste. In 2020<strong> </strong>the company<strong> </strong>launched its own pretty, giftable fruit — the Pinkglow pineapple, which has pink flesh and comes in its own special box.
    </p>



    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw988bjs000s3b6jga5yzyhe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The Pinkglow was never supposed to be a grocery list staple, said Melissa Mackay, VP of marketing in North America<strong> </strong>at Del Monte. “It’s a hostess gift, it’s a Mother’s Day gift,” she said. It’s also perfect for Instagram and TikTok, where food influencers with large followings cut open the fruit, marveled at its color and shared their reviews (the verdict: very sweet).
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw988bjs000t3b6j17fmjw44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            At first, the Pinkglow was sold for about $50. Today, you can get one for far less, online between around $8 and $29 — bargain prices, relatively, but still steep for a pineapple.
    </p>

            If you can afford it, splurging on a pink pineapple is “permissible, because you’re investing in something that’s good for you,” said<strong> </strong>Melanie Zanoza Bartelme, associate director of Mintel Food &amp; Drink. “It’s like people who go to Erewhon and spend almost $20 on a smoothie that a celebrity created,” she said, referring to the high-end Los Angeles grocery store known for collaborating with celebrities on pricey smoothies (like Hailey Bieber’s Strawberry Glaze Skin Smoothie, priced at $19 for a 20-ounce cup).

            Still, she noted, there is a “blank space between a $16 pineapple and a $400 pineapple.”

            Melissa’s Produce, which sells everything from truffles to mangosteens to kumquats, describes the Rubyglow on its website as a “rare gem” and “the pinnacle of luxury fruit,” adding that “for the gourmand, it’s an unforgettable gift.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw988bjs000z3b6jfshzozon@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The pitch has had limited success. Melissa’s started with 50 pineapples, according to Robert Schueller, director of public relations at Melissa’s Produce. So far, it has sold about half that number over the course of a month, including to restaurants in Las Vegas and Southern California, which he said are using the fruit in displays.
    </p>

            “There’s a market for this,” Schueller said. It’s just a very small, very niche market. “This is not something for everybody.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw988bjs00113b6jl2ha19mx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            To try to create more buzz, Melissa’s reached out to a handful of food influencers, including Bo Corley, a chef who shares recipes and other food tidbits on his social channels.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw988bjs00123b6jb7mu45w5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The pineapple “was absolutely delightful,” Corley said. “There’s almost like a bitter aftertaste when you eat too much pineapple,” he explained. “You don’t have that with the Rubyglow.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw988bjs00133b6jk9j2r2i8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            But, he said, it wasn’t worth $400.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw988bjs00143b6jhnwebe56@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Corley can see people spending to get their hands on the Rubyglow, if not for the taste of the pineapple itself then for the wow factor of the brilliant exterior.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw988bjs00153b6j4ihbut9f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “I think charcuterie boards this Christmas, Thanksgiving — you’re going to see this Rubyglow as a centerpiece, especially in an affluent house,” he said. In other words, people may not spend for the taste of the pineapple, but just<strong> </strong>to show off that they have it.

<p><span>Genesis Global has been given the green light by the bankruptcy court to start a payout plan that will give back almost 97% of its assets to its creditors. </span></p><p class="mobileAfads m-on"></p>
<p><span>The decision was made after the court found that the Amended Plan proposed by Genesis is suitable for confirmation, thus allowing the disbursement of billions in digital assets.</span></p><p class="midadsafter"></p>



<h2><strong>Genesis Creditors to Receive 97% Payout</strong></h2>
<p><span>On May 17, 2024, Judge Sean Lane of the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Genesis Chapter 11 repayment plan, which also includes cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to be returned directly to the creditors. </span></p>
<p><span>This method is in contrast to the other bankruptcy cases for instance FTX’s that proposed repayments in USD. The court also endorsed Genesis’s settlement with New York Attorney General Letitia James, that was related to the previously controversial <a href="https://coingape.com/gemini-agrees-to-1-1-billion-payback-in-earn-program-settlement/" target="_blank">Earn program</a>.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>The approval is the crucial step that Genesis needed to be able to release customer assets frozen since November 2022, when the firm stopped withdrawals in a market downturn. The Genesis creditors, including the users of the Gemini Earn program, solidly supported the plan suggesting that all stakeholders were relieved.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Legal Challenges and Settlements</strong></h2>



<p><span>During the bankruptcy process, Genesis’s parent company, <a href="https://coingape.com/genesis-debt-repayment-creditors-digital-currency-group-dcg/" target="_blank">DCG</a>, had legal problems, with Judge Lane dismissing one of its challenges against the repayment plan. In his 135-page judgment, Judge Lane pointed out that DCG, as an equity holder, was the last in line for repayment and, therefore, “out of the money” significantly.</span></p>
<p><span>Besides this internal conflict, the court’s approvals also included a settlement with the New York Attorney General which solved a lawsuit about <a href="https://coingape.com/genesis-global-capital-agrees-21-million-settlement-sec-gemini-earn/" target="_blank">Genesis Earn program</a> operations. </span></p>
<p><span>This settlement shifts the possible penalties from state coffers to those who are affected, a move that is considered as a victory for the former Earn users.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Enhancing Security Ahead of Payouts</strong></h2>



<p><span>In anticipation of the forthcoming asset distribution, <a href="https://coingape.com/32041-bitcoins-bought-by-genesis-to-settle-creditor-debts/" target="_blank">Genesis</a> has introduced new security measures such as the activation of Approved Addresses for customer accounts. This security feature is designed to ensure that the users who want to transfer their digital assets to external wallets must first be vetted and approved, a process which can take up to seven days.</span></p>
<p><span>This stage reflects Genesis’s protection of creditor assets in the last stages of its bankruptcy resolution. The company, moreover,  has announced that, although these changes will be made, the trading, storing, and fiat withdrawals for those who do not choose to transfer their crypto externally will still continue as usual.</span></p>

<li>
<p><strong>Secretive land purchase</strong>: In 2017, a secretive group purchased 60,000 acres of farmland in rural Solano County, California, sparking concerns about a Chinese government plot to set up a base near Travis Air Force Base.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>New city project</strong>: The company behind the land purchase, California Forever, has launched a website and publicly announced plans to build a brand-new city for up to 400,000 residents, featuring a walkable, urban design inspired by cities like Savannah and New York City's West Village.</p>

<p>The project's fate will ultimately be decided this November by the voters of Solano County, who have to decide whether or not to overturn a three-decades-old law restricting where new development can go.

He believes California Forever's motivation is, "If we could redesign everything and not have to deal with all the inherited problems that cities come with, then that would make everything so much easier."</p><p>California Forever still has plenty of hurdles to clear, some that may prove impossible.</p><p>But Sramek insists this idea of designing and building a relatively-affordable walkable city within the nation's most unaffordable and car-centric state is in fact possible. He says his company has the know-how, the patience, and (critically) the deep pockets to make it a reality.</p><p>"To me, success is that, in 10 or 15 years, Solano County is this incredible economic success story that people all over America are looking at and saying, can we replicate that here?" Sramek said. </p>

                    <p>Thank you, Dean Treanor, for the invitation to speak here today. I am very sorry that circumstances prevent me from joining you in person.</p>

<p>I will start by acknowledging the parents, spouses, partners, other family members and mentors who are here. Without your support, sacrifice, and encouragement, we would not have so much to celebrate today.</p>

<p>And to the class of 2024—congratulations on earning your law degree. You are the most selective class in Georgetown history, chosen from 14,000 applicants, and the most well qualified as well. Among you are Fulbright scholars, military veterans, Peace Corps, AmeriCorps and Teach for America alumni, student athletes, accomplished musicians and even a medical doctor. An impressive group. This is also the most diverse class in the 154-year history of the school.</p>

<p>I am especially proud today to say that there is a lot of Georgetown in my family tree. My father graduated from the College in 1943 before serving in the U.S. Army in World War II. After the war, he received his law degree here and practiced law in Washington, D.C. I am fortunate to have two wonderful daughters; one graduated from the College in 2012; the other is a member of the Class of 2026 at the Law Center.</p>

<p>It seems like yesterday that I was in your shoes, receiving my degree, looking forward with optimism and excitement, and wondering what lay ahead.</p>

<p>I cannot help but think fondly of my time here. For many years, friends from law school have gathered annually for a weekend to refresh our ties and laugh about times gone by. These gatherings are referred to as "Big Chill," a reference to a 1983 movie that revolved around a mid-life reunion of college friends. I made lifelong friendships here that I keep to this day, and I hope it will be the same for you.</p>

<p>Along with all the hard work, I also remember the fun. A favorite tradition was to attend Saturday midnight showings of <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em> at the Key Theater on Wisconsin Avenue in Georgetown.</p>

<p>Now, if you have led a culturally deprived life and are tragically unfamiliar with the movie, it is a raucous musical starring a young Tim Curry. Everyone in the theater would sing along, shout out the lines, and throw popcorn at the screen; many would dress up like the characters. Now, I didn't dress up—sorry to disappoint you—but no party was complete until all of us danced "The Time Warp" to the movie's famous song.</p>

<p>As it happens, I still remember the steps, and I had intended to demonstrate the Time Warp for you, but that will not be possible today.</p>

<p>Instead, I will offer a few thoughts that I might have benefited from hearing when I was sitting in your chairs a mere 45 years ago.</p>

<p><strong>Embracing Change</strong><br>
The years since my graduation have brought waves of fundamental change to the workplace and to society at large, much of it driven by technology. Imagine a world with no internet, no email or texting, no personal computers or cell phones, no social media. Some of you parents are no doubt thinking: I would be fine with that world!</p>

<p>The pace of change will likely continue to be very fast. Be alert to the ways your working life may change. Think about how you can be prepared for those changes and to turn them to your advantage, and to society's advantage. The practice of law has been transformed over the years; if you do choose the path of a practicing lawyer, I would think about what practicing law could look like in 10 or 20 years.</p>

<p>In a world that will continue to evolve quickly and in unexpected ways, you will need to be agile. Embracing change and taking risks can be an important part of your development as a professional and as a person. Your formal education may end today, but you are not done learning. Many of the important things you will need to know can only be learned through experience. And experience can be a hard but irreplaceable teacher.</p>

<p>As an example, near the end of my second year here, it was time to select the next editor in chief of the <em>Georgetown Law Journal</em>. I thought that there were plenty of colleagues who were better qualified, but who simply did not want the job. So, with much trepidation, I put my name in. I was secretly, but utterly, terrified that I might be chosen. And amazingly enough, I was. What now?</p>

<p>It turned out that, as I feared, I was not well prepared for that responsibility. I had to keep people interested and motivated enough to work on the <em>Journal</em> when many things competed for their attention. I had to have a plan for the organization and not just for myself. I had to do this while exhibiting confidence that I did not feel. My main memory of that time is thinking, "This is harder and far different from what I had expected!"</p>

<p>What I now know is that almost no one is ready for their first leadership roles. When you step into a leadership role, it is very common to doubt yourself. If I could tell my younger self something, it would be to believe in yourself and put yourself in situations in which you will be seriously challenged to do new things. Assume that you will make mistakes. Learn from those mistakes; do not dwell excessively upon them in regret. You will fall down. Get up. Repeat cycle.</p>

<p>The more you do that, the more you will learn and the faster you will develop as a person and as a leader. Know also that, in my experience, there is no single model of a successful leader. Each of you has it in you to lead successfully.</p>

<p><strong>No One Path</strong><br>
One of the great things about your legal education is it sets you up for success on a wide variety of potential paths. I left the practice of law a few years after I left this school. But my legal education has benefited me all along the way. Studying law teaches you to think clearly, analyze thoroughly, and understand all sides of an argument. The possibilities that lie ahead of you are extremely broad. You may work for a single law firm for your entire career. Or you may leave the law fairly soon, as I did, and never look back. You will always benefit from what you learned here.</p>

<p>The fact is, I do keep a copy of the Federal Reserve Act that I consult often.</p>

<p>Like many of you, I imagine, I knew that I wanted to do public service. As I left law school, I remember thinking about people like George Shultz and Cyrus Vance, prominent figures of the day who had successful private-sector careers and served periodically in government.</p>

<p>The head of the investment bank in New York where I worked as a young man was Nicholas F. Brady, who had an extraordinary career in investment banking and had served as a U.S. senator from New Jersey as well. I was the most junior of employees, but I wanted to introduce myself and tell him about my own aspirations. But approaching him was daunting. Maybe he would decline to meet with me. Maybe he would think I was not committed to the firm if I told him I was interested in public service.</p>

<p>I finally summoned the courage to present myself at his office. I told him that I grew up in Washington, had been a federal law clerk and a congressional staffer, and wanted to do public service along the way. I said that if you need someone to staff you on anything you do in Washington, I'm your guy. He said something along the lines of, "Great, thanks." I then crept back down the stairs to my broom closet of an office wondering whether that was going to matter.</p>

<p>A few months later, I got a call from his secretary. I can still hear her gravelly voice. "Can you come up and see Mr. Brady?" When I got there, he said, "I need you to help me out with this thing." This thing was defending an oil company from a hostile takeover attempt by a colorful corporate raider of that era named T. Boone Pickens. I ended up spending months going back and forth from New York to Washington with Nick. A few years later, Nick Brady became the Treasury Secretary. Nick asked me to join him at Treasury, which opened the door for me to higher levels of public service. The point is this: if I had not forced myself to get up from my desk, taken the stairs up to the 15th floor, and presented myself to his office that day, the rest of my life would have been very different, and I would not be standing here today.</p>

<p>Mustering that little bit of initiative changed my life. A little initiative can make all the difference in anyone's career.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
I will conclude by encouraging you to think beyond yourselves. Each of you has the capability to achieve success in any field you choose; it is important that you also consider how to give back and use your gifts to make a difference. Reflect on the motto of this school: "law is but the means; justice is the end." Many of you have served at law clinics where you stood up for underrepresented individuals and organizations. And many of you will play important roles in the military, at nonprofits, and in governments around the world.</p>

<p>Each generation has an obligation to move us closer to the ideal, as embodied by the famous image of blindfolded Lady Justice holding the scales. You should count yourselves among the luckiest in all our society to graduate from this institution, to have the support of loved ones through three grueling years, and the health and other good fortune not to get tripped up along the way. Several years ago, one of my predecessors, Ben Bernanke, said, "Those who are the luckiest . . . also have the greatest responsibility to work hard, to contribute to the betterment of the world, and to share their luck with others." I cannot improve upon that.</p>

<p>I thank you for having me. Georgetown will always hold a special place in my heart. Thank you again to Dean Treanor and all the faculty, and the hardiest of congratulations to the Class of 2024.</p>
