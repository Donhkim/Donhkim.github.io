<li><strong>BJP may not win majority</strong>: Early results suggest that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may not win a majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament, and may need to form a coalition government.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty over economic policies</strong>: The uncertainty over the government's composition may lead to uncertainty over economic policies, including investment and infrastructure development.</li>
<li><strong>Markets expected Modi's victory</strong>: Markets had soared on Monday after exit polls suggested a significant victory for the BJP, but the reality is that the party is likely to fall short of achieving a majority by itself.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Indian economy</strong>: The uncertainty over the government's composition may have implications for the Indian economy, including the possibility of a shift in focus from reforms to welfare programmes.</li>

	The future of <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/paramount-global/" id="auto-tag_paramount-global" data-tag="paramount-global">Paramount Global</a> remains uncertain, with the Skydance-RedBird deal in the hands of Shari Redstone, and the three co-CEOs laying out their own plan for the company Tuesday morning.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     ">
	With that in mind, the company has opted to postpone a scheduled all-employee town hall that had been set for Wednesday.

</p>



<p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     ">
	Paramount told employees that the town hall will now be held on Tuesday, June 25, suggesting that there should be more clarity on the company’s future by then.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     ">
	“Given the ongoing speculation regarding potential M&amp;A, we want to be able to speak to you with as much candor and transparency as possible,” the company wrote to employees. “By moving the date, our hope is to do just that.”

	</p>


<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     ">
	The company is in the middle of a critical week that could shape its future. Redstone is currently <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/shari-redstone-skydance-paramount-offer-decide-1235913695/">reviewing a takeover offer </a>led by Skydance that would see the company acquire her family’s National Amusements holding company, merge Skydance into Paramount, and offer to buy out many Paramount common shareholders at a premium.

</p>



<p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     ">
	Meanwhile, on Tuesday morning, during the company’s annual meeting, the three co-CEOs Brian Robbins, George Cheeks and Chris McCarthy<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-leadership-takeover-offer-1235914492/"> </a>laid out their own<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-leadership-takeover-offer-1235914492/"> “shared vision” for Paramount</a>, a new strategic plan that includes cost-cutting, seeking a partner in streaming, and divesting some assets.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     ">
	“While we recognize that this is not a traditional management structure, we are confident that it will enable them to move quickly to implement best practices throughout the company to drive improved performance,” Redstone said during the meeting, suggesting that if there is no deal, the executives will move quickly on their plan.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     ">
	The three were set to discuss that vision with employees Wednesday, but with the town hall postponed, it will have to wait. Their own plan would presumably only come into play if Redstone opts to not take the Skydance deal, and other deals do not materialize.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strong demand</strong>: Super Micro Computer's CFO David Weigand says the demand for their products is real and driven by their new liquid cooling technology, which makes data centers more efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Supply constraint</strong>: Weigand attributes the company's success to its ability to guide a significant number of shipments of liquid cooling products, citing supply constraints as a major issue.</li>
<li><strong>Liquid cooling growth</strong>: Weigand expects the percentage of data centers using liquid cooling to grow from 1% today to 20% within the next 18 months, citing the company's new product as a key differentiator.</li>
<li><strong>Outperformance</strong>: Super Micro's shares have risen 168% since the start of the year, driven by the company's unprecedented demand.</li>
<li><strong>Balancing powerhouses</strong>: Weigand explains that Super Micro is not competing directly with other high-performance companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, but instead positions their company as a neutral "Switzerland" in the industry, offering products that deliver optimal performance.</li>

Now the big question is supply.</p><p>“The opportunity that is presented is the huge demand,” Weigand told me.</p><p>“We've had a growing backlog because of the fact that we're bringing really good products to market. It's really still a supply constrained market," Weigan said.</p><p>Helping fuel Super Micro’s unprecedented demand is its new product, liquid cooling, which makes data centers more efficient. Weigand told me that it’s what differentiates Super Micro from others within the industry and gives the company “an edge.”</p><p>“Speed to market is really the edge that we have and what gave us the ability to guide so many shipments in liquid cooling this quarter," Weigand added.</p><p>To put the expected growth perspective, Bank of America’s Ruplu Bhattacharya wrote in a recent note that just 1% of data centers use liquid cooling today, but Super Micro expects that figure to grow to 20% within the next 18 months.</p><p>Weigand added that Super Micro’s massive outperformance, and in case you missed it, shares are up a staggering 168% since the start of the year, is more than just a result of Nvidia’s blowout business.

<p>Elon Musk is yet again being accused of diverting Tesla resources to his other companies. This time, it's high-end H100 GPU clusters from Nvidia. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-ordered-nvidia-ship-thousands-ai-chips-reserved-tesla-x-xai-rcna155371">CNBC's Lora Kolodny reports</a> that while Tesla ordered these pricey computers, emails from Nvidia staff show that Musk instead redirected 12,000 GPUs to be delivered to his social media company X.</p>
<p>It's almost unheard of for a profitable automaker to pivot its business into another sector, but that appears to be the plan at Tesla as Musk continues to say that the electric car company is instead destined to be an AI and robotics firm instead.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<h2>Does Tesla make cars or AI?</h2>
<p>That explains why <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-profits-drop-55-as-elon-musk-dodges-cheap-car-questions/">Musk told investors in April</a> that Tesla had spent $1 billion on GPUs in the first three months of this year, almost as much as it spent on R&amp;D, despite being desperate for new models to add to what is now an old and very limited product lineup that is suffering rapidly declining sales in <a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/tesla-model-3-model-y-drag-evs-down-us-registration-data">the US</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-china-made-ev-sales-fall-66-yy-may-2024-06-04/">China</a>.</p>
<p>Despite increasing federal scrutiny here in the US, Tesla has reduced the price of its controversial "full-self driving" assist, and the automaker is said to be <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-makes-push-roll-out-advanced-fsd-self-driving-china-2024-05-30/">close to rolling out the feature in China</a>. (Questions remain about how many Chinese Teslas would be able to utilize this feature given that <a href="https://bradmunchen.substack.com/p/tesla-files-2-tesla-sold-12-million">a critical chip was left out of 1.2 million cars</a> built there during the chip shortage.)</p>
<p>Perfecting this driver assist would be very valuable to Tesla, which offers FSD as a monthly subscription as an alternative to a one-off payment. The profit margins for subscription software services vastly outstrip the margins Tesla can make selling physical cars, which dropped to just 5.5 percent for Q1 2024. And Tesla says that massive GPU clusters are needed to develop FSD's software.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Isn’t Tesla desperate for Nvidia GPUs?</h2>
<p>Tesla has been developing its own in-house supercomputer for AI, called Dojo. But Musk has previously said that computer could be redundant if Tesla could source more H100s. "If they could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo, but they can't because they've got so many customers," Musk said <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/21/tesla_dojo_spending/">during a July 2023 investor day</a>.</p>
<p>Which makes his decision to have his other companies jump all the more notable. In December, an internal Nvidia memo seen by CNBC said, "Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead. In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla."</p>
<p>X and the affiliated xAi are developing generative AI products like large language models.</p>
<h2>Not the first time</h2>
<p>This is not the first time that Musk has been accused of diverting resources (and his time) from publicly held Tesla to his other privately owned enterprises. In December 2022, US Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2022.12.18%20Letter%20to%20Tesla%20Board%20on%20Musk%20Concerns.pdf">wrote to Tesla</a> asking Tesla to explain whether Musk was diverting Tesla resources to X (then called Twitter):</p>
<blockquote><p>This use of Tesla employees raises obvious questions about whether Mr. Musk is appropriating resources from a publicly traded firm, Tesla, to benefit his own private company, Twitter. This, of course, would violate Mr. Musk’s legal duty of loyalty to Tesla and trigger questions about the Tesla Board’s responsibility to prevent such actions, and may also run afoul other “anti-tunneling rules that aim to prevent corporate insiders from extracting resources from their firms."</p></blockquote>
<p>Musk giving time meant (and compensated) for by Tesla to SpaceX, X, and his other ventures <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-part-time-ceo-distracted-by-twitter-spacex-shareholders-2023-2">was also highlighted as a problem</a> by the plaintiffs in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/elon-musks-56-billion-pay-plan-voided-as-shareholders-beat-tesla-in-court/">a successful lawsuit to overturn</a> a $56 billion stock compensation package.</p>
<p>And last summer, the US Department of Justice opened an investigation into whether Musk used Tesla resources <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/federal-investigation-launched-into-alleged-misuse-of-tesla-resources-for-elon-musks">to build a mansion for the CEO in Texas</a>; the probe has since <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/justice-department-probe-scrutinizes-elon-musk-perks-at-tesla-going-back-years-3493e321">expanded to cover behavior stretching back to 2017</a>.</p>
<p>These latest accusations of misuse of Tesla resources come at a time when Musk is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/tesla-shareholder-group-opposes-musks-46b-pay-slams-board-dysfunction/">asking shareholders to reapprove</a> what is now a $46 billion stock compensation plan.</p>

<li>A technical issue on the stock exchange caused a huge discount in the stock price of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, with the price falling to $185 a share from over $620,000.</li>
<li>Investors who purchased the stock at the discounted price will have their trades canceled by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which has identified the trades as "erroneous".</li>
<li>The NYSE has stated that it will "bust" all trades of Berkshire Hathaway stock at or below $603,718.30 a share.</li>

<li>
<p>The FDA is investigating allegations of misconduct and therapist unblinding in the Majestic Life Optimization Network (MPLONG) psychotherapy trial, but cannot disclose specific details due to ongoing inspections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FDA has concerns about therapists discouraging people from reporting adverse events and is reviewing the therapy manual to address potential flexibility issues.</p>

<li>
<p>The agency is looking into allegations of therapist variability in delivering the psychotherapy, but lacks insight into whether guesses of treatment assignment might have affected the therapy.</p>

<li>
<p>The FDA is unlikely to regulate psychotherapy itself, citing the difficulty of managing the therapy manual and the psychotherapy component of the REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy).</p>

<p>Despite ongoing investigations, the FDA plans to complete inspections before taking action on the product, and it is unclear how many patients will gain access to the therapy once the product is approved.</p>

							<p>Walter Dunn begins by asking two questions of the agency. The first draws on the ICER review to ask about claims that investigators discouraged people from encouraging in MPLONG, that therapists discouraged reports of adverse events, and so on. “Is the agency investigating this?”, he asked.</p><p>Farchione said that “there isn’t a lot I can say with regard specific details” in terms of what she is looking into. “We certainly take those allegations very seriously and are quite concerned”, she said, adding that “we do have inspections ongoing at this point, but can’t really speak to the details as those are ongoing.”</p><p>Satish Iyengar, Professor of Statistics at the University of Pittsburgh, asked whether an analysis is possible that accounts for inter-therapist (dyad) variability in outcomes. Inter-site variability had been reviewed, the agency said, but not inter-therapist.</p><p>Holtzheimer asked how therapist unblinding might lead to differences in how the psychotherapy is delivered between the two arms. Lykos told him that there was assessment of fidelity to the protocol in both arms, but Holtzheimer asked FDA if it had reviewed such data.</p><p>“I would just say that based on the description of the therapy in the manual, and the sort of flexibility inherent in the manualised psychotherapy, we assumed that there would be variability among the different therapeutic approaches,” Farchione said. Whether that differed based on therapists’ guesses of treatment assignment, ‘we don’t have any insight into that’.</p><p>Joniak-Grant said that, as a patient, the flexibility in Lykos’ therapy manual makes her uneasy. She asked how the FDA might manage this.</p><p>“The difficult thing…is that we don’t regulate psychotherapy, and also we don’t really have any say in the design or the implementation of the particular therapy that is going to be used”, Farchione said.</p><p>“Even when it comes to the parameters of the REMS”, she said, it comes down to safety and monitoring, not the psychotherapy component.</p><p>She also asked that, if inspections into allegations of misconduct are ongoing, could the product come to market before those are completed?</p><p>Farchione said that the agency “would complete the inspections before taking action.”</p><p>Hertig asked the agency to comment on accessibility: “I’m trying to get a sense for, after we do all of these things, how many patients are gonna get access?”</p><p>“We don’t have an answer to that”, Farchione said. “In terms of trying to design a REMS that can appropriately mitigate the risks we have identified,” the agency had tried to consider accessibility, too.</p><p>“But at the same time, we do have a lot of unknowns, and we do have some clear risks with this product”, she added.</p><p>“We do periodic REMS assessments as well”, she added, suggesting that new information could justify modifying a REMS.</p><p>Witczak, the consumer representative, asked if there would be a way (in the postmarketing world) to separate out drug-related vs. psychotherapy-related incidents or adverse events.</p><p>Farchione suggested that state medical boards and other licensing bodies, as well as the potential for criminal charges, would need to play a role in regulating the delivery of MDMA-assisted therapy, if approved. ‘The FDA can’t regulate everything’, she implied.</p><p>Amirshahi brought up hyponatremia, noting that it hadn’t been discussed in great detail thus far. “Do we have a plan for that?”, she asked.</p><p>Farchione said that “we are considering what kind of postmarketing requirements” the agency might mandate, both for clinical laboratory assessments and additional data from cardiovascular studies.</p><p>Barone said that the fact that the therapy guide had such flexibility is inconsistent with clinical practice guidelines for PTSD, and asked how the FDA views it.</p><p>Farchione said that “there is not a great answer to that question”, reiterating that the psychotherapy does not fall within its remit.</p><p>Dunn asked another question, asking how the agency views the incident in a Phase 2 study that “happened long after the last dose was administered”. Given the drug’s pro-social effects, would the agency be monitoring for these types of longer-term events?</p><p>Farchione said that this is an area in which it would be useful to hear from the committee, such as how to incorporate this type of monitoring into its REMS structure. She noted that ‘the further out you get from the administration session, the harder it is to attribute that to the drug’, though.</p><p>Dunn also wondered whether, if Lykos’ model of psychological intervention was demonstrated as essential to the safety of the drug product, FDA could mandate it.</p><p>FDA’s Cynthia LaCivita said that would be something the agency would have to look into, as this is something novel for them.</p><p>Dunn then asked what the rationale was with regard to only requiring one licensed therapist in the room. “Why not have both be licensed?”, he asked.</p><p>Farchione explained that this mirrored the trials, adding that it “primarily has to do with the concerns of balancing access, as well”.</p><p>Dunn reminded the audience that the transgression in the Phase 2 study happened with an unlicensed therapist. Dunn also said he was “thinking about for-profit operations which may misrepresent the training status of people who are unlicensed, claiming they are in training when they’re not”, adding that his personal feeling is that both therapists should hold licenses.</p><p>Joniak-Grant also commented on the licensure element, reminding the agency that power imbalances in the relationship between therapists might reduce the likelihood of the lesser-credentialed therapist reporting the other in the case of misconduct.</p><p>She also sought clarification for what ‘on-site’ means, saying that the “idea that someone is just going to be ‘around'” might not be enough for patients.</p><p>Canuso asked how there was no requirement for laboratory assessment at the time of submission.</p><p>“It was missed”, Farchione admitted. “Every program we have ever reviewed has labs…perhaps the primary reviewer, because it’s always there, just didn’t notice it wasn’t”, she continued, adding that “both the applicant and we have to take responsibility for [that].” “It is a hole in the program”, she acknowledged.</p><p>Dunn asked whether the agency has data regarding how many additional hours of therapy those in the MDMA arm might have received versus those in the placebo arm, as some had additional integration sessions. ‘That’s probably a question for the sponsor’, Farchione said.</p><p>Dunn then asked whether the agency would consider a warning label for the <em>therapist</em>, pointing to things like transference, and citing a Stanford animal study where mice ‘acted differently’ when in the presence of mice that had ingested MDMA.</p><p>Even though the prescribing information is generally directed toward the prescriber, an FDA staffer said, one might expect the therapists to be familiar.</p><p>Witczak asked if the total number of study participants is adequate, in the FDA’s mind.</p><p>Farchione said that if this were something that needed to be dosed more frequently, the agency would expect more data, “primarily to have more safety data”. But, given the proposed protocol, it’s a different matter.</p><p>Narendran said he was “struggling with” a lot of missing data, and asked FDA whether the agency could restrict patient populations to maintain safety, such as for cardiovascular risk.</p><p>“It’s certainly something that we could consider”, Farchione said, which was echoed by Director of the Division of Risk Management, LaCivita. They both encouraged the committee to make suggestions to the agency after lunch.</p>						</div>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>By Dawn Chmielewski</p><p>(Reuters) -Paramount Global Chair Shari Redstone is unhappy with Skydance Media's reduced offer for the family's controlling stake in the company, opening the door for rival bidders to make their case, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.</p><p>Over a months' long pursuit of a deal with Paramount, Skydance CEO David Ellison reduced his initial $2.5 billion offer for National Amusements, which holds the Redstone family's Paramount stake, to provide additional cash for the company's nonvoting shareholders, according to one source familiar with the process.</p><p>In a later offer submitted last week, Ellison created more cash for shareholders by reducing Skydance's valuation of the merger to $4.75 billion from $5 billion, according to that source.</p><p>Redstone was displeased with that revaluation, according to the two sources - creating an opportunity for others interested in buying National Amusements. Among them, Hollywood producer Steven Paul began lobbying the Redstone family to consider his offers over a sale to Skydance, one of the sources said. Though one of the sources added that Redstone would always have always been obliged to consider all offers for National Amusements.</p><p>Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Spokespeople for Skydance and Redstone declined to comment. A spokesman for a Paramount special committee, which has been evaluating options for the company, also declined to comment.</p><p>Paramount shares were down 4.6% in late Tuesday trading. The company's fortunes have waned as its traditional television business has declined while the streaming video service it launched to capture audiences has yet to recover lost revenue.</p><p>The latest twist in deal talks came with Paramount's annual shareholder meeting in the background. Addressing shareholders, Paramount's co-CEOs put forth a restructuring plan that includes $500 million in annualized cost cuts, potential asset sales and a possible joint venture or other partnerships for its Paramount+ streaming service.</p><p>The new Paramount triumvirate - CBS President and CEO George Cheeks; Chris McCarthy, president and CEO of Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios; and Paramount Pictures President and CEO Brian Robbins - have led the company since the exit of former boss Bob Bakish in April, who left amid growing tensions with Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder.</p><p>Paramount said it rescheduled Wednesday's planned employee town hall for June 25, citing ongoing speculation about a potential deal.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>"We want to be able to speak to you with as much candor and transparency as possible," the company's co-CEOs told employees in a note seen by Reuters. "By moving the date, our hope is to do just that.”</p><p>REDSTONE ENDORSEMENT</p><p>Redstone endorsed the co-CEOs and their plan to better capitalize on the company's wealth of content and reduce costs to strengthen its balance sheet.</p><p>"They are each experienced, respected leaders within our company, in our industry, and they have been behind our biggest successes for years," she said on Tuesday.</p><p>The shareholder meeting was the first time the three executives publicly addressed investors as a group.</p><p>Paramount has shed about $18 billion in market value since December 2019, when Redstone reunited two halves of the family's media empire, CBS and Viacom.</p><p>One source close to Redstone said the sale of a media conglomerate built by the late Sumner Redstone, from the National Amusements theater chain founded by his father, Michael, has been an emotional process and one which will require some time to evaluate.</p><p>In April, Paramount entered into exclusive merger talks with Skydance Media, but allowed that period of exclusivity to lapse as it evaluated a rival nonbinding offer letter from Sony Pictures Entertainment and Apollo Global Management.</p><p>Under the terms of the latest offer from Skydance, Paramount would acquire the independent studio in an all-stock transaction valued at $4.75 billion, according to one person familiar with the negotiations.</p><p>Skydance and its deal partners, RedBird Capital and KKR, would infuse Paramount with at least $1.5 billion in fresh capital to be used to pay down debt, and offer to purchase 40% of Paramount's nonvoting class B stock at $15 a share, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>In a related transaction, Skydance would acquire privately held National Amusements, which owns movie theaters in the United States, the UK and Latin America, and holds 77% of Paramount's class A voting stock, representing the Redstone family's controlling interest in the company.</p><p>The more than $2 billion deal for National Amusements would give Skydance CEO Ellison voting control over the larger media company, setting the stage for the merger.</p><p>(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)</p></div></div>

<p class="has-large-font-size">Today at SAP Sapphire, we announced plans to bring our generative AI copilot Joule together with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sap-news-cta-banner alignleft cta-banner"><div class="cta-banner__content"><p class="cta-banner__title">SAP Sapphire: Taking Business to the Next Level in the Era of AI</p></div></div>



<p>The deep bi-directional integration will allow employees to get more done in the flow of their work through seamless access to information from interactions with business applications in SAP, as well as Microsoft 365.</p>



<p>I often get asked the question, “How many copilots do I need for my business?”</p>



<p> The answer is not about how many, but which you use when. </p>



<p>By integrating two of the leading generative AI copilots for business, users can use both simultaneously to get work done. And future plans for bi-directional integration will allow users to benefit from one experience, no matter which copilot they use.</p>



<p>“Unlocking the massive potential AI has to offer requires capabilities that are high value, reliable, and available in-context in the applications that people use today,” said Muhammad Alam,  member of the Executive Board of SAP SE and head of SAP Product Engineering. With the bi-directional integration of Joule and Copilot for Microsoft 365, we’re enabling employees to get more done in the flow of their work through seamless access to information from business applications in SAP as well as Microsoft 365.” </p>



<p>“Microsoft and SAP are committed to providing world-class solutions to help our customers solve their most fundamental business challenges,” said Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Cloud + AI at Microsoft. “The integration of Microsoft Copilot and Joule brings together the power of generative AI to unlock greater employee productivity and will enable enterprises to accelerate customer-centric innovation in a unified experience.”</p>



<p>SAP and Microsoft will start integrating their Joule and Copilot for Microsoft 365 later this year, combining enterprise data residing in SAP with contextual knowledge from Microsoft 365, including Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Word, and more, delivering richer insights for better decision-making. </p>



<p>With this integration, SAP and Microsoft are creating entirely new ways to boost productivity. </p>



<p>For example, by bringing Copilot for Microsoft 365 into Joule, a user can book a flight using SAP Concur and Joule, and Joule can block their calendar in Microsoft Outlook. </p>



<p>Or, consider a product manager working on a new product launch with a cross-functional team: they have regular meetings on Microsoft Teams and collaborate with Microsoft 365. Joule can connect to the team’s individual skill profiles stored in SAP SuccessFactors software and core business information that resides in SAP S/4HANA Cloud. The new integration enables product managers to coordinate business activities with the team, simply by using a few queries. </p>



<p>Today’s collaboration, as well as the <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/unlock-innovation-and-transformation-with-expanded-sap-btp-and-sap-ai/ba-p/13714786" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three new AI SAP BTP regions announced</a> last week, is the next step in a long-standing partnership between SAP and Microsoft, using the latest in enterprise-ready generative AI innovation to help solve customers’ most fundamental business challenges.</p>

							<p>Despite some recent volatility, the long-term growth story at <strong>Super Micro Computer</strong> (NASDAQ:<span class="stock-ticker"><a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/smci-stock-quote/"><strong><u>SMCI</u></strong></a></span>) remains intact. Twelve months ago, Super Micro Computer stock was $230 a share. Since then, the stock has risen 241% and grown from a small-cap security to being <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-jones-03-18-2024/card/supermicro-deckers-to-join-the-s-p-500-today-KCVF4h9UJSoqosuPdbk4" rel="nofollow">added to the S&amp;P 500</a>, and <a href="https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance" rel="nofollow">leading that benchmark index</a> in terms of performance. </p>



<p>Most of the gain came this year,Super Micro Computer stock is up 175% since January. After peaking in mid-March, SMCI stock has experienced some volatility and dropped 36% from its 52-week high. Investors should see the pullback as <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/06/01/artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-outperform-nvidia/" rel="nofollow">a buying opportunity</a> and take a position before the share price begins to run higher once again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Post-Earnings Volatility</h2>



<p>Super Micro Computer stock really took off after the company signed a deal to supply <strong>Nvidia </strong>(NASDAQ:<span class="stock-ticker"><a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/nvda-stock-quote/"><strong><u>NVDA</u></strong></a></span>) with servers that can be used in tandem with its microchips and semiconductors to run artificial intelligence applications. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.barchart.com/story/news/26507094/why-super-micro-computer-stock-is-a-buy-after-nvidias-earnings-report" rel="nofollow">Servers are in high demand </a>as companies invest in infrastructure to support generative AI applications and models. The huge run up in SMCI stock over the past year has been due to sky high expectations for sales growth of its servers.</p>



<p>Heading into Super Micro Computer’s first quarter print, expectations might have been set too high for the company. </p>



<p>Despite beating Wall Street’s profit forecast, reporting 200% year-over-year revenue growth, and raising its forward guidance, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/super-micro-stock-plummets-18percent-after-posting-revenue-miss-.html" rel="nofollow">SMCI stock fell more than 10%</a>. </p>



<p>Had any other company posted as strong a quarter, their stock would have skyrocketed. But investors wanted more from Super Micro Computer after the huge run up in its share price.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Big Growth</h2>



<p>Super Micro Computer reported EPS of $6.65 compared to $5.78 that was expected among analysts. Revenue came in at $3.85 billion, which narrowly missed the $3.95 billion consensus forecast of analysts. </p>



<p>Despite the miss, the company’s <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/super-micro-computer-smci-earnings-stock-price-2bd885ef" rel="nofollow">revenue was up 200%</a> year over year. In the previous fourth quarter of 2023, Super Micro Computer reported 103% year-over-year revenue growth.</p>



<p>Super Micro Computer said its <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/smci-stock-super-micro-fiscal-q3-2024-earnings/" rel="nofollow">Q1 growth</a> would have been greater had it not been for the shortage of a key component needed to make its in-demand servers. </p>



<p>Management said that their supply chain should be better moving forward. In terms of guidance, the company said it expects fiscal 2024 revenue of $14.70 billion to $15.10 billion, up from a previous outlook of $14.30 billion to $14.70 billion.</p>



<p>The new guidance implies astounding year-over-year revenue growth of 582% at the midpoint. Analysts had expected fiscal 2024 revenue of $14.60 billion, which is lower than the revised outlook provided by the company.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Buy Super Micro Computer Stock </h2>



<p>The 10 professional analysts who cover SMCI stock currently have a <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/smci/forecast" rel="nofollow">median price target</a> on it of $1,097.78, which implies 40% upside from current levels. There are currently no “sell ratings” on the stock. </p>



<p>The fact that the company’s share price fell after its Q1 print obscured the fact that Super Micro Computer is growing at breakneck speed, a fact that justifies both its share price and valuation. With demand for its servers rising and the AI revolution in full-swing, Super Micro Computer <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/05/06/super-micro-computer-time-to-buy-this-magnificent/" rel="nofollow">stock is a buy</a>.</p>
