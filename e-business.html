We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">OpenAI defended its practices in a statement, saying that it had avenues such as a tipline to report issues at the company and that it did not release new technology until there were appropriate safeguards. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Google</a> did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“We’re proud of our track record providing the most capable and safest AI systems and believe in our scientific approach to addressing risk. We agree that rigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology and we’ll continue to engage with governments, civil society and other communities around the world,” an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/openai" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">OpenAI</a> spokesperson said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Concern over the potential harms of artificial intelligence have existed for decades, but the AI boom of recent years has intensified those fears and left regulators scrambling to catch up with technological advancements. While AI companies have publicly stated their commitment to safely developing the technology, researchers and employees have warned about a lack of oversight as AI tools exacerbate existing social harms or create entirely new ones.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The letter from current and former AI company employees, which was first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/technology/openai-culture-whistleblowers.html?" data-link-name="in body link">reported by the New York Times</a>, calls for increased protections for workers at advanced AI companies who decide to voice safety concerns. It asks for a commitment to four principles around transparency and accountability, including a provision that companies will not force employees to sign any non-disparagement agreements that prohibit airing risk-related AI issues and a mechanism for employees to anonymously share concerns with board members.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“So long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public,” the letter states. “Yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Companies such as OpenAI have also pursued aggressive tactics to prevent employees from speaking freely about their work, with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/17/24158478/openai-departures-sam-altman-employees-chatgpt-release" data-link-name="in body link">Vox reporting last week</a> that OpenAI made employees who leave the company sign extremely restrictive non-disparagement and non-disclosure documents or lose all their vested equity. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, apologized following the report, saying that he would change off-boarding procedures.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The letter comes after two top OpenAI employees, co-founder Ilya Sutskever and key safety researcher Jan Leike, resigned from the company last month. After his departure, Leike alleged that OpenAI had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/18/openai-putting-shiny-products-above-safety-says-departing-researcher" data-link-name="in body link">abandoned a culture of safety</a> in favor of “shiny products”.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The open letter on Tuesday echoed some of Leike’s statement, saying that companies did not display any obligation to be transparent about their operations.</p></div></div>

<li><strong>Shari Redstone's Merger Offer</strong>: Paramount's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, is considering a merger offer from Skydance, a company run by David Ellison.

	A town hall for <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/paramount/" id="auto-tag_paramount" data-tag="paramount">Paramount</a> Global employees originally scheduled to take place Wednesday has been delayed until June 25.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	In a note to employees obtained by Deadline, CEOs George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins recapped Tuesday morning’s annual shareholder meeting and also noted the rescheduling of the town hall. “Given the ongoing speculation regarding potential M&amp;A, we want to be able to speak to you with as much candor and transparency as possible. By moving the date, our hope is to do just that,” they wrote.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	The shift comes at a time that <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/paramount-global/" id="auto-tag_paramount-global" data-tag="paramount-global">Paramount Global</a> controlling shareholder, <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/shari-redstone/" id="auto-tag_shari-redstone" data-tag="shari-redstone">Shari Redstone</a>, is mulling a merger offer from <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/skydance/" id="auto-tag_skydance" data-tag="skydance">Skydance</a>. The shareholder meeting largely skirted the topic of M&amp;A, and instead gave Redstone a chance to make the case for the unorthodox Office of the CEO structure. She conceded it was unusual, but said it would harness the collective experience of three top execs with seasoning both at the company and in the entertainment industry. Cheeks, Robbins and McCarthy were installed in their new roles in April after the ouster of Bob Bakish.

	</p>

<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	The troika outlined a plan to shareholders to cut $500 million in annual overhead and juice streaming revenue through licensing and a potential joint venture or strategic partnership with a media or tech company. While more information can be expected to be conveyed at the town hall later this month, the CEOs also alluded to Paramount’s next quarterly earnings call in August as a moment when the investment community can expect to hear more details.

</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	Paramount stock slipped 4% Tuesday in the wake of the meeting after having run up on Monday amid talk of Skydance being close to sealing a long-sought merger deal. Redstone did not appreciate the fact that Skydance’s revised offer satisfied many Class B (non-voting) shareholders while diminishing her proceeds, according to a report by Reuters. In creating more cash for shareholders, the David Ellison-run suitor decreased the valuation of the deal to $4.75 billion from $5 billion, the report said. (That price tag excludes the roughly $3 billion initial step of acquiring Redstone’s National Amusements, which controls 77% of Paramount’s Class A, or voting, stock.)</p>

What do you think, if you were gonna advise Roaring Kitty right now, what would you do with his share GameStop?</strong></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"><strong>DAVID DIETZE (DD): </strong>I would sell. There’s no fundamentals that back up the kind of price that GameStop has run up to. I applaud him for perhaps getting lucky. We don’t know who’s complete track record. We don’t even know who’s backing him. Some of the screenshots are showing what, $116 million of gain stock shares? Is that all his, or is he running a little bit of mini fund that has been funneled into his account? We don’t know for sure that that’s his screenshot. There’s no proof of that. But, certainly, I advise my clients and so forth, don’t get involved in the meme stock frenzy. There’s just no way to use fundamental analysis to determine where the next stop is. Indeed, we’ve seen both AMC and GameStop sell shares into the latest runup because they see a valuation that way exceeds what they think their own shares are worth. They run the company, they would be in the best position to know, and that actually could help them move their business forward by getting this inexpensive capital because the stock price runup. So, you know, in terms of E*Trade, of course, they’re now trying to figure out, well, how do we handle the situation? It sounds like the Roaring Kitty account is on the E*Trade platform. So they’re between a rock and a hard place if they kick him off. I mean, he’s got all these followers. The so-called younger investors. E*Trade has always purported to want to get a foothold into [that] investment world. They’re gonna say, <em>Oh yeah. Stodgy E*Trade, now owned by Morgan Stanley, we’re trying to make money and play with the big guys. And now you kick our leader off the platform. We may take our money and go somewhere else right on down the road. Maybe to TD Ameritrade and Schwab or something like that.</em> That’s the risk they run right now. I’m not sure there’s been any manipulation. It is just a screenshot. There’s no promise that it will go up. There’s no promise that he will hold it for any length of time. It just happens to be what it appears that he has. If in fact, however, that screenshot is false and he doctored the screenshot to show an amount that he’s holding that he really doesn’t hold, now, I think he could run a follow of the law.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"><strong>Read more</strong>: <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 kuiiXm js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://qz.com/gamestop-etrade-roaring-kitty-keith-gill-morgan-stanley-1851517766",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://qz.com/gamestop-etrade-roaring-kitty-keith-gill-morgan-stanley-1851517766" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Roaring Kitty’ could get kicked off E*Trade for GameStop stock manipulation</a></span></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"><strong>AM: E*Trade’s concern is that it’s a manipulation of reality and therefore pushing people into a particular stock.</strong></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"><strong>DD:</strong> Yeah, exactly. So I think Roaring Kitty has potential liability if, in fact, that’s not what he owns. Even though he purports to say he owns it, if it is what he says, and therefore it’s a factual screenshot. I’m not quite sure what the problem is. It’s like, you know, a mutual fund saying we have now accumulated a certain number of shares of Nvidia. It’s just a fact, right? From E*Trade’s point of view, if they are providing a platform for someone who is making non-factual statements on social media, that’s gotta make them uncomfortable. Because people, when they start suing, if things don’t work out, they’ll sue Roaring Kitty. But they also may sue the E*Trade saying they were in a conspiracy. They saw what Roaring Kitty said was in his platform, E*Trade has his account. It wasn’t the same. So maybe they were a party to the whole pulling the wool over people’s eyes.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"><strong>AM: I see. So if you’re Roaring Kitty, you’re saying, take the money now, get out. Too many people are mad.</strong></p><p class="sc-166b7vj-0 eEDRKr js_ymal-below-post" data-vtas-click="inner:Recommendation:ymal-below-post"></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"><strong>DD:</strong> Well, absolutely. It appeared earlier this week that he made a fortune, for example, on Monday. The stock price was up 21% and he got over what, $290 million of GameStop in his account because they also held calls, which are gonna go up much faster than the underlying stock. So to me, if you could pocket 290 million, go for it.</p></div></div>

            CEO pay is closely related to the fate of the stock market. Although most CEOs earn a salary and get perks, most of their total compensation is typically from stock rewards.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clx0juz7d000f3b6jgxu0vts2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Stock awards made up about 70% of total compensation last year, according to the Equilar study.
    </p>

            Given the rising stock market, the median stock award increased by 10.7% to $9.4 million, the report found.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clx0juz7d000h3b6j51d328wr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Last year, the S&amp;P 500 soared 24% as investors breathed a sigh of relief that the economy did not plunge into a recession and looked forward to potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The Nasdaq surged by 43% last year, powered by the artificial intelligence boom.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clx0juz7d000i3b6jyn4x4f4p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Even though the stubborn inflation has prevented the Fed from lowering rates so far this year, the S&amp;P 500 has climbed another 11% since the start of the year to all-time highs. That suggests CEO pay packages could get even bigger this year.
    </p>

            No CEO in the S&amp;P 500 came close to the total pay of Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, who raked in $161.8 million last year.

            Tan’s massive payday was fueled almost entirely by stock awards after Broadcom’s share price nearly doubled last year. The Broadcom CEO’s compensation doubled in 2023, leaving him <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/broadcom-ceo-compensation-more-than-doubles-1618-mln-2023-2024-02-27/" target="_blank">with 510 times the median salary</a> of employees at the company.

            The next-closest CEO in terms of pay last year was FICO CEO William Lansing, according to Equilar. Lansing’s total compensation hit $66.3 million last year.

            Apple CEO Tim Cook was the third-highest paid CEO in the S&amp;P 500, raking in $63.2 million last year, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000130817924000010/laapl2024_def14a.pdf" target="_blank">672 times that of the median Apple employee’s</a> pay of $94,118.

            The pay gap is even starker at some companies that rely on hourly, part-time workers.

            For instance, Barbara Rentler, the CEO of clothing retailer Ross Stores, received $18.1 million in total compensation last year. The median Ross employee — a part-time hourly retail store associate — made $8,618. That means Rentler made 2,100 times as much as her median employee.

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk confirmed he diverted artificial intelligence chips away from Tesla Inc. to his X Corp. and xAI Corp. ventures, offering explanations both for the redirected shipment and internal Nvidia Corp. emails casting doubt on the carmaker’s procurement plans.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>In a series of posts Tuesday on X, Musk wrote that Tesla had no place to put Nvidia chips where they could be turned on. CNBC reported earlier that the billionaire redirected 12,000 of the chipmaker’s H100 graphics processing units originally slated for Tesla to X instead, citing an Nvidia memo from December.</p><p>In another email CNBC viewed from late April, Nvidia staff said Musk made statements during the automaker’s first-quarter earnings call and on X that conflicted with the company’s bookings with the chipmaker.</p><p>The Tesla chief executive officer said during the April 23 earnings call that roughly 35,000 of the company’s H100s were active, and he expected the electric-vehicle maker to have around 85,000 working by year-end. On April 28, he wrote on X that Tesla will spend around $10 billion this year on AI.</p><p>Listen and subscribe to Elon, Inc. on Apple, Spotify, iHeart and the Bloomberg Terminal.</p><p>Musk suggested in one of his posts Tuesday that Nvidia wouldn’t be able to track all the money Tesla is spending on AI this year, writing that about half of its expenditures will be internal. The company is working on its own supercomputer as part of broader efforts to develop self-driving technology. It also procures sensors for all of its cars, regardless of whether consumers pay extra for its more advanced driver-assistance system.</p><p>“My current best guess for Nvidia purchases by Tesla are $3B to $4B this year,” Musk wrote.</p><p>Following CNBC’s report, Tesla shares erased gains in early trading and fell as much as 1.3% after the open. The stock has dropped about 30% this year.</p><p>Musk’s plans for developing AI within Tesla have come under greater scrutiny since he threatened in January to take that work elsewhere unless he’s awarded around 25% voting control of the EV maker. Weeks after making that demand, a Delaware court voided the compensation package that would have awarded him tens of billions of dollars worth of stock options and boosted his stake in the carmaker. Tesla shareholders will vote on the pay deal again at its June 13 annual meeting.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Musk ordered up Tesla’s biggest-ever layoffs earlier this year and is staking its future on self-driving vehicle development. While the idea of offering an autonomous taxi service has been kicking around the company for at least eight years, Tesla has yet to stand up much of the infrastructure it would need, nor has it secured regulatory approval to test robotaxis on public roads.</p><p>The billionaire acquired X, the company formerly known as Twitter, for $44 billion in late 2022 and founded xAI the following year. The two companies are closely linked, with Musk having said late last year that investors in X will own 25% of xAI. The latter company announced last month that it had raised $6 billion.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

We have been in contact with One Cedar Valley, a local agency supporting employees through this transition by offering career and support services."</em></p><p>State Senator for District 30, Eric Giddens also giving the newsroom a statement. In it he said:</p><p><em>"My thoughts are with our friends and neighbors throughout the Cedar Valley affected by this most recent round of layoffs at John Deere Waterloo Works. These men and women are facing the unthinkable: losing their livelihoods. Their hard work and service have propped our community for years. The state needs to help them access unemployment and other job services to get back on their feet."</em></p><p>Iowa's Second Congressional District Representative Ashley Hinson issued a statement saying:</p><p><em>“My heart goes out to those impacted by these layoffs and I understand how stressful it is for families to receive this news while the cost of living continues to increase. I encourage those impacted to reach out to IowaWorks or any of the great local organizations that assist job seekers.”  </em></p><p>Senator Chuck Grassley releasing a statement to KWWL, stating:</p><p><em>“Behind every one of these job cuts is an Iowa family left hurting. I hope to see these jobs return to Iowa soon and in the meantime, I hope another Iowa employer is able to utilize these hardworking and skilled employees. Current economic factors are forcing farmers to operate on a shoestring budget, making large machinery purchases extremely financially challenging. I’ll keep fighting for an improved safety net for our farmers.”</em></p><p>We have reached out to John Deere representatives for comment and have not heard back. </p><p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"></p>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. agreed to sell a stake in a venture that controls a plant in Ireland to Apollo Global Management Inc. for $11 billion, helping bring in more external funding for a massive expansion of its factory network.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>Under terms of the deal, the investment firm will take a 49% share of a joint venture that operates Intel’s Fab 34, the chipmaker said in a statement Tuesday. It’s the second such investment program that Intel has announced, part of an effort to lessen the burden on its already-stretched finances.</p><p>Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger is pushing an ambitious and expensive plan to return Intel to the summit of the semiconductor industry. He’s investing heavily to revitalize its struggling product lineup and pouring money into plants around the world, aiming to reinvigorate its manufacturing and attract external outsourced-manufacturing customers.</p><p>Intel, once the richest company in the semiconductor industry, has been forced to seek external funding in a program it’s dubbed “Smart Capital.”</p><p>“The announcement highlights Intel’s continued progress in its transformation strategy,” the company said in the statement. “The company continues to advance to create financial flexibility and accelerate its strategy, including investing in global manufacturing operations, while maintaining a strong balance sheet.”</p><p>Intel said that construction of the plant, on an existing company site in Leixlip near Dublin, is “largely complete.” The transaction, which allows Intel to invest its money elsewhere, will be completed in the second quarter of 2024. Fab 34 will use Intel’s 4 and 3 manufacturing technologies.</p><p>Under the terms of the agreement, Intel will buy a minimum amount of the output of the factory to sell itself or on behalf of customers. The chipmaker will give preference to the plant over others in its network when choosing where production is handled, the agreement states. Construction will be largely complete by June.</p><p>In 2022, Intel announced a deal with Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP to secure a $15 billion commitment to help finance a semiconductor complex in Arizona.</p><p>That deal helped ease fears that Gelsinger’s revival plan would prove too costly. A string of weak earnings results — along with the loss of market share to rivals such as Nvidia Corp. — have renewed those concerns and weighed on Intel’s stock.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>The shares, which fell less than 1% at $30.03 in New York trading Tuesday, are the worst-performing member of the Philadelphia Stock Market Semiconductor Index.

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. reported revenue that beat analysts’ estimates on a big jump in sales of servers built to handle artificial intelligence work. The shares gained 17% in extended trading.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>Fiscal second-quarter revenue increased 3.3% to $7.2 billion, the company said Tuesday in a statement. Wall Street projected a 2% decline year over year to $6.82 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, was 42 cents per share in the period ended April 30. Analysts, on average, estimated 39 cents.</p><p>The strong performance was due to the company’s server business, which generated revenue of $3.87 billion. Analysts, on average, estimated $3.45 billion. Sales of AI-oriented systems doubled from the first quarter to more than $900 million, the company said. Increased demand and better availability of high-powered semiconductors from Nvidia Corp. led to the increase in AI systems sales, Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri said in an interview.</p><p>The shares rose to a high of $20.90 in extended trading after closing at $17.60 in New York. While server peers Dell Technologies Inc., and Super Micro Computer Inc. have seen share jumps this year of 77% and 171%, respectively, due to their AI-server businesses, HPE stock has increased just 3.7%.</p><p>“I think the market will start waking up about this,” Neri said of HPE’s AI server business. “I think after today’s announcement, they will understand even more.”</p><p>HPE’s current backlog for AI systems is now $3.1 billion, Chief Financial Officer Marie Myers said on a conference call after the results were released. Dell said last week its AI server backlog was $3.8 billion.</p><p>Sales will be $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion in the period ending in July, the company said. Analysts, on average, projected $7.45 billion. Profit, excluding some items, will be 43 cents to 48 cents a share, compared with an estimate of 46 cents.</p><p>For the fiscal year, HPE raised its revenue outlook to a gain of 1% to 3%, from a previous forecast of flat to 2% growth. The company said profit will be about $1.90 per share at the mid-point of its range, compared with a February forecast of about $1.87 per share.</p><p>“The AI-server ramp-up is finally materializing,” wrote Woo Jin Ho, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Still, the full-year forecast is underwhelming given the increased AI business, suggesting other business lines, such as networking, are dragging down the results, he said.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>HPE’s Intelligent Edge, which includes the networking business, reported $1.09 billion in revenue in the second quarter, compared with the average estimate of $1.25 billion. In January, HPE agreed to buy Juniper Networks Inc. for $14 billion in a move that will boost its networking offering. Neri said he expects improvement in customer demand as the year goes on.</p><p>(Updates with server backlog in the sixth paragraph.)</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>A recent poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago found that nearly half of Americans (47%) said they are not likely to purchase an electric vehicle (EV) for their next vehicle.</li>
<li>Only 19% of respondents said they were either "very" or "extremely" likely to buy an EV for their next car purchase, and another 22% said they were "somewhat likely" to do so.</li>
<li>The majority of U.S. adults (6 in 10) cited high prices as the major reason they would not buy an EV, and 25% cited cost as a minor reason.</li>
<li>The average price of a new EV is $58,000, which is out of reach for many Americans' budgets, while the average vehicle sold in the U.S. is under $46,000.</li>
<li>Despite efforts by the Biden administration to promote the adoption of EVs, including tax incentives, many Americans are still hesitant to make the switch to an electric vehicle.</li>
