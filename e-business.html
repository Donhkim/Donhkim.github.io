<p>China and the European Union will consult on the latter's investigation into Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) after preliminary tariffs are announced.</p>
<p>On June 22, China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao was invited to hold a video talk with Valdis Dombrovskis, executive vice president of the European Commission.</p>

<p>The two sides agreed to initiate consultations on the EU's anti-subsidy investigation case against China's EVs, according to a brief statement on China's Ministry of Commerce <a href="http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/article/xwfb/xwbldhd/202406/20240603518157.shtml">website</a>.</p>
<p>On June 12, the European Commission pre-disclosed the <a href="https://cnevpost.com/2024/06/12/eu-to-impose-additional-tariffs-on-chinese-evs/">level of provisional anti-subsidy duties</a> to be imposed on imports of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from China.</p>
<p>If discussions with the Chinese authorities do not lead to an effective solution, these provisional anti-subsidy duties will be introduced from July 4, according to the European Commission's statement at the time.</p>
<p>The final measures should be implemented within four months of the imposition of the provisional duties, according to the European Commission's statement.</p>
<p>Following the release of the EU's statement, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce said that China is highly concerned and strongly dissatisfied, and that China's industry is deeply disappointed and resolutely opposed to this.</p>
<p>China urges the EU to immediately correct its wrong practices and properly handle economic and trade frictions through dialog and consultation, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The EU originally imposed a 10 percent tariff on BEVs imported from China, and in the newly announced provisional tariffs, different car companies face different rates.</p>
<p><a href="https://cnevpost.com/byd/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="">BYD</a>, Geely and SAIC, which were sampled and cooperated with the investigation, will be subject to additional tariffs of 17.4 percent, 20 percent and 38.1 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Other Chinese BEV producers that cooperated in the investigation but have not been sampled will pay a weighted average duty of 21 percent, with <a href="https://cnevpost.com/nio/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="">Nio</a> (NYSE: NIO) and <a href="https://cnevpost.com/xpeng/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="">Xpeng</a> (NYSE: XPEV) falling into this category.</p>
<p>All other BEV producers in China which did not cooperate in the investigation would be subject to 38.1 percent residual duty.</p>

<ol>
<li>Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, was one of the few voices on Wall Street who predicted a stock market surge in 2022, contrary to widespread expectations of a recession.</li>
<li>Lee's prediction proved accurate, and his call was deemed the most accurate among forecasters surveyed by Bloomberg in 2023.</li>

<li>Lee has now made a longer-term forecast, predicting that the S&amp;P 500 could hit 15,000 by the end of the decade, representing an upside of over 170%.</li>

    <div><p>Fundstrat Global Advisors cofounder Tom Lee was among the few voices on Wall Street last year who predicted a <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/06/13/wall-street-bull-says-economy-expansion-not-recession-tom-lee/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/06/13/wall-street-bull-says-economy-expansion-not-recession-tom-lee/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2023/06/13/wall-street-bull-says-economy-expansion-not-recession-tom-lee/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">stock market surge</a> while most of his peers saw a slump amid widespread expectations for a recession.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>But he—and the U.S. economy—proved the doomsayers wrong. In fact, among the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-20/wall-street-bulls-outperformed-the-likes-of-wilson-kolanovic-in-2023" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-20/wall-street-bulls-outperformed-the-likes-of-wilson-kolanovic-in-2023" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-20/wall-street-bulls-outperformed-the-likes-of-wilson-kolanovic-in-2023" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">forecasters surveyed by Bloomberg</a>, Lee’s call in 2023 turned out to be <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/12/15/small-cap-stocks-could-rise-50-percent-next-year-tom-lee-fundstrat/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/12/15/small-cap-stocks-could-rise-50-percent-next-year-tom-lee-fundstrat/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2023/12/15/small-cap-stocks-could-rise-50-percent-next-year-tom-lee-fundstrat/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">the most accurate</a>. </p>



<p>And this year, he’s still calling his shots and nailing them. In early June, he said the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/04/fundstrats-tom-lee-sp-500-will-rise-4-percent-to-5500-by-the-end-of-june.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/04/fundstrats-tom-lee-sp-500-will-rise-4-percent-to-5500-by-the-end-of-june.html" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/04/fundstrats-tom-lee-sp-500-will-rise-4-percent-to-5500-by-the-end-of-june.html" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">S&amp;P 500 would hit 5,500</a> by the end of the month. As of Friday’s close, it was at 5,464.62. </p>



<p>Now, he’s got a longer-term forecast, and it’s a whopper: by the end of this decade, Lee said the S&amp;P 500 could hit 15,000, representing upside of more than 170%.</p>



<p>On a recent episode of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2024-06-21/odd-lots-tom-lee-says-s-p-could-hit-15-000-by-2030-podcast?srnd=homepage-asia" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2024-06-21/odd-lots-tom-lee-says-s-p-could-hit-15-000-by-2030-podcast?srnd=homepage-asia" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2024-06-21/odd-lots-tom-lee-says-s-p-could-hit-15-000-by-2030-podcast?srnd=homepage-asia" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Bloomberg’s <em>Odd Lots</em> podcast</a>, which was recorded on Tuesday, he began by explaining his evidence-based approach to forecasting, which looks across history and across assets. He said the bond market is smarter than the stock market: “That’s why they say equities are the land of C students.”</p><p></p>



<p>He also believes investors can’t fight the Federal Reserve and focuses more on themes that will drive growth, such as how millennials are reshaping the economy, the global labor shortage that will boost AI and tech stocks, as well as energy security and cybersecurity. By picking the strongest stocks within each theme, he has outperformed the market every year since 2019, Lee said.</p>



<p>Wall Street typically underestimates the impact of new technologies, which are usually adopted first by younger people in their teens and 20s while most top investment professionals are in their 40s and 50s, he added, noting that cell phones were initially dismissed as toys for the rich. Something similar is happening with AI.</p>



<p>“The adoption rate of AI is staggering, but the use case is important because there’s a labor shortage,” Lee said. “So to me, I think it’s very likely we’re underestimating how much revenue all these companies will make.”</p>



<p>And as the demand for workers continues to outstrip supply, AI will become more critical. By end of decade, he estimated the global labor shortage will be equivalent to 40 million workers, or about $3 trillion worth of wages. Considering that most of automation is from hardware like semiconductors, that means whoever is supplying the chips might have $2 trillion in revenue, he explained.</p>



<p>Eventually, technology will represent 40%-50% of global stock market weighting, up from about 20% today, Lee said.  </p><p></p>



<p>“In a normalized world, if this is a normal S&amp;P cycle following demographics, I could provide a chart later, S&amp;P should be potentially 15,000 by the end of the decade,” he said. “As you move into longer timeframes, that’s probably where I think we’re moving towards.”</p>



<p>The stock market is already heavily concentrated on tech and AI stocks, with <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/nvidia-stock-valuation-nvda-sp500-returns-market-capitalization-risk-investors/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/nvidia-stock-valuation-nvda-sp500-returns-market-capitalization-risk-investors/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/nvidia-stock-valuation-nvda-sp500-returns-market-capitalization-risk-investors/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Nvidia alone accounting for more than a third of the S&amp;P 500’s gains</a> this year. Meanwhile, Wall Street is scrambling to keep up with the market’s relentless rally, with <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/stock-market-outlook-wall-street-forecasters-sp500-year-end-targets/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/stock-market-outlook-wall-street-forecasters-sp500-year-end-targets/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/stock-market-outlook-wall-street-forecasters-sp500-year-end-targets/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">more analysts raising their year-end targets</a>.</p>



<p>Such bullishness and market concentration have raised concerns that the AI hype is a sign of a bubble about to pop. But Lee downplayed those worries, pointing to key differences between earlier bubbles like the dot-com boom and bust. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>He noted that <a href="https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Nvidia</a> has a much steeper competitive advantage than Cisco did during the early stages of the internet boom. And unlike the dot-com bubble, there is a lack of overly hyped IPOs today, he added.</p>



<p>Lee isn’t the only Wall Street bull making bold predictions. Ed Yardeni has been pounding the table about another “Roaring 20s” super-cycle and has said the <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/12/11/stock-market-forecast-2024-ed-yardeni-roaring-2020s/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/12/11/stock-market-forecast-2024-ed-yardeni-roaring-2020s/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2023/12/11/stock-market-forecast-2024-ed-yardeni-roaring-2020s/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">S&amp;P 500 would jump to 6,000</a> by next year.</p><p></p>



<p>And by the end of the decade, he said the stock index <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-sp500-prediction-8000-bull-rally-ed-yardeni-2024-6" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-sp500-prediction-8000-bull-rally-ed-yardeni-2024-6" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-sp500-prediction-8000-bull-rally-ed-yardeni-2024-6" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">could reach 8,000</a>—not as high as Lee’s estimate but still good enough for a 46% jump.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the Fortune Next to Lead newsletter to get weekly strategies on how to make it to the corner office. </p><a href="https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p> before it launches on June 24, 2024.</p></div></div>

It's also believed that Kaspersky's software lets bad actors install <a href="https://cyberguy.com/apps/worst-malware-security-privacy-breaches-2023/" rel="nofollow"><u>malicious software</u></a> and withhold critical updates.</p><p class="speakable"><a href="https://cyberguy.com/newsletter/" rel="nofollow"><strong><u>GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT’S NEWSLETTER – THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE</u></strong></a></p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Kaspersky conference room (Kaspersky)</span> </p></div></div></div><h2><strong>Why is the US banning Kaspersky?</strong></h2><p>Kaspersky is getting banned in the U.S. after the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) conducted a review of the company’s cybersecurity and anti-virus transactions. BIS notes that the company poses "unacceptable risks to the United States' national security and the security and safety of its people." The main concerns are Kaspersky's connections to Russia, the potential security weaknesses in Kaspersky's products, and the chance that Russia could exploit these weaknesses.</p><p>In an announcement, BIS specifically listed five risks Kaspersky poses to national security. Kaspersky's ties to Russia are a major concern. BIS states that Russia is a foreign adversary that poses ongoing threats to the United States. According to the agency, Kaspersky is under the jurisdiction and control of the Russian government, allowing it access to sensitive information from U.S. customers.</p><p>Other reasons given for the Kaspersky ban include the software's ability to install malware. "Kaspersky software allows for the capability and opportunity to install malicious software and withhold critical updates," says BIS. "The manipulation of Kaspersky software, including in U.S. critical infrastructure, can result in data theft, espionage, and system malfunctions. The products also threaten economic security and public health in the U.S., potentially resulting in injuries or loss of life."</p><p>Kaspersky’s ban in the U.S. shouldn’t come as a surprise since the firm has been on the government’s radar for quite some time. In 2017, the U.S. banned the use of the Moscow-based cybersecurity firm's products across all government agencies.</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Illustration of a bad actor on a computer (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson)</span> </p></div></div></div><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/att-data-leak-from-73-million-customers-what-you-need-to-do-next/" rel="nofollow"><strong><u>AT&amp;T DATA LEAK FROM 73 MILLION CUSTOMERS – WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NEXT</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>Kaspersky’s response to the ban</strong></h2><p>Kaspersky denied Friday that it is a security threat, saying the government had based its decision on the "geopolitical climate and theoretical concerns" rather than independently verifying if there was a risk. The company says it cannot obtain sensitive data on Americans and that its operations and employees in Russia can only access aggregate or statistical data not attributable to a specific person.</p><p>Below is part of the company’s official statement. The full statement can be read on Kaspersky’s website.</p><p>"For over 26 years, Kaspersky has succeeded in its mission of building a safer future by protecting over a billion devices. Kaspersky provides industry-leading products and services to customers around the world to protect them from all types of cyber threats, and has repeatedly demonstrated its independence from any government. Additionally, Kaspersky has implemented significant transparency measures that are unmatched by any of its cybersecurity industry peers to demonstrate its enduring commitment to integrity and trustworthiness. The Department of Commerce’s decision unfairly ignores the evidence."</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>A child working on a computer (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson)</span> </p></div></div></div><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/pharma-giants-data-breach-exposes-patients-sensitive-information/" rel="nofollow"><strong><u>PHARMA GIANT’S DATA BREACH EXPOSES PATIENTS’ SENSITIVE INFORMATION</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>What does this ban mean for you?</strong></h2><p>The Kaspersky ban essentially means you will not be able to purchase its software products, and if you already have one, it will stop working soon. Starting July 20, Kaspersky and any of its partners will not be able to sell or license cybersecurity or antivirus software in the U.S. Resellers who already have the products in stock will be able to sell them, but only until Sept. 29.</p><p>It’s worth noting that while BIS has banned most Kaspersky products, some have been exempted. These include Kaspersky Threat Intelligence products and services, Kaspersky Security Training products and services, and Kaspersky consulting and advisory services.</p><p>Existing Kaspersky customers have until Sept. 29 to find an alternative, as the company will no longer be able to provide antivirus signature updates after this date.</p><h2><strong>Which antivirus should you choose now that Kaspersky is banned?</strong></h2><p>Kaspersky's antivirus was widely used, but now that it has been banned, it’s important to look for alternatives. An antivirus is the best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware, which may gain access to your private information. It can also alert you to phishing emails or ransomware scams. <a href="https://cyberguy.com/security/best-antivirus-protection/" rel="nofollow"><strong><u>Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android &amp; iOS devices</u></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/frontier-fallout-as-750k-customers-data-exposed-in-ransomhub-cyberattack/" rel="nofollow"><strong><u>FRONTIER FALLOUT AS 750K CUSTOMERS' DATA EXPOSED IN RANSOMHUB CYBERATTACK </u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>Kurt’s key takeaway</strong></h2><p>The U.S. government raised serious national security concerns regarding Kaspersky's ties to the Russian government. If true, a ban is absolutely necessary. However, Kaspersky maintains it's a private company with no ties to Moscow. It remains unclear whether these claims are credible. One thing's for sure: Kaspersky's absence would leave a significant gap in the cybersecurity market, creating a prime opportunity for competitors to step up.</p><p>Do you believe the concerns about Kaspersky's ties to Russia and potential threats to national security are justified?

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Alaska flight attendants reach tentative agreement on new contract</strong>: The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA has agreed on a "record contract" with Alaska management, which will be presented to the Master Executive Council for a full membership ratification vote.</li>
<li><strong>Contract details not yet released</strong>: The exact terms of the contract are not being disclosed at this time, but the union will release the full text of the agreement after it is voted on by the Master Executive Council.</li>
<li><strong>No strike imminent</strong>: Although Alaska flight attendants voted to authorize a strike in February 2024, it appears that management and the union have reached common ground, and a strike is less likely at this time.</li>
<li><strong>Southwest Airlines' contract serves as a precedent</strong>: The article mentions that Southwest Airlines' flight attendants recently ratified a new contract, which included significant wage increases and retroactive pay. This may serve as a model for Alaska flight attendants' new contract.</li>
<li><strong>Flight attendants at many US airlines seeking new contracts</strong>: The article notes that many US airlines are in the process of negotiating new contracts with their flight attendants, who have not had pay increases since before the pandemic.</li>

<p>At the moment, we’re seeing flight attendants at most major US airlines trying to ratify new contracts (except at Delta, where flight attendants aren’t unionized). Flight attendants largely haven’t had pay increases since before the pandemic, and are looking for significant raises, to reflect the inflation we’ve seen in recent years.</p>



<p>Back in April, Southwest flight attendants <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/news/southwest-airlines-flight-attendant-contract/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became the first to ratify a new contract</a>, and it’s probably the richest flight attendant contract we’ve ever seen, in terms of wage increases, retroactive pay, and more.</p>



<p>There’s now a positive update for another US airline, as Alaska flight attendants now have a tentative agreement on a new contract, which should help with labor relations at the Seattle-based oneworld carrier.</p>

<p>The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents Alaska’s flight attendants, has just announced that it has reached a tentative agreement with Alaska management for a “record contract.”</p>







<p>The union describes this tentative agreement as having been reached with the help of the National Mediation Board (NMB). Over the past week, negotiations took place in Washington, with AFA International President Sara Nelson and AFA General Counsel in attendance, along with Alaska Chief Operating Officer Constance von Muehlen.</p>



<p>Exact details of the contract aren’t yet being released. The union states that in the coming days, both parties will “work to clean up the contract language to present the full text of the TA to the Master Executive Council.” The Master Executive Council will then vote to release the agreement for a full membership ratification vote. </p>





<p>Back in February 2024, Alaska flight attendants voted to authorize a strike, with 99.48% of participants voting in favor of a strike (and 93.47% of flight attendants participating in the vote). So it’s good to see that there’s finally some common ground between management and the union.</p>



<p>However, I wouldn’t assume it’s a given that the membership will necessarily ratify the new contract. For example, Southwest flight attendants rejected the first tentative agreement they were presented by the union during their negotiations, and only ratified the second agreement, after additional improvements.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-i-m-curious-how-lucrative-this-contract-is"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="im_curious_how_lucrative_this_contract_is" ez-toc-data-id="#im_curious_how_lucrative_this_contract_is"></span>I’m curious how lucrative this contract is<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>It’s interesting how the union is referring to the tentative agreement as a “record contract.” Is that suggesting that this is the most lucrative contract that has been negotiated in the entire industry so far, or just a record for the airline (which seems like it would be a given)?</p>



<p>The reason I ask is because historically Alaska hasn’t exactly had the best pay in the industry. The airline has paid much better than ultra low cost carriers, but not consistently to the same level as carriers like Southwest.</p>



<p>Southwest flight attendants have ratified a new contract whereby they get immediate 22% pay increases, and 3% pay increases in each of 2025, 2026, and 2027. On top of that, they received retro pay, which comes out to around $18K per flight attendant. Does that mean Alaska flight attendants are getting contracts that are even more lucrative?</p>



<p>With a second carrier now nearing a new contract, this should also <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/news/american-flight-attendants-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help American flight attendants</a> with getting a new contract, as American has had the most hostile negotiations on a new contract.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Alaska-737-MAX-8-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-284781"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">I’m curious how lucrative this new contract is</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bottom-line"><span class="ez-toc-section" id="bottom_line" ez-toc-data-id="#bottom_line"></span>Bottom line<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>



<p>The union representing Alaska flight attendants has announced that a tentative agreement has been reached for a new “record contract.” The details are expected to be released in the coming days, so it’ll be interesting to see the details.</p>



<p>It’s great news that flight attendants at a second US airline are nearing a new contract, as it should help with this cycle of negotiations, providing stability to passengers (though perhaps a little less stability to the bottom line of airlines). </p>



<p><strong>What do you make of Alaska flight attendants getting a tentative agreement on a new contract?</strong></p>

<li><strong>Wealth transfer</strong>: By 2033, over $31 trillion will be transferred from individuals worth $5 million or more to their heirs worldwide, with Generation X expected to receive most of this wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Generation X inherits first</strong>: Contrary to expectations, a recent report by Wealth-X suggests that Generation X (born 1961-1981) will inherit wealth from their parents before Millennials (born 1981-1996) and Generation Z (born 1997-2012).</li>

<li><strong>Total wealth transfer</strong>: By 2045, up to $90 trillion is expected to be transferred between generations in the US alone, with the Great Wealth Transfer making the next 20 years a significant period of wealth redistribution.</li>

<p>By 2033, 1.2 million individuals worldwide worth $5 million or more are going to pass on more than $31 trillion to their inheritors, according to <a href="https://wealthx.com/reports/family-wealth-transfer-2024" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://wealthx.com/reports/family-wealth-transfer-2024" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">a recent report by Wealth-X</a>, a company that provides research and data on the world’s wealthy. Individuals worth $100 million or more—of which there are fewer than 40,000 globally—are expected to pass on almost half of that wealth. And most of it is going to Generation X. </p>



<p>Over the last few years, millennials have emerged as the projected winners of the much-lauded  Great Wealth Transfer, in which older generations, mostly baby Boomers, are expected to hand over tens of trillions of dollars in wealth. (By 2045, $84 to $90 trillion is expected to be transferred between generations in the U.S. alone.) In the next 20 years, the shift in assets will make people born between 1981 and 1996 the richest generation in history, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/29/america-wealthest-one-percent-minimum-millennials-richest-generation/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/29/america-wealthest-one-percent-minimum-millennials-richest-generation/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">according to a 2024 report from Knight Frank</a>, making millennials five times richer in 2030 than they were at the start of the 2020s.</p>



<p>But the new report by Wealth-X suggests that the youth will have to wait a little longer. At least in the short term, the heirs to the wealth of the rich and ultra rich will actually be those aged 44 to 59. In North America alone, the sum of the fortunes coming down from wealthy donors will surpass $14 billion.</p>



<p>“Much is often made in the media of millennial and Generation Z heirs but, in fact, Generation X will be first in line to inherit from their wealthy parents,” the report said. “Millennials and the younger Gen Z, for now, are more likely to receive sums as grandchildren, which will often be less substantial.”</p><p></p>



<p>On balance, Gen X has been perceived as getting the short end of the financial stick. Gen Xers, also referred to as the “sandwich” generation—having to simultaneously provide financial security for themselves, their children and their parents—are significantly less likely to feel secure in their ability to meet their retirement goals compared to their younger and older relatives, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/gen-x-retirement-anxiety-more-worried-than-baby-boomers/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/gen-x-retirement-anxiety-more-worried-than-baby-boomers/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">according to a report by Schroders</a>. </p>



<p>In addition, unlike baby boomers, the vast majority of Gen Xers will be relying on 401(k) plans, rather than pensions, once they retire, meaning they’re more responsible for their savings than the post war generation. </p>



<p>But even though the new findings suggest there is a trove of wealth waiting for Generation X in the coming decade, that inheritance may not be equally spread out.</p>



<p>As of 2023, it took <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/16/us-one-percent-net-worth-monaco-switzerland-australia/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/05/16/us-one-percent-net-worth-monaco-switzerland-australia/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">a $5 million fortune to join the ranks of the 1% in the U.S.</a>—the minimum threshold for those passing on their wealth in the Wealth-X report. What’s more, Gen X has the largest wealth gap of any current generation. While the top 25% of earners in the generation have $250,000 saved toward retirement, the bottom quartile has just $35,000 saved, according to <a href="https://www.nirsonline.org/2023/07/new-report-finds-alarming-retirement-outlook-for-generation-x-3/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.nirsonline.org/2023/07/new-report-finds-alarming-retirement-outlook-for-generation-x-3/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">a report by the National Institute on Retirement Security</a>.</p>



<p>Still, the massive transfer of resources coming from the aging wealthy elite will have major implications for wealth managers, philanthropies and other organizations handling the newly inherited money, Wealth-X reports. Generation X, and their younger peers, are more motivated by technological, environment and social issues than previous generations of investors.</p><p></p>



<p>“The younger generations are very focused on charity and foundations,” D’Arcy Fellona, client success manager at Altrata, said in the report. “This doesn’t necessarily imply larger donations, but there is certainly stronger engagement and an interest in wanting to be more involved with the work of organizations and seeing their impact over time.”</p></div></div>

    <div><div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"><p>The head of NJ Transit said he’s holding Amtrak’s “feet to the fire” to ensure the <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nj-transit-and-amtrak-commuters-face-transit-meltdown-for-the-second-time-this-week" rel="noopener" target="_blank">week’s brutal train delays</a> don't plague riders all summer — even as the two agencies trade blame over some of the problems.</p><p>On Friday, <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/service-suspensions-at-nys-penn-station-snarl-commutes-yet-again" rel="noopener" target="_blank">service in and out of New York Penn Station was stopped for hours</a> during the peak morning commute and Midtown Direct trains were temporarily diverted to Hoboken. It was the <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nj-transit-and-amtrak-commuters-face-transit-meltdown-for-the-second-time-this-week" rel="noopener" target="_blank">third time that commuters were left stranded</a> and frustrated this week as a <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/city-to-open-45-schools-as-cooling-centers-to-replace-closed-libraries" rel="noopener" target="_blank">heat wave kicked off</a> the summer season and sent temperatures into the high 90s.</p><p>“Our riders, they don't care whose fault it is at the end of the day," NJ Transit CEO Kevin Corbett said. "They buy a ticket. They want to go from A to B. They want to get to work on time. They want to get home or get to their kids’ game on time, and they don't care if it's us or Amtrak."</p><p>NJ Transit uses Amtrak's Northeast Corridor tracks in the northern part of the state. Corbett estimated that 60% of NJ Transit trains travel along the corridor for at least some of their runs. Amtrak has taken some of the blame but the agency <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/transportation/2024/06/19/summer-delays-for-riders-nj-transit-amtrak-plan-repairs-northeast-corridor/74072161007/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently told Gov. Phil Murphy</a> that it also believed some issues were due to NJ Transit trains’ pantograph — an apparatus that distributes power atop the train — getting snarled in Amtrak’s overhead wires.</p><p>In alerts on Friday morning, NJ Transit blamed overhead wire issues for the hours-long service interruptions. Amtrak alerts describing Amtrak's own delays and cancelations pointed to a disabled commuter train in New York. But <a href="http://nj.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NJ Transit said in a statement</a> that the train was “inspected thoroughly” before leaving Newark and no problems were found, including with its pantograph.</p><p>In a statement on Friday, Amtrak President Roger Harris apologized to customers for this week's service delays in the New York area, which he attributed to "a unique combination of events."</p><p>"While we are still investigating the root cause of each delay, we do know that, yesterday, a circuit breaker powering our trains experienced a catastrophic failure on one of the hottest days of the year and a serious brush fire also came close to our tracks," Harris said. "Additionally, we are working with our partners at NJ Transit to understand and address recent disruptions associated with NJT trains operating on Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor infrastructure, which appears unique to the equipment and area. We have established a joint team with NJT to identify the source of this damage and implement improvements."</p><p>Corbett said NJ Transit runs 700 train trips a day on 500 miles of track and most of the issues happen on a 10-mile stretch between Newark and New York. That section is owned and maintained by Amtrak.</p><p>He said the root issue is aging infrastructure on 100-year-old train lines that haven’t received the sort of investment needed to keep up with modern usage.</p><p>"Amtrak tries to do the best they can, and they <a href="https://media.amtrak.com/2023/11/president-biden-announces-16-4b-for-northeast-corridor-projects-at-amtraks-bear-maintenance-facility/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now have some real money to start doing that</a>, but there's a long litany of challenges on the infrastructure, particularly between Newark and New York Penn Station," Corbett said.</p><p>Until the system receives much-needed investment planned under the Gateway Tunnel Project — which will build a second tunnel under the Hudson River for Amtrak and NJ Transit — the transit agencies need to find short-term fixes, Corbett added. The Gateway project isn’t expected to be completed for another decade.</p><p>“We can maintain our system," said Corbett. "I know on our system, we have a high level of confidence. We want to work with [Amtrak]. We've offered them our equipment, our expertise to help them if they need it. But there are a number of issues. It's not one silver bullet that can solve this.”</p><p>Tom Wright, head of the <a href="https://rpa.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Regional Planning Association</a>, a policy advocacy organization for the tri-state area, said Amtrak and NJ Transit have generally worked well together on projects like Gateway. But he said the problems facing the rail services come down to “decades of underinvestment,” and cited then-Gov. Chris Christie’s 2010 decision to cancel the ARC Tunnel project, a predecessor to Gateway that would have built a new tunnel under the Hudson River.</p><p>“The problem with these kind of complex large systems is that it takes a long time to turn around decisions, bad decisions that were made in the past,” Wright said. That’s left the infrastructure that both NJ Transit and Amtrak depend upon intensely vulnerable, he added.</p><p>“What we’ve seen this week is that the system is only as strong as its weakest link,” said Wright. “Things like extreme heat — and we may have big storms coming this fall — all of them can disrupt different parts of the system. Whether it’s a signal going out, a stalled train, catenary issues, lightning strike, a fire, any one of those things can really disrupt the system.”</p><p>Travel into and out of New York Penn Station was also slowed on Tuesday by a disabled train, and commuters were stranded on Thursday due to power problems. Along with Friday's disruptions, they’re the latest in a series of problems since May 22, when service suspensions resulted in hours of delays during the evening commute that caused issues into the next morning.</p><p>In response to the May incident, Gov. Murphy sent a letter to Amtrak asking to meet, and both Amtrak and NJ Transit have pledged to communicate and collaborate better. Earlier this month, the rail services said they would create new protocols for sharing information and coordinate service adjustments more efficiently to facilitate repairs and other maintenance. But Murphy <a href="https://www.thirteen.org/programs/nj-spotlight-news/nj-transit-summer-meltdown-1718821319/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said this week</a> that the continued problems were “unacceptable” and pledged to look into them further.</p><p>“We've told them we're prepared to give more, alter our schedule to give them bigger windows to be able to make the necessary repairs,” NJ Transit's Corbett said on Friday. “Let’s put the BS aside, get everyone together in the same room.”</p><p>Another potential issue looms for NJ Transit commuters: Even after recently approved fair hikes, the agency is facing a budget deficit that is projected to balloon to $1 billion in the fiscal year starting in July 2025.</p><p>Murphy has <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/to-save-nj-transit-gov-murphy-wants-to-raise-taxes-on-njs-wealthiest-companies" rel="noopener" target="_blank">proposed reinstating a version of a corporate business tax surcharge</a> to provide NJ Transit with a dedicated funding source. He and the New Jersey state Legislature must agree on a budget before July 1.</p><p><i>Sean Carlson and Joseph Capriglione contributed reporting.</i></p></div></div>

<li><strong>Generation Z is being disproportionately affected by the economy</strong>: Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2012, is facing higher costs of living, including rising prices, housing costs, and student loan debt, compared to millennials (born between 1981 and 1996).</li>
<li><strong>Higher housing costs are a significant issue</strong>: Housing costs, in particular, are a major concern for Gen Z, who are struggling to afford homes and apartments due to rising prices and limited housing supply.</li>
<li><strong>Student loan debt is also a major burden</strong>: Gen Z is carrying larger student loan balances than millennials, which is exacerbating their financial struggles.</li>
<li><strong>Debt is a broader issue for Gen Z</strong>: In addition to student loan debt, Gen Z is also accumulating more overall debt than millennials, including credit card debt, personal loans, and other forms of debt.</li>
<li><strong>This could have long-term consequences for Gen Z's financial well-being</strong>: The economic challenges faced by Gen Z could have lasting impacts on their financial stability, ability to save, and overall financial well-being, potentially leading to a generation of Americans who struggle to achieve financial security.</li>

Many struggled to get jobs, particularly following the Great Recession, when the nation’s unemployment rate hovered around 10 percent for over a year. Their wages took a massive hit, too. On average, millennials lost <a href="https://kevinrinz.github.io/recession.pdf" target="_blank">about 13 percent </a>of their earnings between 2007 and 2017, according to economist Kevin Rinz.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KW3UZDWKEJC75AJUSDTHFTP7HY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">By contrast, the recovery since the pandemic has been swift and broad. Unemployment was<b> </b>under 4 percent for the longest stretch in 50 years until May, and younger workers in particular have seen some of the largest pay hikes. Wages for 16-to-24-year-olds have risen 8.6 percent in the past year, compared with an overall gain of 5.2 percent, according to <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker" target="_blank">the Atlanta Fed</a>.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SPEZXSB5CRB7BIKEBOYZLQGS2I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Still, rising prices are dealing an outsize blow to Gen Z. Compared with other age groups, adults under 27 devote more of their spending to basics like housing, dining out, gas and car insurance — all of which have gotten far pricier in recent years, data from Moody’s shows.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R62GNPUCRFGQRJF4NZUTLRQZHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">“We’re at an inflection point: [Gen Z is] coming to age in a time of rising inflation and rising interest rates — and that will stay with them,” said Jimmie Lenz, a financial economics professor at Duke University whose work focuses on generational behavior. “There’s the immediate impact: higher monthly payments on your credit card.

<p>The Stanley cup has become <em>the</em> tumbler to have. It's all over Instagram, loved by celebs and influencers, and definitely worth the splurge if you want to stay on-trend this summer. According to Stanley, the Quencher tumbler has double-wall vacuum insulation and can keep your favorite bevvy cold for up to 11 hours. It's designed to fit in your car's cupholder (a huge plus!) and features a FlowState 3-position lid, so you can sip with or without the included reusable straw and even rotate the silicone cover shut when you're on the go to prevent spills. The large 40-ounce size also means you can easily stay hydrated when you're out and about this summer and beyond. Functionality aside, the Stanley cup is available in plenty of fun colors with this latest Target drop featuring pearly beauty-inspired shades crafted to match your favorite makeup and skincare routine. </p>

<h2>What exactly are the devs up to?</h2>
<p>In the recent developers call, Ethereum developers ironed out details for the upcoming Pectra upgrade to the Ethereum system. Pectra is being rigorously tested on special test versions, called Devnets, before going live.</p>
<p>The next test version, Devnet 1, will introduce two major changes. First, it will implement a more efficient way for validators, the special computers that verify transactions, to work together.</p>
<p>Second, it will introduce a new system called EIP 7702. This system allows users to grant permission to other programs to control their transactions, similar to giving someone a key to your digital wallet.</p>
<p>However, there’s an ongoing debate about how users can take back this permission if needed. Developers are scheduled to meet again to finalize this crucial aspect of EIP 7702.</p>
<p>Beyond the Pectra upgrade, the meeting also covered progress on other Ethereum developments.</p>
<p>For EOF, a separate upgrade focused on data storage, testing of client implementations will begin after finalizing Pectra changes.</p>
<p>The EOF team will provide more tests to aid development. Additionally, EOF meetings have shifted to bi-weekly as specifications are finalized.</p>
<p>For PeerDAS, another independent upgrade enhancing validator communication, the next testnet launch is expected within two weeks. Unlike Pectra, PeerDAS will use finalized Dencun specifications.</p>
<p>The meeting also included announcements. A new standardized format for writing improvement proposals was suggested to ensure better reviews.</p>
<p>Notably, a new GitHub resource page “eth-clients” was introduced for Ethereum developers.</p>
<h2>ETH remains stable</h2>
<p>At press time, ETH was trading at $3,494.20, with its price had grown by 0.12% in the last 24 hours. Retail interest in ETH was rising.</p>

<hr>
<p>Accumulation by addresses ranging from the 0.001 to 10 cohort collected large amounts of ETH over the last few days. Whales did not show similar interest in ETH and were letting their holdings go.</p>
<p>Even though this selling pressure is being absorbed by retail investors, a reversal in whale sentiment would be required for ETH to see green again.</p>

		    <h2><strong><span>All of these Treasury securities have been sold. So here are the holders.</span></strong></h2>

<p>The US national debt – now $34.7 trillion, up from $23.3 trillion in January 2020, and from $27.6 trillion in January 2021 – has spiked so fast that it would make our eyes water with disbelief, if we didn’t know better. Over the four years and five months since January 2020, it has spiked by $11.4 trillion. Since the pandemic trough, the economy has been growing rapidly, yet trillions were flying by so fast it’s hard to see them. We don’t even want to imagine what this will look like during the next recession.</p>
<p>But every single one of the Treasury securities that the government issued was bought, and we’ll get to the holders in a moment:</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-96545" src="https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/US-gross-national-debt-2024-06-22.png" alt="" srcset="https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/US-gross-national-debt-2024-06-22.png 978w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/US-gross-national-debt-2024-06-22-560x464.png 560w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/US-gross-national-debt-2024-06-22-768x637.png 768w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/US-gross-national-debt-2024-06-22-260x216.png 260w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/US-gross-national-debt-2024-06-22-160x133.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px"></p>
<h3><strong>Who holds this $34.7 trillion in debt?</strong></h3>
<p>Every single one of these Treasury securities is held by some entity or individual. So here they are.</p>
<p><strong>US Government funds: $7.1 trillion.</strong> Held by various US government pension funds and by the Social Security Trust Fund (we discussed the <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2023/10/23/social-security-update-trust-fund-income-outgo-and-deficit-in-fiscal-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SS Trust Fund holdings, income, and outgo here</a>). These Treasury securities are not traded in the market, but are purchased directly by the funds from the Treasury Department, and at maturity are redeemed at face value. They’re called, “held internally,” and are not subject to the yield-whims of the markets.</p>
<p>The remainder amounts to $27.6 trillion currently, they’re the securities “held by the public.”</p>
<p>A small portion of these $27.6 trillion in securities cannot be traded, such as savings bonds (including the popular I bonds), and some other bond issues.</p>
<p>The remainder are Treasury bills, notes, and bonds, plus Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), and Floating Rate Notes (FRN). These securities are traded (“marketable”). At the end of Q1 – that’s the timeframe we look at below), there were $26.9 trillion of these securities outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign holders: $8.0 trillion</strong>. Includes private sector holdings, and official holdings, such as by central banks. China, Brazil and other countries have been reducing their holdings for years. European countries, the big financial centers, Canada, India and other countries have been loading up. In total, foreign holdings rose to an all-time high in March and dipped a little in April, which was still the second highest ever. While foreign holders in aggregate have increased their holdings in dollar terms over the years, their share of the total debt outstanding has plunged from 33% a decade ago, to 22.9% now because they have not kept up with the rapid increase of the US debt (we discussed the <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2024/06/19/the-foreign-holders-of-the-ballooning-us-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">details of those foreign holders here</a>).</p>
<h3><strong>The rest is in the hands of US Holders.</strong></h3>
<p>The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) just released its Quarterly Fixed Income Report for Q1. It doesn’t spell out the dollar amounts, but the percentage of Treasury bills, notes, bonds, TIPS, and FRNs outstanding. As of March, there were $26.9 trillion of these Treasury securities outstanding. And they were held by:</p>
<p><strong>US mutual funds</strong>: <strong>18.0%</strong> of Treasury securities outstanding (about $4.8 trillion). They include bond mutual funds that hold Treasury securities, and the T-bill holdings at money market mutual funds.</p>
<p><br>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8212587530282873" data-ad-slot="6716687404" data-adsbygoogle-status="done"><p id="aswift_2_host"></p></ins><br>
</p>
<p><strong>Federal Reserve: 16.9%</strong> of Treasury securities outstanding (about $4.6 trillion in March). Under its QT program, the Fed has already shed $1.31 trillion of its Treasury securities since the peak in June 2022 (our <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2024/06/06/fed-balance-sheet-qt-107-billion-in-may-1-71-trillion-from-peak-to-7-26-trillion-lowest-since-december-2020/">latest update on the Fed’s QT</a>).</p>
<p><strong>US Individuals: 9.8%</strong> of Treasury securities outstanding (about $2.6 trillion). These are people who hold them in their accounts in the US.</p>
<p><strong>Banks: 8.1%</strong> of Treasury securities outstanding (about $2.2 trillion). We saw in March 2023, banks hold a lot of long-term Treasury securities and MBS that lost a lot of market value due to the rise in yields, and as depositors saw this and got scared and yanked their money out, some banks collapsed. According to FDIC data, the total amount of all types of securities held by banks – Treasury securities, MBS, and other securities – was $5.5 trillion at the end of Q1, with <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2024/05/29/status-of-banks-unrealized-losses-in-q1-worsened-after-brief-rate-cut-mania-relief/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cumulative unrealized losses on all their securities rising to $517 billion</a>. The $2.2 trillion are just Treasury securities.</p>
<p><strong>State and local governments: 6.3%</strong> of Treasury securities outstanding (about $1.7 trillion).</p>
<p><strong>Pension funds: 4.3%</strong> of Treasury securities outstanding (about $1.2 trillion).</p>
<p><strong>Insurance companies: 1.9%</strong> of Treasury securities outstanding (about $510 billion). Warren Buffett’s insurance conglomerate, <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2024/05/06/buffett-invests-in-t-bills-instead-of-stocks-waits-for-bad-stuff-to-happen-cash-is-king-at-5-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berkshire Hathaway, has increased its holdings of T-bills to $153 billion</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Other: 1.5%</strong> of Treasury securities outstanding (about $400 billion).</p>
<p>This shows just how far and wide Treasury securities are spread. If these investors lose interest at current yields and demand at current yield vanishes, yields have to rise until sufficient demand materializes. And that can happen all of a sudden, which we saw happen when the 10-year yield briefly pierced 5% in October, <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2023/10/23/spectacle-ensues-after-10-year-treasury-yield-pierces-5-huge-demand-piles-in-yield-plunges-19-basis-points-in-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unleashing a torrent of demand that bid up prices, and so the yield plunged again</a>. Currently, amid blistering demand, the 10-year yield is back down to 4.25%, even though T-bill yields are close to 5.5%.</p>
