<p>(WJW) — It’s not just police wearing body cameras these days. The company that owns <a href="https://fox8.com/tag/TJ-Maxx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TJ Maxx</a>, Marshalls and Home Goods — TJX Companies — said they recently began outfitting employees with the equipment to help thwart shoplifting. </p>



<p>The body cameras have reportedly only been rolled out at select stores over the last year. The company <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/tj-maxx-marshalls-parent-equipping-employees-body-cameras-stop-theft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told FOX Business </a>the move was made to “de-escalate incidents, deter crime, and demonstrate to our Associates and customers that we take safety in our stores seriously.”</p>





<p>The company was clear the cameras are only worn by specially-trained loss prevention employees and not every employee in the store, <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/tj-maxx-marshalls-parent-equipping-employees-body-cameras-stop-theft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">telling FOX Business</a> they don’t share the footage unless requested by police or through a subpoena. </p>



<p>Working to combat the pervasive issue of lost or stolen merchandise, while still making sure customers feel comfortable at their stores, the company finance chief said in a <a href="https://investor.tjx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May earnings call, that </a>they believe people are less likely to shoplift if they know they’re on camera. </p>

<p>TJX is not alone in pursuing the theft prevention option.

<p>Companies are also considering some AI-forward technologies and have started getting rid of self-checkout registers at their stores, <a href="https://cdn.nrf.com/sites/default/files/2023-09/NRF_National_Retail_Security_Survey_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NRF reported.</a></p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Andrew Left, the founder of Citron Research, is shorting GameStop again, citing that the stock is "extremely overvalued" after its recent meteoric rise.</li>
<li>Left had previously bet against GameStop in 2021, but was forced to close out his short position at a 100% loss due to intense harassment and threats from GameStop fans.</li>
<li>This time, Left made a profit when he bet against GameStop again last month, despite the stock's initial surge to an intraday peak of $64.83.</li>
<li>The surge in GameStop's stock price was attributed to social media post by Keith Gill, aka "Roaring Kitty", which popularized the company and attracted retail investors to buy in.</li>
<li>After the initial surge, GameStop's stock eventually fell to a low of $18.93 on May 23, allowing Left to close out his short position for a profit.</li>

The veteran short seller was burned on his first bet against meme-stock traders’ favorite company in 2021, eventually closing out his short position at a 100% loss and halting the publication of short reports after he said an “<a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/Hedge+Funds/Short-Seller+Citron+Walks+Away+After+Angry+Mob+Tried+to+Silence+Him+on+GameStop+(GME),+Turning+Info+Over+to+Feds/17851916.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.streetinsider.com/Hedge+Funds/Short-Seller+Citron+Walks+Away+After+Angry+Mob+Tried+to+Silence+Him+on+GameStop+(GME),+Turning+Info+Over+to+Feds/17851916.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">angry mob</a>” of fanatical GameStop shareholders harassed him.</p><p class="paywall-selector"></p><div class="paywall">



<p>But Left, who made his name with big bets against <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/10/21/valeant-philidor-stock-plummet/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2015/10/21/valeant-philidor-stock-plummet/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">the pharmaceutical giant Valeant</a> and China’s now-defunct <a href="https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/26/andrew-left-citron-research-founder-banned-hong-kong-trading-warning-china-evergrande/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/26/andrew-left-citron-research-founder-banned-hong-kong-trading-warning-china-evergrande/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">property giant Evergrande</a>, told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> that he made a profit when he bet against GameStop again last month. </p>



<p>The video game retailer saw its shares surge from just over $10 at the start of May to an intraday peak of $64.83 by May 14 after Keith Gill—the trader, and de facto meme-stock leader, who goes by <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/03/roaring-kitty-gamestop-116-million/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/03/roaring-kitty-gamestop-116-million/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">Roaring Kitty</a>—referenced the company in social media posts, leading retail investors to pile in. After that initial surge, GameStop stock eventually fell to a low of $18.93 on May 23, and Left says he was able to close out his short position for a profit during this period, he says.</p>



<p>On Monday, the Citron Research founder doubled down on his bearish bet against GameStop after Gill posted a screenshot on Reddit that implied he <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/03/roaring-kitty-gamestop-116-million/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/03/roaring-kitty-gamestop-116-million/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">owns over $100 million</a> of the retailer’s stock. “When I saw it, I shorted it,” Left <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-03/andrew-left-burned-in-2021-meme-mania-is-short-gamestop-again?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-03/andrew-left-burned-in-2021-meme-mania-is-short-gamestop-again?embedded-checkout=true" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> of the Reddit post.</p>



<p>The surge in GameStop shares simply “makes no sense” and shows the U.S. has become a “nation of gamblers,” he said in his <em>Wall Street Journal</em> interview.</p><p></p>



<p>GameStop stock has risen more than 33% from its opening price on Monday, but fallen over 23% from that day’s intraday high. That means the potential profitability of Left’s current short position, at least at the moment, depends on the price at which he was able to secure shares for the bet.</p>



<p>Either way, the veteran short-seller said that he did learn not to make large bets against “cult” stocks when he was burned shorting GameStop back in 2021, and his latest short compromises a small portion of his portfolio. “It’s a cult stock. You don’t do that on cult stocks,” he told the <em>Journal.</em> “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.”</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points based on the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Japan's biggest brewer aims to attract sober Gen Z</strong>: Asialight, Japan's largest brewer, is trying to attract a younger generation that is increasingly sober and less interested in drinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nommunication: the Japanese way of drinking</strong>: In Japan, drinking is not just about getting drunk, but also about building relationships and creating a relaxed environment, known as "nommunication" (a combination of "nomu" meaning drink and "communication").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drinking as a way of communication in Japan</strong>: In Japan, drinking is a cultural tradition used to break the ice, build relationships, and settle business deals. Even serious business issues are tackled over drinks in pubs rather than conference rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The decline of drinking culture in Japan</strong>: The drinking culture in Japan, which was once a vital part of business and social relationships, is declining among younger generations. This is particularly true for Gen Z, who are increasingly sober and less interested in drinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Asialight's response</strong>: Asialight, Japan's largest brewer, is trying to adapt to this change by creating new products and marketing strategies to attract a younger audience that is less interested in traditional drinking habits.</p>

              </figcaption></figure><p>McDonald's lost a European Union trademark dispute over the Big Mac name after a top European Union court sided Wednesday with Irish fast-food rival Supermac's in a long-running legal battle. </p><p>The EU General Court said in its <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2024-06/cp240092en.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">judgment</a> that the U.S. fast-food giant failed to prove that it was genuinely using the Big Mac label over a five-year period for chicken sandwiches, poultry products or restaurants. </p><p>The Big Mac is a hamburger made of two beef patties, cheese, lettuce, onions, pickles and Big Mac sauce. It was invented in 1968 by a Pennsylvania franchisee who thought the company needed a sandwich that appealed to adults.</p><p>The decision is about more than burger names. It opens the door for Galway-based Supermac's expansion into other EU countries. The dispute erupted when Supermac's applied to register its company name in the EU as it drew up expansion plans. McDonald's objected, saying consumers would be confused because it already trademarked the Big Mac name.</p>    
  <p>Supermac's filed a 2017 request with the EU's Intellectual Property Office to revoke McDonald's Big Mac trademark registration, saying the U.S. company couldn't prove that it had used the name for certain categories that aren't specifically related to the burger over five years. That's the window of time in Europe that a trademark has to be used before it can be taken away. </p><figure class="embed embed--type-video embed--type-content_video is-video embed--float-none embed--size-medium ">

<p>SAN DIEGO (FOX 5/KUSI) — Rubio’s Coastal Grill has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a mere days after the Mexican fast casual chain announced the <a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/business/rubios-coastal-grill-closes-over-a-dozen-san-diego-area-stores/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/business/rubios-coastal-grill-closes-over-a-dozen-san-diego-area-stores/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closure of nearly 50 stores across California</a> citing the “rising cost of doing business.”</p>



<p>In a statement, the Carlsbad-based chain said it is seeking the bankruptcy protection for reorganization to “facilitate the sale of the business.” The statement added it will continue at “normal operations” at its remaining 86 stores in the Golden State, Arizona and Nevada.</p>



<p>“Despite the Company’s best efforts to right-size the company, the continued challenging economic conditions have negatively impacted its ability to meet the demands of its debt burden,” Nicholas Rubin, chief restructuring officer of Rubio’s, said in a statement. </p>





<p>“The Company believes the best path forward for Rubio’s is through a court-supervised sale process that will position the brand for long-term success to grow and flourish,” he continued.</p>



<p>Rubio’s will be entering what is known as a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stalkinghorsebid.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,A%20stalking%20horse%20bid%20is%20an%20initial%20bid%20on%20the,to%20succeed%20in%20buying%20them." data-type="link" data-id="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stalkinghorsebid.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,A%20stalking%20horse%20bid%20is%20an%20initial%20bid%20on%20the,to%20succeed%20in%20buying%20them." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stalking horse purchase agreement</a>, which is a type of negotiation where the company determines the lowest bid price, to sell its business, according to the statement — something it expects to be completed in 75 days.</p>





<p>It will mark the second time Rubio’s Coastal Grill has filed for bankruptcy in the last five years. It first sought <a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/report-rubios-restaurant-chain-files-for-bankruptcy/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/report-rubios-restaurant-chain-files-for-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 11 bankruptcy back in 2020</a>, selling off ownership to an investment group to help pull the chain out of a financial downturn.</p>





<p>According to Wednesday’s statement, Rubio’s said it has “a commitment from its existing lender to provide debtor-in-possession financing and has more than adequate liquidity to meet all its operating needs during the sale process” this time around.</p>



<p>Last Friday, the chain announced the abrupt closure of nearly 50 “underperforming” stores across California, including 13 in San Diego County — where the chain originated back in 1983. According to the company, 24 stores in the Los Angeles area were also closed last week, as well as 11 in Northern California.</p>





<p>“Making the decision to close a store is never an easy one,” a spokesperson for Rubio’s Coastal Grill said at the time, adding the move came “after a thorough review of its operations and the current business climate.”</p>



<p>However, the move drew pushback from purported customers and workers on the chain’s social media. At <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7pGMNzvN7h/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">least one user who said they were a worker</a> on a recent Instagram post, which has now been cleared of comments, said they were informed of their store’s closure the day it happened.</p>





<p>Known for its fish tacos, Rubio’s Coastal Grill was founded in Mission Bay in 1983. Since then, the chain has expanded to <a href="https://rubios.com/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 100 stores</a> in California, Arizona and Nevada. According to the spokesperson, 86 stores will remain open after the closures.</p>

    <div><section class="content__body"><p>A salmonella outbreak linked to cucumbers has expanded to 25 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, with at least 162 people having fallen ill and 54 hospitalized, health officials announced on Wednesday.</p><p>Federal and state agencies are investigating the outbreak following data showing that cucumbers may be contaminated with salmonella, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a public <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/africana-06-24/epi.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post</a>. Testing that identified salmonella in a Fresh Start Produce product sample <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cucumber-recall-salmonella/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">prompted the recall two days ago of cucumbers</a></span> shipped to 14 states, "but these sellers may have shipped to additional states or repackaged them for stores," according to the federal agency.</p><p>Testing is still underway to establish a definitive link, according to the agency. Salmonella can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in the young, frail or elderly. Healthy people infected with salmonella can experience symptoms including fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, the bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause more severe infections. </p>    
  <p>Illnesses linked to the outbreak started on March 11 and continued through mid-May, according to the CDC. Those impacted live in the District of Columbia and the following states: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. </p><p>The CDC and FDA are also investigating a separate outbreak of salmonella infections tied to 158 illnesses in 23 states. "Investigators are working to determine whether the two outbreaks could be linked to the same food," <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/africana-06-24/details.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> the CDC.</p>

<h2>Hundreds of deaths</h2><p>Salmonella bacteria cause about 1.3 million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations and 420 deaths in the U.S. every year, with food causing most of the illnesses, according <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">to</a> the CDC. Anyone with severe salmonella symptoms should call their health care provider. Most people recover without specific treatment and should not take antibiotics, the agency noted.</p><p>The agency urged consumers not to eat any of the recalled cucumbers and to wash any items or surfaces that may have touched a recalled cucumber with hot soapy water or a dishwasher.</p><p>"If you recently purchased cucumbers and have them at home, you can check with the store where you purchased them to see if they were part of the recall. If you can't tell, do not eat them," the CDC said.</p>

<ol>
<li>The FDA's advisory committee has voted unanimously to update the formula for the Covid-19 vaccine to combat the JN.1 variant, which was dominant in the US in February.</li>
<li>The committee recommends using a formula aimed at combating the JN.1 variant or a virus containing it. However, recent weeks have seen the rise of descendants of JN.1, including KP.2 and KP.3.</li>
<li>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to formally recommend a variant target for vaccine makers in the coming weeks, which will guide the development of new vaccines to be rolled out in the late summer or early fall.</li>
<li>The decision on the variant target involves some educated guesswork, as the new vaccine formula won't be available until months after a new variant becomes dominant.</li>
<li>The updates to the vaccine formula aim to offer better protection against circulating versions of the virus, particularly as a result of the annual fall immunization campaign.</li>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><figure class="caas-figure"></figure><p>Shares of <strong>Hewlett Packard Enterprise</strong> <span class="ticker">(NYSE: HPE)</span>, or HPE, charged sharply higher Wednesday, soaring as much as 16.1%. As of 1:46 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 12.9%.</p><p>The catalyst that sent the server and cloud software specialist higher was its strong financial report, which held a few surprises.</p><h2>Investors let out a collective cheer</h2><p>For its fiscal second quarter (ended April 30), HPE generated revenue of $7.2 billion, up 3% year over year. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.42, down 19%. Fueling the robust top-line growth was <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=68970dae-a055-4044-b35e-375df5c40677" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:artificial intelligence (AI);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="13" data-v9y="0">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> systems revenue, which doubled quarter over quarter.</p><p>While that might not seem like much to celebrate, the results sailed past management's forecast and easily surpassed analysts' consensus estimates, which called for revenue of $6.82 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.39.</p><p>CEO Antonio Neri noted that the accelerating adoption of AI helped fuel the results. "Our deep expertise in designing, manufacturing, and running AI systems at scale, fueled growth of cumulative AI systems orders to $4.6 billion dollars, with enterprise AI orders representing more than 15%," he said. He went on to say that the company was seeing stronger AI order conversion. That, combined with "prudent cost discipline and higher-than-expected free cash flow" set the stage for future success.</p><p>In the wake of the robust results, management increased its full-year guidance and now expects revenue growth in a range of 1% to 3%, while lifting its EPS guidance to a range of $1.85 to $1.95, up from a range of $1.82 to $1.92.</p><h2>Wall Street is much more bullish</h2><p>On the heels of HPE's strong results, Wall Street scrambled to revise its models, with nine analysts boosting their price targets. <strong>Evercore</strong> ISI analyst Amit Daryanani increased his price target to $22, up from $18, and seemed to adequately capture Wall Street's more bullish sentiment. The analyst noted that while investors had relegated HPE stock to the "show-me" pile, the results "proved that the company has a significant presence and a competitive offering in the AI market."</p><p>Some uncertainty remains, but HPE is staking its claim in the AI revolution, and at less than 14 times earnings, the stock is selling for a significant discount to its peers.</p><h2>Should you invest $1,000 in Hewlett Packard Enterprise right now?</h2><p>Before you buy stock in Hewlett Packard Enterprise, consider this:</p><p>The <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the <strong><a href="https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=81c28a52-13a6-49e4-985a-cdb600ee4eb3&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-foolcom-sa-bbn-dyn%3Faid%3D8867%26amp%253Bsource%3Disaeditxt0010895%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D13885&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=68970dae-a055-4044-b35e-375df5c40677" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 best stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="0">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy now… and Hewlett Packard Enterprise wasn’t one of them.

            AT&amp;T’s second prolonged outage so far this year left customers irate on Tuesday, with experts criticizing the company’s response and saying the wireless company risked losing user loyalty over the issues.
    </p>

            “Come on AT&amp;T, let’s get it together here. These service issues are getting old,” <a href="https://twitter.com/syracuseashley/status/1798107451230941634" target="_blank">said one</a> social media user. “We better be getting more than a $5 credit. Otherwise I’m going back to Verizon.”

            Though outages can affect any company, it’s not normal to have two long outages in a short period of time, Mojtaba Vaezi, a professor and director of the Wireless Networking Laboratory at Villanova University, said to CNN.
    </p>

            “If it’s something that’s happening with a software update dysfunctioning with some systems, usually they have back-ups and people working around the clock,” Vaezi said. “When it takes longer than 10 to 15 minutes, it is alarming.”

            Although AT&amp;T did not share the number of impacted customers, website Down Detector shows <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/att/" target="_blank">a spike in reports</a> of issues using the service starting around 1 pm ET on Tuesday. Those numbers climbed in the hours that followed. By 6 pm ET, however, the number of reported incidents sharply declined, according to Down Detector.

            In February, a massive outage knocked out service for AT&amp;T’s network for nearly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/22/tech/att-cell-service-outage/index.html">12 hours</a>. Tens of thousands of AT&amp;T customers in America could not make phone calls, send texts, reach emergency services or access the internet. At the time, the mobile network <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/25/business/att-network-outage-reimbursement/index.html">issued a $5 credit</a> to impacted customers.

            Karen North, a communication professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in brand management and crisis communications, said AT&amp;T’s initial lack of communication may damage customer faith in the company.

            AT&amp;T told CNN on Tuesday that 911 calls were going through, despite a few locations, including Camden County, Georgia, and Scranton, Pennsylvania, issuing <a href="https://x.com/CamdenCountyEMA/status/1798058896109842744" target="_blank">alerts</a> on social media that the outage was disrupting calls to 911. AT&amp;T told CNN the alerts were received accidentally and the company is investigating why that happened.

            After two consecutive outages and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/30/tech/att-data-leak/index.html">a March data breach</a>, North said AT&amp;T needs to work to regain customer trust.
    </p>

            “They need to put out a very clear message about why they should be trusted in the future to resolve this,” North said. “And they probably need to show empathy for the fact that this isn’t just a phone. This is, professionally and personally, a lifeline for people to their families, their friends and their businesses.”

Parent company Outfox Hospitality is going to reopen some of its locations, including in Austin. </p>
<p id="vZ1EKR">Eater Chicago <a href="https://chicago.eater.com/2024/5/16/24157698/foxtrot-bankruptcy-auction-comeback-outfox">reports</a> that Foxtrot’s assets were up for auction on May 10, with rumors that co-founder Mike LaVitola was trying to bring back the company. A business called Further Point Enterprises placed the winning bid. </p>
<p id="0YJDPK">Now it <a href="https://chicago.eater.com/2024/6/5/24172117/foxtrot-chicago-dallas-austin-corner-store-comback-mike-lavitola-official">turns out</a> Further is working with LaVitola, who is serving as the executive chairman of the new entity overseeing this Foxtrot 2.0, <a href="https://www.chicagobusiness.com/retail/foxtrot-reopening-stores">per Crain’s</a>. He told the publication, “It’s a totally new company starting from scratch,” but with same name and original locations.</p>
<p id="oyTt6u">Foxtrot’s press release notes that “reopened stores will maintain the same layout and merchandising, focusing on small and local makers.” But it’s unclear exactly which Foxtrots will reopen. The press release only mentioned that it would be reopening in Chicago, Austin, and Dallas, but there was no mention of Washington, D.C., nor specific addresses. </p>
<p id="E2uQxP">Foxtrot had four locations in Austin, all of which <a href="https://austin.eater.com/2022/10/7/23391108/foxtrot-austin-open-convenience-stores">opened throughout 2023</a>: Rosedale on Burnet, Bouldin Creek on South First, downtown on West Second Street, and West Campus on Guadalupe. Currently, the South First Foxtrot was covered in graffiti immediately after its shutter, and the downtown location has been dark but its stock fully visible from the outside. </p>
<p id="kHEw1L">LaVitola and co-founder Taylor Bloom started Foxtrot in 2014. The company merged with Chicago-based Dom’s Kitchen &amp; Market in November 2023, forming the Outfox Hospitality Group. </p>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>Dollar Tree said Wednesday it will explore a sale or spinoff of Family Dollar, less than a decade after acquiring the chain in what has turned out to be a disastrous merger.</p><p>Family Dollar has around 8,000 US stores, catering to low-income customers predominantly in cities with prices typically ranging from $1 to $10. The chain has struggled in recent years. Last year, Family Dollar announced plans to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/13/investing/family-dollar-dollar-tree-closing-stores/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:close more than 900 stores;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="13" data-v9y="0">close more than 900 stores</a>.</p><p>Dollar Tree CEO Rick Dreiling said in a statement that the “unique needs” of the two different chains led the company to explore a split from Family Dollar. Dollar Tree typically has stores in suburban areas and focuses on middle-income consumers, unlike Family Dollar, which is located in more urban areas and caters to lower-income customers.</p><p>Messy stores, high prices and over-expansion have plagued Family Dollar, analysts say.</p><p>The chain has also faced steep competition from larger retailers, such as Walmart and Dollar General. And inflation in recent years has increased Family Dollar’s operating costs and squeezed its lower-income customers.</p><p>“The saga of Family Dollar is a long and unhappy one,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients Wednesday. “The harsh reality is that Family Dollar is a problematic business which is a millstone around Dollar Tree’s neck, dragging down overall performance.”</p><p>Family Dollar’s sales at stores open at least one year ticked up 0.1% last quarter.</p><p>Dollar Tree’s (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/DLTR?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DLTR;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="0">DLTR</a>) stock fell 3% in premarket trading.</p><h3>Merger gone bad</h3><p>Family Dollar has struggled since Dollar Tree <a href="https://corporate.dollartree.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/120/dollar-tree-completes-acquisition-of-family-dollar" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bought it in 2015;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="0">bought it in 2015 </a>for $8.5 billion.</p><p>Dollar Tree believed acquiring Family Dollar would help it compete against bigger rivals. But it misjudged the deal.</p><p>The combined company hoped that by joining forces it could grow its customer base, reduce costs and fend off Dollar General, which is located primarily in rural areas. Dollar General had also bid for Family Dollar.</p><p>But analysts say the match between the two different chains was a poor fit, and Dollar Tree has struggled to manage the larger Family Dollar store base.</p><p>Family Dollar stores were in worse condition than Dollar Tree management expected, and early strategies to improve sales, such as selling beer, fell short.</p><p>Many Family Dollar stores were located too close to each other and cannibalized each other’s own sales.</p><p>“Family Dollar’s sales have been sputtering, hurt by neglected stores, poor product selection and unhappy workers,” The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dollar-trees-9-billion-problem-family-dollar-isnt-paying-off-1541419201?mod=article_inline&amp;mod=article_relatedinline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0">reported</a> in 2018.
