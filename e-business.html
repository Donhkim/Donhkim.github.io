    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Starbucks' poor quarterly report</strong>: Starbucks Corporation's latest quarterly report was disappointing, with a surprise decline in same-store sales and missed estimates for earnings and revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Howard Schultz's critique</strong>: Former CEO Howard Schultz believes the company's downturn is due to a lack of focus on improving the mobile order and pay experience, as well as a need to create new, premium drink offerings.</li>
<li><strong>Schultz's prescription</strong>: Schultz believes that improving the customer experience in U.S. stores is key to the company's recovery, and that this can be achieved by focusing on the "eyes of a merchant" rather than relying on data.</li>
<li><strong>Stock performance</strong>: Starbucks' shares have fallen 17% since the poor quarterly report, taking the company's market value down to $82.8 billion.</li>
<li><strong>Analysts' concerns</strong>: Analysts are still trying to understand the reasons behind Starbucks' underperformance, with some pointing to social media backlash over the company's stance on conflict in the Middle East as a potential factor.</li>

            <strong>Sydney —</strong> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/australia">Qantas Airways</a> has agreed to pay 120 million Australian dollars<strong> </strong>($79 million) to settle a lawsuit over the sale of thousands of tickets on already canceled flights, in an attempt to end a reputational crisis that has engulfed the airline.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvunkyur00083b6j88779s3e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The company will split 20 million Australian dollars between more than 86,000 customers who booked tickets on the so-called “ghost flights” and pay a fine of 100 million instead of defending the lawsuit it had previously vowed to fight, Qantas and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said on Monday.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvunlqux000a3b6jsltjuowm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The fine is the biggest ever for an Australian airline and among the largest globally in the sector, although some Australian banks and casino operators have faced higher penalties.

            “We recognize Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards,” CEO Vanessa Hudson said in a statement.

            The settlement “means we can compensate affected customers much sooner than if the case had continued in the Federal Court,” added Hudson, noting the court still must sign off on the settlement.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvunmz40000i3b6jc5w2xr8b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            If the court approves, the settlement will resolve a dispute that featured prominently at a time when Qantas’s brand value tanked in consumer surveys amid a spike in complaints about cancellations.
    </p>

            After the ACCC filed its lawsuit last August, Hudson’s longserving predecessor, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/04/business/australia-qantas-ceo-hnk-intl/index.html">Alan Joyce</a>, brought forward his retirement. Hudson became CEO in September.

            The payout, however, would pale against the net profit of 1.47 billion Australian dollars that analysts on average forecast Qantas to report in the year to end-June, according to LSEG data.

            People who bought tickets on non-existent domestic flights would get $225 and people with international fares would get $450, on top of a refund, the airline and regulator said.

            The ACCC lawsuit centered on the months after Australia’s border reopened in 2022 following two years of Covid restrictions, and airline cancellations and lost luggage complaints spiked globally amid staffing shortages.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvunor9a000y3b6j7ricdngu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Qantas had argued that it faced similar challenges to airlines around the world, but the ACCC said its actions broke consumer law. It had said the airline sometimes sold tickets to flights weeks after they were canceled.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvunp53k00103b6j6huwv0pq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The ACCC’s Cass-Gottlieb noted that the settlement included a promise from Qantas not to repeat the conduct.

                                  <p class="drop-cap">If you've hunted for a job in the past decade or so, you've likely encountered the following obstacle course. Applying to a desired role online, you're greeted with a login prompt. The employer is asking you to create a profile to apply? Annoying, but you go ahead.</p><p>You're given a long form to fill out with the information that's already on your résumé. In a world where we can all attach PDFs, this seems unnecessary, but — ah, phew — the form promises to autofill the entries if you simply drag your résumé over, and — oh, crap. It loads all wrong. Your<em> </em>work experience is scattered across the lines that want your name and address. Your address, truncated, is where your college degree should be. It's a mess. You find it's easier to delete it all and manually type in each entry. How obnoxious.</p><p>Soon after, applying to a different job at a different company, you click through and see the same form. You recognize the logo at the top of the page: a blue W with a yellow arch cresting above it. Is the arch a … frown? Geez. But you'd set up a user ID to apply to the previous job, so this should be — huh? It wants an entirely new ID. New company, new profile, new form. Oof. Surely it saved your application entries from the other job, right? Nope. Does the autofill work this time? Of course it doesn't. Another half-hour of formatting and you're done with the application — and so done with whichever confounding organization decided to execute these tasks this way.</p><p>Then you find another job opening and — no. No! So the logo <em>is</em> a frown.</p><p>The company devising this torture that is the modern job application is called Workday. Since 2006, Workday, which provides software for payroll, talent management, and expense processing, has been making a mint creating misery where painless processes could be. More than half of the Fortune 500 companies use Workday to pay, hire, onboard, and administer benefits to their employees. Clients range from Netflix to Goodwill, Spotify to The Washington Post, Chick-fil-A to Ohio State University. Trillions of dollars in revenue and tens of millions of employees are at the mercy of Workday's back-end people-management software. The company is worth some $70 billion, a market cap greater than that of FedEx, Nintendo, or Honda.</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-right" data-quote="LinkedIn, Reddit, and Blind abound with enraged job applicants and employees sharing tales of how difficult it is to book leave, how Kafkaesque it is to file an expense." data-quote-updated="true" data-source="Add source (optional)" data-source-updated="false">

                            </es-blockquote><p>Few seem happy about this. LinkedIn, Reddit, and Blind abound with enraged job applicants and employees sharing tales of how difficult it is to book paid leave, how Kafkaesque it is to file an expense, how nerve-racking it is to close out a project. "I simply hate Workday. Fuck them and those who insist on using it for recruitment," one Reddit user wrote. "Everything is non-intuitive, so even the simplest tasks leave me scratching my head," wrote another. "Keeping notes on index cards would be more effective." Every HR professional and hiring manager I spoke with — whose lives are supposedly made easier by Workday — described Workday with a sense of cosmic exasperation. "It's like constantly being botsmacked by bureaucracy incarnate," said a copy director at an AI startup in San Francisco who had the misfortune of having to hire contractors through Workday. He went on: "Getting someone onboarded using Workday is like trying to get water from your sink to your stove using a colander." The X account Work Day Failing tracks memes and news articles describing workers and companies suffering within various circles of Workday hell, from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-ends-deal-workday-hr-software-partnership-2021-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="40">Amazon's failed migration to Workday</a> in 2021 (after which Workday's stock dropped by 7%) to an ongoing class-action lawsuit that alleges Workday uses AI to discriminate against candidates based on race, age, and disability. ("We believe this lawsuit is without merit and deny the allegations," said a Workday spokesperson. "Workday does not have oversight or control of our customers' job application processes.")</p><p>If candidates hate Workday, if employees hate Workday, if HR people and managers processing and assessing those candidates and employees through Workday hate Workday — if Workday is the most annoying part of so many workers' workdays — how is Workday everywhere? How did a software provider so widely loathed become a mainstay of the modern workplace?</p><p>The answer, to use a term that any client of Workday could surely use, is POSIWID. This is a saying in systems thinking: The purpose of a system is what it does (POSIWID), not what it fails to do. And the reality is that what Workday — and its many despised competitors — does for organizations is far more important than the anguish it causes everyone else.</p><hr><p class="drop-cap">Of the 160 million Americans with jobs, about 130 million of us aren't self-employed or don't own a business and so receive wages and health-insurance plans through our employers. Serving these 130 million people are roughly 1 million human-resources professionals. That's an impossible shit ton of hirings, firings, withheld taxes, expenses, paid leaves, orientation trainings, and professional-growth reviews to keep track of. It's a world of paperwork that software is eager to eat.</p><p>In the late 20th century, companies moved more and more of that recordkeeping from filing cabinets to mainframe computers and then to servers. In 1988, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oracle.com/applications/peoplesoft/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="60">PeopleSoft</a>, backed by IBM, built the first fully fledged Human Resources Information System. In 2004, Oracle acquired PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion. One of its founders, David Duffield, then started a new company that upgraded PeopleSoft's model to near limitless cloud-based storage — giving birth to Workday, the intractable nepo baby of HR software.</p><p>Unlike its predecessors, Workday stores our applications and profiles as objects that relate to each other, linked with metadata. How this works is less important than the fact that it means Workday could conceivably build its <em>own</em> encrypted database of our information, across our different jobs and applications. When you leave Spotify to go work at Netflix, your profile could follow you, allowing you to more easily apply to the job. The multiplying powers of tech could scale to free us of our busy work, as promised.</p><p>But Workday's servers belong with its clients, and so it can't (or won't) do this. Does Workday want to carry the liability of a data breach that could damage half of the Fortune 500? Probably not. A Workday spokesperson said that Workday's clients "configure the application process for each job to fit their unique hiring processes and needs." She added, "Our customers retain control over their own data."</p><p>This raises another point: Workday is indifferent to our suffering in a job hunt, because we aren't Workday's clients, companies are. And these companies — from AT&amp;T to Bank of America to Teladoc — have little incentive to care about your application experience, because if you didn't get the job, you're not their responsibility. For a company hiring and onboarding on a global scale, it is simply easier to screen fewer candidates if the result is still a single hire.</p><p>Also, because Workday is a jack of all trades program (recruiting <em>and</em> finance <em>and </em>company-wide planning etc. etc.), the supposed convenience of an all-in-one platform often come at the cost of creating frustrating <em>new</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/04/workday_problems_persist_at_mcgill/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="60">problems</a> for clients.

                            </es-blockquote><p>For recruiters, Workday also lacks basic user-interface flexibility. When you promise ease-of-use and simplicity, you must deliver on the most basic user interactions. And yet: Sometimes searching for a candidate, or locating a candidate's status feels impossible. This happens outside of recruiting, too, where locating or attaching a boss's email to approve an expense sheet is complicated by the process, not streamlined. Bureaucratic hell is always about one person's ease coming at the cost of someone else's frustration, time wasted, and busy work. Workday makes no exceptions.</p><p>Workday touts its ability to track employee performance by collecting data and marking results, but it is employees who must spend time inputting this data. A creative director at a Fortune 500 company told me how in less than two years his company went "from annual reviews to twice-annual reviews to quarterly reviews to quarterly reviews plus separate twice-annual reviews." At each interval higher-ups pressed HR for more data, because they wanted what they'd paid for with Workday: more work product. With a press of a button, HR could provide that, but the entire company suffered thousands more hours of busy work. Automation made it <em>too</em> easy to do too much. (Workday's "customers choose the frequency at which they conduct reviews, not Workday," said the spokesperson.)</p><p>Of course, Workday has innumerable competitors, their names as ridiculous as their sheer volume. We have Dayforce, Zenefits, and Sage. We must not confuse Paycom with Paycor, or Kudos with Kudoboard. How dare you mistake Namely or Cornerstone for Rippling. Beyond standard HR Information Systems, legions of niche operators offer add-ons to boost employee engagement, from Bonusly (really) to BucketList (sad but true), to Motivosity (yes).</p><p>Are any of these better, or are they all maligned? As easily as you can find a founder who hates UKG Pro but loves Rippling you can find a similar rant from another founder ripping Rippling a new one. HR and payroll and recruiting are unenviable tasks, and not easy even before scale. At the scale of a large company, this is simply too much work to expect a few people to do and far too user-specific to expect automation to handle well. It's why Workday can be <em>the worst</em> while still allowing that <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/invinceabella/status/718399996517838848" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="80">Paychex is the worst</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Codywaynegroves/status/1557835464635256832" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="80">Paycom is the worst</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Authenikk2/status/1369631631527587845" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="80">Paycor is the worst</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/chris_fedak/status/469870651952480256" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="80">Dayforce is the worst</a>. "HR software sucking" is a big tent.</p><hr><p class="drop-cap">The writer and tech critic Cory Doctorow coined the term "enshittification" to describe how internet platforms inevitably decay. First, platforms are good to their users, creating value (Facebook, where people can connect and share their lives with one another). Then they abuse their users to make money for their <em>actual</em> customers, advertisers or businesses (Facebook, where we sell your data to inundate you with ads). Then they abuse those business customers to try to recoup revenue for themselves (Facebook, pivoting to video). Then platforms die.</p><p>Workday finds itself between enshittification steps two and three. The platform once made things faster, simpler for workers. But today it abuses workers by cutting corners on job-application and reimbursement procedures. In the process, it provides the value of a one-stop HR shop to its paying customers. It seems it's only a matter of time before Workday and its competitors try to split the difference and cut those same corners with the accounts that pay their bills.</p><p>Workday reveals what's important to the people who run Fortune 500 companies: easily and conveniently distributing busy work across large workforces. This is done with the arbitrary and perfunctory performance of work tasks (like excessive reviews) and with the throttling of momentum by making finance and HR tasks difficult. If your expenses and reimbursements are difficult to file, that's OK, because the people above you don't actually care if you get reimbursed. If it takes applicants <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/job-hunting-sucks-programmer-filled-out-250-applications/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="100">128% longer to apply</a>, the people who implemented Workday don't really care. Throttling applicants is perhaps not intentional, but it's <em>good</em> for the company.</p><p>Customer service is Workday's goal. It's just that the customer isn't you.</p><p>I once worked at a cocktail lounge with a creaky board behind the bar, and the owner refused to fix it. We all complained nonstop about the board, but never about him. He'd seemed to realize the same net benefit that Workday and all of its love-to-hate-them competitors provide us in the modern workplace: Nothing brings people together like a common enemy.</p><hr><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/matt-alston" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100"><em>Matt Alston</em></a><em>'s writing has appeared in Wired, Rolling Stone, Playboy, and Believer.

    <div><p>Last year’s consensus was that the U.S. economy was headed for a recession, but that didn’t happen. This year’s consensus is that we’ll have a soft landing, where the economy slows but won’t tip into a recession. That could be wrong too.</p><div class="paywall paywallActive">



<p>Doubling down on his contrarian view, Citi chief U.S. economist Andrew Hollenhorst told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2024-05-02/bloomberg-surveillance-tv-may-2-2024" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2024-05-02/bloomberg-surveillance-tv-may-2-2024" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2024-05-02/bloomberg-surveillance-tv-may-2-2024" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS"><em>Bloomberg TV</em> on Thursday</a> that he sees a hard landing. In fact, inflation and the labor market will weaken enough that the Federal Reserve will cut benchmark rates four times this year—far more than the one or two cuts Wall Street expects.</p>



<p>His warning proved prescient as the Labor Department’s payroll report the following day showed that the economy added <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/03/jobs-report-hiring-april-175000/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/03/jobs-report-hiring-april-175000/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/03/jobs-report-hiring-april-175000/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">175,000 jobs in April</a>, down sharply from the blockbuster increase of 315,000 in March and well below the 233,000 gain that economists had predicted.</p>



<p>On Thursday, Hollenhorst said other data have been signaling weakness in the labor market, including surveys of consumers and businesses that say jobs are getting harder to find, companies are less eager to hire, and employees are feeling more worried about keeping their jobs.</p>



<p>To be sure, data in recent weeks have offered mixed signals on the economy. The latest employment cost index rose more than expected, suggesting a strong job market. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/economy-gdp-growth-high-interest-rates-1-6/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/economy-gdp-growth-high-interest-rates-1-6/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/economy-gdp-growth-high-interest-rates-1-6/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">first-quarter GDP report</a> showed growth cooled more sharply than anticipated. But that was due largely to a wider trade deficit and slower inventory restocking, while <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/28/us-economy-outlook-q1-gdp-growth-report-consumer-demand-services/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/28/us-economy-outlook-q1-gdp-growth-report-consumer-demand-services/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/04/28/us-economy-outlook-q1-gdp-growth-report-consumer-demand-services/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">consumer demand remained robust</a>.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>But Hollenhorst is convinced there won’t be a soft landing, and said financial markets are starting to move away from that hope as well.</p>



<p>“The reason I think the Fed’s going to see enough to cut is because we’re more toward the hard landing end of the spectrum,” he told <em>Bloomberg TV</em>.</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Fed won’t wait for both inflation and the labor market to weaken before cutting rates, he noted. It only needs to see one or the other.</p>



<p>When asked if his view for four rate cuts this year also means that they wouldn’t provide enough economic stimulus to stave off a hard landing, Hollenhorst said almost every monetary policy cycle has played out that way.</p>



<p>“We’re in the higher-for-longer stage of the policy cycle,” he explained, noting that stubborn inflation has prevented rates from coming down. “The next stage of the policy cycle is a weakening of the labor market. Once it starts gradually weakening, it then weakens more sharply. I think that’s exactly what’s playing out now.”</p>



<p>In February, even amid blowout jobs reports, Hollenhorst was warning about a harding landing and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RY7IV8vPK4" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RY7IV8vPK4" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RY7IV8vPK4" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">told <em>CNBC</em> that he expected a recession</a> by the middle of this year.</p>



<p>Looking past the upbeat headline jobs numbers, he said there were signs of softness, such as the number of hours worked and the number of full-time jobs dropping.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has expressed skepticism about the idea of stagflation, which is characterized by high inflation and slow economic growth. He cited the current state of the economy, with low unemployment, low inflation, and moderate growth.</li>
<li>The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, has remained below 3% for several months, suggesting that inflation is not as high as previously thought.</li>
<li>Despite the initial impression, the first-quarter GDP growth rate of 1.6% is potentially stronger than it seems due to a trade deficit, and underlying demand data remained strong.</li>
<li>Powell decided to hold interest rates steady, citing the lack of progress in reducing inflation to the Fed's 2% goal. He also predicted that consumer prices will continue to fall in 2024.</li>
<li>Some experts, including Janet Yardeni of Yardeni Research, agree with Powell that the likelihood of stagflation is low, with Yardeni estimating the odds at 20% or less.</li>

<p>“I was around for stagflation. And it was 10% unemployment, it was high-single-digits inflation … and very slow growth. Right now, we have 3% growth … and we have inflation running under 3%. So I don’t really understand where that’s coming from,” he told reporters, adding, “I don’t see the stag or the -flation, actually.”</p>



<p>To Powell’s point, although inflation came in ahead of Wall Street’s targets in each of the first three months of this year, the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge has remained below 3% the whole time. The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.8% from a year ago in March. That was in line with February’s figure, and still the lowest core PCE reading since April 2021.</p>



<p>At the same time, although first-quarter GDP growth came in below consensus estimates at 1.6%, rising imports compared with exports in the U.S. economy <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/high-inflation-low-economic-grow-worst-of-both-worlds-gdp-report/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/high-inflation-low-economic-grow-worst-of-both-worlds-gdp-report/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">made the figure seem worse than it actually was</a>—and underlying demand data remained strong. Private domestic demand, a measure of real final sales to domestic purchases that serves as a leading indicator for GDP growth, actually rose 3.1% in the first quarter.</p>



<p>Chair Powell also put his money where his mouth is, so to speak, and decided to hold interest rates steady at a range between 5.25% and 5.5% on Wednesday, despite the recent rise in inflation. Powell admitted that the latest data has <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/01/federal-reserve-interest-rates-inflation/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/01/federal-reserve-interest-rates-inflation/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">shown “a lack of further progress”</a> in reducing inflation to the Fed’s 2% goal, but reiterated he still believes that consumer prices will continue to fall in 2024. The Fed chair added that it’s “unlikely” his next move will be a rate hike.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“My personal forecast is that we will begin to see further progress on inflation this year. I don’t know that it will be sufficient [to cut interest rates]. I don’t know that it won’t. I think we’re gonna have to let the data lead us on that,” he told reporters.</p>



<p>Powell isn’t the only expert pushing back on the stagflation narrative. Ed Yardeni, a veteran Wall Street strategist who now runs Yardeni Research, told <em>Fortune</em> before Powell’s press conference Wednesday that the odds of U.S. stagflation are now 20% or less. A few weeks ago, when the conflict between <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/19/iran-israel-air-defense-drone-strike/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/19/iran-israel-air-defense-drone-strike/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">Israel and Iran</a> <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/14/israel-vs-iran-military-capabilities-weapons-missiles-drones-f35-s300-cyberwarfare/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/14/israel-vs-iran-military-capabilities-weapons-missiles-drones-f35-s300-cyberwarfare/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">appeared to escalate</a>, Yardeni feared that there was a small chance a second oil price shock (the first being the expansion of the Ukraine-Russia war in 2022) could lead to a stagflationary outcome for the economy.</p>



<p>After all, in the 1970s, multiple recessions plus two oil-price shocks sparking the so-called great inflation led to an era characterized by economic stagnation and high prices—giving birth to the term “stagflation.” Now, though, with tensions between oil-producing nations in the Middle East cooling, Yardeni said he is “clearly less worried about that.”</p>



<p>“We can’t even seem to get a 1970s scenario with a horrible situation in the Middle East. The price of oil is still remaining remarkably subdued—and that’s with Saudi Arabia, and Russia, involuntarily cutting back some of their production,” he noted.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

Nonetheless, consumers under 35 continued to express greater confidence than those over 35. In April, households with incomes below $25,000 and those with incomes above $75,000 reported the largest deteriorations in confidence.
