    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>CDK Global, a software provider to car dealerships, was hit by a pair of ransomware attacks</strong>, causing it to take its data centers offline and impacting thousands of car dealerships across the US.</li>
<li><strong>The first attack occurred this month, and CDK Global didn't reveal details</strong>, but it was reported to be related to the company's always-on VPN connection that allows dealerships to access its platform.</li>
<li><strong>After recovering from the first attack, CDK Global was hit again on June 19, forcing it to shut down its systems once more</strong>, causing car dealerships to revert to paper and pens to work out many of their computerized functions.</li>
<li><strong>CDK Global provides software to over 15,000 car dealerships across North America, offering services such as financing, inventory, and payroll management</strong>, making it a critical provider to the auto industry.</li>
<li><strong>The attacks not only impacted CDK Global but also its customers and potential car buyers</strong>, as dealerships were unable to access important software and services, disrupting their operations and potentially impacting sales.</li>

It provides car dealerships with software to handle operations like financing, inventory, back office, payroll and more. CDK’s services are used by over 15,000 car dealerships across North America. The company also employs thousands of people.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</strong></a></p><h2><strong>Timeline of the attacks</strong></h2><p>Cybercriminals targeted CDK twice. The first attack occurred this month, and while CDK Global didn’t reveal details, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cdk-global-hacked-again-while-recovering-from-first-cyberattack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Bleeping Computer</u></a> reported it was related to the company’s always-on VPN.</p><p>Car dealerships use a special kind of VPN connection that's always on to connect to CDK's data centers. This lets their dealership software, installed on their computers, access CDK's platform. Since the CDK software has permission to update itself (like admin privileges) automatically, it makes sense why CDK recommended disconnecting from their data centers during the security incident.</p><p>CDK reported restoring some services on June 20 and told CyberGuy that its systems were again offline due to another cyberattack.</p><p>"Late in the evening of June 19, we experienced an additional cyberincident and proactively shut down most of our systems. In partnership with third-party experts, we are assessing the impact and providing regular updates to our customers," said Lisa Finney, senior external communications manager at CDK Global.</p><p>"We remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible," Finney added.</p><p>CDK Global announced on June 24 that the breach was, in fact, a ransomware attack, meaning the company’s systems won’t be back online until it pays the hackers a ransom. CDK’s software remains down as of this writing, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/cdk-dealer-software-unlikely-be-restored-before-june-end-memo-says-2024-06-25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Reuters reported</u></a> that it won’t be back online until the end of June. </p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-24/blacksuit-cybercrime-gang-blamed-in-major-cdk-ransomware-attack" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg reported</a> that a hacking group called BlackSuit is behind the cyberattack on CDK Global, demanding an extortion fee of tens of millions of dollars.</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>BMW sales car lot</span> <span>(Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson)</span></p></div></div></div><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/pharma-giants-data-breach-exposes-patients-sensitive-information/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong><u>PHARMA GIANT’S DATA BREACH EXPOSES PATIENTS’ SENSITIVE INFORMATION</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>How are dealerships responding?</strong></h2><p>Car dealerships across the U.S. are feeling the pinch from the CDK cyberattack. But some dealerships are showing their resourcefulness. Employees are taking to social media, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/1djl7iy/comment/l9blify/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">like Reddit</a>, to share how they're keeping things going with spreadsheets and sticky notes. This allows them to handle smaller sales and repairs, but for now, bigger transactions are on hold.</p><p>Big names like Honda, Toyota and Hyundai are closely monitoring the situation to see how badly the outage is hurting dealerships. Honda even went further, telling affected dealerships to use alternative tools and processes to keep business running smoothly while CDK gets its systems back online.</p><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/mobile/massive-free-vpn-data-breach-exposes-360-million-records/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong><u>MASSIVE FREE VPN DATA BREACH EXPOSES 360 MILLION RECORDS</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>How does the CDK cyberattack impact you?</strong></h2><p>Car dealerships rely on CDK's software to manage various aspects of their operations, including financing and inventory management. When these systems are down, it can delay the process of purchasing a car, affecting those who are in the market for a new vehicle.</p><p>If you’re seeking services from dealerships, such as maintenance or repairs, you may experience delays or disruptions because the dealership's management systems are offline. CDK's software also helps dealerships manage financing and leasing agreements. The cyberattack has disrupted these processes, leading to delays in securing loans or leases for customers.</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Toyota dealership</span> <span>(Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson)</span></p></div></div></div><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/privacy/ticketmaster-data-breach-exposes-560-million-customers-data-says-it-group/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong><u>TICKETMASTER DATA BREACH EXPOSES 560 MILLION CUSTOMERS’ DATA SAYS IT GROUP</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>Cybersecurity lessons you can learn from the CDK global attack</strong></h2><p>The CDK Global cyberattack serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in our digital world and the far-reaching consequences of such breaches. This incident underscores several key security considerations you should take into account:</p><h3><strong>1. Ransomware awareness and prevention</strong></h3><p>The revelation that the attack involved <a href="https://cyberguy.com/privacy/ransomware-reality-check-as-us-is-top-target-of-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ransomware</a> highlights the ongoing threat posed by this type of malware. It's a reminder that you need to be vigilant about the security of your personal devices. Here are some steps you can take:</p><p><strong>Regular backups:</strong> Ensure that you regularly back up important data to an <a href="https://cyberguy.com/kurts-picks/best-external-hard-drives/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>external hard drive</u></a> or a <a href="https://cyberguy.com/kurts-picks/space-running-low-securely-store-heavy-files-free-cloud-storage-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>secure cloud service</u></a>. This can help you recover your data without paying a ransom if your device is compromised.</p><p><strong>Update software:</strong> Keep your operating system, antivirus software and all applications <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/how-to-update-your-devices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>up to date</u></a> to protect against known vulnerabilities.</p><p><strong>Email caution:</strong> Be wary of <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/outsmart-spammers-to-finally-end-unsolicited-emails/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>unsolicited emails</u></a>, especially those with attachments or links. <a href="https://cyberguy.com/privacy/dont-fall-for-these-7-fake-phishing-emails/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Phishing emails</u></a> are a common method for delivering ransomware. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any phishing emails or ransomware scams. <a href="https://cyberguy.com/security/best-antivirus-protection/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices</u></a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE U.S. NEWS</strong></a></p><h3><strong>2. Strong authentication and access controls</strong></h3><p>While the CDK attack involved always-on VPN connections, the principle of strong authentication applies to you as well. Protect your accounts with:</p><p><strong>Two-factor authentication (2FA):</strong> Enable <a href="https://cyberguy.com/how-to/what-is-two-factor-authentication-and-why-should-i-enable-it/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>2FA</u></a> on all accounts that offer it. This adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password.</p><p><strong>Unique passwords:</strong> Use unique, complex passwords for different accounts. Consider using a <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/best-password-managers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>password manager</u></a> to keep track of them.</p><h3><strong>3. Incident response and personal data protection</strong></h3><p>The prolonged outage and its impact on dealership operations underscore the need for you to have your own incident response plan:</p><p><strong>Know your recovery steps:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the steps to take if your device is compromised, such as disconnecting from the internet, <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/how-to-install-antivirus-software-onto-your-devices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>running antivirus scans</u></a> and <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/how-to-back-up-and-restore-your-mobile-device/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>restoring from backups</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Protect personal information:</strong> Be cautious about sharing personal information online. Use privacy settings on social media and be mindful of the data you share with various services.</p><h3><strong>4. Regular security audits</strong></h3><p>Just as businesses need to assess their security regularly, you should also:</p><p><strong>Review account activity:</strong> Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorized transactions.</p><p><strong>Security settings:</strong> Periodically review and update the security settings on your devices and online accounts.</p><p>By taking these proactive steps, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to cyberattacks. The CDK Global incident serves as a powerful reminder that cybersecurity is not just a concern for businesses but for you and everyone in our increasingly digital world.</p><h2><strong>Kurt’s key takeaways</strong></h2><p>When a company of CDK’s scale is affected by a ransomware attack, it disrupts the whole market, which is something we are witnessing right now. Many dealerships in the U.S. use CDK Global’s software, meaning their business is paralyzed unless they can find another alternative. The company should work on tightening its security systems and hurry to deal with cybercriminals to minimize the losses suffered by dealerships.</p><p><a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p><p>What role should government and regulatory bodies play in supporting businesses affected by ransomware attacks?

<ol>
<li><strong>Record-breaking travel expected</strong>: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) expects to screen over 32 million passengers at US airports from June 27 to July 8, a 5.4% increase over last year's Independence Day holiday.</li>
<li><strong>Long lines and airport congestion expected</strong>: With a record number of travelers, airport security lines and congestion are likely to be severe, making for a challenging travel experience.</li>
<li><strong>TSA prepared for security lines</strong>: TSA Administrator David Pekoske assures that the agency is ready to handle the increased traffic, but it's still crucial for travelers to plan ahead and arrive early at the airport.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid travel chaos by planning ahead</strong>: By expecting long lines and congestion, travelers can take precautions to minimize the impact. The article suggests checking TSA's website for security wait times and planning accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Alternative travel options may be sought</strong>: The article's mention of "hurricane you'll actually like" and "latest transportation tangles and troubles" suggests that travelers may seek alternative modes of transportation or destinations, and this could lead to an interesting shift in travel patterns and preferences.</li>

            The Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen more than 32 million folks at US airports from June 27 through July 8.

            Tractor Supply Company has eliminated its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives as part of what the retail chain says is a push to distance itself from “nonbusiness activities” after conservative backlash from some of its customer base.

            In a news release Thursday, Tractor Supply, which advertises itself as the country’s “largest rural lifestyle retailer,” said it will stop sponsoring activities like “pride festivals and voting campaigns” and would be cutting DEI roles and “retire (its) current DEI goals while still ensuring a respectful environment.”

            The about-face comes less than a month after right-wing commentator Robby Starbuck attacked the company’s LGBTQ-inclusive stance and DEI hiring initiatives in a series of posts on X. Starbuck, who in 2022 launched a failed bid for Tennessee’s 5th Congressional District, called on customers to boycott Tractor Supply and contact<strong> </strong>its<strong> </strong>corporate leadership.

            Shaun Harper, a professor of business, public policy and education at the University of Southern California, told CNN one reason for the conservative backlash was the fact Tractor Supply failed to tailor its DEI policy to the culture in which it operates.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly0iim0l0000356kif4jvizl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The Brentwood,<strong> </strong>Tennessee-based company, which bills itself as the largest supporter of the National FFA Organization, a non-profit supporting agricultural education, has deep ties to rural communities across 49 states. Harper says Tractor Supply’s inclusion policies should have been attuned to that specific cultural context.
    </p>

            “You can’t say you’re going to try to do at Tractor Supply what they do at the Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California — that’s definitely not going to work,” he said. “It’s what I call ‘situated DEI.’ I would say start with an emphasis on expanding opportunities for low income people, expanding access to farming for women in rural contexts, and helping people understand how more women and more people of color in the farming industry benefits everyone. And helping them understand that the diversification of the farming industry, with women and people of color doesn’t necessarily have to entail a reduction and opportunities for White male farmers.”

            Still, activists and experts say Tractor Supply’s backtrack is a blow against civil rights and LGBTQ+ protections for employees and customers.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly0hv0ez000n356kh6j5l7ax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “Homophobia, transphobia, sexism, gender discrimination, workplace sexual harassment, ableism, size-ism and racism are not going to eliminate themselves,” said Harper. “In the absence of good policy and programs within companies, the danger is that those long-standing problems are going to become exacerbated. There’s going to be more conflict between and among employees, and customers who represent various diverse groups.”
    </p>

            Tractor Supply also said it would “no longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign,” one of the biggest LGBTQ+ non-profit advocacy groups in the United States.

            It was one of more than 1,300 businesses to participate in the HRC’s Corporate Equality Index, a benchmarking survey and report measuring policies and practices relating to LGBTQ+ workplace equality.

            “Tractor Supply Co is turning its back on their own neighbors with this shortsighted decision,” Eric Bloem, vice president of Programs and Corporate Advocacy at the Human Rights Campaign, told CNN in a statement Saturday. “LGBTQ+ people live in every zip code in this country, including rural communities. We are shoppers, farmers, veterans and agriculture students. Companies from every industry work closely with us to be sure their employees and customers are respected, valued and can get the job done for their workforce and shareholders. This is why the Tractor Supply — and most of the country’s biggest employers — have worked with us for years to create inclusive policies and practices. Caving to far right extremists is only going to hurt the same folks that these businesses rely on.”

            The policy reversal is part of a wider trend of corporate vacillation over LGBTQ+ inclusion. In the face of anti-LGBTQ backlash threatening companies’ bottom line, several household brands have backed down in their support of inclusivity.

            Last year, Bud Light’s partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked an anti-trans backlash and a monthslong boycott of the beer brand, throughout which the company <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/29/tech/dylan-mulvaney-bud-light-statement/index.html">failed to take a firm stance</a> in support of Mulvaney and the transgender community. The boycott and the subsequent tepid response lost parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev as much as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/29/business/bud-light-boycott-ab-inbev-sales/index.html">$1.4 billion in sales</a>, as well as its credibility with a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/19/business/hrc-rating-bud-light/index.html">major LGBTQ+ non-profit</a>.

            While bowing to consumer backlash might seem like the safest strategy to claw back revenue lost in a boycott, it can also be shortsighted. Harper argues few companies consider the potential<strong> </strong>cost of litigation<strong> </strong>from customers and employees.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly0i9xkz000t356klijprzpk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “So much money gets wasted on settlements or damages for discrimination and harassment,” he said. “I want companies to not just think about sales, but also about the cost of litigation, as well as the reputational costs. Those are the parts that business leaders aren’t thinking about as they are folding on DEI.”

    <div><div class="wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content css-ibbk12" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"><p class="tr-story-p1">Nike’s stock has plunged as a forecast for a surprise drop in annual sales amplified investor concerns about the pace of the sportswear giant’s efforts to stem market share losses to upstart brands such as On and Hoka.</p>
<p>It was the worst day ever for the stock, which slumped 20 percent on Friday, with the losses wiping out $28.41bn from the company’s market valuation.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 4 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 4 of 4</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>On Thursday, the company had projected a mid-single-digit percentage fall in fiscal 2025 revenue, compared with analysts’ estimates of a near 1 percent rise.</p>
<p>“Nike is at a point where they want to put out the most conservative guidance they can, such that they’re setting the bar low for themselves and hopefully it’s a bar they can beat,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.</p>
<p>Its forecast dragged shares of rivals and sportswear retailers across Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States on Friday.</p>
<p>British sportswear retailer JD Sports lost 5.4 percent at Friday’s close, while Germany’s Puma fell 1 percent. Adidas’s shares were up marginally.</p>
<p>“Nike’s been under pressure for a couple of years now. I certainly think they have an opportunity now that the valuation’s been reset extremely low to start getting some sponsorship, but it’s just not going to happen today or this week,” Hogan added.</p>
<p>The company’s US market share in the sports footwear category fell to 34.97 percent in 2023 from 35.37 percent in 2022, and 35.4 percent in 2021, according to GlobalData.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other sporting goods brands such as Hoka, Asics, New Balance and On accounted for 35 percent of the global market share in 2023 compared with the 20 percent held over the 2013-2020 period, according to a June RBC research report.</p>
<p>To curb a worsening sales decline, Nike has cut back on oversupplied brands including Air Force 1, as part of a $2bn cost-cutting plan launched late last year.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Americas Coverage Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>The sportswear giant is also tweaking its product lineup to roll out new $100-and-under sneakers in countries around the world to appeal to price-conscious consumers.</p>
<p>It will also roll out this year an Air Max version and Pegasus 41 with a full-length foam midsole made from ReactX to boost sustainability.</p>
<p>“This is still Nike, and we expect their size and scale to prove a long-term competitive advantage, but the burden of proof [is] on management execution at this point,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel.</p>
<h2 id="management-shakeout">Management shakeout?</h2>
<p>The underperformance over the past year has led to some Wall Street analysts raising the possibility of a management shake-up ahead of the company’s investor day this fall.</p>
<p>“In retail, if you have two bad quarters, you’re usually out the door,” said Jessica Ramirez, senior analyst at Jane Hali &amp; Associates.</p>
<p>“I think it [a leadership change] is very much needed.”</p>
<p>CEO John Donahoe is in his fourth year of a five-year commitment as Nike’s top boss. The former eBay CEO, who succeeded Mark Parker, was hired to focus on strengthening the company’s digital channel sales.</p>
<p>“I have seen Nike’s plans for the future, and wholeheartedly believe in them. I am optimistic in Nike’s future, and John Donahoe has my unwavering confidence and full support,” Phil Knight, co-founder and chairman emeritus, said in a statement.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>At least six brokerages downgraded the stock, and 15 cut their price targets.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The pavilion's design is inspired by tidal ecosystems and features biomimicry elements</strong>: The pavilion's design was influenced by the flora and fauna of tidal ecosystems, with the aim of evoking the natural world through its aesthetic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Re:Right Design is pushing the boundaries of what is possible with sustainable materials in large-scale installations</strong>: The company's founders, Kostur and Simon Carroll, aim to explore the creative potential of sustainable materials in large-scale installations, with a focus on both practical and aesthetic applications.</p>

<p>"It's important to note that we should absolutely not over-exploit the ocean like we've done with the land, and we need to build solid and truly sustainable farming methods based on research before we dream about saving the Earth with seaweed," Kostur said.</p>
<p>"But if we are able to achieve that, there are so many potential benefits to seaweed. It can replace certain kinds of plastic, obviously, but it can also help decarbonize the economy, clean up the oceans, rebuild marine ecosystems and even feed people. It is quite a super material."</p>
<p>The bioplastic featured in the installation is made using red and brown seaweed, sourced locally from around Europe and the UK. This is mixed with vegetable pigments like cabbage and beetroot for colour and sometimes with mineral pigments that provide a pearly opalescence.</p>
<p>Kostur's minimal-intervention approach creates a material that – unlike a fossil plastic or an industrialised bioplastic like polylactic acid (<a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/polylactic-acid/">PLA</a>) – is entirely home-compostable and will degrade in soil in a matter of weeks, the studio claims.</p>
<p>"PLA is becoming very common but it requires industrialised composting, so temperatures in excess of 70 degrees, to break it down," Carroll said. "That's a huge energy input. Whereas what we're doing will break down on its own."</p>

<li><strong>Fed's preferred inflation gauge reaches 2.6%</strong>: The Personal Consumption Expenditure price index, the Federal Reserve's most closely monitored inflation measure, has reached its lowest level since March 2021, trending towards the Fed's 2% target.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation expectations solidify rate cut predictions</strong>: The inflation figures lead to market expectations for interest rate cuts, with September being seen as the most likely month for the first rate cut, followed by another by the end of the year and potentially three more next year.</li>
<li><strong>Donald Trump's win probabilities increase</strong>: The odds of Trump winning the presidential election have increased to about 60% after the first debate, while President Joe Biden's performance was widely viewed as disappointing.</li>
<li><strong>Economists question policies of both candidates</strong>: Economists say that the policies of both Trump and Biden are inflationary and fail to address the fiscal and debt issues facing the US economy.</li>
<li><strong>Stock market performance:</strong> Strong earnings reports and optimistic guidance led to double-digit share price increases for companies like FedEx Corp. and Carnival Corp., while companies like Walgreens Boots Alliance and Nike Inc. plummeted over 20% due to disappointing quarterly results.</li>

            Walgreens said Thursday that it<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/business/walgreens-closures/index.html"> plans to close a “significant” number</a> of its roughly 8,600 stores in the United States. Around 25% of Walgreens’ stores aren’t profitable, and the chain will look to close stores that are right by one another or struggling to hold down theft, CEO Tim Wentworth said in an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/walgreens-plans-major-u-s-store-closures-0b04a96e?mod=hp_lead_pos10" target="_blank">interview</a> with the Wall Street Journal.

            Walgreens and other retailers have been hit by shoplifting and resorted to locking up items or closing high-theft stores since the pandemic, but Walgreens’ problems are much deeper, including competition and failed growth strategies. Walgreens admitted last year it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/06/business/walgreens-shoplifting-retail/index.html">“cried too much”</a> over the business impact of shoplifting.

            The latest closures are part of a larger downturn, not just for Walgreens, but for other drug store chains, too, after years of expansion. Walgreens said in 2019 it would close 200 stores and last year announced an additional 150 store closures.

            CVS, the largest US chain, closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020. In 2021, it announced plans to close 900 stores. And Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy last year and will close up to 500 stores.

            Drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxxn2uki000c3b6ktuidntak@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The majority of drugstores’ sales comes from filling prescriptions. But their profits from that business have dropped in recent years because of lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs and higher fees.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxxpasxg00073b6k8hz12vg2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The prices customers pay for drugs and the payments pharmacies receive are largely determined by pharmacy benefit managers, known as PBMs, which negotiate rebates from drug manufacturers to insurers. PBMs have been cutting reimbursement rates to boost their own profits, said Elizabeth Anderson, an analyst at Evercore IRI.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxxs8h7900033b6knp03kkj6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The pharmacy industry has <a href="https://www.nacds.org/pdfs/pharmacy/2020/Pharmacy-Reimbursement-2020.pdf" target="_blank">complained</a> that PBMs have too much control over the industry and can squeeze pharmacies. PBMs <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559746/" target="_blank">argue</a> that they help keep drug prices down by negotiating with drug makers.

            “If reimbursement rates start to come down and drug stores can’t offset it with other growth, then it has a negative impact on their profitability,” she said.

            At the same time, the rest of the store that’s supposed to pad the profit margins aren’t doing it so much anymore.

            The front end of drug stores, where they sell snacks and household staples, have become less profitable, as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart and Costco. Both have grown in recent years. Dollar General’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/19/business/cvs-store-closings-dollar-general-retail/index.html#:~:text=CVS%20is%20heading%20in%20the,10%20of%20its%20outdated%20locations.">growth has also hurt drug store chains</a> in rural areas.

            Walgreens, CVS and other drug stores have moved into primary care to try to lure in shoppers, adding doctors’ offices to hundreds of stores. Walgreens took a $5.2 billion stake in VillageMD, a primary care network, in 2021.

            When pharmacies close, some patients have to travel farther to get the medications they need. Researchers find pharmacy closures lead to health risks such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6481442/" target="_blank">older adults failing to take medication</a>.

            Roughly one out of every eight pharmacies closed between 2009 and 2015, which disproportionately affected independent pharmacies and low-income neighborhoods, according to a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2753258" target="_blank">study</a> published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

            The study found that pharmacies at greatest risk for closures are those with a large customer base on public insurance, which have lower reimbursement rates than private plans, as well as independent pharmacies.

<li><strong>Donation to charity:</strong> Buffett announced that he has donated another $5.3 billion of Berkshire Hathaway's shares to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and four of his family's foundations, bringing the total value of gifts to around $55 billion over the last 18 years.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>A survey by McKinsey &amp; Co. found that nearly half (47%) of electric car owners in the US are "very" likely to switch to a gasoline-powered vehicle when their current car needs to be replaced.</li>
<li>The top reason for this decision was difficulty in finding a place to recharge, cited by 35% of respondents, while the second reason was a shock at learning that electric cars are more expensive to own and operate, cited by 34%.</li>
<li>The US government has failed to improve the charging infrastructure, with only 7 federally-funded charging stations built to date despite a commitment to build 500,000 by the end of the decade.</li>
<li>Costco has built more functioning charging stations than the federal government, without using any federal dollars, highlighting the lack of progress on building a nationwide charging network.</li>
<li>Electric cars are indeed more expensive to own and operate, with examples cited in the article including the high cost of recharging and the time required to do so, as well as the additional taxes associated with refueling.</li>

    <div><div id="mainArticleDiv" itemprop="articleBody">
                    <p>A survey completed by McKinsey &amp; Co. of electric car owners in the United States found, to their amazement, that almost half of the electron burner owners were "very" likely to dump their watt wagon and buy a gasoline-powered vehicle when it comes time to get new transportation.</p>

<p>Automotive News quotes Philipp Kampshoff, who is in charge of McKinsey’s Center for Future Mobility, expressing his surprise, "I didn’t expect that, I thought, 'Once an EV buyer, always an EV buyer.'"</p>

<p>This is the quality of thought we’ve learned to expect from McKinsey since the consulting firm inflicted Pete Buttigieg on an unsuspecting American public.</p>

<p>Once the wizards at McKinsey came to, here’s what we learned.</p>

<p>In the U.S., the number one reason, at 35%, for returning to the folds of reliable fossil fuel transportation was the difficulty in finding someplace to recharge.</p>

<p>We’ve been writing about this particular EV foible for quite some time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/reagan/california-epa-epstein/2023/04/15/id/1116267/">Here</a> you can learn how the charging situation isn’t likely to improve because the Biden administration is busy ordering natural gas-powered power plants to close, while at the same time failing to build the charging infrastructure necessary to keep electric cars humming down the road.</p>

<p>As Fox Business points out, "To further Biden’s EV agenda, Democrats passed infrastructure legislation in 2021 that committed billions of taxpayer dollars to building a half million charging stations in the U.S. by the end of the decade.</p>

<p>"But three years later, only seven federally funded chargers have been built to date."</p>

<p>Costco currently has more chargers functioning than the Biden administration and that company didn’t use any federal dollars to do it.</p>

<p>The second reason for second thoughts among disgruntled amperage auto owners — 34 percent — was their shock at learning the EV lobby had been lying all along.</p>

<p>It’s <em><u>more</u> </em>expensive to own and operate electric cars.</p>

<p>We knew that, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/reagan/battery-electricity-wind/2023/09/15/id/1134658/">Here</a> you can learn how U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm started a clown car caravan to show the rubes in flyover country how great owning an EV really was.</p>

<p>When it came time to recharge Her Highness Granholm’s luxury Cadillac, it took 40 minutes to add 60% to its battery according to Inside EV, and cost up to $45.00 depending on where your charger is located and the brownout situation.</p>

<p>And that didn’t include the time tax.</p>

<p>Unless you’re in line for the really cheap gas at the discount club wholesale warehouse, refueling a carbon carriage takes about five minutes. On most occasions you don’t even have time to run to the bathroom before you’re finished.</p>

<p>That’s not how it works with EVs. The recharging process involves so much time you can take a book to the bathroom and still have plenty of time to wait.</p>

<p>The third reason for fossil reconciliation — at 32% — was the range of a voltage vehicle was too limited.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/reagan/charge-ford-gmc-hybrid/2022/07/09/id/1078022/">Here</a> you can read the results of a test between an EV pickup (a contradiction in terms if you ask us) and a gas-burner.</p>

<p>The electric truck was a Ford F-150 pickup and the driver quickly learned campers considering using an electric vehicle to tow their trailer will have to adjust to playing charger leapfrog every 80 miles or so with at least an hour spent calculating how much carbon you offset at each stop as you wait for the charge to finish.</p>

<p>Electric vehicles, like the rest of the clean energy scam are all hype and hypocrisy with no performance in the real world.</p>

<p>We welcome EV owners return to sanity.</p>

<p>We only regret that it was such an expensive lesson for them.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Nvidia's "full stack" approach gives it an advantage in AI</strong>: Ben Reitzes, a managing director at Melius Research, believes that Nvidia's hardware and software "full stack" approach allows it to dominate the AI market.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nvidia's innovation cadence is a key advantage</strong>: Reitzes notes that Nvidia's annual cadence of innovating new products gives it a competitive edge over rivals. This allows developers and customers to plan for upgrades and budgets accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Nvidia's potential for shareholder returns</strong>: Melius Research estimates that Nvidia will generate $270 billion in cash over the next three years, setting the stage for significant shareholder returns.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nvidia's focus on cash returns to shareholders</strong>: Although Nvidia has been returning capital to shareholders, Reitzes believes that the company will focus on cash returns, potentially in the form of stock buybacks. He suggests that management may be hesitant to discuss buybacks due to their association with older companies, but that the data shows potential for huge shareholder returns.</p>

<p>Ben Reitzes, a managing director and head of technology research at Melius Research, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/26/expect-nvidia-to-deliver-more-cash-to-shareholders-says-melius-ben-reitzes.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/26/expect-nvidia-to-deliver-more-cash-to-shareholders-says-melius-ben-reitzes.html" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/26/expect-nvidia-to-deliver-more-cash-to-shareholders-says-melius-ben-reitzes.html" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">told CNBC on Wednesday</a> that Jensen Huang’s Nvidia has mastered a “full stack” approach with its hardware and software, giving it a key advantage in AI.</p>



<p>“What they did is they built a computing language and an ecosystem that allows you to monetize AI, and obviously they’re killing it,” he said. </p>



<p>Reitzes has a price target of $160 on Nvidia stock, implying a 30% gain from Friday’s closing price. Despite an <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/25/nvidia-jensen-huang-shares-market-cap-value-shareholder-meeting/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/25/nvidia-jensen-huang-shares-market-cap-value-shareholder-meeting/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/06/25/nvidia-jensen-huang-shares-market-cap-value-shareholder-meeting/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">ongoing selloff</a> that began earlier this month, shares have soared 150% so far this year after more than tripling in 2023. Among the Magnificent 7 stocks that he covers, Nvidia has the most upside ahead, he added.</p>



<p>Another big advantage Nvidia has over rivals is its annual cadence of innovating new products, Reitzes said. That means developers and customers will know where Nvidia is headed and can a budget for upgrades accordingly. </p><p></p>



<p>“And they’re running 150 miles an hour while everyone else is running 100. It’s going to be hard to catch these guys,” he said.</p>



<p>Given Nvidia’s edge in the booming AI space, Melius Research projects the company will generate $270 billion in cash over the next three years, potentially setting the stage for huge shareholder returns. </p>



<p>Management may not be eager to tout the possibility of stock buybacks as those are often associated with older companies, Reitzes said. But in his view, it’s obvious.</p>



<p>“No one’s talking about it, and when you do the model we do, it’s a cash gusher,” he said. “And there’s nothing they can do. This government’s not going to let them buy anything big. They can’t invest that much in R&amp;D. It’s just not possible. So we gotta get it as shareholders.” </p>



<p>To be sure, Nvidia has been returning capital to shareholders. In August, it announced a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidias-frankfurt-shares-surge-stellar-results-seen-keeping-ai-rally-alive-2023-08-24/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidias-frankfurt-shares-surge-stellar-results-seen-keeping-ai-rally-alive-2023-08-24/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidias-frankfurt-shares-surge-stellar-results-seen-keeping-ai-rally-alive-2023-08-24/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">$25 billion repurchase program</a>. And last month, Nvidia boosted its quarterly cash dividend by 150% from $0.04 per share to $0.10, equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis.</p><p></p>



<p>Nvidia declined to comment about the possibility of more stock buybacks.</p>



<p>For his part, Reitzes was quick to point out that any future buybacks wouldn’t imply that Nvidia has stopped growing. “It’s not an insult to buy back stocks if you have nothing else to do.”</p>



<p>Nvidia’s recent financials show that its ability to generate cash is accelerating. In the <a href="https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2024/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2024/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2024/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">fiscal year</a> that ended in January, Nvidia’s net cash provided by operating activities soared to $28.1 billion from $5.6 billion in the prior year.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>And in the <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2025" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2025" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2025" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">first quarter</a> that ended in April, net cash provided by operating activities was $15.3 billion—already more than half of last year’s total.</p>
