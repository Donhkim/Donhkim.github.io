            Boeing executives presented sweeping changes to the company’s production process and safety systems in a three-hour meeting with the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday. The plan is meant to reassure the public, airline customers and regulators that the troubled company’s planes are safe to fly.

            Boeing’s plan could also shed new light on the findings of FAA inspectors at Boeing’s Renton, Washington, facility that builds the 737 Max, as well as the Wichita, Kansas, plant of key supplier Spirit AeroSystems. The FAA provided the findings to both companies but shielded the report from public view and has so far declined CNN requests for a copy.

            Boeing has begun implementing changes within its production process that it says will produce safer airplanes.

            Whitaker ordered the plan from Boeing after reviewing the findings of FAA auditors who visited the company’s 737 Max assembly line. The auditors were deployed in response to the January 5 door plug blowout on Alaska Airlines flight 1282, a months-old Max. The National Transportation Safety Board believes Boeing delivered the plane to the airline <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/business/ntsb-boeing-alaska-door-plug-blowout-faa/index.html">without critical bolts that hold the door plug in place</a>, and Calhoun admitted to a “quality escape.”

            It was the second grounding since the first 737 Max delivery in 2017. The Max 8 spent 20 months grounded after crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.

            The plan may be one of Boeing’s last major milestones under Calhoun, who announced in the wake of the blowout he would join other senior managers in leaving the company this year. The corporate board has a search underway for a new chief executive.

According to a Thursday announcement from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, users of these bed rails can become entrapped within the bed rail itself or between the product and the side of a mattress when it's attached to a bed. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">This poses “a serious entrapment hazard and risk of death by asphyxiation,” the CPSC notes.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">To date, the commission added, Medline has received two reports of entrapment deaths associated with the recalled Bed Assist Bars in the U.S — involving a 76-year-old woman who died in an Iowa senior nursing facility in 2019, and a 87-year-old woman who died at a South Carolina residential care facility in 2023.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">One additional injury in the U.S. has also been reported, according a Health Canada announcement. No injuries or incidents in Canada were reported to Medline as of Monday, Health Canada said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Medline said in a statement that it understands "that in the instances of reported entrapment deaths associated with the bed assist bars, the bed rails were not securely attached to the bed and the users became entrapped between the rail and mattress.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The company based in Northfield, Illinois, said it encourages all customers to read warnings and instructions of its products. Still, it said it's important for impacted customers to participate in this recall — noting that it had worked closely with the CPSC and “fully supports the agency’s commitment to consumer safety.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Medline sold about 1.5 million of the now-recalled Bed Assist Bars from July 2009 through March 2024 in the U.S. — through its own websites and major retailers online, including <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/Amazon" id="_ap_link_Amazon_Amazon_" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and Walmart.

More than 5,500 were additionally sold in Canada between February 2013 and March 2024.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The recalled bed rails, which were manufactured in China, can be identified by two model numbers: MDS6800BA and MDS6800BAH. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The CPSC and Health Canada urges consumers in possession of these products to stop using them immediately — and contact Medline to request a refund.</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li>John Williams, President of the New York Federal Reserve, expects inflation to start decreasing again in the second half of the year, but not quickly enough to warrant a rate cut until further progress is made.</li>
<li>Williams reiterated that the Federal Reserve won't lower interest rates until inflation is shown to be making sustainable progress towards the 2% target.</li>
<li>The New York Fed president expects the economy to continue growing, with the unemployment rate ending the year at around 4% and then gradually dropping to 3.75%.</li>
<li>Williams foresees inflation ending the year at 2.5%, down from the current rate of 2.7%, and does not expect a rate hike this year.</li>
<li>The author of the article notes that some Federal Reserve officials have expressed a willingness to raise rates if needed, but Williams' comments suggest that a rate hike is unlikely at this time.</li>

<li><strong>Consumers and businesses are being cautious about spending due to elevated inflation and interest rates</strong>: Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan noted that both consumers and small- to medium-sized businesses are slowing down their purchases, including hard goods and software.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer spending growth has slowed down significantly</strong>: Moynihan reported that consumer spending has grown by about 3.5% this year, down from a 10% growth rate seen in May 2023.</li>
<li><strong>The slowdown began last summer and is consistent with a "very low growth" environment</strong>: Moynihan noted that the slowdown started last summer and is similar to the low-growth period from 2016 to 2018.</li>
<li><strong>Consumers are grappling with higher prices and borrowing costs</strong>: Many consumers are still adjusting to higher prices for goods and services, which has impacted US companies, including McDonald's and discount retailers.</li>
<li><strong>The Federal Reserve's efforts to tame inflation may have helped the economy avoid recession</strong>: While the high inflation and interest rates have been a challenge for consumers, the Federal Reserve's efforts to curb inflation have helped the stock market reach new highs this year.</li>

That’s a sharp slowdown from the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/24/bank-of-america-ceo-says-nothing-will-slow-us-consumer-from-spending-money.html">nearly 10%</a> growth rate seen in May 2023, he said.</p><p>“Both of our customer bases that have a lot to do with how the American economy runs are saying, ‘You know what? I’m being careful, slowing things down,’” Moynihan said, referring to consumers and businesses.</p><p>The slowdown began last summer and is consistent with the “very low growth” environment of the period from 2016 through 2018, he said.</p><p>Nearly a year after the last Federal Reserve rate increase, consumers and businesses are wrestling with inflation and borrowing costs that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/30/feds-williams-says-inflation-is-too-high-but-will-start-coming-down-soon.html">remain higher</a> than they are accustomed to. The Fed began efforts to tame inflation by hiking its benchmark rate starting in March 2022, hoping it could slow the economy without tipping it into recession.</p><p>Many economists believe the Fed is on track to pull off that feat, which has helped the stock market reach new highs this year. But consumers are still grappling with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/06/cramer-says-many-retailers-have-raised-prices-too-high.html">higher prices</a> for goods and services, and that has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/07/retail-earnings-what-we-know-about-the-consumer-so-far.html">impacted</a> U.S. companies from <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-stories/article/providing-meaningful-value-to-our-fans-with-a-side-of-facts.html#:~:text=The%20average%20price%20of%20a,21%25%20(not%20100%25)." target="_blank">McDonald’s</a> to discount retailers as Americans adjust their behavior.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>Food shoppers are hitting up more store locations in search of deals, according to Moynihan. “They’re going to three grocery stores instead of two, is one of the stats we see,” he said.</p><p>The now-tepid growth in overall spending is being propped up by travel and entertainment, while “other things have moderated, except for insurance payments,” Moynihan said. Growth in rent payments has slowed, he noted.</p><p>“We’ve got to keep the consumer in the game in the U.S. economy, because [they’re] such a big part of it,” Moynihan said. “They’re getting a little more tenuous, and that is due to everything going on around them.”</p><p>The same is true for small- and medium-sized businesses, the Bank of America CEO said. His company is the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, after <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-8"><a href="/quotes/JPM/">JPMorgan Chase</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span>. Moynihan and other bank CEOs have a bird’s-eye view of the economy, given their coast-to-coast coverage of households and companies.</p><p>Business owners are saying, ”‘I still feel good about my overall business, but I’m not hiring as much. I’m not buying equipment as fast. I’m not making software purchases as fast,’” Moynihan said.</p><p>The bank’s economists believe that inflation will take until the end of next year to get under control and that the Fed will begin cutting interest rates later this year, Moynihan said. The U.S. economy will probably grow at around a 2% level, avoiding recession, he added.</p></div></div>

Meanwhile, a host of other retailers report earnings Thursday, including Dollar General and Costco.</p><h3 class="vPZug oPAle xcLAU bunQU uhXXI PjNjV lNbol LBPRq">Shoppers' savings</h3><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">A number of big retailers are lowering prices as they strive to pull consumers into stores and online to spend more freely on both essential purchases such as food and more discretionary purchases like new clothes, decorative items for the home, arts and crafts or hobby kits.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Retailers are feeling jittery after they hiked up prices as inflation spiked in recent years. But now, households aren't shopping like they used to, and high prices are forcing Americans to choose between wants and needs. In the game of chicken between stores and shoppers, it's the stores that finally appear to be yielding.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">That presents an ongoing challenge for the whole American economy, of which about two-thirds comes from consumer spending.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Shoppers have pulled back for a year now as costs have risen 20% to 30% higher than they were three years ago and as incomes failed to keep up, said Sarah Wyeth, managing director, retail and consumer with S&amp;P Global Ratings.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">This is making consumers across income levels look for deals. "There's just less dollars for consumers to spend," Wyeth said. The challenge for retailers now is to shake consumers out of that frugal mindset, she added.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN"><em>The-CNN-Wire  &amp;  2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Elon Musk is seeking approval from Tesla shareholders to pay himself a massive compensation package valued at up to $56 billion, despite a Delaware judge previously blocking the deal due to concerns over its size and Musk's ties to the board.</li>
<li>The proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis has recommended that shareholders reject the package, citing concerns about its size and the potential impact on the company. Tesla has responded by accusing Glass Lewis of using "faulty logic" and relying on "speculation and hypotheticals" in its analysis.</li>
<li>Tesla has put Glass Lewis on blast, issuing a strongly worded letter to investors criticizing the firm's report and claiming that it "omits key considerations" and uses "faulty logic".</li>
<li>The compensation package was originally approved by shareholders in 2018, but was later blocked by a Delaware judge due to concerns over its size and Musk's ties to the board. It is now up for vote again at the upcoming shareholder meeting on June 13.</li>
<li>Additionally, the shareholder meeting will also consider a proposal to relocate Tesla's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas, a move that has been motivated by the former state's decision to block Musk's payout.</li>

Also on the agenda is the proposal to relocate Tesla's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas — a move undoubtedly motivated by the former state's decision to block Musk's payout.</p><p>Glass Lewis advised against the payment package back then, and it hasn't changed its tune now. In a lengthy report, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/tesla-shareholders-advised-to-vote-against-musks-pay-package-d49a1c59" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">the firm warned</a> that approving the compensation — which is doled out in stock options — would dilute existing shares in the company, as well as make Musk the largest stakeholder by a considerable margin.</p><p>Beyond that, it also questioned Musk's "focus" on the company — given that he pursues other lucrative (and less lucrative) ventures — and the financial benefits of relocating Tesla to Texas.</p><p>"The excessive size of the award, both on a pure dollar basis and in terms of the dilutive effect upon exercise, remains very much top of mind," the report said, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/tesla-shareholders-advised-to-vote-against-musks-pay-package-d49a1c59" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">as quoted by <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></a>. "The company’s provided rationale does little to combat these concerns given their proportionate magnitude."</p><p>Tesla's rebuke of the Glass Lewis letter confidently asserts that this is all hogwash. It also haughtily proclaims that Tesla is "one of the most successful enterprises of our time."</p><p>But all that self-aggrandizing talk may not be enough to sway everyone in the Tesla camp. Musk is more polarizing than ever, and even though Tesla's valuation is still astoundingly high, it's suffering an <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/teslas-nightmare-year-horrible-start" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">absolute nightmare of a year</a>, falling short of delivery goals last quarter and looking ever more inept <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/youtuber-melts-down-lemon-cybertruck-replacement" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">with its shoddy Cybertruck</a>.</p><p>Perhaps the automaker should have bigger priorities than ensuring Musk, whose net worth <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">already exceeds $200 billion</a>, gets dozens of billions more.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>American Airlines has canceled plans to change its booking experience, which would have affected how passengers earn miles and Loyalty Points.</li>
<li>The planned changes would have only allowed passengers to earn miles and Loyalty Points if they booked directly with the airline or through a preferred channel, excluding some third-party booking platforms.</li>
<li>American Airlines' CEO, Robert Isom, stated that the changes were being scrapped due to confusion and disruption caused by the new policy.</li>
<li>Isom emphasized the importance of "modern retailing" and "New Distribution Capability" (NDC), which allows for a better customer experience when booking directly with the airline or with preferred partners.</li>
<li>The planned changes were originally set to take effect May 1, but had already been pushed back to July 11 before being canceled altogether.</li>

    <div><div class="Mobiledoc"><p>American Airlines is canceling <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/american-airlines-mile-changes-bag-fees/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes that it planned to make to its booking experience</a>, which would have seen some passengers become ineligible for earning miles or Loyalty Points.</p><p>Under the originally planned changes, passengers on American would only earn frequent flyer miles and Loyalty Points, or credits for elite status on the airline, if they had booked their ticket either directly with the airline or through one of its preferred channels. A variety of third-party booking platforms would have potentially been excluded, including some corporate travel-booking portals.</p><p><strong>Want more airline-specific news? <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/aviation-newsletter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up for TPG's free biweekly Aviation newsletter</a>.</strong></p><p>Speaking at a Bernstein financial conference Wednesday, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said that the airline was scrapping the plan as part of a broader effort to pull back on its recent distribution strategy. That strategy was meant to encourage customers to book directly with the airline, meaning the carrier would not have to share a cut with a travel agent or booking service.</p><p>However, Isom said, the broader strategy, along with the specific tactic of restricting mileage earning, were creating confusion which has driven customers to book flights with rival airlines.</p><p>"That's off — we're not doing that because it would create confusion and disruption for our end customer," Isom said. "We need to work closely with our agencies and partners to ensure that the transition that we're making is not disruptive to our end customers."</p><p>"We know that NDC [<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/airline-distribution/retailing/ndc/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">New Distribution Capability</a>], modern retailing, provides a better experience for the customer," he added, referring to new distribution tools available when passengers book directly with the airline or with certain preferred partners. "We know that we will get there over time. We have to go about it differently."</p><p>The changes to mileage and elite status earning were originally slated to go into effect May 1, but <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/american-airlines-mile-changes-bag-fees/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">had already been pushed back to July 11</a>.</p><p><strong>Loyalty basics: <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/best-ways-to-earn-airline-miles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Best ways to earn airline miles</a></strong></p><div class="

American also lowered its financial outlook for the second quarter Tuesday, saying it now expects unit revenues to decline as much as 6% compared to the same quarter last year. It previously projected a drop of up to 3% compared to last year. The airline said it would cut capacity growth in the latter part of this year.</p><p>Raja was a major driver of the airline's new distribution strategy, along with other strategies that have produced disappointing results for the airline, like reducing long-haul flying in favor of booking passengers on codeshare partners, along with the airline's network strategy focusing on the so-called Sun Belt, broadly lining the southern third of the United States <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/american-airlines-forgot-it-had-jfk-slots/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">at the expense of its northern and coastal hubs</a>.</p><p>On Wednesday, Isom recommitted to the Sun Belt strategy, however, even as the airline's shares fell more than 15% following the opening bell.</p><p>"I haven't seen anything that suggests the Sun Belt cities aren't going to continue to be a real economic engine in the United States," Isom said. "Our regional network is so important," he added, referring to criticism that the airline has sacrificed some of its broader network in the interest of servicing the Sun Belt hubs.</p><p>"When you take a look at that region, our unit revenue performance has been down considerably, but it's not something that we're going to abandon," Isom added. "We're going to make sure that we're there when the [air travel market] dynamics change."</p><p><b>Related reading:</b></p></div></div>
