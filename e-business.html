They have an art of speaking to convince the opposite person,” she says.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The government and the central bank are looking at ways to protect UPI users from scammers.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But at the moment, if a victim wants compensation, they have to approach their bank.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“The problem is deep rooted," says Dr Durgesh Pandey, an expert in financial crime.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Most of the onus lies with banks and telecom companies. They are lax in making identity checks, that’s why the fraudster can’t be traced.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"But the challenge for banks particularly is that they have to balance between inclusivity, ease of business and enforcement of identity checks. If they are too rigid, the vulnerable section of society will remain without banking facilities.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But Dr Pandey argues that in most cases of fraud, the bank is not totally to blame.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“It’s a complex question because the problem lies with banks, but it’s the victim who is giving his credentials in most case.

<li><strong>Membership fees are key to profitability</strong>: Tarlowe notes that the majority of Costco's profits stem from membership fees, rather than product sales. The memberships are high-margin, recurring revenue streams with over 90% renewal rates.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation and value proposition</strong>: Corey Tarlowe attributes the timing of the fee increase to the fact that inflation has been essentially zero for the last three quarters, making the value proposition of Costco's membership more attractive than ever.</li>
<li><strong>Stock reaction</strong>: The news of the fee increase led to a 3% decline in Costco's stock price on the day the announcement was made.</li>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is awarding nearly $2 billion in grants to General Motors, Stellantis and other carmakers to help restart or expand <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/electric-vehicles">electric vehicle manufacturing</a></span> and assembly sites in eight states, including the presidential battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia.</p><p>The Energy Department will issue grants totaling $1.7 billion to create or retain thousands of union jobs and support auto-based communities that have long driven the U.S. economy, the White House said Thursday. Besides the three battleground states, grants also will go to EV facilities in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia.</p><p>The grants cover a broad range of the automotive supply chain, including parts for electric motorcycles and school buses, hybrid powertrains, heavy-duty commercial truck batteries and electric SUVs, the White House said. </p>
    

<p>“Building a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union autoworkers and automakers,’' President <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a></span> said in a statement. “This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more — from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia — by helping auto companies retool, reboot and rehire in the same factories and communities.’'</p>



<p>GM said Thursday that its $500 million federal grant will help the company convert an assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs. GM has already announced over $12 billion in investments in its North American EV manufacturing and supply chain since 2020. That investment and the federal grant “underscore our commitment to U.S. leadership in manufacturing and innovation,″ said Camilo Ballesty, GM vice president of North America Manufacturing and Labor Relations. </p>
    
<p>The grants, paid for by the landmark <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-science-congress-climate-and-environment-f084d23d61ebb068068d4aa92c82fdbb">2022 climate law,</a></span> will help deliver on his commitment to ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers, Biden said.</p>
    

<p>“Workers that were left behind by my predecessor are now making a comeback with the support of my policies, including the conversion grants my administration is announcing today,’' the Democratic president said.</p><p>The grant announcement comes as Biden rejects calls to step aside after <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-panic-performance-democrats-debate-trump-cnn-fe6546f2c9762e80e6067ba10abedea8">a disastrous debate performance</a></span> last month. Biden, 81, has acknowledged his poor performance but has brushed it off as a “bad night,’' even as many congressional Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have declined to give him a full vote of confidence.</p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Former President Donald Trump</a></span>, meanwhile, has maintained a tight grip on the Republican party, even after becoming the first former president to be <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hush-money-supreme-court-immunity-3d97d2e9497a5a208c1309aec7a0cd6a">convicted of a felony. </a></span></p><p>The grants announced Thursday come after a federal competition that included four times as many applicants as grant recipients, the Energy Department said. Officials declined to identify companies that unsuccessfully applied for grants, but said all projects that were awarded funding currently employ Americans working in union jobs in the U.S.</p><p>“There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,’' said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor. Even as competitors like China invest heavily in electric vehicles, the federal grants will help “ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive — and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations,” Granholm said.</p>
    

<p>The new grants complement $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing since Biden took office, Granholm and other officials said.</p><p>Awards are subject to negotiations to ensure that commitments to workers and communities are met, officials said. The Energy Department also will complete environmental reviews before money is awarded later this year.</p><p>If awards are completed as planned, the selected projects would create more than 2,900 jobs and help ensure that about 15,000 union workers are retained across all 11 facilities, the White House said. The grants come after successful union organizing drives from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Fort Valley, Georgia, the White House said.</p>
    

<p>“The president will not take his foot off the pedal when it comes to supporting the U.S. auto industry,’' said White House national economic adviser Lael Brainard.</p><p>Transportation accounts for the single largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution and Biden has made electric vehicles a key part of his climate agenda.</p><p>“Not only are we delivering new sources of clean transit — that iconic yellow school bus going green — but we’re also delivering to the American people options to save ... thousands of dollars of fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of a vehicle’’ by going electric, White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said.</p>

	As always, there’s one (sort of) downside to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/prime-day/" id="auto-tag_prime-day" data-tag="prime-day">Prime Day</a> this year: There are almost too many deals.

To help you find the latter type of discount, we’ve rounded up some of the best early Prime Day deals of 2024 below.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Delta Air Lines reported a revenue miss</strong>: Delta's second-quarter revenue came in at $15.41 billion, below the expected $15.45 billion consensus estimate. Despite posting record revenue, the figures still fell short of expectations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delta's CEO sees competition pressure</strong>: Delta CEO Ed Bastian attributed the revenue miss to increased domestic competition, with more seats being offered than there are passengers to fill them, resulting in lower yields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jim Cramer views Delta stock critically</strong>: CNBC's Jim Cramer warned investors that Delta's stock is only as good as the weakest competitors in the airline industry, and that management will struggle to maintain pricing discipline in the face of increased competition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delta is the most profitable airline</strong>: Despite the revenue miss, Delta remains the most profitable airline in the industry, and its lackluster quarter could put pressure on its competitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investors should consider the broader airline sector</strong>: Cramer stressed the importance of evaluating a stock's performance over time and considering its cohort's performance before buying shares. He noted that Delta's chart is "pathetic" and that the stock is "not worth owning" due to its weak performance.</p>

He said investors should understand that there is a difference between Delta as a stock and Delta as a company.</p><p>“In recent years, we’ve convinced ourselves that the airline industry has discipline on pricing, but historically, that’s not usually the case, and now there’s a skunk at the garden party,” he said. “Delta the company is terrific. Delta the airline stock is only as good as the weakest competitors, because they’re leading a race to the bottom, and that’s killing it.”</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>Although the U.S. carrier posted record revenue for the second quarter, the figures still fell below expectations, coming in at $15.41 billion versus the $15.45 billion consensus estimate from LSEG. Management reported robust summer travel demand, with CEO Ed Bastian saying on the earnings call that TSA travel volumes were up 7% from the year-earlier period. </p><p>But Bastian also said “domestic industry seat growth has accelerated through the summer months, impacting yield performance in the main cabin,” which Cramer said indicates the Atlanta-based airline has more seats than it can fill.</p><p>By Thursday’s close, Delta shares were trading down nearly 4%. Cramer also pointed out that the stock’s price hasn’t seen significant gains over the past decade.</p><p>The airline is the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/delta-air-lines-americas-luxury-airline-and-what-united-wants-to-do-about-it.html">most profitable</a> in the industry, and its lackluster quarter does not bode well for competitors. Although Cramer conceded that Delta is the best of the bunch, he stressed that investors should consider a stock’s entire sector before they buy any shares.</p><p>“If you’re going to buy a stock, any stock, first see how it’s done over time. Second, see how its cohort has done,” he said. “You can take one look at the jampacked plane and want to buy Delta Air Lines stock, or you can take one look at the pathetic chart, and know for sure that the stock’s, sadly, simply not worth owning.”</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>Delta did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="NewsShowArticle-RelatedContent-1"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO</h2></div></div></div></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="NewsShowArticle-RelatedContent-2"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Jim Cramer’s Guide to Investing</h2></div></div></div></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

That creates an environment more conducive for tropical systems to organize and strengthen.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5AVR6EMAFRGABI4O6HUO232WXM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">The La Niña outlook prompted meteorologists to this week revise a key hurricane season forecast upward, now calling for a near-record 25 named storm systems, including 12 hurricanes and six “major” hurricanes, which are rated Category 3 or higher.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V7Q2QY255FAMVLXSAAZGLI3SEM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">In the United States, La Niña is best known for warm and dry conditions across the southern tier through the winter — including Southern California, the Southwest and the Gulf Coast — and wet and snowy conditions from the Pacific Northwest to the northern Plains.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-bHCGeL-isStandardLayoutAd-true article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="cb db dn-ns" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-mobile"><div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-md mt-sm pt-sm pb-sm ad-mobile"><div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"><p class="dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md">Story continues below advertisement</p></div><p class="relative flex flex-column justify-center w-100"><wp-ad id="slug_mob_bigbox_3" class="chromatic-ignore" data-chromatic="ignore" data-slot="/701/wpni.climate-environment/extreme-weather" aria-hidden="true" data-renderbehavior="never" data-refresh="true" data-json='{"targeting":{"zeus_rendercount":"1","zeus_slot":"slug_mob_bigbox_3.init.dsk","kpi":"ctr","pos":"mob_bigbox_3","ctr":["zeus_mob_bigbox_3"],"wp_ad_refresh":"0","wp_refresh":"mob_bigbox_3_0","pwt":["mob_bigbox_3_mab_0"]}}'></wp-ad></p></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XVBLBN3D35BOVOPVVD2HM4255E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Elsewhere around the world, its effects can include floods in northern South America and across Indonesia, and drought in East Africa — conditions that could exacerbate <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/01/sudan-hunger-war/?itid=lk_inline_manual_24" target="_blank">a hunger crisis amid civil war in Sudan</a>.</p></div><p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><h4 class="wpds-c-kfvUxt wpds-c-kfvUxt-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="6QJOQWEVWRBPLNFP3GVVZGV3S4" data-apitype="header" level="4" id="6QJOQWEVWRBPLNFP3GVVZGV3S4">How is it different from El Niño?</h4></p><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y25WOTRBKJDC3FLHP2RQ2BBUBA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">El Niño is associated with warmer-than-normal temperatures across the eastern and central Pacific.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Social Security COLA increases</strong>: The cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security benefits is expected to increase to 3% in 2025, up from 2.8% in 2024, in response to rising inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation pressure mounts</strong>: The consumer price index (CPI), which measures inflation, has been increasing, causing pressure to adjust Social Security benefits to keep pace with the rising cost of living.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on seniors</strong>: The COLA increase will help mitigate the impact of inflation on seniors, who rely heavily on their Social Security benefits, which make up a significant portion of their income.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic adjustments</strong>: The COLA increase is an automatic adjustment based on the CPI, which is designed to ensure that Social Security benefits keep pace with inflation and maintain their purchasing power.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing monitoring</strong>: The Social Security Administration (SSA) will continue to closely monitor inflation and adjust the COLA as needed to ensure that Social Security benefits remain viable and effective in supporting seniors.</li>

                                        <p>GRAFTON, Mass. (AP) — When two octogenarian buddies named Nick discovered that ChatGPT might be stealing and repurposing a lifetime of their work, they tapped a son-in-law to sue the companies behind the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a></span> chatbot. </p><p>Veteran journalists Nicholas Gage, 84, and Nicholas Basbanes, 81, who live near each other in the same Massachusetts town, each devoted decades to reporting, writing and book authorship. </p><p>Gage poured his tragic family story and search for the truth about his mother’s death into a bestselling memoir that led John Malkovich to play him in the 1985 film “Eleni.” Basbanes transitioned his skills as a daily newspaper reporter into writing widely-read books about literary culture.</p><p>Basbanes was the first of the duo to try fiddling with AI chatbots, finding them impressive but prone to falsehoods and lack of attribution. The friends commiserated and filed their lawsuit earlier this year, seeking to represent a class of writers whose copyrighted work they allege “has been systematically pilfered by” OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft.</p>
    

<p>“It’s highway robbery,” Gage said in an interview in his office next to the 18th-century farmhouse where he lives in central Massachusetts.</p>



<p>“It is,” added Basbanes, as the two men perused Gage’s book-filled shelves. “We worked too hard on these tomes.”</p><p>Now their lawsuit is subsumed into a broader case seeking class-action status led by household names like John Grisham, Jodi Picoult and “Game of Thrones” novelist George R. R. Martin; and proceeding under the same New York federal judge who’s hearing similar copyright claims from media outlets such as <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nyt-new-york-times-openai-microsoft-6ea53a8ad3efa06ee4643b697df0ba57">The New York Times</a></span>, Chicago Tribune <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-media-lawsuits-center-for-investigative-reporting-chatgpt-mother-jones-c48452889750479410b65a119537746c">and Mother Jones</a></span>.</p>
    
<p>What links all the cases is the claim that OpenAI — with help from Microsoft’s money and computing power — ingested huge troves of human writings to “train” AI chatbots to produce human-like passages of text, without getting permission or compensating the people who wrote the original works.</p>
    

<p>“If they can get it for nothing, why pay for it?” Gage said. “But it’s grossly unfair and very harmful to the written word.”</p><p>OpenAI and Microsoft didn’t return requests for comment this week but have been fighting the allegations in court and in public. So have other AI companies confronting legal challenges not just from writers but <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/artists-ai-image-generators-stable-diffusion-midjourney-7ebcb6e6ddca3f165a3065c70ce85904">visual artists</a></span>, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-music-generators-sued-suno-udio-riaa-37a398d326ebb53105538f0d1088233e">music labels</a></span> and other creators who allege that generative AI profits have been built on misappropriation.</p><p>The chief executive of Microsoft’s AI division, Mustafa Suleyman, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPvqvt55l3A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defended AI industry practices</a></span> at last month’s Aspen Ideas Festival, voicing the theory that training AI systems on content that’s already on the open internet is protected by the “fair use” doctrine of U.S. copyright laws.</p><p>“The social contract of that content since the ’90s has been that it is fair use,” Suleyman said. “Anyone can copy it, recreate with it, reproduce with it. That has been freeware, if you like.”</p><p>Suleyman said it was more of a “gray area” in situations where some news organizations and others explicitly said they didn’t want tech companies “scraping” content off their websites. “I think that’s going to work its way through the courts,” he said.</p>
    

<p>The cases are still in the discovery stage and scheduled to drag into 2025. In the meantime, some who believe their professions are threatened by AI business practices have tried to secure private deals to get technology companies to pay a fee to license their archives. Others are fighting back. </p><p>“Somebody had to go out and interview real people in the real world and conduct real research by poring over documents and then synthesizing those documents and coming up with a way to render them in clear and simple prose,” said Frank Pine, executive editor of MediaNews Group, publisher of dozens of newspapers including the Denver Post, Orange County Register and St. Paul Pioneer Press. Several of the chain’s newspapers sued OpenAI in April.</p><p>“All of that is real work, and it’s work that AI cannot do,” Pine said. “An AI app is never going to leave the office and go downtown where there’s a fire and cover that fire.”</p>
    

<p>Deemed too similar to lawsuits filed late last year, the Massachusetts duo’s January complaint has been folded into a consolidated case brought by other nonfiction writers as well as fiction writers represented by the Authors Guild. That means Gage and Basbanes won’t likely be witnesses in any upcoming trial in Manhattan’s federal court. But in the twilight of their careers, they thought it important to take a stand for the future of their craft.</p><p>Gage fled Greece as a 9-year-old, haunted by his mother’s 1948 killing by firing squad during the country’s civil war. He joined his father in Worcester, Massachusetts, not far from where he lives today. And with a teacher’s nudge, he pursued writing and built a reputation as a determined investigative reporter digging into organized crime and political corruption for The New York Times and other newspapers.</p>
    

<p>Basbanes, as a Greek American journalist, had heard of and admired the elder “hotshot reporter” when he got a surprise telephone call at his desk at Worcester’s Evening Gazette in the early 1970s. The voice asked for Mr. Basbanes, using the Greek way of pronouncing the name.</p><p>“You were like a talent scout,” Basbanes said. “We established a friendship. I mean, I’ve known him longer than I know my wife, and we’ve been married 49 years.”</p><p>Basbanes hasn’t mined his own story like Gage has, but he says it can sometimes take days to craft a great paragraph and confirm all of the facts in it. It took him years of research and travel to archives and auction houses to write his 1995 book “A Gentle Madness” about the art of book collection from ancient Egypt through modern times.</p><p>“I love that ‘A Gentle Madness’ is in 1,400 libraries or so,” Basbanes said. “This is what a writer strives for -- to be read. But you also write to earn, to put food on the table, to support your family, to make a living. And as long as that’s your intellectual property, you deserve to be compensated fairly for your efforts.”</p><p>Gage took a great professional risk when he quit his job at the Times and went into $160,000 debt to find out who was responsible for his mother’s death. </p><p>“I tracked down everyone who was in the village when my mother was killed,” he said. “And they had been scattered all over Eastern Europe. So it cost a lot of money and a lot of time. I had no assurance that I would get that money back. But when you commit yourself to something as important as my mother’s story was, the risks are tremendous, the effort is tremendous.”</p><p>In other words, ChatGPT couldn’t do that. But what worries Gage is that ChatGPT could make it harder for others to do that.</p><p>“Publications are going to die. Newspapers are going to die. Young people with talent are not going to go into writing,” Gage said. “I’m 84 years old. I don’t know if this is going to be settled while I’m still around. But it’s important that a solution be found.”</p><p>————-</p><p>The Associated Press and OpenAI have <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-associated-press-ap-f86f84c5bcc2f3b98074b38521f5f75a">a licensing and technology agreement</a></span> that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives.</p>

<li>A Texas-based company called American Rounds has started manufacturing vending machines that dispense gun ammunition.</li>
<li>The company has already installed six of these machines at grocery stores in Texas, Alabama, Oklahoma, and plans to install two more in Texas and Colorado by the end of the month.</li>
<li>American Rounds claims that these vending machines are the safest way to sell ammunition, as the ammo is not accessible until the customer inserts their ID for verification.</li>
<li>According to the company's CEO, Grant Magers, most customers purchase only one or two boxes of rounds from the vending machines.</li>
<li>The company requires ID verification for all purchases, making it a unique approach in the gun ammunition sales industry.</li>

After Apple tweaked its proposals following testing and feedback, the commission said those “final commitments” would address its competition concerns.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Today’s commitments end our Apple Pay investigation,” Margrethe Vestager, the commission’s executive vice-president for competition policy, told a press briefing in Brussels. “The commitments bring important changes to how Apple operates in Europe to the benefit of competitors and customers.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Apple said in a prepared statement that it is “providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC [near-field communication] contactless payments and contactless transactions” for uses like car keys, corporate badges, hotel keys and concert tickets.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Competition watchdogs on both sides of the Atlantic have been investigating Apple’s payment tech. A sweeping justice department lawsuit filed in March accuses the company of engineering an illegal monopoly in smartphones, including charges that it limits access to contactless payment for third-party digital wallets.</p><figure id="8b354319-8216-4c16-adba-65e0f754b761" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":7,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"US accuses Apple of ‘broad, sustained, and illegal’ smartphone monopoly","elementId":"8b354319-8216-4c16-adba-65e0f754b761","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/21/us-antitrust-lawsuit-apple"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"display":0,"theme":0,"design":0}}' data-island-status="hydrated"></gu-island></figure><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The EU deal promises more choice for Europeans. Vestager said iPhone users will be able to set a default wallet of their choice while mobile wallet developers will be able to use important iPhone verification functions like Face ID.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The commission had charged the company with denying others access to Apple Pay, which it said is the biggest NFC-based mobile wallet on the market. Mobile wallets rely on NFC, which uses a chip to wirelessly communicate with a merchant’s payment terminal.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Analysts said there would be big financial incentives for companies to use their own wallets rather than letting Apple act as the middleman, resulting in savings that could trickle down to consumers. Apple charges banks 0.15% for each credit card transaction that goes through Apple Pay, according to the justice department’s lawsuit.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Apple must open up its payment system in the EU’s 27 countries plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein by 25 July.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12" class="dcr-jzxpee">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-12" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note" class="dcr-jzxpee">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“As of this date, developers will be able to offer a mobile wallet on the iPhone with the same ‘tap-and-go’ experience that so far has been reserved for Apple Pay,” Vestager said. The changes will remain in force for a decade and will be monitored by a trustee.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Breaches of EU competition law can draw fines worth up to 10% of a company’s annual global revenue, which in Apple’s case could have amounted to tens of billions of euros.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“The main advantage to the issuer bank of supporting an alternative to Apple Pay via iPhone is the reduction in fees incurred, which can be substantial,” said Philip Benton, a principal analyst at research and advisory firm Omdia. To encourage iPhone users to switch away from Apple Pay to another mobile wallet, “the fee reduction needs to be partially passed onto the consumer” through benefits like cashback or loyalty rewards, he said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Banks and consumers could also benefit in other ways.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">If companies use their own apps for tap-and-go payments, they would get “full visibility” of their customers’ transactions, said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. That data would allow them to “build brand loyalty and trust and offer more personalised services, rewards and promotions directly to the user”, he said.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers have reduced the likelihood of inflation rising further, making it more likely for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September. The odds of a cut in September now stand at 83%.</li>
<li>The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.3% year over year in June, which is lower than expected. The month-over-month core CPI also showed a muted increase, rising 0.1% after increasing 0.2% in May.</li>
<li>Some Federal Reserve watchers believe that the Fed may cut interest rates even sooner than September, possibly as early as the July 30-31 meeting, if the labor market softens at a faster clip.</li>
<li>While the latest CPI numbers are encouraging, more data is needed before the Fed makes a decision on rate cuts. The next reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures index (PCE), will also be closely watched.</li>
<li>Federal Reserve policymakers, such as San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly and St. Louis Fed president Alberto Musalem, have expressed cautious optimism about the prospect of rate cuts, with Daly noting that the time is "closer than six months ago" for policy adjustments, while Musalem said he will be looking for more evidence of inflation converging to 2% before making a decision.</li>
