    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Federal Reserve officials are watching the labor market for signs of softening</strong>: After a year of surprisingly strong job growth, the Fed is keeping a close eye on the labor market for any signs of slowing down, including fewer unfilled jobs and more people lingering on unemployment insurance rosters.</li>
<li><strong>Fed officials may cut interest rates if the labor market softens unexpectedly</strong>: In a shift in their stance, Fed officials have hinted that they could cut interest rates if the labor market unexpectedly cools, which would be a departure from their recent focus on cooling the economy to combat inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Interest rates have been stuck at a decades-long high</strong>: The Fed has kept interest rates at 5.3% since July 2023, which is making it more expensive to borrow money and has led to a slowdown in economic demand.</li>
<li><strong>The goal is to bring inflation under control</strong>: The Fed's higher interest rates are intended to slow down the economy and bring inflation under control, but officials are now monitoring the labor market to ensure that this goal is achieved without causing excessive job losses.</li>
<li><strong>Fed Chair Jerome Powell is looking for further cooling inflation data</strong>: Powell has said that he wants to see more convincing data on cooling inflation before considering rate cuts, indicating that the Fed is not yet ready to ease its policy stance.</li>

That policy setting is slowly weighing on demand across the economy, with the goal of wrestling rapid inflation fully under control.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">But as inflation cools, Fed officials have made it clear that they are trying to strike a careful balance: They want to ensure that inflation is in check, but they want to avoid upending the job market. Given that, policymakers have signaled over the past month that they would react to a sudden labor market weakening by slashing borrowing costs.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The Fed would like to see more cooling inflation data “like what we’ve been seeing recently” before cutting rates, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a speech this week. “We’d also like to see the labor market remain strong. We’ve said that if we saw the labor market unexpectedly weakening, that is also something that could call for a reaction.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">That’s why employment reports are likely to be a key reference point for central bankers and Wall Street investors who are eager to see what the Fed will do next.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">For years, the Fed had been watching the job market for a different reason.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Officials had worried that if conditions in the labor market remained too tight for too long, with employers fighting to hire and paying ever-rising wages to attract workers, it could help keep inflation faster than usual. That’s because companies with higher labor costs would probably charge more to protect profits, and workers earning more would probably spend more, fueling continued demand.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">But recently, job openings have come down and wage growth has abated, signals that the job market is cooling from its boil. That has caught the Fed’s attention.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">“At this point, we have a good labor market, but not a frothy one,” Mary C. Daly, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.frbsf.org/news-and-media/speeches/mary-c-daly/2024/06/getting-it-right-meeting-uncertainty-with-conditionality/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent speech</a>. “Future labor market slowing could translate into higher unemployment, as firms need to adjust not just vacancies but actual jobs.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The unemployment rate has ticked up slightly this year, and officials are watching warily for a more pronounced move. Research shows that a sudden and marked uptick in unemployment is a signal of recession — a <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-FED-SAHM/0H001QXBP8S1/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rule of thumb</a> set out by the economist Claudia Sahm and often referred to as the “Sahm Rule.”</p></div><button class="css-182hr0m" data-testid="Show-More" type="button" aria-hidden="true">Show more</button></div></div>

Its market value ticked over $2trn, putting it in the company of only four other firms: Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia.

Its network of warehouses and vans delivers more packages each year than FedEx or <small>UPS</small>, equivalent to $850bn-worth of goods worldwide.

Activists may complain about how it kills off brick-and-mortar stores. But punters are delighted with their sackfuls of smiling cardboard boxes; Amazon routinely tops customer-satisfaction surveys. In its quest to please shoppers, it diligently ploughs its profits back into its business. Last year no firm spent more on research and development or capital expenditure than Amazon. Plenty of companies say they are customer-obsessed. But for Amazon, that claim actually rings true.</p></div></div>

The needs range from technicians to product managers and corporate roles. </p><p>“It’s why we are very, very aggressive when it comes to our workforce development efforts,” Raman said. “And if you’re not getting traditional talent, [the solution is] cross-training talent, identifying alternate talent pools, people who are doing things in different fields, showing them that this is a very welcoming set of opportunities that exists within the semiconductor industry, is our approach.”</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108002273" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">The GlobalFoundries semiconductor manufacturing facility in Malta, New York, on June 18, 2024.</p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Cindy Schultz | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>Workers also have room for advancement, and training and retaining existing workers is key in this competitive environment.

Woods has now moved into a training and development analyst role with the company, overseeing training for technicians, engineers and management, plus ensuring compliance. Woods said compliance is crucial as the company expands into the automotive space, working with GM.</p><p>“As the demand for the microchips increases, we definitely need more manpower to help support the constant rollout of microchips and meeting our daily targets,” Woods said. </p><p>Woods has taken advantage of a benefit from GlobalFoundries launched in May, allowing eligible U.S.-based employees and new hires to receive a tax-free lifetime total of $28,500 toward student debt.

<p>A US judge ruled against the Federal Trade Commission in a challenge to its rule banning noncompete agreements, saying the FTC lacks "substantive" rulemaking authority.</p>
<p>The preliminary ruling only blocks enforcement of the noncompete ban against the plaintiff and other groups that intervened in the case, but it signals that the judge believes the FTC cannot enforce the rule. The case is in US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, so appeals would be heard in the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit—which is generally regarded as one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>In April, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/ftc-bans-noncompete-clauses-declares-vast-majority-unenforceable/">FTC issued a rule</a> that would render the vast majority of current noncompete clauses unenforceable and ban future ones. The agency said that noncompete clauses are "an unfair method of competition and therefore a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act," calling them "a widespread and often exploitative practice imposing contractual conditions that prevent workers from taking a new job or starting a new business."</p>
<p>A tax services firm called Ryan, LLC <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.389064/gov.uscourts.txnd.389064.1.0.pdf">sued</a> the FTC in an attempt to block the rule. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/business-groups-sue-ftc-to-block-ban-on-noncompetes-claim-they-help-workers/">lawsuit was joined</a> by the US Chamber of Commerce, two Texas business groups, and a lobbyist association that represents chief executive officers at US businesses.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.389064/gov.uscourts.txnd.389064.153.0_3.pdf">ruling on Wednesday</a>, US District Judge Ada Brown granted a preliminary injunction and postponed the effective date of the rule as it applies to the plaintiffs. The rule is scheduled to take effect on September 4, 2024. As of now, the FTC's ban on noncompetes is slated to apply to everyone except the entities involved in the lawsuit.</p>
<h2>“FTC lacks substantive rulemaking authority”</h2>
<p>"The issue presented is whether the FTC's ability to promulgate rules concerning unfair methods of competition include the authority to create <em>substantive</em> rules regarding unfair methods of competition," Brown, a Trump appointee, wrote.</p>
<p>Brown acknowledged that "the FTC has some authority to promulgate rules to preclude unfair methods of competition." But "the text, structure, and history of the FTC Act reveal that the FTC lacks substantive rulemaking authority with respect to unfair methods of competition under Section 6(g)," she wrote.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The FTC has argued it can impose the rule using authority under sections 5 and 6(g) of the FTC Act. "Alongside section 5, Congress adopted section 6(g) of the Act, in which it authorized the Commission to 'make rules and regulations for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of' the FTC Act, which include the Act's prohibition of unfair methods of competition," the FTC said when it issued the rule.</p>
<p>"The FTC stands by our clear authority, supported by statute and precedent, to issue this rule," an FTC spokesperson told Ars today. "We will keep fighting to free hardworking Americans from unlawful noncompetes, which reduce innovation, inhibit economic growth, trap workers, and undermine Americans' economic liberty."</p>
<p>Consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge <a href="https://publicknowledge.org/public-knowledge-condemns-district-court-decision-restricting-ftc-rulemaking-and-enjoining-noncompete-ban/">called Brown's ruling</a> "the latest in a series of attacks on the administrative state, which only further embolden judges without subject matter expertise to seize power from federal agencies and prevent them from effectively serving the American people."</p>
<p>The Supreme Court last week <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/scotus-kills-chevron-deference-giving-courts-more-power-to-block-federal-rules/">overturned</a> the 40-year-old <em>Chevron</em> precedent, which gave agencies leeway to interpret ambiguous laws as long as the agency's conclusion was reasonable. The SCOTUS ruling effectively gives courts more power to block federal rules.</p>
<h2>FTC’s cited authority just a “housekeeping statute”</h2>
<p>Brown concluded that section 6(g) is merely a "housekeeping statute," authorizing "rules of agency organization procedure or practice" but not "substantive rules."</p>
<p>"Plaintiffs next contend the lack of a statutory penalty for violating rules promulgated under Section 6(g) demonstrates its lack of substantive rulemaking power. The Court agrees," Brown wrote. "When authorizing legislative rulemaking, Congress also historically prescribes sanctions for violations of the agency's rules—confirming that those rules create substantive obligations for regulated parties."</p>
<p>The judge said the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits and would be harmed if the rule takes effect. Brown intends to issue a ruling on the merits by August 30.</p>
<p>The preliminary injunction does not apply nationwide, as Brown chose to limit "the scope of the injunctive relief herein to named Plaintiff Ryan, LLC and Plaintiff-Intervenors Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America; Business Roundtable; Texas Association of Business; and Longview Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>The business trade groups wanted the injunction to apply to all of their member entities but could not convince Brown to extend the injunction that far. "Plaintiff-Intervenors have directed the Court to neither sufficient evidence of their respective associational member(s) for which they seek standing, nor any of the three elements that must be met regarding associational standing. Without such developed briefing, the Court declines to extend injunctive relief to members of Plaintiff-Intervenors," Brown wrote.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Unemployment rate ticks up</strong>: The latest employment report showed that unemployment rose in June, indicating that the labor market is moderating after years of strong growth.</li>
<li><strong>Wage growth cools</strong>: Along with the unemployment rate, wage growth has also slowed down, which could be a concern for Federal Reserve officials.</li>
<li><strong>Fed officials have a dual mandate</strong>: The Federal Reserve has two main goals: to achieve low, stable inflation and a strong labor market. They use interest rates to achieve these goals.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation is no longer a major priority</strong>: Since early 2022, the Fed has focused on controlling inflation through higher interest rates. However, with inflation now cooling down, the job market is once again a top priority.</li>
<li><strong>The Fed is now more focused on the employment side</strong>: With inflation under control, the Fed is now concentrating on maintaining a strong labor market, which is important for the overall health of the economy.</li>

They try to accomplish that by setting interest rates, either leaving them low to bolster the economy or raising them to high levels to weigh on growth.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Since early 2022, Fed officials have been using higher rates to battle rapid inflation, focusing more on wrestling price increases under control than on the employment side of their mandate.

its comeback after second quarter deliveries beat analysts estimates earlier this week, shares are up over 20% for the past five days.</p><p>And it's just only in Tesla land guys, you'll see a company show declining deliveries.</p><p>This is an embraced set of results.</p><p>I think a lot of the folks right now are just afraid to be short this name into that August 8th Robo Taxi event.</p><p>Well, also the stock was down 40% year to date at its lows in mid April.</p><p>So if you were short coming into, if you were short coming into this year, um I think there's probably a, you know, hey, we don't need to press our bets anymore at this point.</p><p>And as I've been looking at this, you know, rally because an S for a has written three days in a row now, a Tesla story for us and the story is kind of just like, uh stock keeps going up because you know what it's worth letting people know, hey, stocks still going up and I I'm wondering if there is not an like look at what happened with Xa I, they raised a bunch of money.</p><p>There's some bullishness about the general Elon verse, if that's not a part of like the meme, part of the Tesla stock as like the purest play on Elon Musk.</p><p>If things in general for Elon Musk's business interests are looking up Tesla is the place that you can express that most easily as an investor or as an individual investor who, you know, does not have access to things like that.</p><p>Well, let's remind folks too, I mean, he is disappointed at some of these events, the energy they had an energy storage event.</p><p>He let people down.</p><p>I think the stock got hit too.</p><p>So there's no guarantee that come August 8th, Elon is gonna come out with his mind blowing Uber rival that's gonna instantly take market share in under a year, right?</p><p>If, if history is any good, he won't, he won't.</p><p>What targets has he met the cyber truck even when it did come out lackluster on actually meeting what was promised going into the law that I saw my first cyber truck yesterday.</p><p>Actually I saw the, I saw it but I actually touched it.</p><p>I touched it, touched the side.</p><p>It was pretty cool.</p><p

big, it's too big, it's too big.</p><p>You can't, anywhere on the road.</p><p>They are very big.</p><p>Um But you know, the stock is now making its way back towards break even for the year.</p><p>So, you know, look, we can, we, you can kind of hack up the time frame with Tesla at any point in time and find a good or bad story.</p><p>Well, the Robo taxi was supposed to come out in 2020.</p><p>I mean, this is, in fact, this entire fleet was supposed to be something that happened four years ago.</p><p>Now you can give them a little bit of grace, I guess because of the pandemic.</p><p>But then at what point do you say?</p><p>Ok, you guys promised us this by 2020 we'll give you uh what, one year, two year grace period?</p><p>I just feel like you cannot, if you're, if you're in this thing, you cannot earnestly sit there and be like Elon is disappointing me again.</p><p>It's like it, that, that story is so well baked.</p><p>You are just making a long term bet on Elon's vision and the deliverables, meeting these certain timelines that is stuff or stiffs to talk about.</p><p>I mean, I just don't think that can really be part of it.</p><p>You have to have made peace with that already because it's 2024.</p><p>He's been at it with this company now for 1516 years at it with everybody too sec his own investors.</p><p>There's folks on the internet.</p><p>Yeah,

This includes its own ecosystem, financial health (Aaa credit rating from Moody’s), and growth outlook (Revenue Growth Rate [FWD] of 12.19%).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I am convinced that American Express is also an excellent choice for generating dividend growth, as evidenced by the company’s 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate [CAGR] of 10.46% and its low Payout Ratio of 20.59%.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">BlackRock is a great choice for this portfolio as I believe it will perform well in different market conditions. In addition to that, the company’s excellent market position can be highlighted, as well as its financial health (Aa3 credit rating from Moody’s), and growth metrics (EPS Diluted Growth Rate [FWD] of 9.68%).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I have selected Apple for this portfolio as I am convinced that it can provide additional stability. I firmly believe that the company is still one of the world’s best investment choices when it comes to risk and reward, primarily a result of its strong competitive advantages and wide economic moat.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I have selected the following high dividend yield companies for this dividend portfolio:</p> <ul class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"> <li>U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USB" title="U.S. Bancorp">USB</a>)</li> <li>BHP Group (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BHP" title="BHP Group Limited">BHP</a>)(<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BHPLF?hasComeFromMpArticle=false&amp;source=content_type%25253Areact%25257Csection%25253Amain_content%25257Cbutton%25253Abody_link">OTCPK:BHPLF</a>)</li> <li>Imperial Brands (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IMBBY?hasComeFromMpArticle=true&amp;source=content_type%25253Areact%25257Csection%25253Amain_content%25257Cbutton%25253Abody_link">OTCQX:IMBBY</a>) (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IMBBF?hasComeFromMpArticle=true&amp;source=content_type%25253Areact%25257Csection%25253Amain_content%25257Cbutton%25253Abody_link">OTCQX:IMBBF</a>)</li> <li>Realty Income (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/O" title="Realty Income Corporation">O</a>)</li> <li>Ares Capital (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCC" title="Ares Capital">ARCC</a>)</li> </ul> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">U.S. Bancorp has been selected for this dividend portfolio given the company’s attractive mix of dividend income and dividend growth: while U.S. Bancorp provides investors with a Dividend Yield [FWD] of 5.10%, its 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate [CAGR] stands at an attractive level of 6.59%.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Like U.S. Bancorp, BHP Group offers an appealing mix of dividend income and dividend growth. The Australian based company from the Diversified Metals and Mining Industry exhibits a Dividend Yield [FWD] of 5.07% in combination with a 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate [CAGR] of 7.63%.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Imperial Brands has been included in this dividend portfolio due to its enormous ability to decrease portfolio volatility. This is evidenced by the company’s 24M and 60M Beta Factors of 0.16 and 0.36.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Realty Income has been chosen for this portfolio given the company’s strong financial health (A3 credit rating from Moody’s), and attractive Valuation (P/AFFO [FWD] Ratio of 12.52, which is 14.48% below the Sector Median), allowing you to invest with a margin of safety. It is further worth highlighting that Realty Income remains among the largest positions of <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4631472-the-construction-of-the-dividend-income-accelerator-portfolio">The Dividend Income Accelerator Portfolio</a>.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Ares Capital has been particularly selected for this dividend portfolio due to its strong capacity to produce dividend income, evidenced by its Dividend Yield [FWD] of 8.97%. This makes the company an important strategic component of this portfolio, significantly contributing to income generation through dividend payments.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The following ETF has been selected for this dividend portfolio:</p> <ul class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><li>Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:<a

been chosen for this dividend portfolio, due to its low Expense Ratio of 0.06%, attractive Dividend Yield [TTM] of 3.45% (which is above the Median of all ETFs of 2.60%), and appealing 10-Year Dividend Growth Rate [CAGR] of 10.87% (which is significantly above the Median of all ETFs of 6.67%), in addition to its low risk-level (its Standard Deviation of 13.80 stands below the Median of all ETFs of 15.16).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The following closed-ended equity mutual fund has been selected for this dividend portfolio:</p> <ul class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><li>Cohen &amp; Steers Qty Inc Realty (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RQI" title="Cohen&amp;Steers Quality Income Realty Fund">RQI</a>)</li></ul> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I have included RQI into this dividend portfolio due to its enormous ability to produce dividend income (its Dividend Yield [TTM] stands at 8.41%), and its compatibility and complementation with SCHD (this is particularly the case since their positions do not overlap), making the company an attractive choice for this portfolio.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Overview of the Selected Picks</strong></h2> <span class="table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible

It not only merges dividend income with dividend growth, evidenced by its Weighted Average Dividend Yield [TTM] of 4.50% and its 5-Year Weighted Average Dividend Growth Rate [CAGR] of 8.01%, it also offers a broad diversification and reduced risk level. This increases the chances of achieving successful investment outcomes.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For this dividend portfolio, I have carefully selected five high dividend yield companies, five companies with a focus on dividend growth, one ETF that combines dividend income and dividend growth (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHD" title="Schwab Strategic Trust - Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF">SCHD</a>) and one closed-ended equity mutual fund (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RQI" title="Cohen&amp;Steers Quality Income Realty Fund">RQI</a>).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Each of the selected picks is a strategically important component to reach a balanced approach between dividend income and dividend growth.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">RQI is a key-position for this dividend portfolio due it its complementation with SCHD (since their positions do not overlap) and its ability to produce a significant amount of income via dividend payments (Dividend Yield [TTM] of 8.41%).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">To further decrease the portfolio’s risk level, you could also include U.S. government bonds. This would help to decrease the portfolio’s volatility, making it more resilient to any market condition.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This portfolio not only helps you to produce significant income for today (evidenced by its Weighted Average Dividend Yield [TTM] of 4.50%), it can also serve as an additional source of income for your retirement, thanks to its additional focus on dividend growth (underscored by a 5-Year Weighted Average Dividend Growth Rate [CAGR] of 8.01%).</p> <p class="before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The two main political parties ran on different economic and financial manifestos during the election campaign that would likely have different consequences for the investing environment.</p><p>The Labour party’s pledge, for example, to increase taxes on the compensation that private equity fund managers received raised a few eyebrows, and led to questions on what this could mean more broadly.</p><p>Speaking to CNBC, a selection of experts weighed in on the potential impact the change of government could have on U.K. investment.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline0"></a>Stock markets</h2><div class="group"><p>The arrival of a new Labour government hasn’t moved markets all that much yet but analysts expect U.K. assets to become more attractive from here on out.</p><p>In a note Friday, analysts at Jefferies said, despite concerns raised by a strong showing for the right-wing Reform UK Party, the Labour Party’s U.K. election win would help make the U.K. appear “relatively stable.”</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>This, in combination with regulatory reform, “could raise the attractiveness of UK assets,” Jefferies’ analysts wrote in a research note.</p><p>James McManus, chief investment officer at Nutmeg, meanwhile told CNBC that the vast majority of the time, “markets don’t really care” about elections. “Historical data shows us that elections and their results rarely move markets when the expected outcome is delivered.”</p><p>Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, broadly echoed McManus’ comments in a note published this week, but added that there could be some impact on the economy.</p><p>“A widely predicted Labour win in the UK could usher in an era of greater stability for the UK … which should help bolster investor sentiment towards the UK,” she said.</p><p>In recent years the U.K.‘s political landscape has been characterized by frequent leadership changes, which at times have led to market turmoil — especially during former PM <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/20/uk-prime-minister-liz-truss-resigns-after-failed-budget-and-market-turmoil.html">Liz Truss’ brief premiership</a>.</p></div><div class="group"><p>Some sectors — and therefore specific stocks — could also be affected, Streeter pointed out. Pressure could be added to the utilities sector as Labour plans to increase fines for water companies which are already being weighed down by high costs. Meanwhile, the party’s pledge to boost the country’s defense budget could see U.K. airspace stocks benefit from additional spending on new technology and equipment.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline1"></a>Property markets and housing</h2><div class="group"><p>Plans from all parties to build more houses could impact the property and housing sector, Richard Donnell, executive director for research at Zoopla, told CNBC.</p><p>“Investors would welcome this focus on home building,” he said. “What investors want is more focus on housing and delivering the homes the nation needs and leveraging in as much private investment as possible to create an attractive investment for more capital and to support the ambitions of the new Government.”</p><p>Some housebuilding stocks may also see a boost due to Labour’s plans to build new, affordable homes, Hargreaves Lansdown noted.</p></div><div class="group"><p>Wider economic developments will however also be a factor, according to Nutmeg’s McManus. As interest rates are set to fall, so will mortgage rates, which could lead to more people buying or selling homes, he said, adding that this could also have knock-on effects for other businesses like furniture and DIY shops.</p><p>Aynsley Lammin, an equity analyst at Investec, said Labour’s plan to restore mandatory housebuilding targets would be a “quick win” for the sector that should boost planning and supply.</p><p>RBC’s head of European capital goods research told CNBC’s Silvia Amaro Friday agreed that the house building sector stands to be a major beneficiary of the Labour Party’s landslide victory.</p></div><div class="group"><p>“It’s front and center great for house builders, great for the wider building supply sector, bricks,” Mark Fielding said, pointing to two driving factors. “Two big factors: firstly a return to mandated targets for house building supporting 1.5 million new homes over the next five years, which would be a big positive, and secondly hopes on planning reforms, targeting to get that done.”</p><p>That will in turn allow for faster planning processes and potentially for additional central government intervention to press ahead with more house approvals, according to Fielding, who noted that investor focus will otherwise now narrow on the Labour Party’s ability to deliver on broader economic growth.</p><p>“U.K. bank stocks in the end are one of the biggest proxies for U.K. economic growth,” he said.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline2"></a>The British pound</h2><div class="group"><p>Strategists and economists predict the <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-8"><a href="/quotes/GBP=/">British pound</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> will not be impacted strongly by the election.</p><p>If results are as expected, attention will shift away from the U.K. election quickly, Shreyas Gopal, strategist, and Sanjay Raja, senior economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note published Wednesday.</p><p>“For EUR/GBP, this then means turning attention to the election across the channel [in France], and then the forthcoming UK data in mid-July that will determine whether the BoE are able to pull the trigger on a first rate cut in early August,” they said.</p></div><div class="group"><p>In the longer-term, there are also not “huge risks” for the pound under a Labour government, Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING, told CNBC. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/03/a-labour-win-could-improve-uk-eu-relations-after-brexit.html">Potential renegotiations of Brexit deals</a> would, if anything, be more pro-growth under Labour, and risks of excessive government spending are also low, he explained.</p><p>But the pound could still be on course for a difficult time, Pesole suggested.</p><p> “We see the pound depreciating against the euro in the next 24 months primarily on the back of our view for larger Bank of England cuts compared to the ECB,” he said. Higher taxes in the U.K. could also weaken its currency — but those would likely come regardless of the election outcome, according to Pesole.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline3"></a>Bond markets</h2><div class="group"><p>Bond markets have so far not appeared reactive to potential new policies under Labour, Hargreaves Lansdown’s Streeter said in a second note published earlier this week.</p><p>During the campaign, Labour economy spokeswoman Rachel Reeves suggested that there could be changes to government borrowing rules in an effort to boost growth and investment. But the bond market’s focus seems to be elsewhere, Streeter said.</p><p>“So far, this doesn’t seem to have perturbed the debt markets, with bond investors appearing to be more sensitive to interest rate speculation than the investment plans of an incoming government,” she said.</p><p><em>—CNBC’s Ryan Browne and Ruxandra Iordache contributed to this article.</em></p></div><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

That would impact some 86 million customers.</p>



<p>The potential charges, says Marianne Lake, CEO of consumer and community banking at JPMorgan, are a result of new regulatory rules that cap overdraft and late fees. Lake says Chase will be passing along those increased expenses to customers, which would put an end to now-free services such as checking accounts and wealth management tools. And she says she expects other banks will follow suit.</p>



<p>The threat of charging for once-free services isn’t a new one. Over a decade ago, many banks said they would add a service fee onto debit cards because of regulatory changes. Few actually did, though, as thet feared a consumer revolt.</p>



<p>That could happen again, especially as consumers struggle with inflation and higher costs of living, but it’s not certain.</p><p></p>



<p>The new rules would cap credit card late payments at $8 and overdraft charges at $3. New capital rules would also require them to hod more reserves against mortgages and credit card loans, which could impact consumer loan potentials, banks warn.</p>



<p>“It is not practical for many of the services to be free if we won’t be able to draw from those profit pools,” Lake said.</p>



<p>Of course, whether those rules will go into effect could depend on the results of the November election. Donald Trump could strike them down or dilute them. And banks have brought lawsuits to prevent them from going into effect. Some of those cases are currently pending before judges.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get global CEO perspectives on the biggest stories in business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p>.</p></div></div></div>
