    <div><div class="styles_text__lvCVh"><p>An investigation by law firm Cleary Gottlieb found an agency rife with sexual harassment, bullying, and discrimination, where complaints were ignored and offenders went unpunished. The findings have put pressure on Gruenberg, who has been a fixture at the FDIC since 2005, in rotating stints as its chair and a board member. The report found that Gruenberg contributed to a culture of bullying and that underlings, scared of being berated, were reluctant to bring him bad information.</p><p>That information breakdown has led some critics to tie Gruenberg’s temper to lapses at the FDIC last spring, when three regional banks failed and the agency was slow to seize them, spurring worries about a contagion that forced the government to guarantee deposits at two of the banks. Republican members of Congress and <a href="https://pressley.house.gov/2024/05/15/pressley-slams-gruenberg-for-toxic-culture-at-fdic-jeopardizing-critical-financial-regulations/" class="styles_linkEmbed__SNmaX" rel="no-referrer">at least one Democrat</a> have called on him to resign.</p><p>But Gruenberg, a progressive who has pushed tougher rules on Wall Street throughout his career, is key to a financial-regulation agenda that includes forcing banks to hold more capital, reining in bonuses, and intensifying merger reviews. If he were to be forced out of his role, the FDIC would be paralyzed, split evenly between Democratic and Republican board members and at least temporarily run by a Republican, Travis Hill.</p><p class="styles_divider__xkDtO styles_adDivider__aXGYy styles_topDivider__FcDpP" aria-hidden="true"></p><p class="styles_divider__xkDtO styles_adDivider__aXGYy styles_bottomDivider__6uqU_" aria-hidden="true"></p><p>“There’s plenty of blame to go around,” said Dennis Kelleher, of the progressive think tank Better Markets. “This is outrageous, but to attack the Democrat only, which has the inevitable result of stalling this important work, is so clearly partisan politics.”</p><p>(In a bit of good news for Warren, the Supreme Court this morning <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/federal-consumer-financial-watchdog-survives-supreme-court-scrutiny-e90485bd?mod=hp_lead_pos2" class="styles_linkEmbed__SNmaX" rel="no-referrer">rejected</a> a constitutional challenge that would have dismantled or gutted the CFPB.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The European Commission has launched an in-depth probe into Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, over concerns that its platforms are failing to protect children from addiction.</li>
<li>The investigation will look into whether Meta's apps are reinforcing "rabbit hole" effects, where users get drawn deeper into online feeds and topics, and whether the company is doing enough to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content.</li>
<li>The probe is the second under the EU's Digital Services Act, which aims to police content online and regulate big tech companies. The law imposes new obligations on platforms with over 45 million users in the EU and can impose fines of up to 6% of a company's global annual turnover.</li>
<li>If Meta is found to have broken the law, it can face fines, bans in the single market, or other measures to enforce the rules.</li>
<li>According to Commissioner Thierry Breton, the EU is "not convinced" that Meta has done enough to comply with the DSA obligations to protect the physical and mental health of young Europeans on its platforms.</li>

<p>Brussels has opened an in-depth probe into Meta over concerns it is failing to do enough to protect children from becoming addicted to social media platforms such as Instagram.</p>
<p>The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, announced on Thursday it would look into whether the Silicon Valley giant’s apps were reinforcing “rabbit hole” effects, where users get drawn ever deeper into online feeds and topics.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>EU investigators will also look into whether Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, is complying with legal obligations to provide appropriate age-verification tools to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content.</p>
<p>The probe is the second into the company under the EU’s Digital Services Act. The landmark legislation is designed to police content online, with sweeping new rules on the protection of minors.</p>
<p>It also has mechanisms to force Internet platforms to reveal how they are tackling misinformation and propaganda.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/07/landmark-eu-rules-will-finally-put-regulation-of-big-tech-to-the-test/">The DSA</a>, which was approved last year, imposes new obligations on very large online platforms with more than 45 million users in the EU. If Meta is found to have broken the law, Brussels can impose fines of up to 6 percent of a company’s global annual turnover.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Repeat offenders can even face bans in the single market as an extreme measure to enforce the rules.</p>
<p>Thierry Breton, commissioner for internal market, said the EU was “not convinced” that Meta “has done enough to comply with the DSA obligations to mitigate the risks of negative effects to the physical and mental health of young Europeans on its platforms Facebook and Instagram.”</p>
<p>“We are sparing no effort to protect our children,” Breton added.</p>
<p>Meta said: “We want young people to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online and have spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies designed to protect them. This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission.”</p>
<p>In the investigation, the commission said it would focus on whether Meta’s platforms were putting in place “appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure a high level of privacy, safety, and security for minors.” It added that it was placing special emphasis on default privacy settings for children.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/meta-to-face-eu-probe-for-not-doing-enough-to-stop-russian-disinformation/">the EU opened the first probe into Meta under the DSA</a> over worries the social media giant is not properly curbing disinformation from Russia and other countries.</p>
<p>Brussels is especially concerned whether the social media company’s platforms are properly moderating content from Russian sources that may try to destabilize upcoming elections across Europe.</p>
<p>Meta defended its moderating practices and said it had appropriate systems in place to stop the spread of disinformation on its platforms.</p>

The company declined to share more information with CNBC about its restructuring.</p><p>The company’s shares initially plunged double digits in pre-market trading after its earnings report was released, but later rebounded after its earnings call with Wall Street analysts.<strong> </strong>Shares closed more than 1% lower. </p><p>Here’s how the athletic apparel retailer did in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:</p><ul><li><strong>Earnings per share:</strong> 11 cents adjusted<strong> </strong>vs. 8 cents expected</li><li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $1.33 billion vs. $1.33 billion expected</li></ul><p>The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended March 31 was $6.6 million, or 2 cents per share, compared with $170.6 million, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company reported earnings of 11 cents per share. </p><p>Sales dropped to $1.33 billion, down about 5% from $1.4 billion a year earlier. </p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>During the quarter, sales in North America declined 10% to $772 million, worse than the $780 million that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. </p><p>Under Armour said it expects sales to continue to worsen in North America. The company anticipates they will drop between 15% and 17% in its current fiscal year. </p><p>“Due to a confluence of factors, including lower wholesale channel demand and inconsistent execution across our business, we are seizing this critical moment to make proactive decisions to build a premium positioning for our brand, which will pressure our top and bottom line in the near term,” founder and CEO Kevin Plank said in a statement. </p><p>“Over the next 18 months, there is a significant opportunity to reconstitute Under Armour’s brand strength through achieving more, by doing less and focusing on our core fundamentals,” he added.</p><p>Across Under Armour’s business, the company is expecting revenue to be down “at a low-double-digit percentage rate” in its current fiscal year, while analysts had expected sales to grow by 2.1%, according to LSEG. </p><p>The company is planning to cut down on promotions and discounting, which it expects will lead its gross margin to rise between 0.75 and 1 percentage point for the fiscal year. </p><p>It’s expecting diluted earnings per share to be between 2 cents and 5 cents and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between 18 cents and 21 cents for the year. Analysts had expected earnings per share of 52 cents, according to LSEG. </p><p>Under Armour’s rough quarter comes about two months after the retailer announced former Marriott executive <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/13/kevin-plank-returns-as-under-armour-ceo-mohamed-el-erian-named-board-chair.html">Stephanie Linnartz </a>would be <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/13/kevin-plank-returns-as-under-armour-ceo-mohamed-el-erian-named-board-chair.html">stepping down</a> from her role as CEO after barely a year on the job and Plank would once again <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/14/wall-street-not-happy-that-kevin-plank-returning-as-under-armours-ceo.html">take the helm</a> of the company he founded in 1996. </p><p>Linnartz was the second CEO the company has cycled through in less than two years. </p><p>During a call with analysts, Plank was blunt about where things had gone wrong for Under Armour. He pointed to inconsistent leadership as one of the primary issues.</p><p>“With several CEOs and heads of products, marketing and North America over the past half decade, ongoing turnover of critical leadership has been central to our inability to stay agile and decisive,” said Plank.</p><p>Linnartz was hired on a bet that her experience building out Marriott’s renowned Bonvoy loyalty program and driving digital revenue for the hotel giant would offset her lack of experience in the retail industry. Before her departure, she managed to overhaul Under Armour’s C-suite and build out its loyalty program. She was attempting to pivot the brand’s assortment to a more athleisure-focused offering that had more stylish options for women, who tend to spend more on clothes and shoes than men do.</p><p>Now Plank is looking to undo some of that work. He told analysts that the company had “taken our eyes off” its core men’s apparel business, which has “significantly impacted” the brand’s perception and led it to become “more promotional and commoditized.”</p><p>“We will rectify this,” said Plank. “This focus does not mean that we are deprioritizing our footwear or women’s business per se but from a sequencing perspective, men’s apparel will be our highest priority.”</p><p>As Plank tries to reset the business, he said Under Armour plans to reduce its style counts by roughly 25% over the next 18 months and cut down the amount of time it takes to get a product from an idea to a showroom floor.<strong> </strong>He aims to streamline the process so it’ll only take between 6 and12 months instead of the 18 months it currently takes — a system he called “just plain uncompetitive in the 2024 landscape.”</p><p>The full restructuring will focus on streamlining Under Armour’s overall business, reducing silos and ensuring that every staffer’s work is directly contributing to its primary goal: “Selling more shirts and shoes.”</p><p>“We are simply doing too much stuff. There are too many products, too many initiatives, too much of too much,” said Plank. “To reconstitute this brand, we must be highly focused and prioritize what needs to get done so that our teams know exactly what to do with a clear definition of success.”</p><p>Read the full earnings release <a href="https://about.underarmour.com/content/ua/about/en/stories/press-releases/release.24181.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div></div>

    <div><p class="drop-cap preview">When Josh Holbrook, a software engineer in Alaska, was laid off in January, he didn't expect to spend too much time looking for a new job. He certainly didn't think he'd need to relearn the job-hunt process.</p><p class="preview">A few weeks into his search, however, Holbrook found himself out of his depth. Instead of speaking with a human recruiter at a local healthcare organization, he was screened by an AI chatbot. His résumé, created nearly a decade ago in a technical format popular among academics, was incompatible with new automated recruitment platforms. He signed up for a professional service to update it in an AI-friendly format.</p><div class="premium-content"><p class="premium">"The experience was completely novel," Holbrook told me. "I've never seen that before."</p><p class="premium">Over the past couple of years, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/job-market-high-pay-employees-labor-economy-finding-work-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">job seekers</a> have been forced to contend with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/layoffs-firings-tech-hr-tiktok-cloudflare-employee-morale-bad-business-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">incessant layoffs</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-chatgpt-hiring-ghost-interviews-job-search-weird-labor-market-2023-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">brutal recruitment market</a>, and days of unpaid assignments. They can now add AI recruiting systems to that pile. In 2022, the Society for Human Resource Management found that about 40% of the large-scale employers it surveyed said they were already deploying AI in HR-related activities like recruitment. Rik Mistry, who consults on large-scale corporate recruitment, told Business Insider that AI is now leveraged to write job descriptions, judge an applicant's skills, power recruiting chatbots, and rate a candidate's responses. Ian Siegel, the CEO of ZipRecruiter, estimated in 2022 that nearly three-fourths of all résumés were never seen by humans.</p><p class="premium">Some job hunters have decided to fight fire with fire, turning to programs that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/job-applications-hiring-ai-bots-spam-resume-cover-letter-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">use AI to optimize their résumés</a> and apply to hundreds of jobs at a time. But the emerging AI-versus-AI recruitment battle is bad news for everyone. It turns hiring into a depersonalized process, it inundates hiring managers, and it reinforces weaknesses in the system it's designed to improve. And it only seems to be getting worse.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">Automation in recruitment isn't new: After job sites like Monster and LinkedIn made it easy for people to apply for jobs in the early 2010s, companies adopted <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-your-resume-gets-rejected-job-search-bots-people-ats-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">applicant-tracking systems</a> to manage the deluge of online applications. Now most résumés are first seen by software designed to evaluate a person's experience and education and rank them accordingly.</p><p class="premium">The automation has helped ease the burden on overstretched recruiters — but not by much. As the stacks of digital résumés have grown amid frequent changes to remote-work policies, the recruitment hamster wheel has spun ever faster.</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-right" data-quote="We know AI isn't perfect, but we have to use it as there's pressure from the higher-ups." data-quote-updated="true" data-source="Add source (optional)" data-source-updated="false" class="premium">

                            </es-blockquote><p class="premium">AI is supposed to fix this mess, saving companies time and money by outsourcing even more of the hiring process to machine-learning algorithms. In late 2019, Unilever said it had saved 100,000 hours and about $1 million in recruitment costs with the help of automated video interviews. Platforms like LinkedIn and ZipRecruiter have started using generative AI to offer candidates personalized job recommendations and let recruiters generate listings in seconds. The Google-backed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/moonhub-secures-1-4-million-for-vr-training-platform-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">recruitment-tech startup Moonhub</a> has an AI bot that scours the internet, gathering data from places like LinkedIn and Github, to find suitable candidates. On HireVue, employers can let a bot with a set questionnaire conduct video assessments <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-surveillance-detects-emotion-at-work-gets-you-fired-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">to analyze candidates' personalities</a>. Newer startups combine these abilities in a centralized service, allowing firms to put "<a target="_blank" href="http://hollyhires.ai" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">hiring on autopilot</a>."</p><p class="premium">But hiring experts Business Insider spoke with weren't convinced it's all for the best. Many fear that over time AI will make an already frustrating system worse and spawn fresh issues like ghost hires, where companies are misled into recruiting a bot masquerading as a person.</p><p class="premium">Several seasoned recruiters told me they hadn't incorporated AI into their workflow beyond auto-generating job descriptions and summarizing candidate calls. Tatiana Becker, who specializes in tech recruiting, said software that claims to match résumés with jobs lacked the nuance to do more than keyword matching — it couldn't, for instance, identify desirable candidates who came from top schools or had a history of earning strong promotions. Chatbots that Becker's boutique agency experimented with would frequently mismatch prospects and roles, ultimately pushing the prospects away.</p><p class="premium">This résumé matching "might work for applicants of more entry-level jobs," Becker told BI, "but I would worry about using it for anything else at this point."</p><p class="premium">Despite the problems, many companies are marching forward. "We know AI isn't perfect, but we have to use it as there's pressure from the higher-ups," said a recruiter in a Fortune 500 firm who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss his company's hiring process.</p><p class="premium">Pallavi Sinha, the vice president of growth at Humanly, a startup that offers a conversational-AI hiring platform to companies like Microsoft, said that "AI in recruiting, similar to other industries, is very much at a nascent stage." But she predicted it would continue to be incorporated into hiring.</p><p class="premium">"AI isn't here to replace human interactions," she said, "but to make our jobs and lives easier — something that we'll see more and more of over time." Sinha declined to share how many applications Humanly had processed but said its chatbot service had over a "million conversations last year alone."</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">For candidates, though, AI has been a nightmare. Kerry McInerney, an AI researcher at the University of Cambridge, said AI increases the amount of labor for applicants, forcing them to complete puzzles and attend automated interviews just to get to the selection stage. She argued that it makes a "depersonalized process even more alienating."</p><p class="premium">Holbrook, the software engineer, wrote on LinkedIn about his frustration. "AI is too stupid to recognize transferrable skills among tech applicants," he said, adding, "I had a resume bounced because I don't have c# listed as a fluent language, even though I've dealt with c# in my jobs and have worked with plenty of languages that are 90% the same as c#."</p><p class="premium">Danielle Caldwell, a user-experience strategist in Portland, Oregon, was confused when an AI chatbot texted her to initiate the conversation about a role she had applied for. At first, she thought it was spam. After the exchange, she was left with more questions.</p><p class="premium">"There was no way to ask questions with the bot — it was a one-way experience," Caldwell said.</p><p class="premium">The University of Sussex has found that AI video interviews can be <a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.sussex.ac.uk/policy-engagement/files/2021/10/Automated-job-interviews-and-the-implications-for-young-jobseekers.pdf" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">disorienting for job seekers</a>, who behave much less naturally in the absence of a reassuring human presence. Plus, Mclnerney said, assessing a candidate's personality based on their body language and appearance is not only "reminiscent of 19th- and 20th-century racial pseudoscience but simply doesn't work." Her <a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-022-00543-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">research</a> has demonstrated that even things like wearing a headscarf or having a bookshelf in the background can change a personality score.</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-quote="With AI you are only accelerating the brokenness of recruiting." data-quote-updated="true" data-source="Add source (optional)" data-source-updated="false" class="premium">

One called LazyApply, for example, can apply to thousands of jobs online on your behalf for $250. "Anyone who has had to review over 50 résumés in one sitting wants to put a toothpick in their eyes," said Peter Laughter, who's been in recruitment for about three decades. With AI, he said, "you are only accelerating the brokenness of recruiting."</p><p class="premium">Bonnie Dilber, a recruiting manager at Zapier, said these services contributed to problematic behaviors on both sides of hiring. Candidates' submitting hundreds of applications leaves recruiting teams struggling to keep up and respond, which in turn pushes applicants to feel that they need to submit even more applications to stand a chance.</p><p class="premium">A more pressing issue, Dilber added, is that often these bots submit poor applications. Dilber and other recruiters told BI that some cover letters say only, "This has been submitted by [AI tool], please contact [person's email] with questions." When Aki Ito, a BI correspondent, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/job-applications-hiring-ai-bots-spam-resume-cover-letter-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">tried using AI to apply for jobs</a>, the system got her race wrong, made up that she spoke Spanish, and submitted an outdated cover letter.</p><p class="premium">"We had some people accidentally include ChatGPT's entire response," Hailley Griffis, the head of communications and content at Buffer, told BI. Griffis, who said she reviewed an average of 500 applications per open role, added, "There is a very distinct tone with a lot of AI content that hasn't been edited, and we saw a lot of that."</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">Recruiters and researchers also worry about AI's tendency to reinforce many of the recruitment industry's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-racism-bias-new-inclusive-solutions-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">existing biases</a>. Researchers from the Berkeley Haas Center for Equity, Gender and Leadership <a target="_blank" href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/when_good_algorithms_go_sexist_why_and_how_to_advance_ai_gender_equity" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">said in 2021</a> that of about 133 biased AI systems they analyzed, about 44% exhibited gender bias. Other recent studies have found that AI systems are prone to <a target="_blank" href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/artificial-intelligence/2022/05/eeoc-doj-sounding-alarm-over-ai-hiring-tools-that-screen-out-disabled-applicants/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">screening out applicants with disabilities</a> and de-ranking résumés with names associated with Black Americans.</p><p class="premium">Unlike a human, an algorithm will never look at past hiring decisions and rectify its mistakes, said Sandra Wachter, a tech and regulation professor at the University of Oxford. It will always do as it has been taught.</p><p class="premium">Wachter, whose team developed a bias test that's been adopted by companies like IBM and Amazon, believes <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-help-recruit-hire-employees-tech-women-bias-job-seeking-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">it's possible to use AI to make fairer decisions</a> — but for that to happen, employers need to address systemic issues with more inclusive data and regular checks. Moonhub, for example, has a human recruiter who vets the AI's recommendations and speaks with candidates who prefer a human over a chatbot.</p><p class="premium">But until AI improves enough, humans will remain the most effective hiring systems. Becker, the tech recruiter, said humans were still critical for "getting to the heart of the candidate's decision-making process and helping them overcome apprehensions if they've gotten cold feet," as well as for "dealing with counteroffers."</p><p class="premium">David Francis, a vice president at Talent Tech Labs, a recruitment research and advisory firm, said that while "recruitment is still and will always be a very human-focused process," AI "is a tool and can be used effectively or poorly."</p><p class="premium">But when it's used poorly, both candidates and recruiters suffer.

<li><strong>United Airlines has released a new safety video</strong> which was widely anticipated given the airline's recent clearance by the FAA to resume normal operations after a safety audit.</li>
<li><strong>The video was filmed inside a life-sized airplane-inspired sequential reaction machine</strong> to capture the attention of frequent fliers.</li>
<li><strong>It took 10 months to create the video</strong>, involving 17 employees from different departments, 1,000 real dominoes, and a 100-year-old song, "Rhapsody in Blue" by George Gershwin.</li>
<li><strong>The video has customized versions for 8 different aircraft types, 20 seat configurations, and 18 languages</strong> to cater to international passengers.</li>

		<p>United Airlines has <a href="https://www.united.com/en/us/newsroom/announcements/cision-125332" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> its new safety video.  The timing here likely is not a coincidence.  They were presumably holding onto it – but now that <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/united-airlines-cleared-for-takeoff-faa-expected-to-end-safety-audit-freeze/" target="_blanK" rel="noopener">the FAA is lifting restrictions on the airline</a> put in place as part of a safety audit, highlighting the airline’s safety is perfect timing.
</p><p>Work on the video began in June, and the FAA approved it in March – but it will only begin rolling out to aircraft beginning May 25.</p>
<blockquote><p>The video was filmed inside a life-sized, airplane-inspired sequential reaction machine, with a creative concept designed to capture and keep the attention of even the most frequent fliers…. </p>
<p>United’s New Safety Video by the Numbers…</p>
<p>•	171 customized versions of the safety video to accommodate United’s 8 different aircraft types, 20 various seat configurations on those aircraft and 18 languages<br>
•	Ten months in the making – Creative development on the new video began in June 2023; filming took place in October 2023 and then the team spent the next five months on edits and translations before the March 2023 FAA approval<br>
•	12 individual contraptions the ball passes through in the machine<br>
•	17 employees from across the airline, including flight attendants, pilots, customer service agents, ramp service, tech operations, the network operations center and reservations<br>
•	More than 1,000 real dominoes<br>
•	A 100-year old song, “Rhapsody in Blue” by George Gershwin, that’s been a consistent feature in United safety videos over the years<br>

<p>My United flights right as this video was completed <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/11-observations-from-3-united-flights-last-week-my-unplanned-love-affair-with-united-airlines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were excellent</a> and the airline exceeded all of my expectations.  Even the wifi was functional, which has been my primary complaint (and what’s kept me mostly off of their planes) for years.  I do not have concerns about safety flying United.</p>
<p>What do you think of the new video?</p>

<p>WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) — Spirit AeroSystems is notifying its Wichita workforce that layoffs are coming. In an internal memo a worker shared with KSN, the company said it has “made the difficult decision” to reduce the hourly production workforce “by approximately 400-450 employees.”</p>



<p>A Spirit spokesperson would not release the numbers.</p>



<p>“The recent slowdown in the delivery rate on commercial programs compels a reduction to our workforce in Wichita,” Joe Buccino said. “In the coming weeks, we will inform affected employees. We are committed to implementing this transition in as compassionate a manner as possible.”</p>



<p>The internal memo is addressed to the Wichita hourly production teams. It also says the layoffs are due to high inventory levels.</p>



<p>“We must slow down our operations to align our workforce with the needs of our customers,” the message says.</p>



<p>Workers who are affected may not know right away. Managers will contact workers in the coming weeks to provide specific instructions on the exit process.</p>





<p>“These decisions are difficult and sensitive. We sincerely appreciate your contributions and thank you for your understanding and resilience during this period of adjustment,” the company said.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Spirit released its <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spiritaero.com/pages/release/spirit-aerosystems-reports-first-quarter-2024-results/" target="_blank">first quarter financial results</a> — <a href="https://www.ksn.com/business/press-releases/cision/20240507CG06630/spirit-aerosystems-reports-first-quarter-2024-results/">a loss of $616.7 million in the first quarter</a>.</p>





<p>At the time, Spirit President and CEO Pat Shanahan said several factors were hurting the company’s finances, including a slowdown in production after a door plug blew out on an <a href="https://www.ksn.com/news/alaska-airlines-flight-makes-emergency-landing-in-portland-after-window-blew-out/">Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 in January. The plane was forced to make an emergency landing</a>.</p>



<p>Boeing slowed 737 production below 38 a month in order to add quality and safety measures. Shanahan said Spirit will produce about 31 a month for the rest of the year. He also said a slowdown did not necessarily mean the number of employees would drop.</p>





<p>“Our teammates aren’t 100% variable with rate,” Shanahan said. “It doesn’t make sense to go up and down and have people go in and out the door. We’ve invested a lot in their training.”</p>



<p>Of the 21,000 employees Spirit has worldwide, 12,500 work at its Wichita plant.</p>



<p>During his comments on May 7, Shanahan said the company is trying to find the right balance and warned that Spirit would have to make some decisions in the next couple of weeks.</p>

<li><strong>Choosing a mortgage term and type</strong>: When selecting a mortgage, consider loan terms (e.g., 15- or 30-year terms) and mortgage types (e.g., fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate) to find the best fit for your financial situation and goals.</li>

The average 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate is 7.13% today, down -0.05% over the last week. The average rate for a 15-year fixed mortgage is 6.57%, which is an increase of 0.03% compared to a week ago. For a look at mortgage rate movement, see the chart below.</p>
<p>
Because inflation data hasn’t been improving, the Federal Reserve has been postponing rate cuts. Though mortgage rates could still go down later in the year, housing market predictions change regularly in response to economic data, geopolitical events and more.</p>

<h2 id="which-mortgage-term-and-type-should-i-pick-">Which mortgage term and type should I pick? </h2>
<p>
Each mortgage has a loan term, or payment schedule. The most common mortgage terms are 15 and 30 years, although 10-, 20- and 40-year mortgages also exist. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate is set for the duration of the loan, offering stability. With an adjustable-rate mortgage, the interest rate is only fixed for a certain amount of time (commonly five, seven or 10 years), after which the rate adjusts annually based on the market. Fixed-rate mortgages are a better option if you plan to live in a home in the long term, but adjustable-rate mortgages may offer lower interest rates upfront.</p>
<h3>30-year fixed-rate mortgages</h3>
<p>
The 30-year fixed-mortgage rate average is 7.13% today. A 30-year fixed mortgage is the most common loan term. It will often have a higher interest rate than a 15-year mortgage, but you’ll have a lower monthly payment.</p>
<h3>15-year fixed-rate mortgages</h3>
<p>
Today, the average rate for a 15-year, fixed mortgage is 6.57%. Though you’ll have a bigger monthly payment than a 30-year fixed mortgage, a 15-year loan usually comes with a lower interest rate, allowing you to pay less interest in the long run and pay off your mortgage sooner.</p>
<h3>5/1 adjustable-rate mortgages</h3>
<p>
A 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage has an average rate of 6.58% today. You’ll typically get a lower introductory interest rate with a 5/1 ARM in the first five years of the mortgage. But you could pay more after that period, depending on how the rate adjusts annually. If you plan to sell or refinance your house within five years, an ARM could be a good option.</p>
<h2 id="whats-behind-todays-high-mortgage-rates-">What’s behind today’s high mortgage rates? </h2>
<p>
Over the last few years, high inflation and the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes pushed up mortgage rates from their record lows around the pandemic. Since last summer, the Fed has <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-rate-predictions-march-fed-meeting/">consistently kept the federal funds rate at 5.25% to 5.5%</a>. Though the central bank <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/how-the-federal-reserve-affects-mortgage-rates/">doesn’t directly set the rates for mortgages</a>, a high federal funds rate makes borrowing more expensive, including for home loans.</p>
<p>
Mortgage rates change daily, but average rates have been moving between 6.5% and 7.5% since late last fall. Today’s homebuyers have less room in their budget to afford the cost of a home due to elevated mortgage rates and steep home prices. <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/how-a-housing-shortage-is-driving-up-home-prices/">Limited housing inventory</a> and low wage growth are also contributing to the <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/how-an-unaffordable-housing-market-leaves-the-next-generation-out-in-the-cold/">affordability crisis</a> and keeping mortgage demand down.</p>
<h2 id="will-mortgage-rates-drop-this-year">Will mortgage rates drop this year?</h2>
<p>
Most housing market experts predict <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-forecast-february-2024/">rates will end the year between 6% and 6.5%</a>. Ultimately, a more affordable mortgage market will depend on how quickly the Fed begins cutting interest rates. The central bank could start lowering interest rates in the fall, but it will depend on how the economy fares in the coming months.</p>
<p>
Mortgage rates fluctuate for many reasons: supply, demand, <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-predictions-inflation-data-mortgage-rates/">inflation</a>, monetary policy, <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-rate-predictions-labor-data/">jobs data</a> and market expectations. Homebuyers won’t see lower rates overnight, and it’s unlikely there will ever be a return to the <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-predictions-the-new-normal-for-mortgage-rates/">2-3% mortgage rates</a> we saw between 2000 and early 2022.</p>
<p>
“We are expecting mortgage rates to fall to around 6.5% by the end of this year, but there’s still a lot of volatility I think we might see,” said <a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/author/darylfairweather/">Daryl Fairweather</a>, chief economist at Redfin.</p>
<p>
Every month brings a new set of <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-predictions-inflation-data-mortgage-rates/">inflation</a> and <a href="/personal-finance/mortgages/advice/mortgage-rate-predictions-labor-data/">labor data</a> that can influence the direction of mortgage rates, said <a href="https://www.firstam.com/economics/odeta-kushi/">Odeta Kushi</a>, deputy chief economist at First American Financial Corporation. “Ongoing inflation deceleration, a slowing economy and even geopolitical uncertainty can contribute to lower mortgage rates. On the other hand, data that signals upside risk to inflation may result in higher rates,” Kushi said.</p>
<p>
Here’s a look at where some major housing authorities expect average mortgage rates to land.</p>

Though mortgage rates and home prices are high, the housing market won’t be unaffordable forever. It’s always a good time to save for a down payment and improve your credit score to help you secure a competitive mortgage rate when the time is right.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Save for a bigger down payment:</b> Though a 20% down payment isn’t required, a larger upfront payment means taking out a smaller mortgage, which will help you save in interest.</li>
<li><b>Boost your credit score:</b> You can qualify for a conventional mortgage with a 620 credit score, but a higher score of at least 740 will get you better rates.</li>
<li><b>Pay off debt:</b> Experts recommend a debt-to-income ratio of 36% or less to help you qualify for the best rates. Not carrying other debt will put you in a better position to handle your monthly payments.</li>
<li><b>Research loans and assistance:</b> Government-sponsored loans have more flexible borrowing requirements than conventional loans. Some government-sponsored or private programs can also help with your down payment and closing costs.</li>
<li><b>Shop around for lenders:</b> Researching and comparing multiple loan offers from different lenders can help you secure the lowest mortgage rate for your situation.</li>

    </div><div class="content article-descr news-text">
    <div><div data-cy="article-content" class="rawHtml-content-no-nativo"><p>If you graduate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with elite computer skills, you can make great money working for a tech company—or even more money working on Wall Street. But if that doesn’t grab you, and you want to get even richer, you can always try your hand at white-collar crime like twentysomething brothers Anton and James Peraire-Bueno. The pair came up with a scheme that let them pocket $25 million in just 12 seconds. Unfortunately, it ended badly, as the feds announced yesterday in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/two-brothers-arrested-attacking-ethereum-blockchain-and-stealing-25-million" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/two-brothers-arrested-attacking-ethereum-blockchain-and-stealing-25-million" rel="noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">press release</a> that reads like a pulp novel.</p><div class="paywall paywallActive">



<p>“Unfortunately for the defendants, their alleged crimes were no match for Department of Justice prosecutors and IRS agents,” wrote the DOJ. For good measure, the release quotes an agent who declares the crime was solved “with cutting-edge technology and good-ole-fashioned investigative work.”</p>



<p>Purple prose aside, the case involves some impressive detective work as well as a sophisticated explanation by Justice Department lawyers of a new type of alleged crime involving the Ethereum blockchain. The crime involves the arcane business of “Maximum Extractable Value,” or MEV, which entails packaging transactions in a block in a way that allows those who construct the blockchain to profit from others’ transactions.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>The miners who build blockchains do not, of course, do this out of the goodness of their hearts. Instead, the process relies on incentives that allow miners—in the case of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other chains—to obtain a reward in the form of both coins and transaction fees for adding a new block. When Ethereum switched to a new blockchain construction process known as proof-of-stake, however, it created new opportunities for miners to make money—including by front-running trades included in the blocks they package. This is what people mean by MEV. (Bitcoin investment firm <a href="https://river.com/learn/what-is-mev-does-it-apply-to-bitcoin-mining/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://river.com/learn/what-is-mev-does-it-apply-to-bitcoin-mining/" rel="noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">River</a>, as well as the DOJ’s <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/media/1351931/dl" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/media/1351931/dl" rel="noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">criminal indictment</a>, has a good explanation of how exactly it works).</p>



<p>MEV has been around for a while now, and while a number of people in crypto find it distasteful, it is not illegal—and indeed, similar things go on in the world of traditional finance such as the practice known as payment for order flow. The Peraire-Bueno brothers, however, took things a step further when they detected a bug in a popular piece of software used to carry out MEV. This allowed them not to simply front-run Ethereum users’ transactions, but to tamper with them in a way that allowed them to outright rob them.</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>All of this is likely to draw new scrutiny of the murky practice of MEV, and potentially lead to calls for reform among the Ethereum crowd. As for the Peraire-Bueno, the episode also showed that people with MIT degrees are also capable of old-fashioned stupidity. Not only did they get caught, but the DOJ also found evidence they conducted web searches about things like money laundering and how to get away with financial fraud.

  <p id="MMZssw">At long last, Foxtrot and Dom’s Kitchen &amp; Market’s ownership filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on Tuesday, May 14. The filing comes four days after Foxtrot’s assets were snapped up for $2.2 million at an auction held on Friday, May 10, <a href="https://www.chicagobusiness.com/retail/foxtrot-assets-sell-auction">according to <em>Crain’s</em></a> — and as rumors swirl that Foxtrot co-founder Mike LaVitola is attempting to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___et__p_23921739__t_w__d_D&amp;id=66960X1516589&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2024/05/14/foxtrot-founder-mike-lavitola-eyes-brand-revival/&amp;referrer=eater.com&amp;sref=https://chicago.eater.com/2024/5/16/24157698/foxtrot-bankruptcy-auction-comeback-outfox" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-cdata='{"rewritten_url":"https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___et__p_23921739__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516589\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2024/05/14/foxtrot-founder-mike-lavitola-eyes-brand-revival/\u0026referrer=eater.com\u0026sref=https://chicago.eater.com/2024/5/16/24157698/foxtrot-bankruptcy-auction-comeback-outfox","subtag_max_length":50,"subtag_delim_length":3,"subtag_key":"xcust","subtag_data":{"xcust":"___et__p_23921739__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder","id":"66960X1516589","xs":"1","url":"https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2024/05/14/foxtrot-founder-mike-lavitola-eyes-brand-revival/","referrer":"eater.com","sref":"https://chicago.eater.com/2024/5/16/24157698/foxtrot-bankruptcy-auction-comeback-outfox"},"encode_subtag":false}'>revive Foxtrot and reopen</a> as many as 10 locations.</p>
<p id="o6gG2R">Parent company Outfox Hospitality <a href="https://chicago.eater.com/2024/4/23/24138226/foxtrot-dom-kitchen-market-bankrupcty-closing">shut down operations on April 23</a> stunning shocked vendors and former workers, with insiders saying a bankruptcy filing was inevitable. The shutdown left about 1,000 workers without jobs and customers without a trendy spot to buy wine, sip coffee, and buy fancy snacks. Foxtrot also pushed customers to its app for delivery, captializing on liquor sales while pandemic safeguards closed bars and restaurants.</p>
<p id="FOjgac">Outfox filed for bankruptcy in Delaware court and estimates its value (and liabilities) between $10 million and $50 million; the filing shows the company has between 5,001 to 10,000 creditors. That’s more than the only bid made at last week’s auction. The winner was <a href="https://www.further-point.com">Further Point Enterprises</a>, a private fund with a portfolio that already lists Foxtrot and non-alcoholic beverage company Athletic Brewing in its holdings. The bid only accounted for the 33 Foxtrots scattered across Chicago, Texas, and the D.C. area. No one placed a bid on Dom’s assets separately.</p>
<p id="R2YoMH"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-27/chicago-food-retailers-foxtrot-and-dom-s-kitchen-to-merge">Foxtrot and Dom’s merged</a> in November 2023. Foxtrot wanted to expand to big markets like New York, while Dom’s wanted to expand its Chicago footprint with stores in Fulton Market and West Loop. Dom’s founders include Bob Mariano, who helped start the Mariano’s grocery chain.</p>
<p id="NjWhG9"><em>Crain’s </em>reports that Foxtrot’s assets offered at the auction didn’t include leases, but vaguely included “goods, equipment, inventory, intellectual property, figures, and more.” Last week, Eater reached out to the contact listed on Further Point Enterprises’s website, managing partner David Magruder, but there was no response.</p>
<p id="XaFspQ">The Substack publication Snaxshot, and author Andrea Hernandez — a tenacious observer of the Outfox saga, <a href="https://www.snaxshot.com/p/foxtrot-markets-comeback?r=91pn&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;triedRedirect=true">spoke with sources who attended the auction</a> and described a scene where a rep from JP Morgan seemed overwhelmed by the more than 150 people who logged online. The audiences for these auctions don’t usually draw as much interest. Potential bidders weren’t given a list of individual assets, meaning they would have to bid on the company without knowing what exactly they were purchasing. However, Snaxshot notes the auction’s public notice included a list in “very vague terms.” Further Point’s winning bid came before any other bids were solicited. According to a screenshot of the auction, held on video via Microsoft Teams, and a post Snaxshot, one person in the chat exclaimed: “This is like a setup?”</p>

Each menu contains unique dishes like king crab buñuelo, kampachi, lamb terrine, and more.</cnx-span></p><hr class="border last"></div></div></div></div><p id="sHXa78">Jordan Tepper, co-founder of Chicago-based liqueur company <a href="https://www.apologueliqueurs.com/">Apologue</a>, was on the auction call Friday afternoon. Apologue is a former Foxtrot vendor — Tepper estimates Foxtrot stores in Chicago possess unsold Apologue bottles valued in the low five-figure range. He was tipped off to the auction by Hernandez’s social media post. Tepper says the auction abruptly ended, but the call continued with conversation amongst vendors and potential bidders after reps from the bank signed off. Tepper says that some on the call began to speculate that LaVitola was behind the Further Point’s winning — and only — bid: “One party [Further Point Enterprises] had been in communication with the bank, JP Morgan,” Tepper tells Eater.</p>
<p id="LiyK71">Tepper fueled speculation around LaVitola’s alleged involvement further on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordan-tepper-6876464_foxtrot-is-baaaaack-looks-like-activity-7194749300206182400-MfYn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android">Friday afternoon with a LinkedIn post</a>. Others, like Snaxshot, chimed in to point out the Foxtrot was already listed under Further Point’s umbrella of assets. One commenter on Tepper’s LinkedIn post drew comparisons to WeWork, whose <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/adam-neumann-submits-over-500-mln-bid-buy-back-wework-wsj-reports-2024-03-25/">founder Adam Neumann</a> bid to repurchase the company in March for $500 million. The company was worth $47 billion before its spiral toward bankruptcy.</p>
<p id="uWve2x">As Further Point’s bid excluded leases, any Foxtrot comeback is contingent on negotiating new agreements with landlords. On Wednesday, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___et__p_23921739__t_w__d_D&amp;id=66960X1516589&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2024/05/14/foxtrot-founder-mike-lavitola-eyes-brand-revival/&amp;referrer=eater.com&amp;sref=https://chicago.eater.com/2024/5/16/24157698/foxtrot-bankruptcy-auction-comeback-outfox" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-cdata='{"rewritten_url":"https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___et__p_23921739__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516589\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2024/05/14/foxtrot-founder-mike-lavitola-eyes-brand-revival/\u0026referrer=eater.com\u0026sref=https://chicago.eater.com/2024/5/16/24157698/foxtrot-bankruptcy-auction-comeback-outfox","subtag_max_length":50,"subtag_delim_length":3,"subtag_key":"xcust","subtag_data":{"xcust":"___et__p_23921739__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder","id":"66960X1516589","xs":"1","url":"https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2024/05/14/foxtrot-founder-mike-lavitola-eyes-brand-revival/","referrer":"eater.com","sref":"https://chicago.eater.com/2024/5/16/24157698/foxtrot-bankruptcy-auction-comeback-outfox"},"encode_subtag":false}'>the Real Deal published</a> its report after talking to a few of those landlords who tell the real estate publication that they’re considering new leases with Foxtrot’s new ownership group. Locations include Gold Coast, Lincoln Park, Willis Tower, Old Town, Gold Coast, and Lakeview. A second source familiar with Friday’s auction who wished to remain anonymous claims LaVitola has an interest in reopening 10 locations.</p>
<p id="DErNFx">The prospect of a relaunch has raised doubts about whether Foxtrot will retain the same brand power that made the store a source of unique snacks and items from popular local restaurants. Rebuilding trust could take time. Meanwhile, vendors continue to figure out their next step in making up for lost revenues. For example, Andersonville’s Andale Market <a href="https://andalemarket.com/blogs/news/patio-pop-up-for-foxtrot-doms-local-vendors">is holding pop-up events</a> on Sunday, May 19, and Saturday, May 25 to sell items from at least seven former Foxtrot and Dom’s vendors. Many vendors who spoke with Eater say they feel betrayed by Foxtrot and don’t want to work with them. Tepper feels any ill-will directed at Foxtrot from vendors about the abruptness of the shutdown will quickly subside.</p>
<p id="hIm2Sx">“My gut is people, overall, have a pretty short memory and are not as passionate about this as a few folks,” Tepper says. “I do think customers will come back quickly, most suppliers will continue, after all, they’re all in the business of getting [purchase orders].”</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>McDonald's is launching a limited-time offer, a $5 meal promo, starting June 25, to lure back customers who may be cutting back on fast food due to recent price hikes at other chains.</li>
<li>The $5 meal will come with a choice of a McChicken, McDouble, or four-piece chicken nuggets, along with small fries and a small drink.</li>
<li>The promo is intended to provide meaningful value to customers and is seen as essential in these inflationary times when many consumers are cutting back on discretionary spending.</li>
<li>According to a poll by Revenue Management Solutions, 25% of those earning under $50,000 are cutting back on fast food due to cost concerns, indicating that low-income Americans are particularly affected by price hikes.</li>
<li>The $5 meal promo is seen as a way for McDonald's to differentiate itself and attract price-conscious customers who are looking for a good value, amid a backdrop of rising prices and inflationary pressures in the fast-food industry.</li>

    <div><section class="content__body"><p>McDonald's plans to launch a $5 meal promo in an effort to lure back customers scared away by recent price hikes to its menu.</p><p>The limited-time offer is slated to begin June 25 and will last about a month, a source familiar with the promotion told CBS MoneyWatch on Wednesday. The value meal will include a choice of either a McChicken, a McDouble or four-piece chicken nuggets as well as small fries and a small drink.</p><p>"We know how much it means to our customers when McDonald's offers meaningful value and communicates it through national advertising. That's been true since our very beginning and never more important than it is today," McDonald's USA told CBS MoneyWatch. </p>    
  <p>Bloomberg first reported McDonald's plans to offer a $5 promo meal, which required approval from franchise owners. Palmaccio and other franchise owners gave the new promotion their consent this week, with McDonald's thanking those operators in an internal message Tuesday night. </p><p>"Great value and affordability have always been a hallmark of McDonald's brand, and all three legs of the stool are coming together to deliver that at a time when our customers really need it," McDonald's franchise owner John Palmaccio said.  </p>

    </p>
<p>Talk of the upcoming $5 meal promo comes weeks after McDonald's executives reported slower growth in foot traffic at its restaurants. Some inflation-weary customers <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mcdonalds-price-increases-fast-food-cost-popeyes-wendys/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">are cutting back on fast-food dining</a></span> after many chains boosted menu item prices. Between 2014 and 2024, Popeye's, Jimmy John's and Subway hiked their food prices 86%, 62% and 39%, respectively. </p><p>Fast-food chains point to rising labor costs and costs of food as the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-consumer-spending-food-and-restaurants-disposable-income-2024/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">key factors driving up prices</a></span>. </p><p>Still, the hikes appear to be particularly harmful to low-income Americans. A January <a href="https://www.revenuemanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Feb24-RMS-RestaurantConsumers-General.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">poll</a> by consulting firm Revenue Management Solutions found that about 25% of people who make under $50,000 were cutting back on fast food, pointing to cost as a concern.</p><p>Casual dining restaurants — like Applebee's and IHOP — are also feeling the absence of low-income Americans. </p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'>
    </p>
<p>The company has to be "laser-focused" on keeping prices affordable to convince customers to return, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said during an April 30 earnings call with analysts and investors.</p><p>"Consumers continue to be even more discriminating with every dollar that they spend as they face elevated prices in their day-to-day spending, which is putting pressure on the industry," Kempczinski added. "[I]t's imperative that we continue to keep affordability at the forefront for our customers."</p><p>McDonald's, the nation's largest fast-food chain, with more than 2 million people employed at its 14,300 restaurants and another 150,000 employees at its corporate offices. A majority of McDonald's locations are owned and operated by franchisees.</p><p>To be sure, a $5 meal wouldn't necessarily make McDonald's a pioneer in the fast-food industry. In 2015, Wendy's <a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/4-for-4-how-iconic-meal-deal-came-to-life" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">introduced</a> the 4 for $4 meal that includes a small hamburger, four-piece chicken nuggets, small fries and a small drink. In 2019, Wendy's added its $5 Biggie Bag which includes a choice of sandwich or four chicken nuggets, and a small order of fries and a small drink.</p>
