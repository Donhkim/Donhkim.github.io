<ol>
<li>Workers at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama voted against allowing the United Automobile Workers (UAW) to represent them, dealing a blow to the union's efforts to gain ground in the South.</li>
<li>The vote was seen as a test of the UAW's ability to build on recent victories and make strides in a state with a history of hostility towards organized labor.</li>
<li>The outcome was met with celebration from state officials, who argued that a pro-union vote would choke off investment in the state and negatively impact the auto industry.</li>
<li>The defeat dims the chances of the UAW successfully organizing workers at other major auto factories in Alabama, including those owned by Hyundai and Honda.</li>
<li>The UAW has stated its goal of organizing every automobile factory in the United States, including companies like Toyota and Tesla, in order to expand its membership.</li>

(AGM) for Calhoun to remain on the board in a preliminary tally.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The proxy adviser Glass Lewis had recommended shareholders vote against the re-election of Calhoun and two other directors to Boeing’s board, citing dissatisfaction over efforts to transform the planemaker’s safety culture.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Steven Mollenkopf, Boeing’s chair and the former boss of Qualcomm, is leading the search to replace Calhoun, who said he would retire by year-end as part of a management shakeup following a January mid-air blowout on a new 737 Max 9.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Boeing is “committed to a process that will identify the next CEO to lead Boeing through our current challenges and into the future”, he said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The company has sought feedback from customers, employees and investors in the search, Mollenkopf said. “The months and years ahead are critically important to our company as we take the necessary steps to regain the trust lost in recent times, get back on track and perform like the company that we all know Boeing can and must be every day.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Boeing shares have plunged 30% this year. “I would think it’s going to be a rougher ride, this AGM,” said David Duffy, co-founder and director of the Dublin-based Corporate Governance Institute, in reference to Mollenkopf.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Most [attendees] are institutional investors who want to know, ‘Can you give us some sort of commitment you’re going to sort this place out and what you hope to achieve within a certain space of time?’ Duffy said. “What he says in the AGM is going to be important, not just for investors but passengers.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Shareholders also supported a non-binding advisory vote on compensation, after the proxy adviser ISS flagged a misalignment between CEO pay and company performance.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline"

<li>Frontier Airlines is eliminating change fees for all cabins, including economy, premium, and business class.</li>

<li>Frontier is extending the expiration date for flight credits to one year, and offering 2,500 miles to customers who find a lower price elsewhere.</li>
<li>The changes are part of the airline's "new era" of transparency and customer-friendly policies, aimed at complying with the Biden administration's mandate to disclose all fees.</li>
<li>The moves come amidst a broader push by the Biden administration to regulate the airline industry, including rules requiring automatic cash refunds for cancelled flights and protection from surprise airline "junk fees".</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) were not the only stocks involved in the recent "meme craze", a phenomenon where investors buy and sell stocks without considering their fundamentals.</li>
<li>While the original meme stocks (GME and AMC) "unraveled" on Friday, smaller stocks related to the meme craze saw significant gains, with Faraday Future (FFIE) soaring by as much as 122% on Friday before crashing.</li>
<li>Faraday Future, an EV-related startup, saw a gain of over 2,000% over the past five days, with its stock being the third-most-mentioned on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, behind the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) and Nvidia (NVDA).</li>
<li>Retail traders and YouTubers are targeting heavily shorted stocks, which can lead to a surge in their prices. Faraday Future, for example, has a short interest of roughly 92% of its float.</li>
<li>The article suggests that the meme craze is reminiscent of 2021, when retail traders and YouTubers fueled a similar phenomenon in the market.</li>

              </figcaption></figure><p>While the rate climate in recent years has hurt all types of borrowers, it's been a boost for savers with select accounts. With rates on <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/high-yield-savings-account/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">high-yield savings</a></span> and <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whats-a-certificate-of-deposit-cd/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">certificates of deposit (CD) accounts</a></span> less than 1% in 2020 and 2021, savers had no real way to grow their funds with these vehicles. But as the pandemic faded and <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-june-cpi-report-hit-new-high-40-years-9-1-percent/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">inflation surged</a></span>, the federal funds rate rose in tandem. That caused rates on both savings accounts to rise exponentially. As of May 2024, savers can now earn upward of <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-todays-cd-interest-rates/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">5%</a></span> with either (<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-you-should-open-cd-and-high-yield-savings-account-this-week/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">or both</a></span>) of these accounts. That said, 5% may not seem like a substantial amount but when viewed as dollars and cents, savers can gain a better perspective on what they stand to earn.</p><p>Right now, the very best rates are typically offered on CDs. And you won't need to deposit an exorbitant amount or keep your money locked away forever to realize a significant return. Still, before getting started, it helps to see what your bottom line will be after the account <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-to-do-when-your-cd-matures-according-to-experts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">matures</a></span>. To that end, below we've broken down exactly how much a $10,000 deposit into a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/best-6-month-cd-rates/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">6-month CD</a></span> would earn at today's elevated rates.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhow-much-interest-would-a-10000-6-month-cd-earn-now&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhow-much-interest-would-a-10000-6-month-cd-earn-now%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=ab4a4ea6-2290-4971-afd7-0b3623f78e86" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See how much more you could be earning with a top CD account here now</a>.</p><p></p><h2><strong>How much interest would a $10,000 6-month CD earn now?</strong></h2><p>To determine precisely how much a $10,000 6-month CD will earn if opened this month, you'll have to know the interest rate it's opened with. Since different lenders offer different rates based on the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cd-terms-everything-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">term</a></span> (or length) of the CD, this could vary. That understood, here's what the account will earn based off of some common 6-month CDs rates available online now:</p><ul><li><strong>5.35%:</strong> $264.01 in interest for a total amount of $10,264.01 after six months. </li><li><strong>5.30%:</strong> $261.58 in interest for a total amount of $10,261.58 after six months. </li><li><strong>5.25%:</strong> $259.14 for a total amount of $10,259.14 after six months.</li><li><strong>5.00%:</strong> $246.95 for a total amount of $10,246.95 after six months. </li></ul><p>As can be seen, rates on six-month CDs are in the same range right now across lenders. But if you're truly after the highest rate possible, consider opening a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/should-you-open-a-cd-account-online/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">CD with an online bank</a></span> versus one with physical branches. Since online banks often don't have the overhead costs of maintaining physical locations, they can frequently offer higher rates to customers than their counterparts with banks in different parts of the country.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhow-much-interest-would-a-10000-6-month-cd-earn-now&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhow-much-interest-would-a-10000-6-month-cd-earn-now%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=ab4a4ea6-2290-4971-afd7-0b3623f78e86" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Start exploring your 6-month CD account options online today</a>.</p><h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>While the above returns are substantial, savers stand to earn even more if they make a larger deposit or extend the term past six months.

    </p>
<p>But it's important to remember that <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cd-early-withdrawal-penalties-what-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">early withdrawal penalties</a></span> will apply if you take your money out of the account before it matures, so only deposit an amount you're comfortable parting with for the full term. And be cognizant of tax implications as you may have to pay <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-you-avoid-taxes-on-cd-account-interest/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">taxes</a></span> if the interest you earn on a CD surpasses a certain threshold. But if you understand these nuances - and account for them in advance - you can earn a few hundred dollars right now simply by transferring some money into one of today's top 6-month CD accounts.</p>

<p>An Indiana judge, Craig Bobay, ruled in favor of Martin Quintana, a restaurateur, allowing him to open his second location of The Famous Taco restaurant in Fort Wayne, Indiana.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quintana had been trying to open the new location for about three years, but his initial proposal was denied by the Fort Wayne Plan Commission due to a commitment limiting the business to a "sandwich bar-style restaurant".</p>

<p>Quintana sued the city, arguing that his restaurant would serve made-to-order tacos, burritos, and other Mexican-style food items, which are considered "Mexican-style sandwiches" by the judge.</p>

                                        <p>FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) — An Indiana judge who declared that “tacos and burritos are Mexican-style sandwiches” has cleared the way for the opening of a new restaurant, delighting a restauranteur following a legal battle.</p><p>Martin Quintana, 53, has been trying for about three years to open his second The Famous Taco location in Fort Wayne, a city about 120 miles (190 kilometers) northeast of Indianapolis.</p><p>But the initial written commitment for the development at a plaza Quintana owns limits the business to “a sandwich bar-style restaurant whose primary business is to sell ‘made-to-order’ or ‘subway-style’ sandwiches.”</p><p>Quintana said the nearby Covington Creek Association contacted him to say that his The Famous Taco proposal “somehow ran afoul” to that commitment.</p><p>He sued the Fort Wayne Plan Commission in December 2022 after it denied his proposed amendment that would specifically allow his restaurant to offer made-to-order tacos, burritos and other Mexican-style food items, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.journalgazette.net/local/courts/allen-county-judge-rules-that-developer-can-open-famous-taco-in-southwest-fort-wayne/article_375e0948-1194-11ef-a000-43b34bac5019.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Journal Gazette</a></span> reported.</p>
    

<p>Allen Superior Court Judge Craig Bobay ruled Monday that the plan commission acted correctly when it denied Quintan’s proposed amendment. But the judge also found that his request was not needed and he found that the original commitment allows restaurants like the proposed The Famous Taco.</p>



<p>“The Court agrees with Quintana that tacos and burritos are Mexican-style sandwiches, and the original Written Commitment does not restrict potential restaurants to only American cuisine-style sandwiches,” Bobay wrote.</p>
    
<p>Quintana said Thursday he is relieved the legal fight is over, and he is looking forward to opening his second The Famous Taco restaurant in Fort Wayne, which is Indiana’s second-most populous city with about 270,000 residents.</p><p>“I’m glad this thing is over. We are happy. When you have a decision like this the only thing you can be is happy. We’re excited,” he told The Associated Press.</p>
    

<p>Quintana said he came to the U.S. from Mexico in 1988, working first as a farm worker in California picking grapes, olives and kiwi fruit before entering the restaurant business in Michigan before moving to Chicago and finally Fort Wayne in 2001. He also operates a second restaurant in the city.</p><p>Quintana said his new family-owned The Famous Taco restaurant should open in two or three months. He said that like his other The Famous Taco location that opened nearly seven years ago, customers will be able choose their favored toppings for tacos, burritos or tortas assembled by eatery staff.</p><p>“You know, that’s a sandwich, that’s bread. That’s a sandwich,” he said of tortas. “We go through a lot of those.”</p>

In order for that lender to make a profit and reduce risk to itself, it will charge interest on the principal — that is, the amount you borrowed.</p><p>Expressed as a percentage, a mortgage interest rate is essentially the cost of borrowing money. It can vary based on several factors, such as your <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/credit-score-needed-for-mortgage" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>credit score</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/what-is-your-dti-ratio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>debt-to-income ratio</u></a> (DTI), <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/first-time-homebuyer-down-payment-assistance?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>down payment</u></a>, loan amount and repayment term.</p><p>After getting a mortgage, you’ll typically receive an <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/first-time-homebuyers-mortgage-amortization-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>amortization schedule</u></a>, which shows your payment schedule over the life of the loan. It also indicates how much of each payment goes toward the principal balance versus the interest.</p><p>Near the beginning of the loan term, you’ll spend more money on interest and less on the principal balance. As you approach the end of the repayment term, you’ll pay more toward the principal and less toward interest.</p><p>Your mortgage interest rate can be either fixed or adjustable. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the rate will be consistent for the duration of the loan. With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate can fluctuate with the market.</p><p>Keep in mind that a mortgage’s interest rate is not the same as its annual percentage rate (APR). This is because an APR includes both the interest rate and any other lender fees or charges.</p><p data-unit-credible="rate-table,mortgage-combined,interactive" class="credible"></p><p>Mortgage rates change frequently — sometimes on a daily basis. Inflation plays a significant role in these fluctuations. Interest rates tend to rise in periods of high inflation, whereas they tend to drop or remain roughly the same in times of low inflation. Other factors, like the economic climate, demand, and inventory can also impact the current average mortgage rates.</p><p>To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible’s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score.

Here are some other personal factors that may determine your mortgage rate:</p><ul><li>Location of the home</li><li>Price of the home</li><li>Your credit score and credit history</li><li>Loan term</li><li>Loan type (e.g., conventional or FHA)</li><li>Interest rate type (fixed or adjustable)</li><li>Down payment amount</li><li>Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio</li><li>DTI</li></ul><p>Other indirect factors that may determine the mortgage rate include:</p><ul><li>Current economic conditions</li><li>Rate of inflation</li><li>Market conditions</li><li>Housing construction supply, demand, and costs</li><li>Consumer spending</li><li>Stock market</li><li>10-year Treasury yields</li><li>Federal Reserve policies</li><li>Current employment rate</li></ul><p data-unit-credible="simple-cta,mortgage-refi,learn-more" class="credible"></p><h2><a name="how-to-compare-mortgage-rates" id="how-to-compare-mortgage-rates"></a>How to compare mortgage rates</h2><p>Along with certain economic and personal factors, the lender you choose can also affect your mortgage rate. Some lenders have higher average mortgage rates than others, regardless of your credit or financial situation. That’s why it’s important to compare lenders and loan offers.</p><p>Here are some of the best ways to compare mortgage rates and ensure you get the best one:</p><ul><li><strong>Shop around for lenders: </strong>Compare several lenders to find the best rates and lowest fees. Even if the rate is only lower by a few basis points, it could still save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.</li><li><strong>Get several loan estimates: </strong>A loan estimate comes with a more personalized rate and fees based on factors like income, employment, and the property’s location. Review and compare loan estimates from several lenders.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved for a mortgage: </strong><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/mortgage-preapproval?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-approval</a> doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a loan, but it can give you a better idea of what you qualify for and at what interest rate. You’ll need to complete an application and undergo a hard credit check.</li><li><strong>Consider a mortgage rate lock: </strong>A <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/money/lock-or-float-mortgage-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>mortgage rate lock</u></a> lets you lock in the current mortgage rate for a certain amount of time — often between 30 and 90 days. During this time, you can continue shopping around for a home without worrying about the rate changing.</li><li><strong>Choose between an adjustable- and fixed-rate mortgage: </strong>The interest rate type can affect how much you pay over time, so consider your options carefully.</li></ul><p>One other way to compare mortgage rates is with a mortgage calculator. Use a calculator to determine your monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan. Just remember, certain fees like homeowners insurance or taxes might not be included in the calculations.</p><p>Here’s a simple example of what a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might look like versus a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage:</p><h3>15-year fixed-rate</h3><ul><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>$300,000</li><li><strong>Interest rate: </strong>6.29%</li><li><strong>Monthly payment: </strong>$2,579</li><li><strong>Total interest charges: </strong>$164,186</li><li><strong>Total loan amount: </strong>$464,186</li></ul><h3>30-year fixed-rate</h3><ul><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>$300,000</li><li><strong>Interest rate: </strong>6.89%</li><li><strong>Monthly payment: </strong>$1,974</li><li><strong>Total interest charges: </strong>$410,566</li><li><strong>Total loan amount: </strong>$710,565</li></ul><p data-unit-credible="simple-cta,mortgage,find-my-rate" class="credible"></p><h2><a name="pros-and-cons-of-mortgages" id="pros-and-cons-of-mortgages"></a>Pros and cons of mortgages</h2><p>If you’re thinking about taking out a mortgage, here are some benefits to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Predictable monthly payments: </strong>Fixed-rate mortgage loans come with a set interest rate that doesn’t change over the life of the loan. This means more consistent monthly payments.</li><li><strong>Potentially low interest rates: </strong>With good credit and a high down payment, you could get a competitive interest rate. Adjustable-rate mortgages may also come with a lower initial interest rate than fixed-rate loans.</li><li><strong>Tax benefits: </strong>Having a mortgage could make you eligible for certain tax benefits, such as a <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/mortgage-interest-deduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>mortgage interest deduction</u></a>.</li><li><strong>Potential asset: </strong>Real estate is often considered an asset. As you pay down your loan, you can also build home equity, which you can use for other things like debt consolidation or home improvement projects.</li><li><strong>Credit score boost: </strong>With on-time payments, you can build your credit score.</li></ul><p>And here are some of the biggest downsides of getting a mortgage:</p><ul><li><strong>Expensive fees and interest: </strong>You could end up paying thousands of dollars in interest and other fees over the life of the loan. You will also be responsible for maintenance, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/property-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>property taxes</u></a>, and homeowners insurance.</li><li><strong>Long-term debt: </strong>Taking out a mortgage is a major financial commitment. Typical loan terms are 10, 15, 20, and 30 years.</li><li><strong>Potential rate changes: </strong>If you get an <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/adjustable-rate-mortgage-definition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>adjustable rate</u></a>, the interest rate could increase.</li></ul><p data-unit-credible="simple-cta,mortgage,learn-about-mortgage-rates" class="credible"></p><h2><a name="how-to-qualify-for-a-mortgage" id="how-to-qualify-for-a-mortgage"></a>How to qualify for a mortgage</h2><p>Requirements vary by lender, but here are the typical steps to qualify for a mortgage:</p><ol><li><strong>Have steady employment and income: </strong>You’ll need to provide proof of income when applying for a home loan. This may include money from your regular job, alimony, military benefits, commissions, or Social Security payments. You may also need to provide proof of at least two years’ worth of employment at your current company.</li><li><strong>Review any assets: </strong>Lenders consider your assets when deciding whether to lend you money. Common assets include money in your bank account or investment accounts.</li><li><strong>Know your DTI: </strong>Your DTI is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward your monthly debts — like installment loans, lines of credit, or rent. The lower your DTI, the better your approval odds.</li><li><strong>Check your credit score: </strong>To get the best mortgage rate possible, you’ll need to have good credit. However, each loan type has a different credit score requirement. For example, you’ll need a credit score of 580 or higher to qualify for an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment.</li><li><strong>Know the property type: </strong>During the loan application process, you may need to specify whether the home you want to buy is your primary residence. Lenders often view a primary residence as less risky, so they may have more lenient requirements than if you were to get a secondary or investment property.</li><li><strong>Choose the loan type: </strong>Many types of mortgage loans exist, including conventional loans, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/va-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>VA loans</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/usda-loans-what-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>USDA loans</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/how-to-use-fha-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>FHA loans</u></a>, and jumbo loans. Consider your options and pick the best one for your needs.</li><li><strong>Prepare for upfront and closing costs: </strong>Depending on the loan type, you may need to make a down payment. The exact amount depends on the loan type and lender. A USDA loan, for example, has no minimum down payment requirement for eligible buyers. With a conventional loan, you’ll need to put down 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI). You may also be responsible for paying any closing costs when signing for the loan.</li></ol><p data-unit-credible="simple-cta,mortgage,compare-mortgage-rates" class="credible"></p><h2><a name="how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage" id="how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage"></a>How to apply for a mortgage</h2><p>Here are the basic steps to apply for a <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/what-is-a-mortgage?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mortgage</a>, and what you can typically expect during the process:</p><ol><li><a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/money/some-of-the-best-mortgage-lenders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Choose a lender</u></strong></a><strong>: </strong>Compare several lenders to see the types of loans they offer, their average mortgage rates, repayment terms, and fees.

You’ll need identifying documents, as well as documents verifying your employment, income, assets, and debts.</li><li><strong>Submit a formal application: </strong>Complete your chosen lender’s application process — either in person or online — and upload any required documents.</li><li><strong>Wait for the lender to process your loan: </strong>It can take some time for the lender to review your application and make a decision. In some cases, they may request additional information about your finances, assets, or liabilities. Provide this information as soon as possible to prevent delays.</li><li><strong>Complete the closing process: </strong>If approved for a loan, you’ll receive a closing disclosure with information about the loan and any closing costs. Review it, pay the down payment and closing costs, and sign the final loan documents. Some lenders have an online closing process, while others require you to go in person.

	<a href="https://variety.com/t/elon-musk/" id="auto-tag_elon-musk" data-tag="elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> is retiring the last vestige of  — the twitter.com web address — as the social network has fully moved over to the <a href="https://variety.com/t/x/" id="auto-tag_x" data-tag="x">x</a>.com domain name.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“All core systems are now on X.com,” the multibillionaire tech mogul <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1791351500217754008" target="_blank">posted</a> on the platform late Thursday. With the changeover, all twitter.com URLs are now being redirected to the corresponding address on x.com.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	When users logged on to Twitter/X on Friday, they saw a message that said: “Welcome to x.com! We are letting you know that we are changing our URL, but your privacy and data protection settings remain the same.”

</p><p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The move comes after Musk unilaterally rebranded Twitter as X in July 2023. In a late-night post, he declared that <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/twitter-renamed-x-elon-musk-1235677741/">Twitter was no longer the name of the social network</a> — reborn as X, which appears to be his favorite letter of the alphabet. “Soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,” Musk posted on X last July. The company rebranded its mobile apps with the X moniker and moved employee email addresses to x.com.

	</p>


<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Even with the Twitter name scrubbed from the web, many users continue to balk at calling the site X. “Still Twitter,” Marques Brownlee, a popular tech vlogger and podcaster, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1791502158631747830" target="_blank">posted</a> Friday.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Musk earlier this year sparred with Stephen King, after the legendary horror writer said he refused to refer to Twitter as X. In a reply, Musk attempted to make an anti-trans joke — <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/elon-musk-stephen-king-deadnaming-x-twitter-1235912032/">accusing King of “deadnaming” the platform</a>.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Even before Musk had officially closed the debt-laden deal in October 2022 — which he did reluctantly after Twitter sued to hold him to his original $44 billion takeover offer — he had told everyone he was going to change Twitter into X, “the everything app.” </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	To celebrate the new X name, Musk had installed a blindingly bright “X” sign on top of the company’s building in San Francisco but was forced by the city to take it down after complaints, including that the “extremely intense white stroboscopic light” was “causing distress and nausea.”</p>
