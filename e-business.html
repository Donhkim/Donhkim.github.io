                                        <p>Ivan F. Boesky, the flamboyant stock trader whose cooperation with the government cracked open one of the largest insider trading scandals in the history of Wall Street, has died at the age of 87. </p><p>A representative at the Marianne Boesky Gallery, owned by Ivan Boesky’s daughter, confirmed his death. No other details were given. </p><p>The son of a Detroit delicatessen owner, Boesky was once considered one of the richest and most influential risk-takers on Wall Street. He had parlayed $700,000 from his late mother-in-law’s estate into a fortune estimated at more than $200 million, hurtling him into the ranks of Forbes magazine’s list of the 400 richest Americans.</p><p>Once implicated in insider trading, Boesky cooperated with a brash young U.S. attorney named Rudolph Giuliani in a bid for leniency, uncovering a scandal that shattered promising careers, blemished some of the most respected U.S. investment brokerages and injected a certain paranoia into the securities industry.</p>
    

<p>Working undercover, Boesky secretly taped three conversations with Michael Milken, the so-called “junk bond king” whose work with Drexel Burnham Lambert had revolutionized the credit markets. Milken eventually pleaded guilty to six felonies and served 22 months in prison, while Boesky paid a $100 million fine and spent 20 months in a minimum-security California prison nicknamed “Club Fed,” beginning in March 1988.</p>

<p>After Boesky’s arrest, accounts circulated widely that he had had told business students during a commencement address at the University of California at Berkeley in 1985 or 1986, “Greed is all right, by the way. I want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself.”</p>
    
<p>The line was memorably echoed by Michael Douglas in his Oscar-winning portrayal of Gordon Gekko, a high-flying trader, in Oliver Stone’s 1987 film “Wall Street.”</p>
    

<p>“The point is, ladies and gentlemen, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good,” Douglas tells the shareholders of Teldar Paper. “Greed is right. Greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.”</p><p>Boesky, however, said he couldn’t remember saying “greed is healthy” and denied another quotation attributed to him in the 1984 Atlantic Monthly, in which he allegedly said that climbing to the height of a huge pile of silver dollars would be “an aphrodisiac experience.”</p><p>While he usually worked 18-hour days, the silver-haired and lean Boesky also lived a life of opulence. He wore designer clothes, traveled in limousines, private airplanes and helicopters and revamped his 10,000-square-foot Westchester County mansion with a Jeffersonian dome to resemble Monticello.</p><p>“There was a very substantial amount of materiality available,” Boesky said during his 1993 divorce proceedings. “We had places in Palm Beach, Paris, New York, the south of France.”</p><p>Boesky was an arbitrageur, a risk-taker who made millions by betting on stocks thought to be the target of corporate takeovers. But some of his tips came from within the mergers and acquisitions departments of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.</p>
    

<p>Dennis Levine of Drexel and Martin Siegal of Kidder, Peabody fed Boesky confidential information in return for promised cut of profits of either 1% or 5%.</p><p>Boesky paid Siegal $700,000 in three installments, with a courier delivering briefcases full of cash at three clandestine meeting on a street corner and in the lobby of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. Boesky had made millions on Siegal’s tips, which included word that Getty Oil and Carnation Co. were ripe for takeovers.</p><p>Levine was arrested before his payout could come, tripped up by his own insider trading. Facing harsh penalties under the government’s racketeering statutes, Levine revealed everything and Boesky began talking as well, providing information leading to convictions or guilty pleas in cases involving former stockbroker Boyd Jefferies, Siegel, four executives of Britian’s Guiness PLC, takeover strategist Paul Bilzerian, stock speculator Salim Lewis and others.</p>
    

<p>The most notable arrest was of Milken, the pioneering financier who had transformed capital markets in the 1970s with a new form of bond that allowed thousands of mid-sized companies to raise money.</p><p>In the 1980s those “junk” bonds were used to finance thousands of leveraged buyouts, including Revlon, Beatrice Companies, RJR Nabisco Inc. and Federated Department Stores, making Milken a hated and feared figure on Wall Street.</p><p>The financier and philanthropist was indicted on 98 counts, including securities and mail fraud, insider trading, racketeering and making false statements. Prosecutors said Milken and Boesky conspired together to manipulate securities prices, rig transactions and evade taxes and regulatory requirements.</p><p>Milken eventually pleaded guilty to six securities violations, including telling Boesky he’d cover any losses he suffered trading the stock of Fischbach Corp., a takeover target at the time.</p>
    

<p>Prosecutors said Boesky’s cooperation provided the government with the most information about securities law violations since the legislative hearings that led to the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts.</p><p>When John Mulheren Jr. feared he was about to be implicated, the Wall Street executive loaded an assault rifle with the intent of killing Boesky and Boesky’s former head trader, police said. Mulheren was captured en route.</p><p>At trial, Mulheren’s attorney, Thomas Puccio, called Boesky a repeat liar and “pile of human garbage” who was motivated to say anything to assist federal authorities in exchange for leniency.</p><p>“If there ever was a person to whom the title Prince of Darkness could be applied, Ivan Boesky is that man,” Puccio said. “The king of greed, a person who stood for nothing except his own ambition, his own greed.”</p><p>The jury convicted Mulheren, but his conviction was later overturned. Other convictions were reversed as well — those of GAF Corp. and a senior executive, five principals of Princeton-Newport Partners and that of a former Drexel trader.</p><p>The reversals bolstered the arguments of free-traders who argued that Wall Street had been victimized by a publicity-seeking federal prosecutor using racketeering statutes usually reserved to combat organized crime. The government had previously done little to police insider trading, and some said it should be legalized.</p><p>But no one could defend payoffs involving suitcases full of cash. Levine, writing in the pages of Fortune after his release, said he couldn’t understand why Boesky would risk so much by engaging in something so clearly illegal.</p><p>“And I don’t know why Ivan engaged in illegal activities when he had a fortune estimated at over $200 million,” Levine wrote in 1990. “I’m sure he derived much of his wealth from legitimate enterprise: He was skilled at arbitrage and obsessed with his work. He must have been driven by something beyond rational behavior.”</p><p>At his 1987 sentencing Boesky’s lawyer quoted his psychiatrist as saying Boesky “has begun to recognize that he suffered from an abnormal and compulsive need to prove himself, to overcome some sense of inadequacy or inferiority that is rooted in his childhood.”</p><p>Three years after his release from a Brooklyn halfway house in April 1990, Boesky and his wife Seema divorced after 30 years of marriage.</p><p>Claiming he had been left penniless after paying fines, restitution and legal fees, he won $20 million in cash and $180,000 a year in alimony from his wife’s $100 million fortune. He also got a $2.5 million home in the La Jolla section of San Diego, where he lived with his boyhood friend, Houshang Wekili.</p><p>Ivan Frederick Boesky was born in Detroit in 1937 into a family of Russian Jewish immigrants. Boesky said he learned industriousness from his father, who operated three delicatessens. At the age of 13 Boesky bought a 1937 Chevy truck, painted it white and sold ice cream from it in Detroit parks, making about $150 a week in nickels and dimes.</p><p>A three-time college dropout, Boesky entered the Detroit College of Law in 1959, which then did not require an undergraduate degree for admission. He withdrew twice before receiving his degree five years later.</p><p>While in law school Boesky married Seema Silberstein, the daughter of Ben Silberstein, a real estate developer and the owner of the Beverly Hills Hotel.</p><p>Unable to find employment with any major Detroit law firm, Boesky moved in 1966 with his wife and the first of their four children to New York, where he floated from job to job on Wall Street.</p><p>In 1975 Boesky struck out on his own, opening small brokerage that he eventually parlayed into a sprawling group of investment companies with more than 100 employees. He worked grueling hours, gave self-promoting newspapers interviews and wrote a 1985 book entitled “Merger Mania.”</p><p>He was also an active philanthropist, especially with Jewish causes, giving $20 million to endow a library at the Jewish Theological Seminary that was later renamed.</p>

	Trump Media and Technology Group, the company affiliated with former U.S. president <a href="https://variety.com/t/donald-trump/" id="auto-tag_donald-trump" data-tag="donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> that operates Truth Social, reported $770,500 in revenue for the first quarter of 2024 and a net loss of $327.6 million. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Shares in Sarasota, Fla.-based TMTG — which says it is a “safe harbor for free expression amid increasingly harsh censorship by Big Tech corporations” — began trading March 26, 2024, on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “DJT” following its merger with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC). At Monday’s closing price of $48.38/share, TMTG has a market capitalization of about $6.6 billion.

</p><p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Trump owns about 64.9% of the outstanding shares in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, making his stake worth about $5.5 billion currently (though he is restricted from selling TMTG shares for the six-month period after the company’s stock started trading publicly). His holdings of 114.75 million shares include 36 million in “earnout shares” officially determined by TMTG on April 26 in accordance with the DWAC merger agreement.

	</p>


<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In Q1, the company recorded $311 million in non-cash expenses arising from the conversion of promissory notes, and the associated elimination of prior liabilities, immediately before the closing of TMTG’s merger with DWAC. Trump Media and Technology Group had a first-quarter operating loss of $12.1 million based on adjusted EBITDA calculations; approximately half of that amount — $6.3 million — consisted of one-time payments related to the closing of TMTG’s merger with DWAC. The company reported an operating loss of $98.35 million for Q1 on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“At this early stage in the Company’s development, TMTG remains focused on long-term product development, rather than quarterly revenue,” the company said in announcing Q1 2024 results. “By adding features to Truth Social, launching live TV streaming, and building out its ecosystem, the Company aims to first develop a slate of best-in-class products that can then be leveraged to increase revenue and drive long-term value.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	TMTG said its “nascent advertising initiative” will “continue to evolve as TMTG implements its vision.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The company plans to launch a new “live TV streaming platform” for Truth Social’s app for Android, iOS, and web. In a subsequent phase, it said, TMTG will release “stand-alone Truth Social over-the-top (‘OTT’) streaming apps for phones, tablets and other devices,” followed by Truth Social streaming apps “for home TV.”

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	As of March 31, TMTG said, its balance of cash and cash equivalents was $273.7 million. The company “believes it has sufficient working capital to fund operations for the foreseeable future,” it said in announcing the Q1 results.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	TMTG’s quarterly report and financials were reviewed by Semple, Marchal &amp; Cooper, which the company appointed as its independent registered public accounting firm effective May 4, 2024. That came after <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-51" target="_blank">the SEC accused TMTG’s previous auditor, BF Borgers, of “massive fraud”</a> in preparing more than 1,500 regulatory filings for public companies.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Trump Media and Technology Group said that based on data provided to the company, as of April 29, 2024, the company’s stock was held by more than 621,000 shareholders, “the vast majority of whom are retail investors.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	TMTG launched Truth Social in early 2022; the company has not disclosed how many people use the service. “At this juncture in its development, TMTG believes that adhering to traditional key performance indicators, such as signups, average revenue per user, ad impressions and pricing, or active user accounts including monthly and daily active users, could potentially divert its focus from strategic evaluation with respect to the progress and growth of its business,” the company said in its 10-Q filing Monday.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Trump Media &amp; Technology Group was formed in 2021 after the former president was kicked off Twitter (now called X), Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other internet platforms, which said he had violated prohibitions against inciting violence in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, which aimed to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump’s accounts have been reinstated by X, Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, YouTube and others, but he continues to use Truth Social as his preferred social media platform. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“TMTG’s success depends in part on the popularity of our brand and the reputation and popularity of President Donald J. Trump. The value of TMTG’s brand may diminish if the popularity of President Donald J. Trump were to suffer,” the company said in a section of the 10-Q filing labeled “Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations.” The section continued, “Adverse reactions to publicity relating to President Donald J. Trump, or the loss of his services, could adversely affect TMTG’s revenues, results of operations and its ability to maintain or generate a consumer base. President Donald J. Trump is involved in numerous lawsuits and other matters that could damage his reputation. Additionally, TMTG’s business plan relies on President Donald J. Trump bringing his former social media followers to TMTG’s platform. In the event any of these, or other events, cause his followers to lose interest in his messages, the number of users of our platform could decline or not grow as we have assumed.”</p>

The injectables use the same active ingredients as the branded versions, which currently are in <a href="https://www.novonordisk-us.com/products/product-supply-update.html/1000#:~:text=doses%20through%20September.-,We%20do%20not%20currently%20anticipate%20supply%20interruptions%20of%20the%201.7,of%20action%20and%20options%20available." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">short supply</a> in some doses.</p><p>Shares of Hims &amp; Hers soared $4.21, or 29%, to $18.79 in Monday afternoon trading.</p>    
  <p>GLP-1 drugs, which stands for glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists, help people feel fuller and less hungry, aiding their efforts to lose weight. But the brand-name versions made by a handful of pharmaceutical companies can be pricey, with Novo Nordisk's Wegovy costing about $1,350 a month, or more than $16,00 a year, without insurance, according to <a href="https://www.goodrx.com/wegovy/wegovy-for-weight-loss-cost-coverage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">GoodRx</a>. </p><p>Hims &amp; Hers Health's may also beat out competitors on another key metric: availability.

<p>The company added that it will also sell brand-name versions of GLP-1 drugs, once supply rebounds. </p><p>"We've leveraged our size and scale to secure access to one of the highest-quality supplies of compounded GLP-1 injections available today," Hims &amp; Hers Health CEO and co-founder Andrew Dudum said in a statement Monday. "We're passing that access and value along to our customers, who deserve the highest standard of clinical safety and efficacy to meet their goals, and we're doing it in a safe, affordable way that others can't deliver."</p><p>Customers will need a prescription from their medical provider, based on what is "medically appropriate and necessary for each patient," the company said. </p><p>The company is tapping an opportunity to profit by focusing on Americans' desire to slim down.

a reduction in locations, and pursue a sale of substantially all of its assets."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Red Lobster, founded in 1968 and headquartered in Orlando, said in the statement Sunday night it would sell its business to a new entity that will be wholly owned and controlled by its lenders, and that "Red Lobster's restaurants will remain open and operating as usual during the Chapter 11 process." The company has been working with vendors to ensure restaurant operations are unaffected, according to the statement.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"This restructuring is the best path forward for Red Lobster. It allows us to address several financial and operational challenges and emerge stronger and re-focused on our growth," said Jonathan Tibus, the company's CEO, in the statement. "The support we've received from our lenders and vendors will help ensure that we can complete the sale process quickly and efficiently while remaining focused on our employees and guests." </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Here's what we know about the closures, including where they're happening and why these restaurants are closing.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Red Lobster bankruptcy:</strong><a href="/story/money/2024/05/20/red-lobster-files-bankruptcy/73767023007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:9|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Red Lobster files for bankruptcy days after closing dozens of locations across the US</a></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Which Red Lobster locations are closed?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Each of these restaurants are currently listed as temporarily closed on the website:</p><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Alabama</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Arizona</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">California</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Colorado</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Florida</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Georgia</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Idaho</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Illinois</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Indiana</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Iowa</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Kansas</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Louisiana</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Maryland</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Mississippi</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Missouri</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">New Jersey</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">New York</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">North Carolina</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">North Dakota</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Oklahoma</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Pennsylvania</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">South Carolina</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Tennessee</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Texas</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Virginia</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Washington</h3><h3 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Wisconsin</h3><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Who own Red Lobster restaurants?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><a href="https://www.thaiunion.com/en" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Thai Unio</a><a href="https://www.thaiunion.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">n</a><a href="https://www.thaiunion.com/en" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"> Group</a> − which is based in Thailand − has been the largest shareholder since 2020, owning 49% of the company. <a href="https://www.darden.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Darden Restaurants</a> originally sold off Red Lobster to private equity firm <a href="https://goldengatecap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Golden Gate Capital</a> in 2014 for about $2.1 billion.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Red Lobster suffered big losses with 'Ultimate Endless Shrimp' promotion</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In 2023, the seafood chain's "<a href="https://www.redlobster.com/menu/specials/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Ultimate Endless Shrimp</a>" deal became more popular than expected, inadvertently becoming a key factor in a $11 million loss in the third quarter.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The limited-time promotional deal, in which guests picked two types of shrimp to enjoy nonstop for $20, landed a permanent spot on Red Lobster menus in June.

    <p>It seems that the article you provided is an html page with a captcha and feedback form, which makes it difficult to extract specific key points. However, I'll try to identify some potential points based on the HTML code:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Captcha Protection</strong>: The page uses a Captcha protection system to verify that the user is a human and not a bot.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback Form</strong>: The page has a feedback form that allows users to report issues or provide feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Reference ID</strong>: The page assigns a unique Reference ID (0a2fb060-1714-11ef-92ed-ee2e768d40fd) to the user's feedback submission.</li>
<li><strong>Copy Icon</strong>: There is a SVG icon that can be used to copy the Reference ID for future reference.</li>
<li><strong>Cancel and Send Buttons</strong>: The feedback form has cancel and send buttons, allowing users to confirm or cancel their feedback submission.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that without the actual article content, it's challenging to extract more specific key points. If you'd like me to help with anything else, feel free to ask!</p>

<p>More than 60 years after he was denied an opportunity to become America's first Black astronaut, Ed Dwight finally traveled into space Sunday with five other passengers on a 10-minute flight inside a Blue Origin capsule.</p>
<p>Dwight, a retired Air Force captain and test pilot, had a chance to become the first African American astronaut. He was one of 26 pilots the Air Force recommended to NASA for the third class of astronauts in 1963, but the agency didn't select him. It took another 20 years for America's first Black astronaut, Guion Bluford, to fly in space in 1983.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>“Everything they did, I did, and I did it well," Dwight said in a video released by Blue Origin. "If politics had changed, I would have gone to space in some kind of capacity.”</p>
<p>At the age of 90, Dwight finally entered the record books Sunday, becoming the oldest person to reach space, displacing the previous record-holder, actor William Shatner, who flew on a similar Blue Origin launch to the edge of space in 2021.</p>
<p>“I thought I didn’t need it in my life," Dwight said after Sunday's fight. "But I lied!"</p>
<p>Since retiring from the Air Force, Dwight became an accomplished sculptor. His works, which focus on Black history, are installed at memorials and monuments across the country.</p>
<p>“The transitions, the separations and stuff were a little bit more dynamic than I thought," Dwight said in remarks after Sunday's flight. "But that’s how it’s supposed to be. It makes your mind wonder, 'Is something wrong?' But no, it was absolutely terrific and the view ... absolutely fantastic. This was a life-changing experience. Everybody needs to do this.”</p>

<p>Dwight and his five co-passengers lifted off from Blue Origin's remote launch site in West Texas at 9:35 am CDT (14:35 UTC). Strapped into reclining seats inside a pressurized capsule, the passengers rode Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket into the uppermost layers of the atmosphere. After burning its main engine more than two minutes, the rocket released the crew capsule and continued coasting upward to an apogee, or high point, of nearly 66 miles (107 kilometers), just above the internationally recognized boundary of space.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>This was the seventh time Blue Origin, the space company owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, has flown people to suborbital space, and the 25th flight overall of the company's fleet of New Shepard rockets. It was the first time Blue Origin has launched people in nearly two years, resuming suborbital service after a rocket failure on an uncrewed research flight in September 2022. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/12/blue-origins-suborbital-rocket-flies-for-first-time-in-15-months/">In December</a>, Blue Origin launched another uncrewed suborbital research mission to set the stage for the resumption of human missions Sunday.</p>
<p>Joining Dwight on Blue Origin's capsule were investor Mason Angel, French businessman Sylvain Chiron, software engineer Kenneth Hess, adventurer Carol Schaller, and Gopi Thotakura, an Indian pilot and entrepreneur. Dwight's ticket with Blue Origin was sponsored by Space for Humanity, a nonprofit that seeks to expand access to space for all people, and the other five participants were paying passengers.</p>
<p>After cutoff of the New Shepard rocket engine, the passengers had a few minutes to unfasten their seatbelts and float around the cabin while taking in the view of Earth. They returned to their seats as the capsule descended back into the atmosphere. The reusable New Shepard booster reignited its main engine for a propulsive landing back in Texas, while the crew capsule deployed parachutes to slow for touchdown a few miles away.</p>
<h2>Two of three</h2>
<p>However, one of the three main parachutes did not fully unfurl as the capsule drifted back to the ground. The capsule is designed to safely land with two chutes, a capability Blue Origin demonstrated on a test flight in 2016.</p>
<p>“It looks like we do have two parachutes that have full inflation, the third is not quite fully inflated," said Ariane Cornell, a Blue Origin official hosting the company's live webcast Sunday. “Landing with two parachutes is perfectly OK for this system.”</p>
<p>Family members and Blue Origin personnel greeted the passengers as they exited the capsule. All six appeared to be in good spirits and good health.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Although it had no obvious ill effects on the crew or the spacecraft, Blue Origin engineers will investigate the malfunction to determine what went wrong. The capsule's three main parachutes were supplied to Blue Origin by Airborne Systems, which manufactures parachutes for every US human-rated spacecraft.</p>

<p>Airborne also provides parachutes for SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, Boeing's Starliner, and NASA's Orion capsule. Those parachutes have different designs and sizes than the chutes used on Blue Origin's capsule, but it wasn't immediately clear if there might be any crossover concerns on other programs stemming from the malfunction on Sunday's flight.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration, the regulatory agency that oversees US commercial space missions, said in a statement it did not consider the parachute issue a mishap. This statement suggests the incident will not trigger a mishap investigation that would require FAA oversight.</p>
<p>Before the 2022 launch failure, Blue Origin's New Shepard program achieved a cadence, on average, of roughly one flight every two months. Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company founded by Richard Branson, ramped up the flight rate of its suborbital SpaceShipTwo spaceplane over the last year as Blue Origin's rocket remained grounded.</p>
<p>But Virgin Galactic is about to halt operations of its own spaceship following one more flight with passengers next month. The company says it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/for-virgin-galactic-becoming-profitable-means-a-pause-in-flying-to-space/">decided to suspend flights of the VSS <em>Unity </em>rocket plane</a> to focus its resources on developing a fleet of larger air-launched spaceships that are easier to reuse.</p>
<p>This means Blue Origin, assuming it can regain or build on the cadence it demonstrated in 2021 and 2022, will be the only company serving the suborbital space tourism and research market for at least the next couple of years.</p>

<p>Target plans to cut prices on thousands of consumer basics this summer, from diapers to milk, as inflation cuts into household budgets and more Americans pay closer attention to their spending.
</p><p>The price cuts, already applied to 1,500 items, will include 5,000 food, drink and essential household goods. Target and other retailers are increasingly catering to customers who are struggling with higher prices for groceries, though inflation has begun to cool. Many have switched to private label brands sold by Target and others big retailers, which are typically less expensive than well-known brands.
</p><p>Target launched one such collection in January called Dealworthy which includes nearly 400 basic items, ranging from clothing to electronics, that can cost less than $1, with most items under $10.</p>
<p>Last week, McDonald’s said that it was planning to introduce a $5 meal deal in the U.S. next month to counter slowing sales and customers’ frustration with high prices. Walmart posted strong quarterly sales last week, driven by a influx of customers looking for bargains.
</p><p>Target is cognizant of the pullback by shoppers due to inflation and because of the increased cost of using credit cards. The company in March reported its first annual decline in sales — 1.7% — in seven years.
</p><p>Target Corp. said Monday that the lower prices will roll out over the summer on national brands and its own house brands.</p>

<p>“These reductions are in addition to our everyday low prices, which we routinely adjust to be competitive in the market and make sure you enjoy great value every day,” the company said in a prepared statement.
</p><p>Target said customers will be able to score reduced prices on food items like milk, bread, fruits and vegetables. They’ll also see price reductions on goods such as diapers and pet food.
</p><p>Target is likely to offer more insight into what it thinks about customer behavior and how it’s addressing any changes when it releases its quarterly financial report Wednesday.

    AND OTHER GUESTS. ED, ALL YEARS. THANK YOU, CAROL. I WOULD CALL IT ALL ARMS AT THE A.I. SUPPLY CHAIN OR MARKET GATHERED HERE AND THE THREE C.E.O.'S JUST ON STAGE TOGETHER MOMENTS AGO. OUR HOST IS MICHAEL DELL. CHAIRMAN AND C.E.O. OF DELL, A COMPANY CELEBRATING 40 YEARS AS WELL AT THIS EVENT. JENSEN WONG, AND C.E.O. OF SERVICE NOW. I THINK IT'S SENSIBLE TO ASK, IF IS THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE THREE OF YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE SAME ROOM AT THE SAME TIME AND MICHAEL, TO YOU, AS A HOST, WHY THE THREE OF YOU IN THE SAME ROOM AT THE SAME TIME? DELL TECHNOLOGY LOVES TO BRING OUR PARTNERS TOGETHER AND TALK ABOUT WHAT'S NEW AND WHAT'S EXCITING. AND THIS A.I. OPPORTUNITY IS REALLY TREMENDOUS AND WE CAN NEVER DO ANYTHING BY OURSELVES BUT THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU HAVE AN ECOSYSTEM OF COMPANIES COMING TOGETHER ALONG WITH ALL THESE INCREDIBLE INNOVATIONS IN G.P.U.'S AND COMPUTE STORAGE AND NETWORKING AND ALL THE A.I. MODELS AND SOFTWARE COMPANIES THAT ARE UTILIZING ALL THIS POWER. AND IT'S CAUSING A NEW INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE THREE OF YOU AND YOUR COMPANIES, HOW YOU WORK TOGETHER AND THE SECOND BEING A.I. INFRASTRUCTURE. HOW DURABLE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS. AIPC. YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR SOME TIME. U.S. LEADERSHIP, THE FACT I HAVE THREE AMERICAN C.E.O.'S SITTING AROUND MORE ALL WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME GOAL BUT REALLY, JENSEN, THE ORIGIN OF THIS WAS G.T.C. YOU YOU SAID BASICALLY THERE'S NO ONE BETTER AT END-TO-END SYSTEMS OF SCALE THAN DELL. HOW IS IT THAT IN VOIDA INTERACTS WITH THAT PART OF MICHAEL'S BUSINESS? WE'VE REENGINE NEARED AND REINVENTED EVERY LAYER OF COMPUTING. FROM THE CHIP TO THE WAY THESE SYSTEMS ARE PUT TOGETHER. THERE'S ONLY ONE COMPANY IN THE WORLD THAT CAN HAVE THE ABILITY TO BUILD THE COMPUTING SYSTEM, THE NETWORKING SYSTEM, ALL OF THE SOFTWARE THAT GOES WITH IT AND THE PATH TO A.I. ENTERPRISE. WE WANT TO BRING THIS ABILITY TO EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. SOME OF IT CAN BE DOWN DONE ON CLOUD. IN ORDER FOR US TO BRING THEM INTO THE A.I. REVOLUTION, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PARTNER THAT CAN HELP US TAKE THIS COMPLETELY NEW REINVENTION OF A COMPUTER AND HELP EVERY CUSTOMER HAVE A -- 1. ON PRIM IS BACK? YES OR NO? IT NEVER LEFT BUT IT'S COOL AGAIN. ED: SAVE THAT THOUGHT. BILL, YOU'VE BEEN A C.E.O. FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. HAVE YOU EVER HAD TO HAVE SUCH A FOCUS ON THE MY FUTUREA OF A SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY, A SERVER COMPANY? I THINK MICHAEL DELL AND JENSEN ARE AT THE EPICENTER OF THE A.I. EVOLUTION. THIS IS ENABLING SERVICE NOW TO BE WHAT I DREAMT IT WOULD BE. WE RUN OUR WHOLE CLOUD ON DELL TECHNOLOGIES AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUR BILLION WORKFLOWS AND FOUR TRILLION DIGITAL TRANSACTIONS RUNNING A MILLION BUSINESS PROCESSES AROUND THE WORLD. WITH JENSEN, WE WERE THE FIRST ENTERPRISE COMPANY TO RECOGNIZE THE GREATNESS OF THIS VIDA AND WE BEGAN BUILDING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS WITH JENSEN FIVE YEARS AGO. WE'RE TAKING IT TO MARKET WITH BOTH OF THESE MEN FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. ONE, THEY'RE GREAT HUMAN BEINGS AND GREAT LEADERS AND IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE WITH THEM TODAY AND TO TEAM UP WITH THEM AND TWO, WE KEEP OUR PROMISES. ED: YOU WERE DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM WHEN FRANKLY ALL OF THIS WASN'T SEXY AND NOW IT IS. TOTALLY. THAT'S 100% TRUE AND WE'LL ALWAYS BE DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM BECAUSE TRUST IS THE ONLY HUMAN CURRENCY AND WE HONOR THEM WITH THEIR LIVES. ED: THERE'S A CRITICS THAT MARKETS ARE OFTEN BUILT ON CHOICE. CHOICE FOSTERS COMPETITION. COMPETITION IS THE MOTHER OF INNOVATION, SO THE SAYING GOES. I HAD A GUEST ON THE SHOW FRIDAY AND HE WAS BRUTALLY HONEST ABOUT IT. THEY LOOK AT OTHER SILICON AND BENCHMARK AND HOW IT MIGHT RELATE TO THEIR SYSTEM BUT WHAT THEY LOOK AT IS WHAT THEIR CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS DEMAND SO THEY GIVE THEM IN RIDA. WOULD YOU SAY YOUR CLIENTS ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION? YES, WE WORK WITH THEM SO WE KNOW THEIR WORK CASE. I THINK THE REASON BILL HAS PARTNERED WITH IN VOIDA IS -- NVIDIA IS BECAUSE THEY'VE OUTENGINEERED OTHER COMPANIES AND BUILT SOFTWARE OVER MANY DECADES THAT HAS PREPARED FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THE OTHER ASPECT IS EDGE, THE PHYSICAL WORLD, THE P.C., THE FACTORY FLOOR. ALL THE RETAIL STORES. A.I. IS GOING TO BE EVERYWHERE AND HAVING THAT SORT OF INTERIOR ECOSYSTEM OF PATE, THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHAT'S GOING TO DRIVE SUCCESS BUT NVIDIA IS IN A GREAT POSITION. JENSEN HAS DONE A FABULOUS JOB BRINGING THE WORLD THE MOST INNOVATIVE ACCELERATED COMPUTING SOLUTIONS. ED: WHAT IS AN A.I. FACTORY? SURE, AN A.I. FACTORY IS REALLY A SUPPLY CHAIN THAT CREATES INTELLIGENCE SO YOU THINK ABOUT A TRADITIONAL FACTORY. YOU HAVE ALL THESE INGREDIENTS AND WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT SUPPLY CHAINS. THAT'S KINDS OF WHAT WE DO. BUT THINK ABOUT IT AS A SUPPLY CHAIN TO CREATE INTELLIGENCE INSIDE YOUR COMPANY AND TO DO THAT, IT ALL STARTS WITH DATA. IF YOU HAVE NO DATA, YOU HAVE NO A.I. AND IF YOU HAVE BAD DATA, YOU HAVE BAD A.I. SO YOU HAVE TO ORGANIZE YOUR DATA. IT'S SOMETHING WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT BECAUSE WE STORE MORE DATA THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. YOU START WITH THE DATA AND THEN YOU GET INTO THE ECOSYSTEM OF ALL THE SOFTWARE AND THE MODELS THAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT, SMALL AND LARGE MODELS. AUGMENTED GENERATION. IT'S NOT JUST G.P.U.'S IT'S ALSO THE NETWORKING AND STORAGE AND -- ED: YOU TALK ABOUT H100 IS NOT JUST A CHIP YOU HOLD IN YOUR HAND. IN REALITY IT'S HGX, RIGHT? YOUR STAFF HAS LET ME PLAY WITH, LET'S SAY, G.D.X., DO A DEAD LIFT WITH IT. IT'S 80,000 POUNDS. ED: THANK YOU, BUT THAT'S THE SCALE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I SEE YOU SELLING THAT TO THE HYPERSCALERS AND I'M NOT YET SEEING THE A.I. FACTRY THAT'S GOING TO THE S.I.A. OR ENTERPRISE CUSTOMER. WHEN DOES THAT REALLY HAPPEN? THAT'S WHY TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT IS SUCH A BIG DEAL. I'M HERE TO ANNOUNCE A DELL A.I. FACTORY WITH NVIDIA GOING TO MARKET TODAY. IT HAS C.P.U.'S AND G.P.U.'S. NETWORKING, SWITCHES, INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF SOFT WEARS AND SYSTEMS CONNECTED TO STORAGE AND THE MILES OF CABLES ALONE NECESSARY TO BUILD UP ONE OF THESE THINGS -- MICHAEL TURNED ENTITLE AN EASY BUILT. AND SO JUST AS DELL DID EARLY DAYS WITH P.C.'S, THEY'RE NOW DOING THIS WITH A.I. FACTORIES SO THAT ANY COMPANY CAN COME TO DEAL WITH A SUPERVISION OR REQUIREMENT THAT COULD GET INTO THE BUSINESS OF PRODUCING INTELLIGENCE AT SCALE. IT'S ACTUALLY ALREADY HAPPENING. NOW WE'RE ALREADY DOING THIS WITH HUNDREDS OF ENTERPRISE COMPANIES AND FOR ALSO SOME SERVICES THAT GO INTO THIS BECAUSE IT'S A NEW THING, A NEW ARCHITECT AND YOU SAW US ANNOUNCE NEW CAPABILITIES TODAY AROUND STORAGE AND NETWORKING. AGAIN, IT'S THIS WHOLE SOLUTION AND WE'VE CREATE THE EASY BUTTON SO ENTERPRISES WITH QUICKLY IMPLEMENT AND DEPLOY THESE TOOLS. ED: DO YOU THINK THEY ARE READY FOR THIS A.I. FACTORY INVESTMENT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE ESSENTIALLY? I KNOW THEY ARE. LAST WEEK I HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING WITH MICROSOFT AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING ON CO-PILOT, FOR EXAMPLE, IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY C.E.O. IS WELL AWARE OF. ED: BIG AND SMALL? BIG AND SMALL WE BUILD OUR OWN DOMAIN-SPECIFIC MODELS ON THE SERVICE NOW PLATFORM. ED: WHY DOES THAT MATTER? BECAUSE WE'RE FOCUSED ON EXPERIENCES. IT'S AN $11 TRILLION MARKET OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS ACCORDING TO G.D.C. THAT IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO HELP THE WORLD ECONOMY IMPROVE. COMPANIES LIKE DELL TECHNOLOGIES, NVIDIA AND SERVICES NOW. BUT WE HAVE TO BE OPEN. MICROSOFT, FOR EXAMPLE, IS A GREAT PARTNER. YOU TALK ABOUT THEM WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN THE ROOM BECAUSE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR CUSTOMERS TO HAVE THE CO-PILOT AND NOW ASSIST. WE'RE INNOVATIVE WITH JENSEN. TELECOMMUNICATIONS WAS OUR FIRST. THINK ABOUT SERVICE MANAGEMENT AND DELL NOW WITH NOW ASSIST. EVERY COMPANY IN THE WORLD AND EVERY WORKFLOW FOR EVERY COMPANY AND EVERY INDUSTRY WILL BE REENGINEERED IN 24 MONTHS. THIS IS A TSUNAMI OF CHANGE AND ONLY THE SMART ONES ARE GOING TO RECOGNIZE I HAVE TO PLANT THE FLAG NOW. WHETHER THE STORY IS COMPLETE OR NOT IS NOT THE ISSUE. THE TRAIN'S MOVED OUT. IT'S ON THE FLY. ED: THE IDEA IS WHEN YOU STAND ON THE PLATFORM THE TRAIN GOES BY FAST. IF YOU'RE ON TRAIN, IT DIDN'T FEEL FAST. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT MICHAEL DELL IS VERY GOOD AT WHICH IS SELLING TO BUSINESSES, THE PUBLIC SECTOR, PROBABLY IN PLACES, JENSEN, YOU DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE IS. PROBABLY. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT MICHAEL DELL WILL CONVINCE NOSE BUSINESSES TO GET ON THE TRAIN? NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. ED: AND DO YOU NEED HIM TO? ABSOLUTELY. WE'VE BEEN PARTNERED WITH MICHAEL FOR COMING UPEN THREE DECADES. TO REACH WITH WORLD'S MARKETS THE IN OLD DAYS WE WORKED ON P.C.IZE FOR GAMERS AND CAR DESIGN AND SOEN OF THE WE'RE ABLE TO REACH WORLD'S SURPRISE THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH MICHAEL AND WITH DELL AND THE THING THAT'S REALLY EXTRAORDINARY THIS TIME IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DELIVERING A BOX BUT AN ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE IS INSANELY COMPLEX. THE LAST 30 YEARS, BOTH OF OUR COMPANIES HAVE CHANGED A LOT AND HE SAID IT EARLY THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE DONE HAS BEEN A PERFECT PREPARATION FOR TODAY. IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY TO HELP YOU BUILD AN ENTIRE A.I. INFRASTRUCTURE, CALL DELL AND THEY'LL COME IN -- NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE ALL THE SOLUTIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES BUT THEY'LL ALSO HAVE THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES TO HELP YOU SET IT UP AND PUT IT TO WORK. WE'RE WORKING WITH DELL AND MICHAEL FROM C.P.U.'S TO GENERATING, TO SOFTWARE ACROSS THE ENTIRE STAFF. IT'S SO FUN LISTENING TO BILL, I JUST SIT HERE AND LAY BACK BUT THEY WERE EARLY IN RECOGNIZING THE ENORMOUS TRANSMA ACTIVE CAPABILITY OF GENERATIVE A.I. SERVICE NOW USED TO BE A PLATFORM OF TOOLS. NOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE A PLATFORM OF TOOLS AND AGENTS THAT HELP YOU USE THOSE TOOLS. THEY'RE SIFTING ON A GOLD MINE OF OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT WE COULD HAVE NOT JUST THE TOOLS TO USE TO RUN OUR COMPANIES. WEAR GOING TO HAVE AN A.I. OPERATING SYSTEM TO RUN ALL OF OUR COMPANIES WITH ALL THE AGENTS NECESSARY TO HELP US DO THAT. ED: THE NEXT LEVEL DOWN IS THE AIPC. IT IS HERE WORK TO TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENTS. IS THAT FOR THE ENJOYED WORKER OR FOR EVERY HUMAN AROUND THE WORLD IN THE FIRST INSTANCE? YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A NEW WAVE OF TECHNOLOGY YOU HAVE KIND OF THE EARLY ADOPTERS AND AT SOME POINTS YOU REFLECT WHETHER THERE ARE MAINSTREAM USE CASES AND WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON RIGHT NOW INSIDE COMPANIES IS YOU HAD THIS INCREDIBLE SURGE IN BUYING P.C.'S FOUR YEARS AGO WITH THE PANDEMIC. ED: COVID-RELATED, YES. YOU HAD THE BIGGEST INSTALE BASE EVER SO NOW THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE GETTING READY TO REPLACE THOSE OLD MACHINES AND THEY'RE THINKING, WOW, IN A.I.-- MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHINGO IT? . ED: IS THAT FAIR? 100%. WE CANNOT WAIT TO DO IT. WE ARE READY TO GO. THE OTHER THING TO REMEMBER IS THE ENTERPRISE IS A TOTAL MESS. THE INDUSTRY IS VERY GOOD AT WHAT IT DOES. FOR 50 YEARS, EVERYONE SOLD INTO AN INDIVIDUAL BUYING CENTER OR A SILO. FINANCE, SALES, DEVELOPMENT. YOU HAVE AN UN-INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE. IF YOU ARE A CEO -- CIO, YOU ARE LOOKING AT AI . WHY DO YOU NEED TO CHANGE? BECAUSE YOU CAN. AND A LOT OF THEM DON'T KNOW THAT. ED: ONE SINGLE DEVICE, LIKE A LAPTOP. LET ME EXPLAIN. IT IS ABOUT INTEGRATION. 85% OF THE PROJECTS TODAY AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION FAILED TO DELIVER AND ARE AWAY DR. R.O.I. FOR ONE SINGLE REASON, INTEGRATION. WE ARE AS JANSSEN WAS SAYING, WE INTEGRATE THE PAST AND INVENT THE FUTURE. NVIDIA, DELL TECHNOLOGIES, THEY ARE THE FUTURE. WE STILL HAVE TO INTEGRATE THE FAT -- THE PAST. WHAT COMPANIES HAVE TO DO IS ENABLE AI BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT BY DEALING WITH THE PAST ALSO AND I THINK SIMULTANEOUSLY, IF I WERE IN A CEOS SITUATION AND NOT WORKING AT SERVICE NOW, I WOULD HAVE A COPILOT, NOW ASSIST AND THE NVIDIA STACK RUNNING EVERYTHING AND USING DELL TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS THE ENTERPRISE AND I AM DOING IT. ED: I GREW UP WITH DELL COMPUTERS. I'M TALKING ABOUT ME PLAYING AGE OF EMPIRES, CD-ROM, THAT DELL COMPUTER. CONVINCE ME AND MILLIONS OF OTHERS THAT THEY HAVE A PLACE FOR NAI PC IN THEIR LIVES. YOU HAVE FIVE MODELS. THAT IS A LOT OF TOYS FOR FIRST JEN OF A NASCENT TECHNOLOGY. THE REASON IS, ANYTHING YOU ARE DOING THAT HAS A PROMPT IS GOING TO BE SPED UP BECAUSE EVERY SOFTWARE DEVELOPER IN THE WORLD IS FIGURING OUT HOW TO USE ALL THE NEW POWER IN THE GP USE, AND NPU'S. ED: THE PROCESSING UNITS? EXACTLY. SO THE EXPERIENCE WILL BE BETTER. WHEN YOUR PC IS FOUR YEARS OLD, TIME TO GET A NEW ONE AND YOU WILL WANT THE ONE THAT SPEEDS UP THE NEW CAPABILITIES AND INSIDE YOUR COMPANY, THEY WILL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE -- THEY WILL WANT TO BUY A MACHINE THAT LASTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. ED: JENSEN, WHERE IS NVIDIA'S PLACE IN THE AI GAMING? DO YOU HAVE A PLACE IN THE A YA I PC -- IN THE AI PC? THERE ARE A BUNCH OF NVIDIA GPU'S IN DELL STATIONS. ALL OF OUR GP WAS HAVE THE SAME DENSER COURT -- TENSOR CORES. EVERY ONE OF OURS USES AI TO DO THE WORK. AI WILL TRANSFORM GAMING. ALL OF THE NONPLAYER CHARACTERS WILL BE CHATBOTS. CREATING WORLDS WILL BE EASIER. INSTEAD OF INSTRUCTION DRIVEN COMPUTING, IT IS IN ENSION DRIVEN COMPUTING SO IT IS EASIER TO WRITE PROGRAMS. --- PYTHON PROGRAMS WILL BE EVEN EASIER TO WRITE. ED: WHAT YOU DID WITH BLACKWELL AND OTHERS, YOU INNOVATED BY COMBINING GPU WITH CPU. HERE IS THE NVIDIA CPU THAT GOES WITH IT. WE WANT TO SUPPORT EVERY CPU THE WORLD MAKES. THERE ARE PLACES THAT HAVE X86. THERE ARE OTHERS THAT PURPLE -- PREFER ARM, WE SUPPORT ARM. WHEREVER IT MAKES SENSE, WE WILL SUPPORT THE RIGHT CPUS COME EVERY CPU. ED: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE U.S. LEADERSHIP SIDE OF THIS. THREE AMERICAN CEOS. IS THAT NEWS IN AND OF ITSELF THAT ACROSS ALL PARTS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN, THEY ARE AMERICAN COMPANIES LEADING, MICHAEL DELL? MICHAEL: I'M NOT SURE IT IS NEWS. THE U.S. HAS BEEN LEADING IN INNOVATION FOR QUITE SOME TIME. BUT IT IS CERTAINLY A GREAT THING FOR THE UNITED STATES. AND THE U.S. ECONOMY, TO HAVE GREAT COMPANIES LIKE NVIDIA, SERVICE NOW, MICROSOFT DRIVING INNOVATIONS AND PRODUCTIVITY TO EFFICIENCY. THE WORLD REQUIRES THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO ENABLE EVERYTHING. E YOU TALKED ONSTAGE ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE IN THE SPLY CHAIN. YOUR GLOBAL EXPERIENCE OF DOING BUSINESS. YOU SEE THIS TYPE O INVESTMENT IN EUROPE, LATIN AERICA, SOUTHEAST ASIA TAT YOU SEEIN THE U.S.? IT IS COMING. JENSN AND I SPEND A LOT F TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS AND HOW IT IS EXANDING OUT. YOUW AN EXAMPLE FROM SOUT KOREA ONSTAGE WITH SAMSUNG. YOU SEETHIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. YOU EE IT IN SOVEREIGN I'S BEING BUILT UP. AND FOR A COUNTRY TO ENCAPSULATE ITS OWN LTURE, LANGUAGE, BELIEFS, THAT IS HAPPENING IN EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. ED: WE HAVE DISCUSSED SOVREIGN AI IN THE WORLDAND USING JAAN AS AN EXAMPL, I GO BACK TO MY QUEION ABOUTHE DURABILITY OF THE MARKET. SEEING A COMMITMENT AT THE NATINSTATLEVEL. IS TODAY'S NEWS AND INDCATION THAT THAT HAS HPENED BECAUS OF AI FACTORIES R ARE THEY RUNNING TO SPARATE PHS? NO COUNTRYCAN AFFORD TO OUTSOURC ITS IELLIGENCE ON FIRST PRINCIPLES.

<li>The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) has announced that it will vote against ExxonMobil's board of directors, including CEO Darren Woods, at the company's shareholder meeting next week.</li>
<li>CalPERS has a $1 billion stake in ExxonMobil and cites the company's attempt to block a shareholder proposal to reduce direct emissions and set emission targets at suppliers and customers as the reason for its vote.</li>
<li>The shareholder proposal was submitted by environmental activists Arjuna Capital and Follow This, but ExxonMobil sued them in Texas federal court in January, prompting them to withdraw the proposal.</li>
<li>ExxonMobil has continued its lawsuit to prevent the activists from submitting a similar proposal in the future, claiming that 90% of its voting shareholders have rejected the proposal.</li>
<li>The dispute highlights the ongoing battle between ExxonMobil and environmental activists, which has led to the company facing opposition from investors and governments around the world over its climate change policies.</li>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- For Filicia Porter, the insurance bills were the final straw. They’d been climbing steeply for her assisted-living business as Florida was battered with ever more-powerful storms, and eventually, the numbers stopped adding up.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>So in March, she finally decided to call it quits, shutting the facility near Palm Beach that she opened just two years ago. That came four months after she closed an older location in Port St. Lucie, opened in 2017. Together, they left a dozen residents scrambling to find another place to live.</p><p>“Each year you see a rise. Why pay more?” said Porter, who first started The House of Cares to capitalize on the burgeoning demand for elder care as baby boomers flooded into the Sunshine State. But now, as her premiums soared on top of all her other costs, she just couldn’t “continue to deplete” herself.</p><p>Porter is just one small example among many in Florida, where two major, generational forces are colliding: The toll of climate change, and the challenge of caring for an aging society. Drawn to the state’s warm weather and low taxes, baby boomers have been piling into the retirement haven for years, leaving it with one of the most elderly populations in the US. That’s turning it into a harbinger for other states as the consequences of rising temperatures ripple through the economy in ways few had envisioned.</p><p>With Florida being threatened by more powerful hurricanes, commercial-property insurance costs last year surged at nearly five times the national pace, according to credit rating firm AM Best Co. Inc. That’s slapping what care providers say is effectively a new — if little noticed — tax on an industry already contending with labor shortages, soaring wages and rising supply costs.</p><p>The result? More and more nursing homes are closing down each year, while others are missing debt payments. At the same time, the costs for senior care – at all levels from independent living to around-the-clock nursing — are rising, threatening to become unaffordable for a growing number of retirees.</p><p>“We are headed into a train wreck,” said Pilar Carvajal, founder and CEO of Innovation Senior Living, a Winter Park-based operator with 339 residents at its facilities, which offer services including memory care and assisted living. Its insurance costs jumped at least 50% in the past five years. “We need help to solve this societal problem,” she said.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>While climate change has pushed commercial-property insurance premiums up nationwide, few places have been hit harder than Florida. In the five-year period ending 2023, costs surged 125%. Last year, annual premiums soared about 27% in the state — for the second year in a row — while nationwide the growth rate slowed to nearly 6% from about 15%, according to AM Best.</p><p>“We have many clients that can’t afford the coverage,” said Patrick McConachie, senior vice president at Marsh McLennan Agency in Tampa, who helps senior-living operators negotiate policies. “In a lot of cases in Florida recently, the operator will simply turn the keys back over to the landlord.”</p><p>Read more: There’s a New Financial Crisis Brewing in Uninsurable US Homes</p><p>Palm Garden Healthcare shuttered its assisted-living facility earlier this year because of skyrocketing costs, said President and CEO Rob Greene. The property insurance bill for his 14-location nursing home chain more than doubled in two years to $2.2 million. And although Greene is paying more to be insured, he said the coverage for $75 million in damages is far below the at least $200 million he needs.</p><p>So far, Palm Garden hasn’t experienced any major storm damage since it opened for business in the late 1980s, but “come June, we get a little bit nervous,” Greene said.</p><p>‘Feeling The Pinch’</p><p>From 2019 to 2023, damage from natural disasters like tropical cyclones and severe storms at least doubled to as much as $200 billion from the 10 years prior, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information. That five-year tally includes Hurricane Ian — the third-costliest hurricane in US history.</p><p>The mounting claims led a few property insurers to fold, driving up rates. But this year, seven new firms are expected to enter the market, according to Mark Friedlander, director of corporate communications at the Insurance Information Institute. And negotiations with reinsurers went well, which could mean flat or smaller premium increases this year, said Jack Walker, senior sales executive at AssuredPartners, an Orlando-based insurer specializing in senior living.</p><p>However, until that happens, operators like Innovation and Palm Garden have to find ways to pay the ballooning bills. Palm Garden’s elders qualify for Medicaid, but the reimbursements are never enough, according to Greene. “We don’t have the luxury of like, a McDonald’s, of being able to pass on costs,” he said.</p><p>For operators serving more affluent retirees that can raise and pass the price on, even they will at some point become “unaffordable,” said Margaret Johnson, senior director at Fitch Ratings.</p><p>“Residents are feeling the pinch,” said Raoul Nowitz, senior managing director at SOLIC Capital Advisors, who specializes in restructuring for distressed companies and investment banking. And operators are struggling to have enough cash flow to cover debt, he added.</p><p>While the spike in insurance costs is a major problem for all groups in Florida — from homeowners to hotels — it’s particularly crippling for this industry. Fitch’s Johnson has a negative credit outlook on the sector.</p><p>When he speaks with chief financial officers of Florida senior-living communities, labor and property-insurance costs are “at the top of the list of things that keep them up at night,” said Richard Scanlon, senior managing director at B.C. Ziegler and Company.</p><p>A majority of first-time payment defaults on debt issued for Florida retirement communities since 2009 took place after the pandemic — 21 out of 34 — according to Municipal Market Analytics. The default rate for senior living in Florida stands at 18% — more than twice the nearly 8% national rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p><p>Read more: More Defaults for Senior Living Ahead as Debt Comes Due</p><p>Supply and Demand</p><p>That strain has been causing dozens of facilities to shutter. In the five years ending 2023, an average of 146 nursing homes or assisted-living facilities have closed each year, according to data from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. Within that period, 2022 saw the most closures — coinciding with Hurricane Ian’s landfall along with the winddown of federal pandemic aid.</p><p>The steady closures occur as demand grows and prospects of new facilities dim. Florida is the nation’s second fastest-growing state based on population behind Texas, according to the US Census Bureau, and ranks second among US states for its elders, with about 22% aged 65 and over, compared to just 17% for the entire US.</p><p>New facilities have to open at a faster rate to keep up with the expanding demographic, said Lisa Washburn, chief credit officer at Municipal Market Analytics, adding that “construction has slowed significantly” across the US. There needs to be some sort of governmental involvement to subsidize or facilitate building, she said.</p><p>“In Florida you may not have an income tax,” but insurance is a tax, said Washburn.</p><p>Following Hurricane Ian, Carvajal had to install a $200,000 new roof on one of her six facilities to continue to be insured.</p><p>“How do you make it work when things like property insurance just are becoming so onerous and unpredictable?” she said. “Looking into the future, if things are going to get worse, I don’t know what we’re going to do.”</p><p>(Adds comment in 18th paragraph and updates 7th paragraph with more detail on Innovation Senior Living.)</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li>Federal Reserve Vice Chairs Philip Jefferson and Michael Barr iterated that interest rates will likely remain at current levels until there is more evidence that inflation is falling.</li>
<li>The officials cited disappointing inflation in the first quarter as a reason to hold rates steady and allow more time for restrictive policy to work.</li>
<li>Despite a slight decline in inflation in April, Jefferson stated that the pace of price increases is still too high, with the core Personal Consumption Expenditures index estimated to have risen 4.1% over the first four months of the year.</li>
<li>The Fed's goal is to bring inflation down to 2%, and Jefferson expects consumer spending to slow later this year as high interest rates weigh on spending.</li>
<li>Barr and Jefferson emphasized a "higher-for-longer" stance, indicating that interest rates may be raised or kept high for an extended period to combat inflation and achieve the Fed's 2% inflation target.</li>

<p>Only about 15 percent of the electrode-bearing threads implanted in the brain of Neuralink's first human brain-chip patient continue to work properly, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/neuralink-gets-fda-green-light-for-second-patient-as-first-describes-his-emotional-journey-a2707584">according to a report from The Wall Street Journal</a>. The remaining 85 percent of the threads became displaced, and many of the threads that were left receiving little to no signals have been shut off.</p>
<p></p><p class="teads-adCall"></p><p>In a May 8 blog post, Neuralink had disclosed that "a number" of the chip's 64 thinner-than-hair threads </p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/elon-musks-neuralink-reports-trouble-with-first-human-brain-chip/">had retracted</a><p>. Each thread carries multiple electrodes, totaling 1,024 across the threads, which are surgically implanted near neurons of interest to record signals that can be decoded into intended actions.
</p><p>Neuralink was quick to note that it was able to adjust the algorithm used for decoding those neuronal signals to compensate for the lost electrode data. The adjustments were effective enough to regain and then exceed performance on at least one metric—the bits-per-second (BPS) rate used to measure how quickly and accurately a patient with an implant can control a computer cursor.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Journal, Neuralink's first patient, 29-year-old Noland Arbaugh, opened up about the roller-coaster experience. "I was on such a high and then to be brought down that low. It was very, very hard," Arbaugh said. "I cried." He initially asked if Neuralink would perform another surgery to fix or replace the implant, but the company declined, telling him it wanted to wait for more information. Arbaugh went on to say that he has since recovered from the initial disappointment and continues to have hope for the technology.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"I thought that I had just gotten to, you know, scratch the surface of this amazing technology, and then it was all going to be taken away," he added. "But it only took me a few days to really recover from that and realize that everything I’ve done up to that point was going to benefit everyone who came after me.” He also said that "it seems like we’ve learned a lot and it seems like things are going in the right direction."</p>
<p>The Journal's report adds more detail about the thread retraction as Neuralink gears up to surgically implant its chip into a second trial participant. According to the report, the company hopes to perform the second surgery sometime in June and has gained a green light to do so from the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees clinical trials.</p>
<p>Neuralink, owned by controversial billionaire Elon Musk, believes it can prevent thread movement in the next patient by simply implanting the fine wires deeper into brain tissue. The company is planning on—and the FDA has reportedly signed off on—implanting the threads 8 millimeters into the brain of the second trial participant rather than the 3 mm to 5 mm depth used in Arbaugh's implantation.</p>
<p>Brain-computer interface chips have been around for many years. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04970" rel="nofollow" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04970" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-xid="fr1716256388843efe" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1716256388843efe">In 2006</a>, researchers reported the first case of a brain chip allowing a tetraplegic patient to control a "neural cursor" that could be used to open email, operate devices, and control a prosthetic hand and a robotic arm. The chip used was a <a href="https://blackrockneurotech.com/products/utah-array/">Utah Array</a> containing 96 electrodes, which can penetrate up to 1.5 mm into brain tissue.</p>
<p><em>This post was corrected to report that 85 percent, not 75 percent, of threads became displaced.</em></p>
