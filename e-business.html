    <p>For Walmart to be the best place to shop, we also need it to be the best place to work. That idea is the North Star of our journey to build a better company for our associates. Whether we’re investing in compensation, learning and development, well-being, or resources for a simpler day at work, our commitment to associates is strong, and our goal is simple: helping them live better at every stage of their careers.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Over the past five years, we’ve increased hourly wages by around 30%, bringing our U.S. average hourly wage to close to $18. But it’s not just about pay. We’ve also invested in centers of excellence for health care, family building and adoption benefits and many other resources for mind and body. At the same time, we’ve expanded our global academies to provide more opportunities to more people, and we continue to invest in associates’ long-term financial health through our 401(k) and associate stock purchase programs, both with a company match.</p><p><br></p><p>Now we’re making four new investments in the associates at the heart of our business:<br><br></p><ul><li><span><b>Launching Associate to Technician pipeline program</b>: With the country facing a </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/economy/what-to-expect-for-the-economy-in-2023" target="_blank">shortage of skilled trade workers</a><span>, we're creating pathways for our own associates to fill these critical jobs in our stores and supply chain facilities. We’re piloting a new Associate to Technician program with 100 associates in the Dallas-Fort Worth area that will help hourly store and supply chain associates move into facilities maintenance, refrigeration and HVAC, reliability and automation technician roles. These jobs make between $19 and $45 an hour and offer opportunities to build a meaningful career while meeting a business need for the company. This program is part of our Walmart Academy, one of the largest training ecosystems in the country.</span></li><li><span><b>Doubling certificates in Live Better U</b>: Associates have been asking for Walmart-paid education options that take less time to complete, so we now </span><a href="/news/2024/02/22/walmart-accelerates-efforts-to-provide-associates-with-skills-to-fill-100000-in-demand-jobs" target="_self">offer more than 50 skills certificates</a><span>, which associates can finish in four months, on average, compared to years for a college degree. Our goal is to fast-track front-line associates into approximately 100,000 jobs that are higher-paying and in-demand for our business over the next three years. Certificates are targeted to those jobs, including salaried and hourly leadership roles in our stores, clubs and supply chain facilities – the backbone of our company – as well as roles like pharmacy technicians, opticians and software engineers in growing parts of our business.</span></li><li><span><b>New bonus for hourly store associates</b>: During Associates Week in Northwest Arkansas, we announced the latest step in our ongoing investment in associate compensation — a new bonus for eligible full- and part-time hourly store associates. This new associate bonus rewards great work and customer service and it celebrates long-term associates who build a career at Walmart: The longer an hourly store associate stays with the company, the higher their bonus potential, up to $1,000 a year. </span></li><li><span><b>Total Pay and Benefits in Me@Walmart</b>: Me@Walmart is a consumer-grade super-app that centralizes the functionality an associate needs for a better day at work. The addition of the new Total Pay and Benefits feature in the Me@Walmart app gives associates at-a-glance visibility to their pay, discounts, learning opportunities and benefits with the goal of friction-free access to tools and resources for a better life.</span></li></ul><p><br></p><p>These investments are all part of our people-led, tech-powered commitment to Walmart associates. We believe in them and their potential. We know that when they’re given the right tools, opportunities for growth and investments in their personal well-being, they can accomplish more than they imagined personally and professionally.</p><p><br></p><p>Our founder, Sam Walton, said it well: “There’s absolutely no limit to what ordinary people can accomplish if they’re given the opportunity and encouragement to do their best.”<br></p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Andrew Left, founder of Citron Research, is shorting GameStop again, despite being burned on his first bet against the company in 2021, resulting in a 100% loss.</li>
<li>Left believes GameStop is "extremely overvalued" after its recent meteoric rise, fueled by a social media post by trader Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty.</li>
<li>Left made a profit when he bet against GameStop again last month, after the company's shares surged from $10 to an intraday peak of $64.83 in May.</li>
<li>GameStop saw a surge in its shares after Gill referenced the company in social media posts, leading retail investors to pile in. However, the stock eventually fell to a low of $18.93 on May 23.</li>
<li>Left's return to short-selling GameStop follows a previous incident where he was harassed by an "angry mob" of fanatical GameStop shareholders who opposed his initial short position.</li>

The veteran short seller was burned on his first bet against meme-stock traders’ favorite company in 2021, eventually closing out his short position at a 100% loss and halting the publication of short reports after he said an “<a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/Hedge+Funds/Short-Seller+Citron+Walks+Away+After+Angry+Mob+Tried+to+Silence+Him+on+GameStop+(GME),+Turning+Info+Over+to+Feds/17851916.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.streetinsider.com/Hedge+Funds/Short-Seller+Citron+Walks+Away+After+Angry+Mob+Tried+to+Silence+Him+on+GameStop+(GME),+Turning+Info+Over+to+Feds/17851916.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">angry mob</a>” of fanatical GameStop shareholders harassed him.</p><p class="paywall-selector"></p><div class="paywall">



<p>But Left, who made his name with big bets against <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/10/21/valeant-philidor-stock-plummet/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2015/10/21/valeant-philidor-stock-plummet/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">the pharmaceutical giant Valeant</a> and China’s now-defunct <a href="https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/26/andrew-left-citron-research-founder-banned-hong-kong-trading-warning-china-evergrande/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/26/andrew-left-citron-research-founder-banned-hong-kong-trading-warning-china-evergrande/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">property giant Evergrande</a>, told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> that he made a profit when he bet against GameStop again last month. </p>



<p>The video game retailer saw its shares surge from just over $10 at the start of May to an intraday peak of $64.83 by May 14 after Keith Gill—the trader, and de facto meme-stock leader, who goes by <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/03/roaring-kitty-gamestop-116-million/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/03/roaring-kitty-gamestop-116-million/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">Roaring Kitty</a>—referenced the company in social media posts, leading retail investors to pile in. After that initial surge, GameStop stock eventually fell to a low of $18.93 on May 23, and Left says he was able to close out his short position for a profit during this period, he says.</p>



<p>On Monday, the Citron Research founder doubled down on his bearish bet against GameStop after Gill posted a screenshot on Reddit that implied he <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/03/roaring-kitty-gamestop-116-million/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/03/roaring-kitty-gamestop-116-million/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">owns over $100 million</a> of the retailer’s stock. “When I saw it, I shorted it,” Left <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-03/andrew-left-burned-in-2021-meme-mania-is-short-gamestop-again?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-03/andrew-left-burned-in-2021-meme-mania-is-short-gamestop-again?embedded-checkout=true" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> of the Reddit post.</p>



<p>The surge in GameStop shares simply “makes no sense” and shows the U.S. has become a “nation of gamblers,” he said in his <em>Wall Street Journal</em> interview.</p><p></p>



<p>GameStop stock has risen more than 33% from its opening price on Monday, but fallen over 23% from that day’s intraday high. That means the potential profitability of Left’s current short position, at least at the moment, depends on the price at which he was able to secure shares for the bet.</p>



<p>Either way, the veteran short-seller said that he did learn not to make large bets against “cult” stocks when he was burned shorting GameStop back in 2021, and his latest short compromises a small portion of his portfolio. “It’s a cult stock. You don’t do that on cult stocks,” he told the <em>Journal.</em> “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.”</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>With the high costs of buying a home, many people are turning to renting, especially with the lack of affordable homes on the market and high mortgage rates. Emily Nations, a 31-year-old, is an example of this trend, opting to rent a new apartment complex instead of buying a home.</li>
<li>The rental market is becoming more competitive, with new apartment complexes offering amenities such as gyms, pools, and coffee shops to attract tenants. This is especially true in cities such as Nashville, Salt Lake City, and Atlanta.</li>
<li>To attract tenants, leasing agents are offering discounts, waiving fees, and providing other incentives. Emily Nations, for example, received two months free rent when she signed her lease.</li>
<li>The surge in apartment construction has created a situation where renters have some leverage. With more options available, people like Emily Nations can afford to be picky and negotiate for better deals.</li>
<li>The high demand for rental properties has created a situation where renters can take advantage of discounts and amenities, making renting a more attractive option compared to buying a home.</li>

    </div><div class="content article-descr news-text">
    <div><p class="drop-cap preview">Emily Nations found her slice of the good life in April. After her Nashville-area apartment flooded for a third time earlier this spring, she started to look around for a new place to live. She briefly thought about buying a home a few years ago, but that wasn't even a consideration this time around — the costs of a down payment and mortgage were too steep. Instead, she ditched her old lease and signed on at a brand-new apartment complex just north of downtown.</p><div class="premium-content"><p class="premium">"The market is insane right now," Nations, a 31-year-old who works in hospitality, told me. "It makes no sense to even try and buy."</p><p class="premium">It may not be an entire home, but there's plenty to love about her one-bedroom unit — the vaulted ceilings, the "huge" walk-in closet, the natural light that spills through her windows. Outside her four walls, the chic collection of modern farmhouse buildings known as Livano Trinity offers a ton of perks: a sprawling gym, a pool with a cabana for weekend hangs, private office spaces, and even doggy day care. An on-site coffee shop serves up free daily brews to first-year tenants, while a New York-style bodega satisfies her late-night cravings.</p><p class="premium">The final kicker for Nations was the discount she got for signing: two months free. While she'll pay $1,500 in rent most months, she paid only a $95 community fee plus utilities in May and June. In the meantime, she's stashing away funds in case she decides to purchase a home down the line.</p><p class="premium">Buying a home has never been a cakewalk, but the hurdles to ownership seem more daunting than ever these days: The typical mortgage rate is hovering near a two-decade high, and there are still roughly 30% fewer homes on the market than in 2019. The median sale price reached a record $390,613 in May, according to Redfin. By contrast, a wave of apartment construction has flooded once hot markets with new studios and two-bedrooms, forcing property managers to extend olive branches if they want to lure tenants through their freshly installed doors. Step inside a newish building in places like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cities-wage-growth-rent-increases-texas-housing-costs-florida-nyc-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="20">Nashville, Salt Lake City, or Atlanta</a>, and you'll find leasing agents hawking discounts: Eight weeks free! No fees! Comped parking! That's to say nothing of amenities such as boxing gyms, rooftop pools, and plush lounge rooms. Renters <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rent-decline-fall-apartment-housing-market-landlords-tenant-lease-construction-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="40">finally have some leverage</a> — especially if they can afford the latest and greatest units.</p><p class="premium">These apartments aren't cheap, sure, but they can feel like bargains compared with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/buying-a-house-keeps-getting-more-expensive-nar-report-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="40">costs of buying and maintaining a home</a> right now. Household incomes have grown faster than rents over the past year, and tenants making more than the median income now benefit from more options thanks to the influx of new apartment units. Given the divergence, more and more Americans with a taste for the finer things in life and a little cash to spare are opting to rent.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="drop-cap premium">Homeownership is synonymous with wealth in America — rich people live in the land of mortgage payments, not rent checks. This setup has an easy logic to it: Homeowners enjoy equity gains and a sense of stability that rentals simply can't provide. But given the costs of breaking into the for-sale market, combined with the recent deals offered on many apartments, that assumption may be flipped on its head.</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-quote="The market is insane right now.

                            </es-blockquote><p class="premium">Landlords have always dangled concessions like rent discounts or perks in front of tenants, but the recent building boom is now paying dividends for renters looking to land a deal. Early in the pandemic, cheap borrowing rates and soaring rents encouraged developers to put shovels in the ground — more than 1.6 million new apartment units hit the market between 2020 and 2023, Yardi Matrix, a data and research firm for commercial real estate, found. The company expects another million or so units to be completed in 2024 and 2025, which would equal levels not seen since the 1970s. Much of this construction is concentrated in the kinds of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-work-home-house-prices-rent-cost-decline-cheaper-cities-2023-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="60">sunny, cheap places</a> that everyone dreamed of moving to during the pandemic: Houston, Atlanta, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/austin-cost-of-living-jobs-city-life-san-francisco-atlanta-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="60">Austin</a>, Phoenix, and Charlotte, North Carolina, among others. This boom in supply means that people in these markets may not be so desperate to land just any open unit, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-rent-growth-top-cities-for-renters-apartments-realtor-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="60">forcing landlords to cut deals</a>. The typical asking rent nationwide is up only 0.7% from last year, according to Yardi Matrix, and markets such as Austin; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Tampa, Florida, have seen rents drop over the past three months. About one-third of rentals listed on Zillow are offering concessions, compared with about 10% in 2019.</p><p class="premium">"This is a much more commonplace tactic that landlords and property managers are using to get people through the door," Nicole Bachaud, a senior economist at Zillow, told me. "They're like, 'Hey, ignore that high rent price.

The result is that class A units account for more than half the apartment market, compared with one-third in the early 2000s, according to Moody's Analytics. At the same time, the number of high-income renters — those earning more than $150,000 — jumped by 82% between 2015 and 2020, a RentCafe analysis of Census Bureau data found.

"If I'm a guy that really wants to try and pinch my pennies and not really be tied down to a home, per se, that's what I'm going to look at."</p><p class="premium">And renters can put those cost savings to work. Sure, they may be missing out on the value of building equity in a home, but David Brasington, an economist at the University of Cincinnati, previously told Business Insider that average returns in the stock market over the past 50 years had well-outpaced home-equity gains (though he also noted that the stock market is more volatile and doesn't provide you with a place to lay your head at night).

But as with all good things, the golden age for America's wealthy renters must also come to an end. While the number of multifamily units expected to be completed next year is a still robust 459,000, according to Yardi Matrix, the end of this construction wave is in sight. Developers are feeling the pinch of higher interest rates and are wary of flooding markets with more supply. As a result, they were on pace to start construction on 245,000 units this year as of March, according to the Census Bureau, down from highs of more than 600,000 in 2022. This means that you can expect the sweetheart deals for renters to trail off near the end of 2025 and into 2026, Ressler told me.</p><p class="premium">"The supply cliff is going to come real soon," Ressler told me. "In other words, starts are already slowing down."</p><p class="premium">The upside for renters, though, is that the cliff hasn't arrived yet. Those in the market can expect more options and better bargains than what was on offer just a year ago, particularly if they're eyeing a top-end unit in a city with a lot of construction cranes on the horizon. So, for now, the formula for wealthier lessees is straightforward: Ride out the good times, sock away the extra cash that isn't going toward plumbing fixes or gym memberships, and check back in on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/housing-market-ice-age-higher-home-prices-fewer-sales-inventory-2023-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">homebuying landscape</a> when the rental market heats up again.</p><p class="premium">Nations told me she still hoped to buy a home one day.

<ol>
<li>The European Central Bank (ECB) is set to cut borrowing costs for the euro area for the first time since September 2019, marking the official end to the record fast-hiking cycle.</li>
<li>Despite the surprise May inflation data, which showed headline inflation at 2.6% and core at 2.9%, the ECB is likely to keep rates on hold until after June, with some officials suggesting that there may not be another rate cut after June.</li>
<li>The ECB is cautious about cutting interest rates too quickly, with ECB board member Isabel Schnabel cautioning against moving too quickly to avoid a potential overcorrection.</li>
<li>While some experts believe that wage growth may be driven by one-off effects, such as a mild winter, others argue that certain elements of inflation, particularly domestic inflation and services, are proving persistent and may require a more cautious approach to rate cuts.</li>
<li>The ECB's next policy meeting is in June, and while another rate cut cannot be ruled out, it appears unlikely given the recent commentary from ECB policymakers, with some experts arguing that the focus will shift to what happens after June.</li>

But investors’ attention looks like it has already moved on to what will happen after this June cut by the Frankfurt institution.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>“Judging by the commentary from officials, there is no questioning of the wisdom of cutting rates on 6 June,” said Mark Wall, ECB watcher with Deutsche Bank.</p><p>“Even with the upside surprise on May HICP [harmonized index of consumer prices], the ECB can argue a cut is consistent with its reaction function. The question is, what comes after June?”</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/31/euro-zone-inflation-may-2024.html#:~:text=Core%20inflation%2C%20excluding%20the%20volatile,the%20first%20reduction%20since%202019.">Euro area inflation for May</a> came in slightly higher than expected with headline inflation at 2.6% and the print for core at 2.9%. On top of that, negotiated wage growth — a figure closely watched by the ECB — did reaccelerate in the first quarter to 4.7% after hitting 4.5% in in the fourth quarter of 2023.</p></div><div class="group"><p>“Many of these data are distorted by one-off effects,” said the chief economist of Berenberg, Holger Schmieding.</p><p>“For example. a mild winter had boosted Q1 [first quarter] outdoor construction and thus real GDP while one-off payments raised wages more than usual in some countries such as Germany early this year.”</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>But while another rate cut in July cannot be ruled out, given the recent commentary from ECB policymakers it doesn’t seem very likely. </p><p>“We see that some elements of inflation are proving persistent — especially domestic inflation, and services in particular,” European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel said in an interview with the German public broadcaster ARD on May 16.</p></div><div class="group"><p>“I would caution against moving too quickly because there is a risk of cutting interest rates too fast.

A top European Union court ruled that McDonald’s has lost its Big Mac trademark in the 27-nation bloc, ruling in favor of Irish fast food rival Supermac’s in a longrunning legal battle. The EU General Court’s ruling said in its judgement Wednesday, June 5, 2024, that the U.S. fast food giant failed to prove that it was genuinely using the Big Mac name over a five-year period for chicken sandwiches, poultry products or restaurants.

                </div>
            </div>
        </div><p>The decision is about more than burger names. It opens the door for Galway-based Supermac’s expansion into other EU countries. The dispute erupted when Supermac’s applied to register its company name in the EU as it drew up expansion plans. McDonald’s objected, saying consumers would be confused because it already trademarked the Big Mac name.</p>
    

<p>Supermac’s filed a 2017 request with the EU’s Intellectual Property Office to revoke McDonald’s Big Mac trademark registration, saying the U.S. company couldn’t prove that it had used the name for certain categories that aren’t specifically related to the burger over five years. That’s the window of time in Europe that a trademark has to be used before it can be taken away. </p>



<p>After the regulator partially approved Supermac’s request, McDonald’s appealed to the EU court. </p>
    
<p>“McDonald’s has not proved that the contested mark has been put to genuine use” in connection with chicken sandwiches, food made from poultry products or operating restaurants and drive-throughs and preparing take-out food, the court said, according to a press summary of its decision. </p><p>Supermac’s portrayed the decision as a David and Goliath-style victory. Managing Director Pat McDonagh accused McDonald’s of “trademark bullying to stifle competition.” </p>
    

<p>“This is a significant ruling that takes a common-sense approach to the use of trademarks by large multi-nationals. It represents a significant victory for small businesses throughout the world,” McDonagh said in a statement. </p><p>The Irish company doesn’t sell a sandwich called the Big Mac but does have one called the Mighty Mac with the same ingredients.</p><p>McDonald’s was unfazed by the ruling, which can be appealed to the European Court of Justice, the bloc’s highest court, but only on points of law.</p><p>“The decision by the EU General Court does not affect our right to use the ‘BIG MAC’ trademark,” the company said in a press statement. “Our iconic Big Mac is loved by customers all across Europe, and we’re excited to continue to proudly serve local communities, as we have done for decades.”</p>

<li><strong>Court ruling</strong>: The Competition Appeal Tribunal in London has ruled that the case can go to trial, allowing Ad Tech Collective Action to pursue its claim against Google.</li>
<li><strong>Google's response</strong>: Google has described the lawsuit as "incoherent" and "speculative and opportunistic", and has vowed to "oppose it vigorously and on the facts".</li>
<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: The outcome of the lawsuit could result in compensation for UK publishers who have been affected by Google's alleged anti-competitive behavior, although no court date has been set and the case is likely to take time to resolve.</li>

<p>“With continued evidence that underlying inflation is easing,” the Bank of Canada said today that “monetary policy no longer needs to be as restrictive,” and it cut policy interest rates by 25 basis points, as widely expected.</p>
<p>But QT will continue, the statement said.

<p>It cut the target for its overnight rate to 4.75%; the Bank Rate to 5.0%, and the deposit rate to 4.75%.</p>

<p>“Recent data has increased our confidence that inflation will continue to move towards the 2% target,” it said in the statement today.</p>
<p>Employment “has been growing at a slower pace than the working-age population,” the statement said in a reference to the huge wave of immigrants that has flooded the labor market. “Wage pressures remain but look to be moderating gradually,” it said.</p>
<p>Due to the huge wave of immigrants, per-capita GDP declined in six quarters over the past seven quarters (the exception was a tiny uptick in Q1 2023), as economic growth stalled in the second half last year, and was too slow in the remaining quarters to keep up with population growth.</p>
<p>“However, shelter price inflation remains high,” the statement said. So there’s that. If it weren’t for rents. <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2024/03/27/amid-canadas-huge-immigration-surge-population-growth-hits-3-2-triggers-10-rent-inflation-even-as-home-prices-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rents spiked because that huge wave of immigrants needs rental housing</a>, and no one was prepared for it.</p>
<p>“Risks to the inflation outlook remain,” the BOC said. It’s “closely watching the evolution of core inflation and remains particularly focused on the balance between demand and supply in the economy, inflation expectations, wage growth, and corporate pricing behavior.”</p>
<p><strong>Two IFs for more cuts</strong>: “If inflation continues to ease (#1 IF), and our confidence that inflation is headed sustainably to the 2% target continues to increase (#2 IF), it is reasonable to expect further cuts to our policy interest rate,” BOC governor Tiff Macklem said at the press conference.</p>
<p>He outlined four risks to the lower-inflation outlook:</p>

<p>“We don’t want monetary policy to be more restrictive than it needs to be to get inflation back to target. But if we lower our policy interest rate too quickly, we could jeopardize the progress we’ve made. Further progress in bringing down inflation is likely to be uneven and risks remain,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’ve come a long way in the fight against inflation. And our confidence that inflation will continue to move closer to the 2% target has increased over recent months,” he said.</p>
<p>He said that “indicators of underlying inflation increasingly point to a sustained easing” of inflation. He cited these four metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>“CPI inflation has eased from 3.4% in December to 2.7% in April</li>
<li>“Our preferred measures of core inflation have come down from about 3.5% last December to about 2.75% in April</li>
<li>“The 3-month rates of core inflation slowed from about 3.5% in December to under 2% in March and April</li>
<li>“The proportion of CPI components increasing faster than 3% is now close to its historical average, suggesting price increases are no longer unusually broad-based.”</li>
</ul>
<p>“This all means restrictive monetary policy is working to relieve price pressures,” Macklem added. “And with further and more sustained evidence underlying inflation is easing, monetary policy no longer needs to be as restrictive. In other words, it is appropriate to lower our policy interest rate.”</p>
<h3><strong>Why higher rates may be more effective in Canada than in the US</strong>.</h3>
<p>There has been a lot of discussion about why the rate hikes seem to have been more effective in Canada than in the US in slowing the economy and bringing down inflation.</p>
<p>Part of the reason may be how mortgages are structured in Canada. The dominant mortgage rates in Canada are either variable-rate mortgages whose rates adjust for existing borrowers as rates go up, or fixed-rate mortgages whose rates are fixed for shorter terms such as two years or five years, and borrowers are facing renewals at much higher rates. So it’s existing borrowers that face higher mortgage payments on homes that they’d living in for years, which puts a damper on spending for other stuff, thus slowing demand growth.</p>
<p>In the US, with the typical 30-year fixed rate mortgage, only new borrowers face higher mortgage rates, and existing borrowers with their 3% mortgages are laughing all the way to the bank.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits, the largest U.S. alcohol distributor, over allegations that the company is providing "secret kickbacks" to large retail customers and violating the 1936 Robinson-Patman Act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FTC claims that Southern Glazer's has been offering better prices to some customers than others, which is illegal under the Robinson-Patman Act, which forbids companies from offering better prices to one buyer over another for the same commodity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Robinson-Patman Act is an obscure antitrust law that has not been used in a case since 2000. The FTC's interpretation of the law allows for volume discounts, but only if they do not interfere with competition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lawsuit could be filed in a matter of weeks, and it would be the FTC's first major enforcement action under the Robinson-Patman Act in over 20 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits is a Florida-based company that distributes alcohol for over 7,000 brands in 44 states, with revenue of $26 billion in 2023. The company serves as a middleman between alcohol producers and liquor stores.</p>

            In releasing its latest findings, investigators also re-upped their call for the FAA to install more technology at airports that can warn air traffic controllers of a possible collision on a runway. Known as ASDE-X, the NTSB says the system helped stop the impending collision at JFK, but it is deployed at only 35 major airports in the United States. In April, the FAA said it would deploy similar technology at four airports <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-install-new-runway-safety-technology" target="_blank">by July</a>.

            “The whole reason US aviation has such an exemplary safety record is because we’ve built in extra layers of protection, which is why we need lifesaving technology at more of the nation’s airports,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20240604a.aspx" target="_blank">said Tuesday</a> in a news release.

            The report noted investigators did not have the benefit of a recording from the cockpit voice recorder – commonly known as one of the black boxes – because it was overwritten. Such a recording would have provided key details about what happened, the NTSB said.

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">SAP’s $14-per-share offer represents a premium of about 45% on WalkMe’s closing price of $9.64 on Tuesday.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Founded out of Israel in 2011, WalkMe was initially designed to simplify website navigation by providing real-time, on-screen guidance. Over the years, the company moved its headquarters to San Francisco and bolstered its platform with more features, focusing more on both consumer and enterprise applications — for instance, to guide users through new features or to onboard new employees.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This took the form of little balloon overlays or even on-screen prompts to try and convert free users into paying customers. The company essentially sought to automate a process that would otherwise be a resource-intensive endeavor with human help alone.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As part of its enterprise push, WalkMe also provides insights into end-user behavior, focusing on providing extra support tools or information at points where a user is more likely to exit an application.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It is this focus on automating contextual, in-app support that SAP sees as bringing value to its own enterprise customers.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Indeed, in May, WalkMe reported that its first-quarter revenue rose 4% from a year earlier and <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-walkme-reports-robust-q1-earnings-launches-aipowered-walkmex-93CH-3454549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-mrf-link="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-walkme-reports-robust-q1-earnings-launches-aipowered-walkmex-93CH-3454549" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="6" mrfobservableid="c1d26cba-70e1-4924-b2b3-9ba555b0f9c4">unveiled WalkMeX</a>, a new AI-powered copilot that suggests “the best next step for any workflow, anywhere” using its existing contextual awareness smarts.

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">SAP, for its part, has been on a tear of late, with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/24/sap-shares-surge-7percent-after-results-plans-to-restructure-8000-jobs-in-push-to-ai.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-mrf-link="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/24/sap-shares-surge-7percent-after-results-plans-to-restructure-8000-jobs-in-push-to-ai.html" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="8" mrfobservableid="0a837df2-2d1b-4601-b995-3b039bd5a0ab">its strong financial performance</a> pushing its valuation to an all-time high of $230 billion this year.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Notably, the WalkMe deal is designed to complement two other acquisitions SAP has made in the past few years. It acquired fellow German firm Signavio, a business process automation company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/sap-is-buying-berlin-business-process-automation-startup-signavio/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/sap-is-buying-berlin-business-process-automation-startup-signavio/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="9" mrfobservableid="43cd6303-5dcb-472b-8340-8e0c3b668250">for $1.2 billion in 2021</a>.

<ol>
<li>Ron Baron, a billionaire investor, is supporting Tesla CEO Elon Musk's pay package, worth $56 billion, which is up for a shareholder vote at Tesla's meeting on June 13.</li>
<li>Baron, CEO of Baron Capital, believes Musk's accomplishments for the company, including the growth of Tesla's stock price to over $550 billion from $53.5 billion in 2018, warrant the pay package.</li>
<li>Baron wrote an open letter stating that Musk is the ultimate "key man" of key man risk, without whom Tesla's success would not be possible.</li>
<li>Musk's original pay package was approved by shareholders in 2018 when Tesla's market cap was $53.5 billion, and has since grown to over $550 billion, with a peak of $1.24 trillion in November 2021.</li>
<li>Despite controversy surrounding the pay package, including a Delaware court ruling that the board didn't act in the best interests of Tesla, Baron believes Musk has "earned his pay" and is crucial to the company's future success.</li>
