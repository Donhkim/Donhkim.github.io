<p>On Wednesday, former OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever announced he is forming a new company called <a href="https://ssi.inc/">Safe Superintelligence, Inc.</a> (SSI) with the goal of safely building "superintelligence," which is a hypothetical form of artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence, possibly in the extreme.</p>

<p>"<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">We will pursue safe superintelligence in a straight shot, with one focus, one goal, and one product," <a href="https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1803472979873128498">wrote</a> Sutskever on X. "We will do it through revolutionary breakthroughs produced by a small cracked team.</span>"</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>Sutskever was a founding member of OpenAI and formerly served as the company's chief scientist. Two others are joining Sutskever at SSI initially: <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/~danilevy/">Daniel Levy</a>, who formerly headed the Optimization Team at OpenAI, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gross_(entrepreneur)">Daniel Gross</a>, an AI investor who worked on machine learning projects at Apple between 2013 and 2017. The trio posted a statement on the company's new website.</p>

<p>Sutskever and several of his co-workers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chief-scientist-ilya-sutskever-leaves-openai-six-months-after-altman-ouster/">resigned</a> from OpenAI in May, six months after Sutskever <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/report-sutskever-led-board-coup-at-openai-that-ousted-altman-over-ai-safety-concerns/">played a key role</a> in ousting OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who later returned. While Sutskever did not publicly complain about OpenAI after his departure—and OpenAI executives such as Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1790518031640347056">wished him well</a> on his new adventures—another resigning member of OpenAI's Superalignment team, Jan Leike, publicly <a href="https://x.com/janleike/status/1791498184671605209">complained</a> that "over the past years, safety culture and processes [had] taken a backseat to shiny products" at OpenAI. Leike <a href="https://x.com/janleike/status/1795497960509448617">joined</a> OpenAI competitor Anthropic later in May.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>A nebulous concept</h2>
<p>OpenAI is currently seeking to <a href="https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/">create AGI</a>, or artificial general intelligence, which would hypothetically match human intelligence at performing a wide variety of tasks without specific training. Sutskever hopes to jump beyond that in a straight moonshot attempt, with no distractions along the way.</p>

<p>"This company is special in that its first product will be the safe superintelligence, and it will not do anything else up until then," said Sutskever in an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-19/openai-co-founder-plans-new-ai-focused-research-lab?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxODgxNjU5NywiZXhwIjoxNzE5NDIxMzk3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTRkM3ODJUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI5MTM4NzMzNDcyQkY0QjlGQTg0OTI3QTVBRjY1QzBCRiJ9.9s8N3QuUytwRVZ6dzDwZ6tPOGDsV8u05fpTrUdlHcXg&amp;sref=nPlhheXZ">interview with Bloomberg</a>. "It will be fully insulated from the outside pressures of having to deal with a large and complicated product and having to be stuck in a competitive rat race."</p>
<p>During his former job at OpenAI, Sutskever was part of the "<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-superalignment/">Superalignment</a>" team studying how to "align" (shape the behavior of) this hypothetical form of AI, sometimes called "ASI" for "artificial super intelligence," to be beneficial to humanity.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, it's difficult to align something that does not exist, so Sutskever's quest has met skepticism at times. On X, University of Washington computer science professor (and frequent OpenAI critic) Pedro Domingos wrote, "<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Ilya Sutskever's new company is guaranteed to succeed, because superintelligence that is never achieved is guaranteed to be safe.</span>"</p>
<p>Much like AGI, superintelligence is a nebulous term. Since the mechanics of human intelligence are still poorly understood—and since human intelligence is difficult to quantify or define because there is no one set type of human intelligence—identifying superintelligence when it arrives may be tricky.</p>
<p>Already, computers far surpass humans in many forms of information processing (such as basic math), but are they superintelligent? Many proponents of superintelligence imagine a sci-fi scenario of an "alien intelligence" with a form of sentience that operates independently of humans, and that is more or less what Sutskever hopes to achieve and control safely.</p>
<p>"You’re talking about a giant super data center that’s autonomously developing technology," he told Bloomberg. "That’s crazy, right? It’s the safety of that that we want to contribute to."</p>

<li>
<p>McDonald's US Chief Joe Erlinger has stated that the company is ready for a "fight" to attract back penny-pinching customers who have cut back on fast food in recent years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>McDonald's is launching a new $5 meal deal on June 25, as part of a larger marketing campaign to compete with its competitors and attract inflation-weary diners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Competitors such as Burger King, Wendy's, and Starbucks have already responded with their own value meal promotions, with some even mocking McDonald's for copying their ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>McDonald's believes its size and marketing muscle give it an edge over smaller rivals, allowing it to reduce any hit to franchisee profits. It also notes that the incremental cost of adding fries and a drink to a sandwich is minimal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some McDonald's franchisees, however, are concerned about the viability of the $5 meal deal, citing concerns that customers may trade down from pricier options and that the model is not sustainable with a 30% discount.</p>

Even Starbucks (<a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SBUX" data-ylk="slk:SBUX;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="0">SBUX</a>), known for its pricey Frappuccinos and lattes, said it would offer a $6 breakfast sandwich and coffee combo.</p><p>When asked about his adversaries, Erlinger smiled and said he isn’t fixated on the competition.</p><p>As the largest restaurant chain in the US by sales, he said McDonald’s size and marketing muscle gives the $130 billion company an edge over smaller rivals and the ability to reduce any hit to franchisee profits. “Think about our scale,” he said, noting that the incremental cost of adding fries and a drink to a sandwich was minimal. The $5 deal includes a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, small fries, four-piece chicken nuggets and a small soft drink.</p><figure class="caas-figure"></figure><p>Franchisees, who operate the majority of McDonald’s stores, don’t all agree with that calculus. Many say they are eager for a value meal that brings customers in the door but have concerns about people trading down from pricier options, like the $9 Big Mac combo.</p><p>“There simply is not enough profit to discount 30% for this model to be sustainable,” an independent franchisee group said in a message last month to its roughly 1,000 members.</p><p>The company said a local $5 promotion in upstate New York has performed well with lower-income consumers while driving additional sales by wealthier customers who buy more than just the $5 meal deal.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>For McDonald’s though, the promotion — which runs four weeks nationally and longer in markets like Dallas and Las Vegas — is not just about driving sales. The national campaign is also geared toward dispelling the notion that McDonald’s has become too expensive after images of an $18 Big Mac combo meal in Connecticut went viral on social media along with claims that prices have doubled in recent years.</p><p>The company’s prices have increased by an average 40% since 2019 to offset rising costs, Erlinger said in a May blog post. He said the $18 price tag is an anomaly found at just one of the company’s more than 13,700 locations.</p><p>That’s cold comfort to customers like Dylan Covington, 33, who lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and used to eat at McDonald’s about once a week. Price hikes have prompted him to cull his McDonald’s visits to every two or three months. Instead, he said he heads to a local restaurant where he can get a bigger sandwich for about the same price.</p><p>“McDonald’s was always the cheap option,” Covington said. “Now it’s not even that. I don’t see a reason to go there unless I’m craving a Big Mac specifically.”</p><figure class="caas-figure"></figure><h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="consumer-pullback">Consumer Pullback</h2><p>As prices rose around the US, local McDonald’s deals just weren’t doing enough to lure back customers like Covington. While the economy is still humming along and the unemployment rate remains low, real disposable income growth in the US has stalled. Americans have depleted much of their pandemic savings and debt is starting to pile up. Dining out has decreased and, for many, even fast-food restaurants are increasingly reserved for a special treat.</p><p>McDonald’s competitors were early to ramp up their value offers, with Arby’s offering a $6 meal deal back in January and White Castle pushing a $5 Bacon Bundle in April. McDonald’s sales were initially holding up better than competitors and the company took a wait-and-see approach.</p><p>“It seems like they were caught on their back heels in terms of value,” said Sara Senatore, an analyst at Bank of America.</p><p>Erlinger said customers are becoming even “more discerning about where they’re spending their dollars.” So the company decided to pitch a bigger national deal to franchisees, who own and operate 95% of US locations and get to weigh in on major marketing campaigns. The operators initially rejected the promotion over profit concerns but eventually came around, encouraged in part by additional funds provided by Coca-Cola Co.</p><p>McDonald’s is also dangling additional promotions like free fries in front of customers ordering via the fast-food chain’s app, a key part of the company’s growth strategy. App users order more often and are more likely to add drinks, desserts and other extras that boost check sizes and drive up sales.</p><p>The $5 meal promotion likely won't provide an instant fix. The company’s original dollar menu debuted in 2002, revamping it several times before landing on a $1 to $3 lineup in 2018. Although the value menu eventually drove strong results, the initiative took a while to gain traction, Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski told investors in April about the 2018 value menu.</p><figure class="caas-figure"></figure><h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="price-perception">Price Perception</h2><p>McDonald’s declined to detail promotional plans beyond this summer, although Erlinger he said it was fair to say the promotion isn’t the fast-food chain’s last word on value. “We obviously are going to remain competitive around value and affordability beyond the $5 meal deal.” Right now, customers aren’t looking for new products or creative takes on McDonald’s nuggets, burgers or wraps. “They’re asking for value and affordability,” he said.</p><p>For their part, competitors say they’re ready to go to battle with the restaurant industry’s heavyweight. Patrick Doyle, chairman of Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International Inc., said the increased focus on value could help prop up the entire industry.</p><p>“There’s a perception that maybe prices had gotten a little too high,” Doyle told investors in mid-June. The value talk is “hopefully going to help the perceptions around the category in general — get some people open their minds to coming back.”</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Why Are Stocks Down Today?</h2>
<p>Critically, the Thursday dip demonstrated the broader market’s sensitivity to Nvidia stock’s performance, as the S&amp;P 500 turned its peak 0.3% morning gain to a 0.6% loss by around 1:45 p.m., with almost all of the fall explained by Nvidia. Essentially, Nvidia’s intraday slide erased the equivalent of Coca-Cola, the S&amp;P’s 27th most valuable company with a roughly $270 billion market cap, from the index.</p>

<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Key Background</h2>
<p>It is highly normal for a stock to decline after a sharp increase like Nvidia just had. Broad index funds have benefited far more from Nvidia’s inclusion than they’ve been hurt, with Nvidia’s $2 trillion market cap added in 2024 accounting for a third of the market cap-weighted S&amp;P’s 15% year-to-date gain. Nvidia, which produces a majority of the semiconductor technology most coveted for generative AI applications, reported a sixfold increase in earnings in its most recent quarter as customers like Microsoft and Google shell out for the technology.</p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"><p id="article-0-inread"></p></fbs-ad>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Big Number</h2>
<p>$345,000. That’s about how much $10,000 invested in Nvidia exactly five years ago would be worth today. The same amount invested in the S&amp;P would be worth about $20,150.</p>

<strong>
<em>– First Phase 3 HIV Prevention Trial Ever to Show Zero Infections –</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Independent Data Monitoring Committee Recommended That Gilead Stop the Blinded Phase of the PURPOSE 1 Trial at Interim Analysis and Offer Open-Label Lenacapavir to All Participants –
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Foster City, Calif. – June 20, 2024 </span></strong>– Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced topline results from an interim analysis of its pivotal, Phase 3 PURPOSE 1 trial indicating that the company’s twice-yearly injectable HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, demonstrated 100% efficacy for the investigational use of HIV prevention in cisgender women.</p>
<p><span>PURPOSE 1 met its key efficacy endpoints of superiority of twice-yearly lenacapavir to once-daily oral Truvada<em>®</em> (emtricitabine 200mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300mg; F/TDF) and background HIV incidence (bHIV). Based on these results, the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended that Gilead stop the blinded phase of the trial and offer open-label lenacapavir to all participants.</span></p>
<p><span>“With zero infections and 100% efficacy, twice-yearly lenacapavir has demonstrated its potential as an important new tool to help prevent HIV infections,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “We look forward to additional results from the ongoing PURPOSE clinical program and continuing toward our goal of helping to end the HIV epidemic for everyone, everywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span>These are the first data generated from Gilead’s landmark PURPOSE program, which is the most comprehensive and diverse HIV prevention trial program ever conducted. The PURPOSE program comprises five HIV prevention trials around the world that are focused on innovation in science, trial design, community engagement and health equity.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Topline PURPOSE 1 data</span></strong></p>
<p><span>PURPOSE 1, a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized study, is evaluating the safety and efficacy of twice-yearly, subcutaneous lenacapavir for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and once-daily oral Descovy<em>®</em> (emtricitabine 200mg and tenofovir alafenamide 25mg; F/TAF) in more than 5,300 cisgender women and adolescent girls aged 16-25 across 25 sites in South Africa and three sites in Uganda. The drugs are being tested in parallel, with one group receiving twice-yearly lenacapavir and one group taking once-daily oral Descovy. Additionally, a third group was assigned once-daily oral Truvada. Study participants were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to lenacapavir, Descovy and Truvada, respectively. Because effective PrEP options already exist, there is broad consensus in the PrEP field that a placebo group would be unethical; thus, the trial used bHIV as the primary comparator and Truvada as a secondary comparator.</span></p>
<p><span>There were 0 incident cases of HIV infection among 2,134 women in the lenacapavir group </span>(incidence 0.00 per 100 person-years)<span>. </span>There were 16 incident cases among 1,068 women in the Truvada group (incidence 1.69 per 100 person-years). <span>The results demonstrated superiority of twice-yearly lenacapavir over bHIV (primary endpoint, incidence </span>2.41 per 100 person-years<span>) and superiority of twice-yearly lenacapavir over once-daily Truvada (secondary endpoint), with p&lt;0.0001 for both endpoints. In the trial, lenacapavir was generally well-tolerated and no significant or new safety concerns were identified.</span></p>
<p><span>HIV incidence in the Descovy group was numerically similar (39 incident cases among 2,136 women, incidence 2.02 per 100 person-years) to that in the Truvada group and was not statistically superior to bHIV. Previous clinical trials among cisgender women have commonly found challenges with adherence to daily oral pills for PrEP, and adherence analyses for Descovy and Truvada from PURPOSE 1 are ongoing. In the trial, both Descovy and Truvada were generally well-tolerated and no new safety concerns were identified.</span> </p>
<p><span>More detailed data from PURPOSE 1 will be presented at a future conference.</span></p>
<p><span>“Twice-yearly lenacapavir for PrEP, if approved, could provide a critical new choice for HIV prevention that fits into the lives of many people who could benefit from PrEP around the world—especially cisgender women,” said Linda-Gail Bekker, MBChB, DTM&amp;H, DCH, FCP(SA), PhD, Director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Center at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, and past President of the International AIDS Society. “While we know traditional HIV prevention options are highly effective when taken as prescribed, twice-yearly lenacapavir for PrEP could help address the stigma and discrimination some people may face when taking or storing oral PrEP pills, as well as potentially help increase PrEP adherence and persistence given its twice-yearly dosing schedule.”</span></p>
<p><span>The use of lenacapavir and the use of Descovy for the prevention of HIV in cisgender women are investigational and have not been determined to be safe or efficacious and are not approved anywhere globally.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Additional PURPOSE trials assessing twice-yearly lenacapavir for PrEP are ongoing</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Gilead expects results in late 2024/early 2025 from the program’s other pivotal trial, PURPOSE 2, which is assessing twice-yearly lenacapavir for PrEP among cisgender men who have sex with men, transgender men, transgender women and gender non-binary individuals who have sex with partners assigned male at birth in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Thailand and the United States. The regulatory filing for lenacapavir for PrEP will include the results of both PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2, if positive, in order to ensure lenacapavir for PrEP can be approved for multiple populations and communities most in need of additional HIV prevention options.</span></p>
<p><span>Gilead is committed to partnering with communities that are disproportionately affected by HIV in their respective countries and regions, and community input on the PURPOSE trials has been instrumental in factors ranging from program design to participant recruitment strategies. This kind of collaborative approach will continue to help Gilead implement clinical trials with rigor, innovation and intentional inclusion of communities that have historically been underrepresented in HIV prevention research. It will also help bolster the post-implementation science activities that Gilead will conduct for PURPOSE 1 and future successful trials.</span></p>
<p><span>Gilead recognizes the importance of helping to enable access in order for twice-yearly lenacapavir for PrEP, if approved by regulatory authorities, to achieve the broadest impact. In light of today’s milestone and the company’s ongoing commitment to communities affected by HIV, Gilead intends to brief community partners and provide a public statement regarding its planned access approach for high-incidence, resource-limited countries, which are primarily low- and lower-middle-income countries.</span></p>

        <li>
        Use DESCOVY FOR PrEP to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection as part of a comprehensive strategy that includes adherence to daily dosing and safer sex practices, including condoms, to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>HIV-1 risk factors:</strong> Behavioral, biological, or epidemiologic HIV-1 risk factors may include, but are not limited to: condomless sex, past or current STIs, self-identified HIV risk, having sexual partners of unknown HIV-1 viremic status, or sexual activity in a high-prevalence area or network
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Reduce STI risk:</strong> Counsel on the use of STI prevention measures (e.g., consistent and correct condom use, knowledge of partner’s HIV-1 viremic status, regular testing for STIs)
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Reduce potential for drug resistance:</strong> Only prescribe DESCOVY FOR PrEP to individuals confirmed to be HIV negative immediately prior to initiation, at least every 3 months while taking DESCOVY, and upon an STI diagnosis. HIV-1 resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection who are taking only DESCOVY because DESCOVY alone is not a complete regimen for treating HIV-1
        </li>
        <li>
        Some HIV tests may not detect acute HIV infection. Prior to initiating DESCOVY FOR PrEP, ask individuals about potential recent exposure events. If recent (&lt;1 month) exposures are reported or suspected, or symptoms of acute HIV infection (e.g., fever, fatigue, myalgia, skin rash) are present, confirm HIV-negative status with a test approved by the FDA for use in the diagnosis of acute HIV infection
        </li>
        <li>
        If HIV-1 infection is suspected or if symptoms of acute infection are present while taking DESCOVY FOR PrEP, convert the DESCOVY FOR PrEP regimen to a complete HIV treatment regimen until HIV-negative status is confirmed by a test approved by the FDA for use in the diagnosis of acute HIV infection
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Counsel on adherence:</strong> Counsel individuals to strictly adhere to daily dosing, as efficacy is strongly correlated with adherence. Some individuals, such as adolescents, may benefit from more frequent visits and counseling
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>New onset or worsening renal impairment: </strong>Postmarketing cases of renal impairment, including acute renal failure, proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT), and Fanconi syndrome have been reported with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-containing products. Do not initiate DESCOVY in individuals with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt;30 mL/min. Individuals with impaired renal function and/or taking nephrotoxic agents (including NSAIDs) are at increased risk of renal-related adverse reactions. Discontinue DESCOVY in individuals who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome. Monitor renal function in all individuals (see Dosage and Administration section)
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis:</strong> Fatal cases have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including FTC and TDF. Discontinue use if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity develop, including hepatomegaly and steatosis in the absence of marked transaminase elevations
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Adverse reactions</strong>
</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
    <li>
    <strong>Most common adverse reactions</strong> (≥2%) in the DESCOVY FOR PrEP clinical trial were diarrhea, nausea, headache, fatigue, and abdominal pain
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Drug interactions</strong>
</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
    <li>
    <strong>Prescribing information:</strong> Consult the full Prescribing Information for DESCOVY for more information, warnings, and potentially significant drug interactions, including clinical comments
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Metabolism:</strong> Drugs that inhibit P-gp can increase the concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), a component of DESCOVY. Drugs that induce P-gp can decrease the concentrations of TAF, which may lead to loss of efficacy
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Drugs affecting renal function:</strong> Coadministration of DESCOVY with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of FTC and tenofovir and the risk of adverse reactions
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Dosage and administration</strong>
</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
    <li>
    <strong>Dosage:</strong> One tablet taken once daily with or without food
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>HIV screening:</strong> Test for HIV-1 infection immediately prior to initiating, at least every 3 months during use, and upon diagnosis of an STI (see Warnings and Precautions section)
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>HBV screening:</strong> Test for HBV infection prior to or when initiating DESCOVY
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Renal impairment and monitoring:</strong> Not recommended in individuals with creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt;30 mL/min. Prior to or when initiating DESCOVY, and during use on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, CrCl, urine glucose, and urine protein in all individuals. In individuals with chronic kidney disease, assess serum phosphorus
    </li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>CDK Global, a technology company that provides software for the auto industry, suffered a second cyberattack on Wednesday, causing outages for auto retailers and car dealerships across the US.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The outage may result in extended downtime, with CDK stating that it does not have an estimated time frame for resolution and that dealers' systems will not be available at a minimum on Thursday.</strong></li>
<li><strong>CDK's customer support teams are unavailable as a precautionary measure to maintain security, and the company is working with third-party experts to assess the impact and provide regular updates to customers.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The cyberattack affected CDK's dealer management systems, which allow dealers to handle customer appointments, vehicle records, and other information. Some CDK functions began to return on Wednesday afternoon, but it's unclear if the second attack is related to the first.</strong></li>
<li><strong>CDK has not provided detailed information about the nature of the attacks or whether any customer data was stolen, and it's not yet clear if the company has the ability to determine if personal data was compromised.</strong></li>

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Auto retailers and car dealerships across the U.S. are facing another day of outages after a second cyberattack hit tech company CDK Global, which develops software used for managing auto customers and their vehicles.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In a message from CDK sent to customers Thursday, the company said the additional cyberattack late Wednesday may result in extended outages.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“At this time, we do not have an estimated time frame for resolution and therefore our dealers’ systems will not be available at a minimum on Thursday,” the message read. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">CDK said that its customer support teams “remain unavailable” as a precautionary measure to maintain security. </p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">When reached by TechCrunch, CDK spokesperson Lisa Finney confirmed the second incident and another shutdown of “most of our systems.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“In partnership with third party experts, we are assessing the impact and providing regular updates to our customers. We remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible,” said Finney. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company’s website says its software runs in about 15,000 dealerships.</p>
<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">News of the cyberattack broke early Wednesday as car dealerships reported outages with their CDK-run dealer management systems, which allow dealers to handle customer appointments, vehicle records and other information. Several CDK customers took to social media and Reddit saying the outages forced staff to find workarounds that do not rely on the downed software. </p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">CDK did not describe the nature of the initial cyberattack, but said that CDK shut down all of its systems on Wednesday. Some CDK functions began to return on Wednesday afternoon, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-19/cyberattack-hits-software-provider-for-car-dealers-across-the-us?srnd=code-wars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to Bloomberg</a>, which first reported the ongoing cyberattack. It’s not clear if, or how, the second cyberattack is related to the first. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">CDK did not answer TechCruch’s specific questions about the incidents, including if it’s aware of any exfiltration of data from its systems. It’s not yet clear if the company has the ability to determine what customer data, if any, was stolen.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Global alert issued</strong>: The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a global alert about fake versions of Ozempic, a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes and aid in weight loss.</li>
<li><strong>Counterfeit drugs pose health risk</strong>: The fake medicines could pose a danger to health and the WHO advises people to source the drug only through reputable sources, such as a doctor, rather than obscure sites online or through social media.</li>
<li><strong>Popularity as weight-loss medication</strong>: Ozempic has become popular as a weight-loss medication, leading to shortages for people with type 2 diabetes and creating a market for counterfeit drugs.</li>
<li><strong>How Ozempic works</strong>: The active ingredient, semaglutide, helps people with type 2 diabetes control sugar levels in their blood and also signals to the brain that they are full, reducing the urge to eat and aiding in weight loss.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of counterfeit drugs</strong>: The WHO is tracking rising concerns about counterfeit Ozempic drugs, which could potentially harm people who use them, and is urging caution and responsible sourcing of the medication.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Bugatti's new car, called "Toon", is a completely new design</strong>: It doesn't share any components with any other Bugatti car, including the Chiron and Nea, and has been designed from the ground up.</li>
<li><strong>The car features a V16 engine with 1,000 horsepower</strong>: The engine is naturally aspirated and has a crankshaft that is over a meter long (less than a meter in length).</li>
<li><strong>The car has a unique gearbox design</strong>: The gearbox is located at the back of the engine, which allows for more space in the cabin and reduces the frontal area of the car, making it more aerodynamic.</li>
<li><strong>The car's design is influenced by mechanical watches</strong>: The designers drew inspiration from the intricate mechanics of watches, aiming to create a car that is beautiful even when the engine cover is removed.</li>
<li><strong>The car has a advanced battery and electric motor system</strong>: The car has a 25 kWh battery and three electric motors, which provides exceptional performance and comfort, despite the car being only 27 mm longer than the Chiron.</li>

    [Music] [Music] okay matate looks like we've got ourselves a private unveiling here should we should we take the covers off yes [Music] wow this is the Bugatti toon toon exactly oh explain it so toon is a a mechanism in in sophisticated watches that helps to get the time uh correct and the one of The Inspirations behind this car was mechanical watches because they are beautiful no matter where you look at them even things you don't see even if they don't have a transparent cover on the rear you know that if you take it apart that you will have beautiful pieces everywhere like machine little metal bits and we think that the Bugatti is the ultimate car so even things you don't see you know that we have done everything we went the extra mile to make it the best possible we say yes to progress this car is completely new so it doesn't share one single component with either the Chiron or the Nea or any other car it has zero in common with any of these cars it's completely from ground up so let's not keep them waiting anyone that doesn't know it's a V16 engine right H hit us with the specs I think you said 8 3 l l of naturally aspirated naturally aspirated 1,000 horsepower horsepower a one meter long crankshaft and that's less than a meter I think a meter is more more like this we I think we man are not so good at predicting this so uh the also the car is not longer actually that was really important so when we decided to go with the V60 and I talked to the designers and like why would it would it be bad if the car was longer like would it maybe be good for the design they said no please don't make the car longer so we had to find a way with a much longer engine this is a lot longer than the W6 it's actually 40 cm longer and it has a big battery 25 kwh battery three electri motors still the same comfort in the car and despite that it's just 27 mm longer wheelway that's crazy and the the gearbox is at the back of the engine right so 8speed DCT exactly so the Chiron has uh the gearbox in front of the engine and when you sit in the car you actually notice that because you are sitting quite far away from the passenger uh and in this car we wanted to use that space for the battery so the gearbox is behind but it also enables another thing so for top speed the most important thing okay besides power is frontal area everyone thinks it's drag coefficient but actually what's even more important is the frontal area because to get to the total drag Force you you multiply the drag coefficients with the frontal area so what we have done we narrowed the tunnel we still have a battery in there but it's more narrow than the gearbox so we brought the passengers closer together still very comfortable enough Elbow Room between the passengers but that meant we could bring the greenhouse closer and also we brought the whole cabin down so that the car is lower so the frontal area is greatly reduced for what Bugatti is known for very high top speed capability and you can actually see it here when you see the shoulders of the design so you know design is not just growing on top of a package it's actually thinking from the beginning from the ground up about the package of the car how it helps to achieve a better design for example not making it longer and for example having a tighter Greenhouse so have this muscular shoulders here and with the hybrid system so you've got this that that was a big battery you just mentioned 26 kwatt hours 25 K 25 Kow hours down the center spine of the car three motors two at the front one in the gearbox exactly at the back so what's the total power then total power is 1,800 horsepower okay so a big step from the from the shiron yeah exactly but I assume it weighs a lot more see you up there yeah exactly that's that's the thing so uh we didn't want to make it longer and we didn't want to make it heavier which was really difficult because the battery itself is 200 kilos it's a very high performance battery so 25 KW hours is a lot in this kind of car so all the existing like sports cars super cars with hybrid systems they are like in order of magnitude less energy so we have lots of energy and of capacity also for a decent all electric range what kind of range you thinking EV only so conservatively 60 kilm EV only uh but like still with a lot of performance so you have actually 800 horsepower with the electric powertrain alone four-wheel drive of four-wheel drive with the rear uh electric motor and the two in the front but actually what's important about that is this very high tech high performance electric power Trin enabled a very emotional combustion engine because BAS basically when you take the turbos away from the engine you have less torque you have less power right but we wanted to have this very emotional engine and for me emotion is a naturally S engine exactly when already a combustion engine then something really special yeah but that was only possible to have a you know a th000 horsepower combustion engine is by no means uh a weak engine but a less powerful one than the previous was enabled by the very high performance electric power train okay so N9 ,000 RPM yes and it sounds good you drove it the other day right for the first time yeah you know I was concerned at the beginning that it could sound like one V8 or two V8s stick stick together and uh just like not be something special but actually it's totally different it doesn't sound like V8 doesn't sound like a V10 doesn't sound like a V12 it's really unique so where did the idea for a V16 come from other than it's a very exotic configuration well you know when you start a project like this with a Famous Brand like Bugatti you actually have so many opportunities because in the last 20 years we know Bugatti for hypercars but actually if you look at the history of Bugatti you can go any direction you could go in a luxury car you can go in a GT you know Cruiser and actually there were lots of people who wanted us to go electric um people who were very influential in the in the you know Volkswagen group and Mr Mr Electric hypercar surely you just reody a Nea and you're you're done that was actually the talk of why people wanted to give me Bugatti you know we already have easyy yeah you just rebodied in AA and you're done but I thought this was wrong and you know the previous uh management also was working actually on a four-seater electric uh Bugatti so first you have to determine which body style you want to do like do you want to do an SUV luxury car whatever but you know Bugatti is really there for performance raising the bar for over 100 years so I thought we need a hyper we need a successor to the Chiron and then the power train and with n you know very well what you can do with electric power trains and it's really you know you can step up the game in many things but I thought for Bugatti it's not the time yet Bugatti needs to be very emotional still with a combustion engine and then when already a combustion engine then let's do it special so naturally aspirated but like many people told me you could have got 1,000 horsepower from a very you know high power turbocharger V8 or could you not take the turbos off the W6 and lighter components and oh we actually looked at that so we looked at that as well um why not keep the w16 r v already had it but turns out the W configuration is not that great as an natur espr engine because you have alternating intake and exhaust lengths between the cylinders so one cylinder has a long exhaust short intake the next one has it the other way around so that doesn't really work well with an NS bra engine so we decided to develop a new one okay wow um performance it's got more power it weighs less it's going to go faster not 60 and less than two seconds less than two seconds and top speed so it will be let's say customer limited to 445 445 what's that in uh that's under that's 280 something maybe something like that yeah but have you you must have run the the the simulators on how fast it could go well let's say there's more in it there's more in it well I mean airon did did over 300 so yeah um do do you have any interest in in going after that in this car down the line well Bugatti is about pushing the limits let's see let's launch the car first Jack um all right so the styling you you touched on it there but I think there were people out there that would probably assume you would come out swinging and just create some crazy looking Batmobile because you know you're the new bus and it's a new era but actually it's it's quite an evolutionary design isn't it it's a bloodline from veyon Chiron to too absolutely so first of all it's completely new there is nothing in this car that carries over anything from the previous cars but we didn't want to you know throw all the design history out of the window so we are very proud that we have very distinct design features in Bugatti so that you can recognize it's a Bugatti even without a badge which you maybe couldn't really say about many other hypercast so the Horseshoe the central line the sea line on the side and the twoone body so even without knowing this is a Bugatti you would know this is a Bugatti so from the outside it's an evolution but a big one if you had now the Chiron next to it you would see how much of a difference it is and a lot of it enabled by the package underneath it so with this car what I'm really proud of is how the teams have worked together you know Frank H the design director and before him aim anite who retired and Emilio sherro the CTO and his team and everyone worked really together to create this and it feels like it came from one hand from one person because the technical package and the design the interior all of it fit together and something that I'm quite proud of on this car as well is the uh rolling chassi so usually you have exterior design and interior design and the stuff between just somehow happens the engineers just do whatever is easiest or makes technically most sense but again toon we want it to be special even when it's naked or its parts we wanted that also that is something really special even if the customers don't see it so we had a third design discipline which was rolling chassis and that was really difficult because rolling chassis designer wow we did actually see it in Berlin and I do remember standing next to it going that is a that is a goodlooking rolling chassis and I think you said it had a clear coat on the carbon but but other than that that is whates underneath ex exactly even if the customers just see it when they come here in molim to the atellier where the car is built they many of them won't do that but still we want you to know that you can take any piece of the car put it on the wall and it's a piece of art the chassis is where I wanted to go next uh in terms of the carbon monoco um the stiffness of it um you talked about the suspension do we have is there some sus yes it's like here's some suspension I printed earlier yeah exactly so here we have some nice pieces that we can have a look at wow well let's start here with the suspension yeah because you collaborated with a company that we actually did a film with a while ago um Zinger Zinger and their company Divergent uh Forint stuff go so explain why 3D apart from the fact that it looks completely mad it looks kind of organic like it's made from bone or something but um other than that what's the engineering benefits of this it's lighter and stiffer very simple but also it's beautiful MH and it's new technology that like people are a bit hesitant to to really put in uh road cars also because of the complexity and cost and so on but we were thinking if not in a Bugatti then where you know this is where you test new technology I mean we make sure that it's on the level where it needs to be in terms of durability and all of that but it gives uh quite a lot of advantage in in weight and we have a lot of 3D printed Parts also in the structure of the car like the front connecting brace and stuff like that and then when we look at the interior you kind of see that reflected as well yeah we call this a skeletonized central console so you can see through it and you here have the most important knobs and here is where the screen comes out so the car is very analog and we want you to be able to run the car without any screen basically so the screen pops out if you want it but most of the time you wouldn't have it so you actually have to have a screen for regulation when you drive in Reverse you have to have reverse and camera for safety reasons so you cannot build a car without screen if that if that law didn't exist would you delete it completely no we would because I I hate to see our customers Drive in cars with their phone in their hand as navigation so if you want like apple carplay you know it pops out and that's it so very simple but this is also cool so this is machined aluminum M but this is machined crystal glass so this is not plastic this is actually crystal glass which starts as a block and is machined into this shape and this is super diff ult and this is also a part that you need to homologate because you do the like head impact so you fire dummy heads into this and it shouldn't shatter so should we give it a go yeah exactly well wow let's let's have a look at the wheel cuz yeah uh this is another one I've been looking forward to this cuz the one in Berlin was it was it was essentially just a a 3D printed kind mockup wasn't it this is real so here you have like 3D uh sorry you have machined titanium rubins so these are actually bearings not there for just the sake of having them but for reducing friction and everything is analog there's a little screen up there and the party trick is it always stays um centered so you have a planetary gearbox in here to enable this and of course your gear shifters and stuff but this is the this is the really beautiful piece like a citr C4 Picasso H not really let's not make that comparison I'm joking it's it's incredible this um this clearly was this must have given you the idea for the toor on name right having this so front and center yeah one of the first things I did when when I joined we you know gaed and went to Switzerland to visit a few watchmakers and talk about this with them to make this together and actually we are building this with a Swiss watchmaker in Switzerland and is it um a watchmaker you can tell us the name of or is it a silent partner well it's actually a great company called concepto watch that makes the mechanisms and the watches for many of the big Brands which don't manufacture their own watches so many of the brands you perceive as being you know making their own watch it's actually coming from from these guys I see straight to the source yeah exactly so all of these mechanisms you see here behind these gears and stuff this is all actually working and uh the the way the needle moves is through all of these little gears and what you see here in the center you have the um the RPM meter so you see it goes to 10,000 mhm uh then the speedometer going around it this is quite interesting speedometer go to 550 km an hour in case you can't see that exactly just in case yeah and then the two needles on the right they show you the combustion and electric powertrain power so the both needles go to th000 horsepower and then you add them up basically so let's say you are on half throttle both give 500 horsepower something like that you add the two up and then interesting on left side you actually have battery state of charge shown in an analog way I guess that's pretty unique as well yeah wow one of the things I love about the Chiron you know everyone is making these horrible fake exhaust pipes and Bugatti has this like the Shion sport for example has four Central exhaust pipes but then they are too hidden in the diffuser so they have more exhaust than they actually show and here for example uh you know we have this floating light and this has a purpose where the air flows underneath it under this flying buttress around the shoulder that we were talking about before and into the air intake to the engine and since it's a naturally aspirated engine it can use any kind of compression it can get so here the this whole thing actually contributes a little bit to engine power more air you can direct into it yeah rather than the round it more power exactly but it starts from the front and this whole car makes a lot of architectural sense what we see in the rear is this really tall diffuser but in order to be tall it has to be super long there's an angle there's like an optimal angle isn't there yeah like above 11° diffusers don't really work anymore so the air separates from the diffuser at this kind of application so if if it's this tall it means it's started in the middle of the car and the way to achieve that is like the whole car has to be designed around that idea so everything has to work together so a more narrow engine so you have the Venturi tunnels left and right and even the engine is angled so that you can do this diffuser I can see it from here now you mention it it's just tipped down at the front exactly exactly amazing and then you you of course have an active Wing but because you have this huge diffuser you actually even at top speed you don't need the wing because the cars are dynamically balanced there is no lift with even the wing tucked in like this but of course we have a big active wing for air brake but also if you want additional downforce and then on top of that we have these exhaust pipes that are not here just for styling they're actually also separating the air flow so the clean air flow from underneath the diffuser and the turbulent air flow here and the exhaust stream kind of nicely separates that kind of like a hot like a blown diffuser in their way yeah exactly yeah another cool thing that we could do with this car is the Chiron and basically any other car has a re crash structure crash beam that you then hide with the bumper so the bumper covers it like it's just a aluminum or or steel bar on most cars and here the diffuser has another function except being this wonderful diffuser it's also structural which means in a rear crash situation it absorbs the energy so that we could have this wonderful open rear end where you can actually have exposed rear tires I love it which looks amazing when you're behind a car yeah kind of race car Vibes there's so much you know space around the back of the car you just just get this sense that it's got a lot of air and heat it needs to get rid of this way it does there's like a big challenge is to get all the heat soaking from the big exhaust systems with unfortunately four gpfs so you have four big you know uh particle filters uh that are somewhat dampening the noise but there's still plenty of it in fact there's a question I just got reminded of that I didn't ask you earlier so this engine this V16 um it's Cosworth have built this engine for you you uh tell me about the phone call when when you you phoned up is it Bruce Wood Bruce Wood Cosworth and you said hey you might not know me this must have been way back so oh I remember exactly where I was I was walking down the street in split in Croatia and I got the phone number of Bruce and nobody knew about the Bugatti thing that was going on and I called Bruce and asked him you know Bruce M mat you might have heard of the electric cars that we are making uh but I'm calling you for something else I might take over Bugatti and I need a V6 natur aspirated Engine with 1,000 horsepower could you do that that's how it started actually the cool thing is that it never changed so since then phone call and I'm so glad that we did this with cord they really amazing Partners you know when you work with the best in the world yeah you know I I'm a guy who always want to do everything myself everything you know the only one crazier is Christian kek so he he's he's building even his own wheels like that that's going even to a higher extent than than we we did before but with this car you know you have Brembo for the best brakes you have uh the you have CW word for the engine you have uh rem's technology for the electric powert train and so on so really the best experts for every field and with CW was beautiful to work with like you know they know what they're doing this was the direction from the beginning and you just go and I was just recently there and you know you you have the little I mean beautiful engines of The Valkyrie and and Gord Murray t50 and then you have this thing next to it and it looks the Hulk yes it's like it looks like a boat engine next to them that's fantastic in fact there's a little model over here that you you brought along yeah so we were going down memory lane there I think that must have been 2020 or was it even earlier than that when you phoned up cworth that must have been a bit earlier because this was we made this in June 2020 so four years ago M and it already had a V16 natur ASP engine here but you see the original concept was with the hot v m we changed later to a cold V and uh it had already the gearbox behind the engine the electric motor behind two electric motors in the front and the battery but this is basically Nea monoco so obviously that changed this was like just the first idea was this you playing around with okay V16 would be cool would it fit where would the motors go where can I put the battery no this is what I used to uh speak to the CEO of Volkswagen at time heres like when we discussed about what I would do with the company I was like this I P I brought some homework sir that was the homework that's incredible so 3.6 million EUR no 3.8 million 3.8 million okay sorry need to earn another 200 grand um 3.8 plus tax plus tax plus tax and you're going to build 250 Coupes but with the Chiron then Along Came the um the other variant and stuff that made it up to 500 well we'll see you know we start shipping this car in 26 yeah and it will take us 2 and a half 3 years to produce those 250 cars so whatever comes after that is beyond 29 okay okay we need to have a look inside yes you also want to show me the front yes that's really important to me so deep yes very deep you could fit a very smooch child in there I think exactly yeah so now imagine you have a customized uh bag doesn't even have to say it's a Bugatti but you come with that shape of a bag into an exclusive hotel and you know who knows knows but another thing that I wanted to show you not just this let's say packaging Marvel that we had in the front but the details so when you open it up Everything Is Beautiful carbon and I'm a bit of a hinge fanatic so this the hinges um are machined and anodized aluminum so even the details that you might not care about or might not know this we have paid attention to them because it's important everything is important so these are the ones that the finance guys would want to be off the shelf steal exactly it doesn't matter matter exact exactly exactly that's the kind of discussions we have every day should we do it let's go let's open it oh Electric yes and for the first time at the hedal door in a Bugatti wow electric that must have cost some weight oh no actually the strut is almost the same and it's a lot better than a gas rut because gas ruts depending on the temperature if it's cold outside of course the air uh has less density so the door kind of hangs when it's very hot outside it has lots of pressure so it wants to push the door up so you cannot get it right and with these kind of doors that's why we decided to go for an electric one to have consistency of how it works just before you even get in the just the this the carbon tub that you can see here is absolutely beautiful the shapes the angles um the Finish yes look at the door yeah look at that shape craziness craziness right also reason to have this kind of doors is because we move the cabin lower in order to have the lower frontal area so this kind of door opening makes it easier to get in and out as you should now demonstrate exactly how tall are you uh 189 189 means nothing yeah uh over 62 six' two okay wow yeah right there is a million things to go through here you you take it away exactly it's a whole Revolution so while on the exterior you can clearly recognize the past in the interior everything is new and you see the watchmaking so the instrument cluster made with a Swiss watch maker beautiful details all the gears and dials completely analog so here we have a little compartment where the screen pops up if you like to see it but if you don't it's completely I would like to see look all right that's awesome yeah it's a little bit theater in itself there I like the screen isn't too big I mean it's dictated by the size of the kind of flying fly console but it it it's just right to not be overpowering and dominating yeah the idea is to have it very simp simple so very simple infotainment mostly based on Apple carplay and Android auto so you don't have to you know fiddle out with with some kind of infotainment of a car it will be outdated anyways very soon so what we were thinking about is how will this car look like in 30 50 100 years because reality is this car will be around when we are long gone like most Bugattis are I mean they're going to they'll be around forever right I mean exactly who's who's going to scrap one of these even in a thousand years it should it should be around that's what we wanted to make sure that when you look at this car in 50 years it's still beautiful and the screen is more of a necessity so it's needed for some regulations but also we wanted people to be comfortable when they travel to have navigation and so on but in normal day driving you don't need it another cool thing is how you start the power Trin so this is how you activate the powertrain wow but this is just hybrid mode if you want the combustion engine you pull it out and then com exactly so in an analog way you wake up the combustion engine and then you have the modes so these are let's say shassy and active system modes well these are powertrain modes so you have you can choose what you want so hybrid so the car decides how to distribute the power then you have full electric mode so it's always going to be electric unless you deploy unless you deplete the battery so the engine's not going to be cutting in when you exactly when you put the thrott fully down it's you go Full Throttle it's only electric so you have a combustion only mode as well and an echarge mode where where the battery gets charged so let's say you are going to a zero emission Zone you're coming towards it you go into this mode it charges up the battery when you arrive there you just go into all electric mode and you have 50 60 70 km of all electric range incredible there's something I didn't notice when we were looking at the um the model over there is the the paddles the way they're kind of they're attached reverse attached to the rim it's it's it's amazing obviously that's because you don't have the the spokes to to stick them to yeah I mean when you make a decision like that that actually actually impacts a lot of stuff so like how far are the pedals so that you can still put your fingers behind but not you know too far that it interferes with with this um stock and uh same with the size of the instruments like you cannot make them bigger than this because otherwise they will interfere with your fingers when you turn the steering wheel so there it has a lot of influences also on the airbag and so on so a lot of engineering went into making this concept work so another way how we managed to do a little bit of magic to not make the car longer was to have the seat fixed but it does move up and down and the back rest is moving the angle you just cannot move the seat back and forth and then you have moving pedals electrically and as well as the steering wheel and you control all of that with this door knob here which is also as we call it scandalized so just like these in the middle as well you have beautiful mechanisms that you can see through a crystal glass what's next after this katti hold could it have two model lines well Bugatti has a huge history and with this brand you can do many things and what for now we are focused on this car this was also let's say my biggest Focus for the last four years developing this beautiful piece and first we need to get uh the car into production which we will do in two years and then we'll see what comes next and for you personally what does this car mean because all eyes are on you you're you're the new boss and and this was your vision and with with the help of thousands of people you've you've brought it to fruition but you're nearly there um what does it mean to you personally yeah I must say I mean first of all the group of people we have behind it it's really like and you can see that like the design team the technical team everyone has worked really as one but when this let's say started to be as a rumor but then became official that like this catian guy with electric car compan is taking over of course very many people were concerned and some said it to our faces and some didn't um but then when we show the car we hear so many people like oh thanks God like you did the right thing like Bugatti's back Top Gear office that was the Top Gear office you heard it from all the way back in London no many customers when we presented the car they were like oh man we were so concerned but then when we saw it it's like it's bang on like they couldn't believe like they I'm really you know I'm quite self-critic and you know that I will also point out things that are not that great but in that this car when I look around I'm so proud of what the team has built it's it's just it's just on another level from all the aspects I really think it will step up the game in the industry well I think we've just made the the world's longest ever YouTube video but this car deserved it I was so honored actually for you to be able to take us around show us all the detail all the thought that had gone into every tiny thing and the way one thing affects another decision at the back of the car is just fascinating and and and for you to be a CEO that takes such an active interest in you know the test driving the engineering the the initial sort of idea and everything it's it's such a wonderful thing with a car like this you kind you kind of need that kind of singular vision from the beginning so look great job but just just I'll save my mark out of 10 till till we've had a exactly exactly okay I'm going to leave you in here thank you um it's probably the comfest seat in the house cheers mat see you for

Many Tesla owners don’t know about this latch.</p><p class="text | article-text">But in this case, Sanchez was stuck outside of her <a href="https://www.tesla.com/contact" target="_blank">Tesla</a> while the toddler was trapped inside, buckled into a car seat.</p><p class="text | article-text">Sanchez tells On Your Side she had no option but to call 911, which immediately sent out Scottsdale firefighters.</p><p class="text | article-text">“And when they got here, the first thing they said was, ‘Uggh, it’s a Tesla. We can’t get in these cars,’” she said. “And I said, ‘I don’t care if you have to cut my car in half. Just get her out.’”</p><p class="text | article-text">Firefighters were forced to break a window with an axe, but they first covered the window with tape to keep the glass from flying.</p><p class="text | article-text">Meanwhile, Sanchez’s granddaughter sat alone inside the Tesla, which was getting hotter and hotter.</p><p class="text | article-text">“She was OK for the first few minutes,” Sanchez said. “But as soon as the firemen came and all the commotion started and the windows getting broken into, she started crying because she was scared.”</p><p class="text | article-text">A firefighter climbed through the window and pulled the little girl free. They even gave her a little fire hat to calm her down.</p><p class="text | article-text">“After I knew she was safe, then the anger,” she said. “Then, all the thoughts of, oh my God, this could have been so much worse.”</p><p class="text | article-text">The 12-volt battery that powers the car’s electronics died without warning.</p><p class="text | article-text">Tesla drivers are supposed to receive three warnings before that happens, but the Tesla service department confirmed that Sanchez didn’t receive any warnings.</p><p class="text | article-text">“When that battery goes, you’re dead in the water,” she said.</p><p class="text | article-text">On Your Side has learned there is a way for drivers to unlock their cars when they’re stuck outside, but it’s a complicated series of time-consuming steps involving wires and battery chargers.</p><p class="text | article-text">But again, many Tesla owners and first responders don’t know about it.</p><p class="text | article-text">“They need to educate the first responders because they had no idea,” Sanchez said. “They were as much in the dark as I was.”</p><p class="text | article-text">Sanchez wants to see Tesla add a better option to get into a car with a dead battery.</p><p class="text | article-text">And while she has been a big supporter of the company, this latest episode has shaken her faith.</p><p class="w-100"></p><p class="text | article-text">“I give Tesla props.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>X (formerly Twitter) is in trouble</strong>: Despite claims that 65% of advertisers have returned, documents show that revenue has actually cratered since Elon Musk took over.</li>
<li><strong>Musk is in damage control mode</strong>: To try to scrounge up much-needed funds, Musk met with executives from major brands like NFL, L'Oreal, Qualcomm, and Target at the Cannes Lions festival.</li>
<li><strong>Musk's past remarks have hurt his chances</strong>: His infamous "go fuck yourself" statement to advertisers last year may have damaged his relationships with them, making it harder to win them back.</li>
<li><strong>Musk is trying to spin his previous comments</strong>: During a recent interview, Musk said he didn't mean all advertisers with his previous statement, but rather specifically those who insist on not appearing next to content they disagree with.</li>
<li><strong>X faces significant financial losses</strong>: The company is hemorrhaging hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter, making it unclear whether Musk's efforts will be enough to turn things around.</li>

The mercurial billionaire reportedly met with executives from the likes of the NFL, L'Oreal, Qualcomm, and Target, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/business/dealbook/musk-advertisers-x-cannes.html" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">new reporting by the <em>NYT</em></a>.</p><p>But whether these measures will help Musk's hate speech-ridden echo chamber from bleeding <a href="https://sherwood.news/business/elon-musk-x-twitter-earnings-loss-venmo-competitor/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> per quarter remains to be seen.</p><p>After all, who could forget that Musk <a href="https://futurism.com/elon-x-twitter-tantrum-stage" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">quite literally told advertisers to go fuck themselves</a> in November — fighting words that likely didn't sit well with the execs he's now pleading to return to X.</p><p>Responding to questions over running his mouth during his DealBook Summit tantrum last year, Musk sheepishly suggested that he didn't mean "advertisers as a whole."</p><p>"Advertisers have a right to appear next to content that they find compatible with their brands," he <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-pitches-advertisers-on-a-return-to-x-months-after-telling-some-to-f-themselves-532d2745" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">told ad giant WPP CEO Mark Read</a> during an interview on Wednesday. "What is not cool is insisting that there can be no content that they disagree with on the platform."</p><p>"I do shoot myself in the foot from time to time, but at least you know it is genuine, not from the PR department," he <a href="https://x.com/benatipsos/status/1803369035733549110" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">admitted</a>.</p><p>As <em>Bloomberg</em>'s latest report shows, Musk's leadership has been disastrous for the platform. Revenue tanked by almost 40 percent in the first half of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The company lost a whopping $456 million in the first quarter of 2023 alone.</p><p>While it's unclear where the company stands in 2024, the documents paint a troubling picture of the company's financials, with Musk repeatedly making headlines for using the platform to <a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-destroyed-top-ai-scientist-yann-lecun" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">further conspiracy theories</a>, go on <a href="https://futurism.com/civil-rights-groups-horrified-elon-musk-racist" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">racist rants</a>, and <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/elon-musk-joe-rogan-harass-vaccine-researcher-twitter" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">spread disinformation</a>.</p><p>In other words, it's not exactly a place where execs are dying to stuff their advertising dollars.</p><p>Case in point, <a href="https://adage.com/article/special-report-cannes-lions/musk-tries-win-back-advertisers-cannes-some-arent-interested/2566071" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">executives told <em>Ad Age</em></a> that they had no interest in listening to Musk and that he had been "antagonistic to causes and social issues that they care about."</p><p>Meanwhile, Musk used the opportunity this week to assure advertisers that AI — what else? — will once again save the day by making ads more relevant to customers.</p><p>"If you’re trying to reach senior decision makers, if you want to reach the most influential people in the world," Musk told Read, "the X platform is by far the best."</p><p>Yet millions of users, particularly in the US, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/fewer-people-using-elon-musks-x-struggles-keep-users-rcna144115" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">continue to flee the platform</a> as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/09/x-twitter-bots-republican-primary-debate-tweets-increase" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">bots</a>, <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/x-crypto-scammers-celebrity-scams/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">scams</a>, and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/musks-x-is-flooded-with-ad-spam-stolen-credit-cards-may-be-key" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out">spam</a> proliferate, largely unchecked.
