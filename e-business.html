        <p>Rating agencies reportedly expect a greater share of the lowest-quality investment-grade bonds to be downgraded than to be upgraded.</p>
<p>That’s the first time this has been the case in this part of the U.S. corporate bond market since the end of 2021, the Financial Times (FT) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fb4216bb-b04e-4615-88a4-7dfffa7c47b1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> Monday (May 27).</p>
<p>The proportion of these bonds that is on “negative watch” is at 5.7%, while the percentage that is on “positive watch” is at 5.3%, according to the report.</p>
<p>In early January, those figures were at 2.9% and 7.9%, respectively, the report said.</p>
<p>The report attributes this shift together “negative watch” to challenges facing certain segments of the American economy as they deal with a combination of slower economic growth and high borrowing costs.</p>
<p>The number of big companies with a large amount of borrowing has also contributed to the change, according to the report.</p>
<p>The shift marks a reversal from last year, when there were far more bonds being upgraded from junk to investment grade than there were bonds moving in the opposite direction, the report said.</p>
<p>Last year’s trend was driven by the U.S. economy remaining strong despite fears of an oncoming recession, per the report.</p>
<p>This report comes at a time when new orders for manufactured durable goods increased by 0.7% in April, signaling a moderate improvement in business spending on equipment even as that investment continues to be constrained by higher <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/business/2024/business-spending-increases-more-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">borrowing costs</a>, a strong dollar and weak global demand.</p>
<p>April’s increase in orders for durable goods followed a 0.8% increase in March and marked the third consecutive month of increases, the U.S. <a href="https://www.census.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Census Bureau</a> reported Friday (May 24).</p>
<p>Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft — a category that is said to signal business spending plans — rose more than was expected by economists polled by Reuters.</p>
<p>At the same time, the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/economy/2024/treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-says-many-americans-concerned-about-high-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high cost</a> of essentials like food, rent and mortgages are weighing on many American consumers, Treasury Secretary <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/janet-yellen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janet Yellen</a> said Thursday (May 23).</p>
<p>Yellen said the price increases have been “substantial,” rapid and noticeable to consumers.</p>
<p>“The cost of living is a problem to a lot of people,” Yellen said. “So, I think this is a concern that people legitimately have.”</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Bill Gross believes Trump's win would be more bearish for bond markets</strong>: Gross, the co-founder of Pimco and known as the "Bond King", thinks that Donald Trump's presidential win would be more bearish for bond markets than Joe Biden's re-election.</li>
<li><strong>Trump's policies would lead to more deficit spending and higher debt</strong>: Gross attributes this to Trump's advocacy of continued tax cuts and more expensive spending habits.</li>
<li><strong>Biden is responsible for trillions of dollars of deficit spending</strong>: Gross notes that Biden's administration has already contributed to massive deficit spending.</li>
<li><strong>Gross' "Total Return" strategy is no longer effective</strong>: Gross believes that the investment strategy he helped create in the late-80s, which involves investing in bonds, is now no longer effective due to the increased deficit and supply of bonds.</li>
<li><strong>Gross prefers alternative investment strategies</strong>: Instead of traditional bonds, Gross recommends investing in preferred securities, contingent capital, and private credit, and up to 20% of the portfolio in private credit.</li>

The mattress is ideal for side sleepers, couples and hot sleepers and at 36% off, you can save hundreds of dollars if you get it during Nectar’s Memorial Day mattress sale. The hybrid model offers a combination of memory foam and individually-wrapped springs for added breathability and support (just keep in mind that the price tag is slightly higher than the memory foam version).</p></div></div></div><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light">
<p class="article_paragraph_7"></p><div class="embed-base finds-module-embed embed-3"><div class="finds-module-wrapper"><div class="finds-module-description"><p>For those on a tighter budget, Nectar’s base memory foam model is a simplified version of the Nectar Premier Copper. The Nectar Memory Foam Mattress is still supportive and cooling, but it costs less than half the price of the Premier Copper, which is why it’s the top recommendation in our <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/best-mattresses-under-1000/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/best-mattresses-under-1000/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/best-mattresses-under-1000/" aria-label="Mattresses Under $1,000">Mattresses Under $1,000</a> list. And during the Nectar mattress sale this Memorial Day weekend, you can get an additional $450 off the usual price. If both foam and springs are what you’re looking for in a bed, consider the hybrid version of this mattress (which is $600 less right now.)</p></div></div></div>





<hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"><div class="embed-base finds-module-embed embed-5"><div class="finds-module-wrapper"><div class="finds-module-description"><p>The Nectar Premier is a Goldilocks mattress that falls right between Nectar’s base model and the Premier Copper in terms of design and features.

Its quilted cover is designed to help wick away moisture and regulate temperature while still providing bounce and support. The design also delivers solid motion isolation—a major perk for those who share a bed with restless partners. Plus, it’s $550 off this Memorial Day weekend. The hybrid version, which combines memory foam and springs, is $700 off.</p></div></div></div><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"> 
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Does Nectar Have Sales Often?</h2>
<p>Yes, Nectar is almost always having a sale—but up to 40% off sitewide for its Memorial Day mattress sale is one of the better discounts we’ve seen from the brand. Nectar’s Flash Sales are typically short-lived, so we suggest shopping today to ensure that you don’t miss your chance to score one of its beds at an impressive discount.</p>

<li>The Justice Department secured an agreement with Arthur Grand Technologies Inc., an information technology services firm, after it posted a job ad seeking only US-born citizens who were white and local to Dallas, TX.</li>

<li>The investigation found that an employee from the company's Indian subsidiary posted the ad, which violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and Executive Order 11246, which prohibits federal contractors from discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.</li>
<li>As part of the settlement with the Justice Department, Arthur Grand will pay a civil penalty of $7,500, implement comprehensive training for its staff on INA compliance, revise its employment policies, and undergo ongoing monitoring.</li>

"Housing costs are another place where people are experiencing this financial squeeze."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In recent months, the White House has tried to address concerns about affordability head on, offering proposals such as rules to limit closing costs and a $10,000 tax credit for first time homebuyers.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It marks a shift in tone, after years of focusing on the economy's strengths, including low unemployment. But with few immediate levers for Mr Biden to pull, it's not clear the efforts are resonating. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">His support has especially eroded among younger people - whose record turnout in 2020 helped put him in office. Voters in this demographic are least likely to own homes and most likely to see housing affordability as a top concern. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"I don't see any platform that purposely looks out for somebody like first-time homebuyers, wanting to ease their pain," says Braiden Dogherty, a 30-year-old from Florida who works in manufacturing and has been checking for houses daily for three years. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Despite a $50,000 inheritance, no debt, and decent jobs, he and his wife can't find an affordable two-bedroom near their families in the Orlando area.  </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He says the problem of housing costs is too big to blame on any one politician or party, but the seeming lack of solutions has contributed to his wider political disillusionment. He is uncertain how he will vote in November.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"I'm fed up," he says. "Housing is part of it."</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The growing outcry has raised pressure on the US central bank to cut interest rates to bring relief, a move Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell has said is likely at some point.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But expectations that a cut would happen early this year, helping to improve the country's mood, have been steadily pushed back. This reflects concerns that progress in lowering inflation - which was hovering at 3.4% in April, still well above the bank's 2% target - could be stalling.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dOZXmm"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-fd6cb93-1 hXQtlW"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/078c/live/87bcf0d0-19e0-11ef-88f3-ff134a9c98ae.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/078c/live/87bcf0d0-19e0-11ef-88f3-ff134a9c98ae.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/078c/live/87bcf0d0-19e0-11ef-88f3-ff134a9c98ae.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/078c/live/87bcf0d0-19e0-11ef-88f3-ff134a9c98ae.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/078c/live/87bcf0d0-19e0-11ef-88f3-ff134a9c98ae.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/078c/live/87bcf0d0-19e0-11ef-88f3-ff134a9c98ae.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/078c/live/87bcf0d0-19e0-11ef-88f3-ff134a9c98ae.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/078c/live/87bcf0d0-19e0-11ef-88f3-ff134a9c98ae.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Julia Mokhnatkiina (JM Photos Inc) Mimi Than and her husband on a busy street" class="sc-fd6cb93-0 hvRJnO"><span class="sc-fd6cb93-2 iuQLaK">Julia Mokhnatkiina (JM Photos Inc)</span></div></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Mimi Than and her husband are among those affected by the rise in interest rates this year</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Instead, since January mortgage rates have mostly moved higher. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mimi Than, a 29-year-old who recently bought a three-bedroom condo in the Boston, Massachusetts area, says she is facing roughly $200 more in monthly costs than when she and her husband were pre-approved for a loan in March. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">They did not lock in the rate then, unaware borrowing costs might shift significantly.

<li><strong>President Biden wants to increase the sale of electric vehicles (EVs) in the US</strong>: He wants to reduce the country's reliance on gasoline-powered cars and trucks, and is pushing for stricter emissions regulations and subsidies to encourage the adoption of EVs.</li>
<li><strong>Electric vehicles are currently too expensive for many Americans</strong>: The average price of an electric vehicle in the US is over $53,000, making them unaffordable for many consumers. However, there are cheaper options available in other countries.</li>
<li><strong>Cheaper electric vehicles are available in other countries</strong>: In Europe, for example, there are electric vehicles available for as little as $10,000. These vehicles are made in China and are proving very popular.</li>
<li><strong>The US administration is blocking imports of these cheaper vehicles</strong>: Despite the potential benefits of lower car prices, the Biden administration is refusing to allow these cheaper electric vehicles to be imported into the US, citing concerns about Chinese exports and trade tariffs.</li>
<li><strong>The decision is seen as a blow to voters amid rising inflation concerns</strong>: The administration's decision not to allow cheaper electric vehicles to be imported is seen as a missed opportunity to address the issue of high car prices and rising inflation concerns among voters, particularly ahead of the presidential election.</li>

They're delaying purchases, focusing on store brands compared to typically more expensive national brands, and looking for deals.</p><p>“Retailers recognize that unless they pull out some stops on pricing, they are going to have difficulty holding on to the customers they got," Neil Saunders, managing director of consulting and data analysis firm GlobalData, said. “The consumer really has had enough of inflation, and they’re starting to take action in terms of where they shop, how they shop, the amount they buy.”</p><p>While discounts are an everyday tool in retail, Saunders said these aggressive price cuts that cover thousands of items announced by a number of retailers represent a “major shift” in recent strategy. He noted most companies talked about price increases in the past two or three years, and the cut mark the first big “price war” since before inflation started taking hold.</p><p><strong>WHERE CAN SHOPPERS FIND LOWER PRICES?</strong></p><p>Higher-income shoppers looking to save money have helped <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://apnews.com/article/walmart-firstquarter-earnings-inflation-economy-2dc446f6df16aa8c1cfc76df81a9ae1f" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Walmart;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="0">Walmart</a> maintain strong sales in recent quarters. But earlier this month, the nation’s largest retailer expanded its price rollbacks — temporary discounts that can last a few months — to nearly 7,000 grocery items, a 45% increase. Items include a 28-ounce can of Bush's baked beans marked down to $2.22, from $2.48, and a 24-pack of 12-ounce Diet Coke priced at $12.78 from $14.28.</p><p>Company executives said the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer is seeing more people <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://apnews.com/article/walmart-bettergoods-inflation-chef-inspired-store-label-80e8f75d766b17892a70409b305de714" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eating at home;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="0">eating at home</a> versus eating out.

The initiative primarily applies to food, beverage and essential household items. For example, Clorox scented wipes that previously cost $5.79 are on shelves for $4.99. Huggies Baby Wipes, which were priced at $1.19, now cost 99 cents.</p><p>Low-cost <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://apnews.com/article/aldi-grocery-inflation-prices-8d4a0afdf28db2766afeb209eea568a5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:supermarket chain Aldi;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="0">supermarket chain Aldi</a> said earlier this month that it was cutting prices on 250 products, including favorites for barbecues and picnics, as part of a promotion set to last through Labor Day.</p><p>McDonald’s plans to introduce <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://apnews.com/article/mcdonalds-value-meal-deal-bda434c5a939b610a9c1fc09446a38d1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a limited-time $5 meal;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="0">a limited-time $5 meal</a> deal in the U.S. next month to counter slowing sales and customers’ <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://apnews.com/article/mcdonalds-boycott-earnings-75770857e452fab4032042c492fcc733" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:frustration with high prices;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="0">frustration with high prices</a>.</p><p>Arko Corp., a large operator of convenience stores in rural areas and small towns, is launching its most aggressive deals in terms of their depth in roughly 20 years for both members of its free loyalty program and other customers, according to Arie Kotler, the company's chairman, president and CEO. For example, members of Arko's free loyalty program who buy two 12-packs of Pepsi beverages get a free pizza. The promotions kicked off May 15 and are due to end Sept. 3.</p><p>Kotler said he focused on essential items that people use to feed their families after observing that the cumulative effects of higher gas prices and inflation in other areas had customers hold back compared to a year ago.</p><p>“Over the past two quarters, we have seen the trend of consumers cutting back, consumers coming less often, and consumers reducing their purchases,” he said.</p><p>In the non-food category, crafts chain Michaels last month reduced prices of frequently purchased items like paint, markers and artist canvases. The price reductions ranged from 15% to up to 40%. Michaels said the cuts are intended to be permanent.</p><p><strong>DO THESE CUTS BRING PRICES BACK TO PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS?</strong></p><p>Many retailers said their goal was to offer some relief for shoppers. But Michaels said its new discounts brought prices for some things down to where they were in 2019.</p><p>“Our intention with these cuts is to ensure we’re delivering value to the customer," The Michaels Companies said. ”We see it as an investment in customer loyalty more than anything else."</p><p>Target said it was difficult to compare what its price-reduced products cost now to a specific time frame since inflation levels are different for each item and the reductions varied by item.</p><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks consumer prices, said the average price of a two-liter bottle of soda in April was $2.27. That compares with $1.53 in the same month five years ago. A pound of white bread cost an average of $2 last month but $1.29 in April 2019. One pound of ground chuck that averaged $5.28 in April cost $3.91 five years ago.</p><p><strong>WHY ARE COMPANIES CUTTING PRICES ON SOME ITEMS?</strong></p><p><a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://apnews.com/article/consumer-confidence-conference-board-economy-spending-64cc1645a4b0e07fbf446f673c7ba2c8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:U.S. consumer confidence;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="0">U.S. consumer confidence</a> deteriorated for the third straight month in April as Americans continued to fret about their short-term financial futures, according to the latest report released late last month from the Conference Board, a business research group.</p><p>With shoppers focusing more on bargains, particularly online, retailers are trying to get customers back to their stores. Target this month posted its fourth consecutive quarterly decline in comparable sales — those from stores or digital channels operating at least 12 months.</p><p>In fact, the share of online sales for the cheapest items across many categories, including clothing, groceries, personal care and appliances, increased from April 2019 to the same month this year, according to Adobe Analytics, which covers more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites.</p><p>For example, the market share for the cheapest groceries went from 38% in April 2019 to 48% last month, while the share for the most expensive groceries went down from 22% to 9% over the same time period, according to Adobe.</p><p><strong>HOW ARE RETAILERS FUNDING PRICE CUTS?</strong></p><p>GlobalData's Saunders said he thinks companies are subsidizing price cuts with a variety of methods — at the expense of profits, at the cost of suppliers and vendors, or by reducing expenses. Some retailers may be using a combination of all three, he said.</p><p>Saunders doesn't think retailers are raising prices on other items to make up for the ones they lowered since doing that would bring a backlash from customers.</p><p>Target declined to disclose details but said its summer price promotion was incorporated into the company's projected profit range, which falls below analysts' expectations at the low end.</p><p><a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgpminvestments.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CADInnocenzio%40ap.org%7Cb04217d535c5459f38be08dc7b491bbc%7Ce442e1abfd6b4ba3abf3b020eb50df37%7C1%7C0%7C638520801140022132%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=9QLcShV3ytmleiOWelwRzO04c5AvoisdxKpEgdsPn5A%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GPM Investments, LLC;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="0">GPM Investments, LLC</a>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arkocorp.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CADInnocenzio%40ap.org%7Cb04217d535c5459f38be08dc7b491bbc%7Ce442e1abfd6b4ba3abf3b020eb50df37%7C1%7C0%7C638520801140047923%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=Ctm%2FboIN9Y0OAkbRVziGPGt7hvKeaS%2BJdXEHdJn%2BuLA%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ARKO Corp.;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="0">ARKO Corp.</a> said its suppliers are funding the convenience store promotions.</p></div></div>
