annual shareholders meeting Thursday, Chris Ailman, chief investment officer of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, known as CalSTRS, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/10/california-pension-fund-opposes-teslas-ridiculous-elon-musk-pay-package.html" data-link-name="in body link">told CNBC</a> that he would cast a “no” vote.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Even if these cars had AI in them, they are not worth 60-times earnings,” Ailman said Monday. “That is absurd.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The California pension fund has about 4.7m shares of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tesla" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Tesla</a> and manages a total of $333bn in assets.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The shareholder vote is over Musk’s $56bn compensation package that was established by the company’s board, and backed by shareholders, in 2018. CalSTRS voted against the deal then, too.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">At the time, the board said Musk would get the payout if Tesla met revenue, profit and share price targets. The company would ultimately meet all targets in 2022.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">But back in January, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/30/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package-too-much-judge-rules" data-link-name="in body link">ruled</a> in favor of a Tesla shareholder who argued that the company’s board inappropriately set the pay package. The judge agreed Musk’s pay package was unnecessary in keeping Musk dedicated to Tesla, an argument that company officers made during the trial.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Swept up by the rhetoric of ‘all upside’, or perhaps starry-eyed by Musk’s superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8bn question: was the plan ever necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals,” McCormick wrote in her decision.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">While the shareholder vote is over the compensation package, it’s also largely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/08/tesla-leads-charge-to-defend-elon-musks-56bn-pay-package" data-link-name="in body link">being seen</a> as a referendum on Musk’s leadership of the company.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Some<strong> </strong>shareholders have thrown their weight behind Musk. “Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla,” the billionaire investor Ron Baron <a href="https://www.baronfunds.com/sites/default/files/baron-capital-tesla-elon-musk-compensation-6.5.2024.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">said</a> last week.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">But others argue that Musk’s sights have turned elsewhere. Musk stirred controversy in 2022 when he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal" data-link-name="in body link">purchased</a> Twitter for $44bn and renamed it X. He sold $22.9bn of his Tesla shares to finance the purchase. Musk is also leading SpaceX, which is trying to achieve his goal of getting humans to Mars.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“He needs to focus in on, either on cars, either on X, or on going to Mars,” Ailman said. “And I think his heart really is in going to Mars.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">CalSTRs joins Norway’s $1.7tn sovereign wealth <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/norway-wealth-fund-vote-against-musks-56-bln-tesla-pay-package-2024-06-08/" data-link-name="in body link">fund</a>, Tesla’s eighth-largest shareholder, in its plan to vote against the pay package.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The Norwegian fund said that, while Musk’s leadership has generated “significant value”, the fund is still “concerned about the total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution and lack of mitigation of key person risk”.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">On Thursday, as Tesla worked to shore up support, Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1800537041022898430" data-link-name="in body link">retweeted</a> a message from the company<strong> </strong>urging shareholders to vote in favor of his pay deal. “Please take a moment to vote,” he said.</p></div></div>

<li><strong>Roaring Kitty, aka Keith Gill, lost a combined $51.5 million</strong> (=$17 million in GameStop shares + $34.5 million in derivatives) after a surprise share issuance by GameStop, which caused the company's stock price to plummet 40%.</li>

<li><strong>Gill takes the loss in stride</strong>: Despite the losses, he appeared to take the loss with humor, posting a tongue-in-cheek message on Twitter (formerly X) about being a former billionaire.</li>
<li><strong>Gill is a prominent figure in the WallStreetBets community</strong>: He is known for his aggressive bets on GameStop and other meme stocks, and his losses are widely followed in the online investing community.</li>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Retail investors can’t buy Raspberry Pi shares just yet, as only certain institutional shareholders can trade the company’s shares right now. Retail investors will be able to buy and sell shares starting on Friday.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This listing is also a win for the London stock market. Deliveroo and Wise both trade in London, but many U.K. tech companies choose to go public in the U.S., as the stock markets there are more liquid.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Raspberry Pi is mostly known for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/raspberry-pi-5/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/raspberry-pi-5/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="3" mrfobservableid="0410f000-b891-4846-a03d-06763d7dc790">tiny computers</a> that can be programmed to perform all sorts of tasks without spending too much money and requiring too much power. These ARM-based computers became particularly popular among tech hobbyists who wanted to create media servers, retro game consoles, interactive dashboards, robotics projects and more.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">More recently, many industrial companies have started integrating the Raspberry Pi in their devices and facilities. The company <a href="https://investors.raspberrypi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-mrf-link="https://investors.raspberrypi.com/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="1" mrfobservableid="36d961e7-9a03-411f-b211-c4d4c55cc86d">reports</a> that the industrial and embedded segment represents 72% of its sales.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Raspberry Pi has sold 60 million units since its inception. In 2023 alone, Raspberry Pi generated $266 million in revenue and $66 million in gross profit.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Other strategic shareholders in the company include ARM and Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation, a subsidiary of Sony that makes image sensors for smartphones and other components.

	Redstone, Paramount Global’s controlling shareholder through National Amusements Inc., is instead looking to pursue deals with parties interested in acquiring NAI, which owns 77% of the voting shares in Paramount, per the Journal.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	A rep for Skydance Media declined to comment. An NAI spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.  </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Redstone, daughter of late media mogul Sumner Redstone, and Ellison, son of Oracle founder and megabillionaire Larry Ellison, were ultimately unable to reach an agreement on the terms of a complex transaction that would have turned over control of Paramount Global to Skydance and its private-equity partners, RedBird Capital Partners and KKR.

	</p>




<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Amid the chaos and uncertainty over the bid by Skydance and its team, others have emerged to potentially scope out an acquisition of National Amusements alone (instead of trying to construct a deal that also comprises Paramount Global). Those include <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-edgar-bronfman-bain-capital-bid-shari-redstone-national-amusements-1236031916/">Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Bain Capital</a>, which are considering a bid of up to $2.5 billion for NAI, as well as producer and filmmaker Steven Paul, who was behind the “Baby Geniuses” movie franchise.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Could Redstone decide that Paramount Global can go it alone? </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	At Paramount Global’s shareholder meeting on June 4, the three execs running the company in the newly established Office of the CEO — George Cheeks, president and CEO of CBS; Chris McCarthy, president and CEO, Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks; and <a href="https://variety.com/t/brian-robbins/">Brian Robbins</a>, president and Chief Executive Officer of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon — presented a strategy for the company that didn’t envision a new owner. The trio spoke about <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-shareholders-meeting-2024-skydance-deal-1236023661/">how they plan to cut upwards of $500 million in costs</a> annually through layoffs and other cost-reduction measures, pursue a joint venture with Paramount+ and potentially sell some assets.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	On Monday, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-cheeks-robbins-mccarthy-change-in-control-severance-benefits-cash-bonuses-1236032752/">Paramount extended change-in-control severance benefits to Cheeks, McCarthy and Robbins</a> that kick in if the company transacts a sale or merger, and also granted the three co-CEOs bonuses for the time during which they serve in the office. Redstone <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-global-bob-bakish-ousted-ceo-1235984730/">outsted former CEO Bob Bakish on April 30</a>, reportedly over Bakish’s clash with Redstone over pursuing the deal with Skydance.

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Skydance’s last offer <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-skydance-agree-merger-shari-redstone-approval-1236023450/">was approved by Paramount Global’s special committee</a> established to evaluate M&amp;A offers earlier this month, and it was submitted to Redstone for consideration last weekend. Under those proposed terms, the Skydance consortium would have paid Redstone about $2 billion for NAI and current Paramount Class B shareholders (who do not have voting rights) would have been offered to cash in nearly half their shares for $15 per share. The Skydance group also would have paid $1.5 billion in cash to help pay down Paramount’s debt. After the merger of Paramount Global and Skydance, the Skydance consortium would have owned about two-thirds of the shares in Paramount as a public company.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Meanwhile, Sony Pictures and private-equity firm Apollo Global Management emerged as joint bidders for Paramount Global, floating an <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/sony-apollo-paramount-global-acquisition-offer-cash-1235981220/">offer of $26 billion</a> (including assumption of debt) last month. However, Sony and Apollo have since backed away from pursuing a deal for Paramount in its entirety.</p>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Gas prices are once again on the decline across the U.S., bringing some relief to drivers now paying a little less to fill up their tanks.</p><p>The national average for gas prices on Monday stood around $3.44, according to AAA. That’s down about 9 cents from a week ago — marking the largest one-week drop recorded by the motor club so far in 2024. Monday’s average was also more than 19 cents less than it was a month ago and over 14 cents below the level seen this time last year.</p><p>Why the recent fall in prices at the pump? Industry analysts point to a blend of lackluster demand and strong supply — as well as relatively mild oil prices worldwide.</p><p>Here’s a rundown of what you need to know.</p><h2>Today’s falling gas prices, explained.</h2><p>There are a few factors contributing to today’s falling gas prices. For starters, fewer people may be hitting the road.</p><p>“Demand is just kind of shallow,” AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said, pointing to trends seen last year and potential lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Traditionally — pre-pandemic — after Memorial Day, demand would start to pick up in the summertime. And we just don’t see it anymore.”</p>
    

<p>Last week, data from the Energy Information Administration showed that U.S. gasoline demand slipped to about 8.94 million barrels a day. That might still sound like a lot — but before the pandemic, consumption could reach closer to the 10 million barrel-a-day range at this time of year, Gross noted.</p>



<p>Beyond pandemic-specific impacts, experts note that high gas prices seen following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and persistent inflation may have led many Americans to modify their driving habits. Other contributing factors could be the increased number of fuel-efficient cars, as well as electric vehicles, on the road today, Gross said.</p>
    
<p>Some of this is still seasonal. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, noted that gas prices typically ease in early summer because of refinery capacity. At this time of year, he said, many factors boosting prices in late winter and early spring — particularly refinery maintenance — are no longer present.</p>
    

<p>“Once refinery maintenance is done, output or utilization of the nation’s refineries goes up — and that contributes to rising supply,” De Haan said. And that stronger supply, paired with weaker consumption, has led to a “bit more noticeable” decline in prices this year. He added that U.S. refinery utilization is at some of its highest levels since the pandemic.</p><p>Separately, the Biden administration announced last month that it would be <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gas-prices-biden-northeast-reserve-6fa669ef3c963d212852513e4b312060">releasing 1 million gasoline barrels</a></span>, or about 42 million gallons, from a Northeast reserve with an aim of lowering prices at the pump this summer. But De Haan noted that such action has little impact nationally — 42 million gallons equals less than three hours of U.S. daily gas consumption.</p><p>“Really, what we’re seeing right now with (declining) gasoline prices ... has been driven primarily by seasonal and predictable economics,” he said. </p>
    
<h2>What about oil prices?</h2><p>Experts also point to cooling oil costs. Prices at the pump are highly dependent <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/commodities-gold-silver-oil-gas-dollar-01d127a20628b3b5166d4ef66aca3149">on crude oil</a></span>, which is the main ingredient in gasoline. </p>
    

<p>West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, has stayed in the mid $70s a barrel over recent weeks — closing at under $78 a barrel Monday. That’s “not a bad place for it to be,” Gross said, noting that the cost of crude typically needs to go above $80 to put more pressure on pump prices.</p><p>Oil prices can be volatile and hard to predict because they’re subject to many global forces. That includes production cuts from OPEC and allied oil producing countries, which have <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gas-prices-rising-heat-wave-production-cuts-4cecfbe2ee68eccab7224f163fc676db">previously contributed to rising energy prices</a></span>.</p><p>OPEC+ recently announced plans to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/opec-oil-prices-saudi-arabia-e806f1609df71b5bef4ee6c9b5199df0">extend three different sets of cuts</a></span> totaling 5.8 million barrels a day — but the alliance also put a timetable on restoring some production, “which is likely why the price of oil had somewhat of a bearish reaction,” De Haan said.</p><h2>Could prices go back up?</h2><p>The future is never promised. But, if there are no major unexpected interruptions, both Gross and De Haan say that prices could keep working their way down.</p>
    

<p>At this time of year, experts keep a particular eye out for hurricane risks — which can cause significant damage and lead refineries to power down.</p><p>“Prices move on fear,” Gross said. In the U.S., he added, concern particularly rises once a hurricane enters the Gulf of Mexico — and even if it doesn’t eventually make landfall, refineries may pull back on operations out of caution. Impacts can also range by region.</p><p>But barring the unexpected, analysts like De Haan expect the national average to stay in the range of $3.35 to $3.70 per gallon this summer. Gas prices typically drop even more in the fall, and it’s possible that we could see the national average below $3 in late October or early November, he said.</p><h2>What states have the lowest gas prices today?</h2><p>While gas prices nationwide are collectively falling, some states always have cheaper averages than others, due to factors ranging from nearby refinery supply to local fuel requirements.</p>
    

<p>As of Monday, per AAA data, Mississippi had the lowest average gas price at about $2.94 per gallon — followed by $2.95 Oklahoma and just under $2.97 in Arkansas.</p><p>Meanwhile, California, Hawaii and Washington had the highest average prices on Monday — at about $4.93, $4.75 and $4.41 per gallon, respectively.</p><h2>____</h2><p>This story has been corrected to note that U.S. gasoline demand has slipped to about 8.94 million barrels a day, not billion.</p>

<p>Apple’s efforts to narrow its artificial intelligence gap with rivals by partnering with OpenAI did little to move Wall Street. The iPhone maker’s stock price fell about 2% in Monday after-hours trading.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p class="article_paragraph_2"></p>
<p>Tuesday morning, investors changed their mind — sending Apple stock up 6% to $205 a share, reported <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/06/11/apple-stock-hits-all-time-high-on-ai-iphone-optimism-crosses-200-per-share/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/06/11/apple-stock-hits-all-time-high-on-ai-iphone-optimism-crosses-200-per-share/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/06/11/apple-stock-hits-all-time-high-on-ai-iphone-optimism-crosses-200-per-share/" aria-label="Forbes"><em data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/06/11/apple-stock-hits-all-time-high-on-ai-iphone-optimism-crosses-200-per-share/">Forbes</em></a>.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p>“Apple Intelligence” — the term repeated about 60 times at Apple’s June 10 Worldwide Developers Conference, according to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/apple-intelligence-ios-18-macos-sequoia-ai-b08bb299?mod=hp_lead_pos7" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/apple-intelligence-ios-18-macos-sequoia-ai-b08bb299?mod=hp_lead_pos7" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/apple-intelligence-ios-18-macos-sequoia-ai-b08bb299?mod=hp_lead_pos7" aria-label="Wall Street Journal"><em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/apple-intelligence-ios-18-macos-sequoia-ai-b08bb299?mod=hp_lead_pos7">Wall Street Journal</em></a> — features a partnership with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. It aims to breath new life into Siri, Apple’s aging voice assistant.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>

<p>Apple’s deal with OpenAI has enraged Elon Musk, who threatened to ban Apple devices from his companies — namely Tesla, SpaceX, and X. Why? On June 10 Musk called the Apple/OpenAI deal “an unacceptable security violation,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/10/elon-musk-to-ban-apple-devices-from-his-companies-over-openai-deal.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/10/elon-musk-to-ban-apple-devices-from-his-companies-over-openai-deal.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/10/elon-musk-to-ban-apple-devices-from-his-companies-over-openai-deal.html" aria-label="CNBC"><em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/10/elon-musk-to-ban-apple-devices-from-his-companies-over-openai-deal.html">CNBC</em></a><em> </em>reported.</p>

<p>Apple sees good times ahead. “We think Apple Intelligence is going to be indispensable to the products that already play such an integral role in our lives,” CEO Tim Cook said in his presentation, the <em>Journal</em> noted.</p>

<p>Apple — which suffered a 4.3% revenue decline in the March 2024-ending quarter — needs new growth to revive its stock. Investors are not convinced the announcement will supply the needed revenue. Many analysts see the OpenAI deal as further reducing iPhone demand.</p>






<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">What Is Apple Intelligence?</h2>
<p>Apple Intelligence aims to add generative AI technology to billions of iPhones.

 <li>Proofread and suggest what users write in emails, notes or text;</li>
 <li>Prioritize messages and notifications;</li>
 <li>Answer user questions, create images and write software code;</li>
 <li>Check whether a rescheduled meeting would overlap with a user’s family commitments;</li>
 <li>Summarize audio recordings;</li>
 <li>Enable users to create movies from photos by writing a description;</li>
 <li>Clean up photos by taking out distracting background images;</li>
 <li>Reduce hacking risk by processing user requests on the iPhone rather than at a data center;</li>
 <li>Operate the service on an Apple-controlled cloud service using Apple semiconductors; and</li>
 <li>Divert user requests Apple can’t handle to ChatGPT.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Apple will also revive the languishing Siri. The voice assistant fails to recognize “various requests” and is unable to converse because it follows each individual command, the <em>Times</em> wrote.</p>
<p>Siri will remember the context of a user’s request and repurpose information in an image for a text application, Apple said. For example, “If someone asks for the weather in Muir Woods National Monument and later asks to schedule a hike there, Siri will now know that the hike it is scheduling is in Muir Woods,” the <em>Times </em>reported.</p>
<p>Siri will also help people fill out forms faster. How so? The assistant will find “an image of a user’s driver’s license” and extract the information to fill it out a form on the user’s behalf, the <em>Times</em> wrote.</p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Big Tech Partnerships Aim To Avoid Generative AI Disruption</h2>
<p>Apple’s buzzy deal with OpenAI highlights the difference between the dot-com and generative AI booms.</p>
<p>During the dot-com boom — when <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2024/03/01/why-generative-ai-stock-bubble-is-not-poised-to-pop/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2024/03/01/why-generative-ai-stock-bubble-is-not-poised-to-pop/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2024/03/01/why-generative-ai-stock-bubble-is-not-poised-to-pop/" aria-label="2,888">2,888</a> companies went public — startups were disrupting incumbents. Since November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, there have been no generative-AI related IPOs, according to my new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brain-Rush-Invest-Compete-Generative/dp/B0CVRSV43C" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.amazon.com/Brain-Rush-Invest-Compete-Generative/dp/B0CVRSV43C" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.amazon.com/Brain-Rush-Invest-Compete-Generative/dp/B0CVRSV43C" aria-label="Brain Rush: How to Invest and Compete in the Real World of Generative AI"><em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.amazon.com/Brain-Rush-Invest-Compete-Generative/dp/B0CVRSV43C">Brain Rush: How to Invest and Compete in the Real World of Generative AI</em></a>.</p>
<p>Instead, incumbents are partnering with each other to keep from falling behind — and hoping to add incremental revenue.</p>
<p>Partnerships are generally full of risk. Their success depends on a strong mutual dependency and the right division of investment, revenue, operating costs, and activities.</p>
<p>OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft seems to be working well now. Yet, most of Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2023/openai-has-received-just-a-fraction-of-microsofts-10-billion-investment" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2023/openai-has-received-just-a-fraction-of-microsofts-10-billion-investment" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2023/openai-has-received-just-a-fraction-of-microsofts-10-billion-investment" aria-label="$13 billion investment">$13 billion investment</a> pays for the software giant’s cloud services to train and operate ChatGPT, noted <em>Semafor. </em></p>
<p>Because OpenAI is so dependent on Microsoft, the two companies could ultimately go their separate ways as the ChatGPT provider becomes more self-sustaining.</p>
<p>While the financial terms of Apple’s partnership with OpenAI are unclear, the collaboration seems to favor OpenAI over Apple. How so? Open AI will get access to 2.2 billion handheld devices from Apple, the <em>Journal</em> reported.</p>
<p>OpenAI could monetize this by sharing revenue — such as the $20 per month the company charges for subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus, <em>Techopedia</em> reported.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple is not bringing much new to this party. The iPhone is a 17-year-old product whose revenues fell 10% in the first quarter of 2024, according to the company.</p>
<p>Upgrading Siri slightly does not strike me as a reason for users to go out and buy new Apple devices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Musk could cost Apple future device revenues. After all, he has 171,000 employees, according to <em>Nova Riche</em>, and 186 million followers on X, <em>Exploding Topics </em>reported.</p>
<p>Musk’s rage at the Apple/Open AI collaboration prompted him to threaten to ban Apple devices from his companies. If Apple “integrates OpenAI at the OS level,” Musk will forbid Apple devices, <em>CNBC</em> reported.</p>
<p>Apple countered Musk by saying its own AI is the default and OpenAI is an optional feature. In response to a post from Cook, Musk said he would bar Apple devices unless Cook decides to “stop this creepy spyware,” <em>CNBC</em> noted.</p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Will Apple Intelligence Accelerate Apple’s Revenues?</h2>
<p>Analysts have expressed mixed views about whether Apple’s announcements will result in faster revenue growth.</p>
<p>One analyst sees Apple Intelligence as hugely significant. “This is the biggest event for investors since the iPhone because they have to infuse A.I. into their products to thrive,” Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told the <em>Times</em>.</p>
<p>“Today was about showing that they will make A.I. a core competency and that they can deliver an A.I. experience that consumers want,” Munster added.</p>
<p>Other analysts see the new technology encouraging users to hold on to their existing devices for longer — thus crimping Apple’s revenues.</p>
<p>“We will all get new iPhones at some point in the future, but we believe consumers will hold onto their devices longer to save money given the lack of compelling features,” analysts at KeyBanc said in a note to clients featured in an <em>Investing.com</em> report.</p>
<p>Another analyst expects the OpenAI partnership to slow Apple’s revenues. The deal could be “revenue dilutive initially,” Bernstein analysts said, according to <em>Investing.com</em>. Revenue sharing could eat away at Apple's top-line returns given “some possible migration from traditional search queries,” Bernstein added.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence is bad news for iPhone revenue and the company’s stock price, according to a fourth analyst. “The lack of a game changing AI product intro/software suite is likely a negative for [near-term] iPhone demand as well as investor sentiment,” analysts at UBS said, according to <em>Investing.com</em>.</p>
<p>Apple’s stock has lagged rivals who have capitalized on generative AI. Since November 2022, Nvidia stock has risen 770% while Microsoft shares increased 93%. This compares unfavorably to Apple’s relatively slow 48% gain in market value since then.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Tuesday’s gains, Apple Intelligence is not a reason to buy the company’s shares.</p>

<li>
<p>Despite its dominance for 80 years, the US dollar's position as the central pillar of the world economy has been predicted to decline numerous times, but these predictions have consistently been wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current situation is not about a crisis or event knocking the dollar off its pedestal, but rather about other countries pushing the boundaries of the financial system and seeking greater financial autonomy within the dollar-based system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dollar's position is still strong, with the US economy being the world's largest, having the deepest capital markets and most trusted financial institutions, and the dollar remaining a financial safe haven and reliable medium of exchange and store of value globally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over the past few decades, various events and developments have been cited as signs of the dollar's decline, but these have all been incorrect, including the introduction of the euro, the global financial crisis, the rise of China, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the author, the future of the dollar is likely to be one of gradual evolution, rather than revolution, with countries continuing to test the limits of their financial autonomy within the dollar-based system, rather than making a concerted effort to change the system fundamentally.</p>

						<p>It has been 80 years since the Bretton Woods Conference, when the U.S. dollar became the central pillar of the world economy and of U.S. economic statecraft. And for eight decades, we’ve also witnessed predictions about the dollar’s coming demise. But almost from the beginning, the debate about the future of the dollar has missed the mark. The question isn’t about whether an event or a crisis or a new technology will knock the dollar off its pedestal. Rather, it is about how the United States’ competitors, and even partners, are pushing the boundaries of the financial system in a global economy where the dollar still dominates but the post-Cold War consensus is breaking down.</p>
<p>For decades, any number of events reportedly portended the end of the dollar. When U.S. President Richard Nixon delinked the dollar from gold in 1971, a prominent British <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-08-15/niall-ferguson-nixon-the-gold-standard-and-a-bitcoin-bonanza" target="">journalist</a> declared it the “moment of the formal dethronement of the Almighty Dollar.” Some saw the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/207504/CASE_FINAL%20online.pdf" target="">euro’s introduction</a> in the 1990s as the moment for the dollar’s demise. The global financial crisis and the rise of China in the 2010s led many <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1928138" target="">economists</a> to predict that the yuan could become the world’s reserve currency. Finally, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and Western-led sanctions against Moscow raised questions about a coming “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/989b2e50-e8b5-474c-86a3-190c6881b235" target="">post-dollar world</a>.”</p>
    
    
<p>There are real geoeconomic headwinds to the dollar. Countries are working to become less reliant on the dollar for trade and to distance themselves from U.S. payment systems. But the future isn’t a binary between dollar dominance and so-called de-dollarization. The U.S. economy remains the world’s largest, with the deepest capital markets and most trusted financial institutions. The dollar remains a financial safe haven and the most reliable medium of exchange and store of value, not just for the United States but globally. The networks and history that earned the dollar its position eight decades ago are holding, and the growing frustration with the dominance of the dollar obfuscates some of the conveniences as well. What has changed is that the United States’ competitors—and some partners—are pushing the limits of their financial autonomy within the dollar-based system, emboldened by technological advances and geoeconomic revisionism. But we are far from an inflection point where we see any concerted effort to actually change it.</p>
<p>If the dollar’s position were to change, it would come from evolution, not revolution. More countries will test and deploy measures to limit the dollar’s reach. Emerging financial technologies will catalyze new theories of change and a range of multilateral financial arrangements. Meanwhile, Western policymakers and business leaders will have to protect the dollar’s historic position even as the U.S. economy takes on larger amounts of debt in a less stable world. But the dollar will continue to underpin the global economy for the foreseeable future.</p>

<div class="bolded-first-line">
<p>There has never been a currency quite like the U.S. dollar. Historians analogize to the Spanish Empire’s pieces of eight, Dutch guilders, or the U.K. pound sterling, which was the leading reserve currency until the <a href="http://emlab.berkeley.edu/~eichengr/rise_fall_dollar_temin.pdf" target="">1920s</a>. But, as economist Michael Pettis <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/high-price-dollar-dominance" target="">points out</a>, the dollar is “the only currency ever to have played such a pivotal role in international commerce.” The dollar <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/geoeconomics-center/dollar-dominance-monitor/" target="">accounts</a> for 58 percent of foreign reserve holdings worldwide. It is involved in 88 percent of all foreign exchange transactions. Due to its international footprint, other countries’ trade imbalances are offset by imbalances in the United States.</p>
</div>
<p>The dollar provides stability and safety to countries and consumers globally, not just to the United States. It is a trusted asset because of the United States’ open markets, rule of law, trusted institutions, and deep, liquid capital markets. Beyond the United States, there is a limited supply of investment-grade assets. But the dollar isn’t without its discontents. In the last few years, a growing number of world leaders have publicly stated that they intend to knock the dollar off its pedestal. They see a divided world, the rise of financial technologies that increase the efficiency of trading with currencies other than the dollar, and a divided United States with an uncertain fiscal position and an ever-increasing list of countries and entities with which it is in economic confrontation—and they are publicly positioning themselves to take advantage.</p><p id="adPlaceholder-0" class="in-article-dynamic-ad" aria-hidden="true"></p>
<p>In a world with more conflict and competition, talk of de-dollarization will continue. Were the U.S. dollar not central to the global economy, adversaries could better evade sanctions, and there could be more potent alternative economic blocs. That’s why, during a speech in Shanghai last year, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/669260a5-82a5-4e7a-9bbf-4f41c54a6143" target="">stated</a> dramatically, “Every night I ask myself why all countries have to base their trade on the dollar.” Warning of the dangers of U.S. “institutional hegemony,” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202302/t20230220_11027664.html" target="">released</a> an essay in February 2023 arguing that through the dollar, Washington “coerces other countries into serving America’s political and economic strategy.” Going further, the ministry stated that the “hegemony of [the] U.S. dollar is the main source of instability and uncertainty in the world economy.”</p>

<p>The timing of such pronouncements—roughly one year after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent imposition of sanctions—belies the true motivations behind them. The nearly eight decades of dollar dominance have witnessed some of the greatest peace and prosperity in history, including the rise of countries such as China. The dollar was not imposed on the world in 1944; it emerged out of postwar circumstances and a remarkable degree of international consensus, when 44 countries, including China and Brazil, assembled in Bretton Woods to determine the post-World War II financial order. What’s driving instability today is not the dollar but war in Europe and the Middle East, as well as tensions in the Indo-Pacific. These geopolitical challenges are connected, including through the deepening support that China provides to Russia. As Moscow has used that economic lifetime to sustain its assault on Ukraine, the war has changed how money moves around the world. Within weeks of Russia’s invasion, a U.S.-led coalition of <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/0wfzc71x/production/6745ea42c21d65d6709231e0e7767bd5de57469b.pdf" target="">37 allies and partners</a>, representing more than <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/countries-have-sanctioned-russia" target="">60 percent of the world economy</a>, imposed sanctions and export controls on Moscow. By April 2022, the value of Russian imports had fallen to around 43 percent below the prewar median. The results have been more severe than the Kremlin lets on, and <a href="https://www.cbr.ru/eng/press/keypr/" target="">ordinary Russians</a> are feeling the pain the regime has caused. But a pivot to Asia saved Moscow, as Russia found new markets and means to put its economy on a war footing. The country now spends <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-22/russia-plans-huge-defense-spending-hike-in-2024-as-war-drags-on" target="">6 percent</a> of its GDP on its military.</p>
<p>What has changed isn’t only where the money has come from but what that money looks like. We see this in the <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/kyrgyz-kazakh-firms-investigation-western-tech-russia-war-ukraine/32467795.html" target="">former Soviet republics</a> in Central Asia and the Caucasus, which purchase Western technology in dollars and sell it to Russia for rubles. We see it with Russia’s trade with China—in the first nine months after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s ruble-yuan trade jumped more than <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/yuans-new-dollar-russia-rides-redback-2022-11-28/" target="">40 percent</a>. Meanwhile, China’s two-way trade with Russia hit a record high of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/china-russia-2023-trade-value-hits-record-high-240-bln-chinese-customs-2024-01-12/" target="">$240 billion</a> in 2023, up 26.3 percent in just one year. The yuan recently displaced the dollar as the most traded currency in Russia, accounting for nearly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/chinas-yuan-ousts-dollar-become-most-traded-currency-moscow-2023-2024-01-16/" target="">42 percent</a> of all foreign currency traded on the Moscow Exchange. As a result, the war and Moscow’s evasion of U.S. payment systems have led the largest country and second-largest economy in the world to trade mostly in currencies other than the dollar.</p>
<p>Internationalization of a currency other than the dollar is still a long way off, however. The continued dominance of the U.S. dollar is a vote of confidence from millions of market participants ranging from governments to corporations to households. It would take not just bilateral changes but new and trusted institutions and multilateral alignments based on the rule of law, transparency, and accountability to create any plausible alternative. While the Chinese-led Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) is one such attempt, and it handles a reported <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/en/3688110/3688172/5188125/5327700/2024041216580199504.pdf" target="">25,900</a> a day, that total falls significantly short of the U.S. Clearing House Interbank Payments System, which does approximately <a href="https://mc-e3a82812-8e7a-44d9-956f-8910-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/New/TCH/Documents/Payment-Systems/FNA_CHIPS_Review_Public_Distribution_January_2023.pdf?rev=def326787ed942b8b4da5ae6be7db3bd&amp;hash=397A2559090DA4265C61899DA2000B83" target="">500,000 daily transactions</a> totaling <a href="https://marquee.gs.com/t/r/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lc3BhY2UiOiJjb250ZW50LXN0cmVhbSIsInVzZXJJZCI6ImQ4NjZlZDFhOWZlNjExZGJiN2E1MDAxNGMyNDBkNjE0IiwibGlua3MiOnsidXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlY2xlYXJpbmdob3VzZS5vcmcvcGF5bWVudC1zeXN0ZW1zL0NISVBTIiwiZGF0YSI6ImV5SmtiMk4xYldWdWRFbGtJam9pTm1VeFl6QXdOREV0TWpNME1TMDBZek5sTFdJMk1HTXRaamt6Wm1JNU16bGhORGd4SWl3aWEyVjVJam9pTVRJaUxDSnpiM1Z5WTJVaU9pSlhSVUlpTENKMFpYaDBJam9pSkRFdU9DQjBjbWxzYkdsdmJpQnBiaUIyWVd4MVpTSjkifSwiaWF0IjoxNzA4NDM5NjE1fQ.hlO7q58NvrRrZLAgD5vQsEsn_OC_gnwKqpqN5o2TDC4" target="">$1.8 trillion in value</a>.

<div class="bolded-first-line">
<p>The two most significant problems for those advocating wholesale de-dollarization are that it is impossible to replace something with nothing and the United States’ competitors do not currently have the capability or will to replace the dollar, even if their rhetoric at times suggests otherwise. That doesn’t mean the dollar’s position should be taken for granted. Innovation and geoeconomic fragmentation may chip away at its reach. The most important emerging trends are new technological models, sector-specific arrangements, and bilateral and multilateral alignments. These efforts are marginal, but they may provide meaningful alternatives in the future.</p>
</div>
<p>The United States has financial technologies that are as developed as most leading markets, but it lags a small number of countries in consumer adoption of certain financial technologies. These comparisons run the gamut. In 2021, <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/pdf/el-salvadors-law-a-meaningful-test-for-bitcoin.pdf" target="">El Salvador</a> became the first country to make cryptocurrency legal tender. More importantly, the <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/" target="">Atlantic Council</a> tracks the proliferation of central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, and reports that 134 countries and currencies unions, representing 98 percent of the world’s GDP, are exploring use cases for CBDCs, up from just 35 in 2020. Pilot projects are underway in 11 of the G-20 member states, though only three countries have fully launched a CBDC. In a more divided world, there are more CBDCs—since February 2022, according to the Atlantic Council, “wholesale CBDC developments have doubled.”</p>
<p>When U.S. consumers mass adopted financial technologies such as credit credits in the 1970s and ’80s, China’s economy was in relative shambles, and it was still recovering from the Cultural Revolution. Its GDP was just <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=CN" target="">$154 billion</a> in 1976. Today, however, China is the second-largest economy in the world, and its digital yuan, or e-CNY, has drawn the focus of many experts who talk about technology-led efforts toward “de-dollarization.” The e-CNY could provide greater efficiencies and financial inclusion to unbanked Chinese citizens, but in many ways, there are few differences between it and digital and mobile payment systems in the West.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, China is making efforts to internationalize the e-CNY as a dollar alternative, and the Chinese government made that intention clear with its choice of venue for the digital currency’s debut: the 2022 Beijing Olympics. During the games, visitors to the capital city, still under strict COVID-19 restrictions, went through customs and were immediately able to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijings-digital-currency-push-at-winter-olympics-puts-visa-in-a-bind-11644402602" target="">exchange</a> currency for e-CNY. Rather than increasing trust abroad, however, this not only raised concerns about Beijing’s leadership in financial technology; it also set off alarms about how that technology could be used to increase the Chinese Communist Party’s control over Chinese society and potentially create new forms of geoeconomic leverage that China could use over the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The fact that it has not had any significant uptake in other countries indicates that the e-CNY is not a trusted alternative abroad, and it is still in the pilot stages, even at home, where it reaches <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/" target="">260 million wallets</a> in just 25 Chinese cities out of a population of more than 1.4 billion. But the push to internationalize China’s digital currency is ongoing. <a href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/cbdc/mcbdc_bridge.htm" target="">Project mBridge</a>—a cross-border CBDC program involving mainland China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as 25 observer nations—is one such effort. There is international interest in more efficient, low-cost alternatives to payment rails that rely on the dollar, even if the Chinese government were not already taking steps to increase trust in the e-CNY in much of the world.</p><p id="adPlaceholder-1" class="in-article-dynamic-ad" aria-hidden="true"></p>
<p>However, China is finding new avenues for limited de-dollarization with its closest partners.

<p>We see that trend most clearly in the oil trade. Oil is priced in dollars, and the trade volume in the global oil derivatives market—approximately <a href="https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/indexes/developed-markets#:~:text=Over%20the%20last%20two%20decades,of%20the%20MSCI%20World%20Index" target="">23 times the size</a> of average daily physical crude flows—is fully denominated in dollars. But Beijing is working to reduce the dollar’s role in its own trade and in the global economy. China is a large, but resource-poor, country that relies on energy imports, mostly from the Middle East.

<p>Here, however, the reach of those who seek to de-dollarize the oil markets may have exceeded their grasp, as shown by trade patterns between India and Russia. Following the imposition of Western-led sanctions on Russia, India became a top destination for Russian seaborne crude oil, hitting <a href="https://marquee.gs.com/t/r/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lc3BhY2UiOiJjb250ZW50LXN0cmVhbSIsInVzZXJJZCI6ImQ4NjZlZDFhOWZlNjExZGJiN2E1MDAxNGMyNDBkNjE0IiwibGlua3MiOnsidXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjQtMDEtMDEvaW5kaWEtcy1jcnVkZS1vaWwtaW1wb3J0cy1mcm9tLXJ1c3NpYS1wbHVuZ2Utb24tcGF5bWVudC1pc3N1ZXM_c3JlZj1ib0U1V3E5RyIsImRhdGEiOiJleUprYjJOMWJXVnVkRWxrSWpvaU5tVXhZekF3TkRFdE1qTTBNUzAwWXpObExXSTJNR010WmprelptSTVNemxoTkRneElpd2lhMlY1SWpvaU1UQWlMQ0p6YjNWeVkyVWlPaUpYUlVJaUxDSjBaWGgwSWpvaU1pNHhOU0J0YVd4c2FXOXVJR0poY25KbGJITWdZU0JrWVhraWZRPT0ifSwiaWF0IjoxNzA4NDM5NjE1fQ.Y3CG2pPJ_iWo8G6OObxZ0b1uoc0REXt3TomxjyOGGb4" target="">2.15 million barrels a day</a> in May 2023.

<p>Moves to “sanctions-proof” whole economies take many other forms. For years, Moscow has been steadily decreasing its dollar holdings, with its stockpile of U.S. Treasurys declining from $102.2 billion in December 2017 to a mere $14.9 billion six months later. Similarly, in 2023, China decreased its own holdings of U.S. Treasurys and <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/China-gold-purchases-soar-30-on-economic-anxiety" target="">upped</a> its gold purchases by 30 percent. These trends aren’t limited to U.S. adversaries and competitors—as Goldman Sachs Research has noted, India, which had been the subject of U.S. sanctions over its nuclear program until the George W. Bush administration, has also upped its own gold holdings, though gold remains a <a href="https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/gold-reserves-by-country" target="">small percentage</a> of its reserve holdings globally.</p>
<p>Gold provides a degree of diversification and insulation from sanctions, but it’s not an alternative for the dollar. The real returns are much less predictable, gold comes with significant carrying and storage costs, and gold’s functionality as a medium of exchange for trade settlement is low. Meanwhile, physical gold supply is limited, with gold futures backed by around just <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/metals/precious/gold.volume.html" target="">$40 billion</a> worth of the precious metal. That number climbs higher with the inclusion of exchange-traded funds, which create opportunities for diversification and investments in many assets, but it still is far short of international currency markets.</p>
<p>Technology could change the uses and role of gold in the global financial system as well. Historically, gold has often proved a better store of value than fiat currency. But it lacks the same functionality, not to mention greater storage and movement costs. The digitization of physical gold in the existing vaulting system, however, can afford it greater efficiency functionality of settlement.</p>
    

<p>Whatever technological progress, true de-dollarization would take a compelling alternative backed by multilateral consensus. China-led groupings such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Belt and Road Initiative, and BRICS (now BRICS+) are, in their own ways, attempting to create such a forum. That’s why Brazil’s president called on the BRICS countries to create a common currency at last year’s summit in South Africa, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/what-is-brics-currency-could-one-be-adopted-2023-08-23/" target="">arguing</a> to his fellow leaders that such a medium of exchange “increases our payment options and reduces our vulnerabilities.”</p>
<p>Even this widely publicized effort has pitfalls. The original BRICS countries are home to <a href="https://unctad.org/publication/brics-investment-report#:~:text=Brazil%2C%20the%20Russian%20Federation%2C%20India,cent%20of%20the%20world's%20population." target="">42 percent</a> of the world’s population and, according to the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPGDP@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD" target="">International Monetary Fund</a>, a third of the world’s economic output. But economic, ideological, and geopolitical differences make any united policy outcomes exceedingly unlikely. Even members dismiss the notion of BRICS-led de-dollarization, with Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/china-russia-and-india-arent-developing-a-dollar-rival-top-official-says-theres-no-idea-of-a-brics-currency/articleshow/101516888.cms" target="">stating</a> last July, “There is no idea of a BRICS currency.”</p><p id="adPlaceholder-2" class="in-article-dynamic-ad" aria-hidden="true"></p>
<p>The data underscores Jaishankar’s sentiments. According to the <a href="https://www.bis.org/statistics/rpfx22_fx.pdf" target="">Bank for International Settlements</a>, the U.S. dollar is the backbone of the BRICS trade. In 2022, it was involved in 97 percent of all foreign exchange transactions involving the Indian rupee, 95 percent of all such transactions involving the Brazilian real, and 84 percent of all such transactions involving the yuan.</p>
<p>While efforts to move away from the dollar have, in some sectors, gained traction, the rhetoric around de-dollarization is, in many ways, more about performative politics than serious policy. To make the yuan more attractive, Beijing could loosen its capital controls or move away from a surveillance state model, but it shows little signs of doing do. The European Union could boost the euro if it were to create the kinds of capital markets that drive the U.S. financial system, but it hasn’t. These moves would be beneficial to Chinese citizens and Europeans alike. But for now, the dollar remains the most trusted, and in many ways most efficient, currency for not only the United States but most of the world. And while BRICS may have the desire to build a new international financial system, the global economy that has allowed the emerging markets to emerge over the last 25 years was built on the dollar.</p>

<div class="bolded-first-line">
<p>The United States’ rivals may not succeed in pulling the world away from the dollar, but Washington should be careful not to push the rest of the world out of its orbit either. The use of the dollar for sanctions can be a valuable tool of economic statecraft, and sanctions have been deployed by Western governments since 432 B.C., when Athens put an <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/360360" target="">embargo</a> on the nearby town of Megara in the lead-up to the Peloponnesian War. When they are overused or abused, however, they erode trust and leave the rest of the world seeking to protect itself from a weaponized global economy.</p>
</div>
<p>The debate about the use of sanctions has gotten more urgent and taken new forms in the last two years. Soon after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States and its allies froze <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-where-are-russias-300-billion-reserves-frozen-west-2023-12-28/" target="">around $300 billion</a> worth of sovereign Russian assets in the West. That included a substantial portion of Russia’s gold and foreign currency reserves, denominated in euros, dollars, British pounds, Japanese yen, and other currencies. While the global economy adapted to these sanctions for two years, we recently entered a new chapter in financial history.</p>
<p>Before this year, the United States had <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/4426738-seize-russian-assets-ukraine-senate/" target="">never seized the foreign assets of a country</a> with which it was not at war. However, on April 24, President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/global-legal-monitor/2024-05-07/united-states-president-signs-law-creating-mechanism-for-delivering-seized-russian-assets-to-ukraine/" target="">signed</a> the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity (REPO) for Ukrainians Act, establishing a means to do just that and seize Russian assets to support Ukraine.</p>
<p>The case for REPO was clear and compelling, at least to Washington and most of its partners. With each passing day, the cost to rebuild Ukraine grows: The World Economic Forum puts the figure at around <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/02/cost-rebuilding-ukraine-other-urban-transformation-news/#:~:text=%24486%20billion%20to%20rebuild%20Ukraine,to%20a%20new%20joint%20report." target="">$486 billion</a>. Repurposing Russian assets is a politically elegant solution that has the benefit of imposing no direct costs to U.S. or EU taxpayers. But like most policies, it involves trade-offs, and it was the subject of considerable debate at the recent <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2371" target="">G-7 finance ministers</a> meeting in May.</p>
<p>What might this policy change lead to? The American Enterprise Institute’s Michael Strain <a href="https://www.aei.org/op-eds/yes-russian-reserves-should-be-seized/" target="">observed</a> that critics argue that the seizure of Russian assets could make other countries worry that their own assets might one day be seized. Given that risk, they’d take preventative steps to distance themselves from Western economies, making them less willing to hold dollars or euros or even invest in the West. Strain finds these risks to be “legitimate, but ultimately unpersuasive” when it comes to REPO, but they should not be dismissed, including when working with allies whose involvement would be required to make such measures effective.</p>
<p>These conversations show how the actual or perceived overuse of economic coercion will likely only increase other countries’ desires to find alternatives to the U.S. dollar. Sanctions are most effective when they are targeted, multilateral, and set out to achieve specific objectives. Used prudently, they enhance the United States’ economic position, but when they are abused, they leave the country weaker.</p>

<div class="bolded-first-line">
<p>The dollar’s demise has been overpredicted for decades. Those who think the dollar will reign supreme forever, though, should take a lesson in humility from Charles Krauthammer. In January 1990, with the United States at the height of its power at the end of the Cold War, he <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/1990-01-01/unipolar-moment" target="">wrote</a> that the “most striking feature of the post-Cold War world is its unipolarity. No doubt, multipolarity will come in time.” The dollar’s unipolar moment isn’t over. But the world could change.</p>
</div>
<p>When the dollar emerged as the consensus of the post-World War II world, the U.S. economy accounted for perhaps <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1334676/wwii-annual-war-gdp-largest-economies/" target="">half of global GDP</a>. Since then, China became the world’s second-largest economy. Beijing is challenging the U.S.-led order. Emerging markets have developed and are seeking greater autonomy. New currencies and technologies have come online. Meanwhile, Washington doesn’t always safeguard the privilege that the dollar bestows. Unnecessary tariffs can diminish the United States’ role and reach in the global economy. Fiscal brinksmanship, combined with repeated confrontations over the debt limit and even the threat of default, erode confidence; the U.S. national debt is approaching <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/national-debt-clock#:~:text=The%20%2434%20trillion%20gross%20federal,funds%20and%20other%20government%20accounts." target="">$35 trillion</a>, and budget deficits are expanding at record rates, even during peacetime.</p><p id="adPlaceholder-3" class="in-article-dynamic-ad" aria-hidden="true"></p>
<p>If the dollar’s detractors truly seek an alternative, however, they would be forced to adopt radically different policies. The economic troubles that China is experiencing today appear to be more structural than cyclical. Beijing’s <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/ps/article?id=China-Foreign-Exchange-Controls" target="">closed capital account</a> restricts the amount of yuan available to transact, and last year, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-first-deficit-foreign-investment-signals-wests-de-risking-pressure-2023-11-06/" target="">China reported</a> its first-ever quarterly deficit in foreign direct investment. While many of China’s trading partners share the desire to move away from the dollar, Goldman Sachs Research has noted that even they have limits on how much yuan they can accumulate, as their own currencies are often pegged to the dollar. When it comes to the United States’ allies, even the EU has not taken steps to create deep, liquid capital markets that could increase the euro’s appeal as an alternative.</p>
<p>The move toward de-dollarization remains marginal but meaningful and moving. For the dollar to lose its place, it would take a series of policy failures in Washington and for the dollar’s detractors to create alternatives that have appeal not only in authoritarian, state-led economies but globally. The global financial system is changing, and nothing is certain. But it would still be wrong to bet against the dollar.</p>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- Pacific Investment Management Co. expects more regional bank failures in the US because of a “very high” concentration of troubled commercial real estate loans on their books.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>“The real wave of distress is just starting” for lenders to everything from malls to offices, John Murray, Pimco’s head of global private commercial real estate team, said in an interview. His division sits within Pimco’s $173 billion alternatives business.</p><p>Uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates has exacerbated challenges faced by the CRE sector, where high borrowing costs have hammered valuations and triggered defaults, leaving lenders stuck with assets that are tough to sell. Contrary to some market expectations, larger banks have been disposing of some of their higher quality assets first to avoid deeper losses, according to Murray.</p><p>“As stressed loans grow due to maturities, however, we expect that banks will start selling these more challenged loans to reduce their troubled loan exposures,” he said, adding his team has been snapping up CRE loans offloaded by some large US banks for the past 18 months.</p><p>The turmoil has been particularly felt among regional banks, which boosted their CRE exposure that in many cases is now worth only a fraction of their value at their peak. Smaller banks have also continued to worry investors ever since the collapse of a few last year.</p><p>Earlier this year, New York Community Bancorp shocked investors by slashing its dividend and stockpiling more cash for potentially bad loans, sending shares into a tailspin that ended in a capital injection. US Bancorp, the largest regional bank by assets, increased its provisions for credit losses in the first quarter. Shares of Axos Financial Inc. slumped last week after a short seller took aim at what it called the bank’s “glaring” property loan problems.</p><p>Regional banks were also the only lenders that didn’t demand extra down payments from commercial-property borrowers in recent years, highlighting their vulnerability to falling values, according to a report released by MSCI Real Assets in March. Deposit-taking institutions face an estimated $441 billion wall of maturing property debt this year.</p><p>For larger banks, the property exposures aren’t expected to cause systemic failures as their CRE lending was curbed after the 2008 crisis, Murray said. But borrowers’ failure to repay means they’re lending even less compared with 2021 and 2022, he added.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Meanwhile, many mortgage real estate investment trusts have become more sidelined as they deal with problems of their own. That’s limited their ability to underwrite new investments. Starwood Real Estate Income Trust tightened its shareholders’ ability to pull money last month in an effort to preserve liquidity and stave off asset sales, while Blackstone Inc.’s $59 billion property trust saw an uptick in withdrawal requests.</p><p>Lending volumes for major public mortgage REITs have plunged 70% from 2021 levels, according to Murray.</p><p>While banks tend to hog most of the headlines, another area that needs close attention is the more than $200 billion of loans made by debt funds in the US that are set to mature through 2025, Murray said. Many of these loans were originated during the peak pricing era of 2021, often with a three-year term and a three-year rate cap.</p><p>“The first catalyst for stress at the asset level is occurring right now, as assets will struggle to meet extension tests in this higher rate environment,” Murray said.</p><p>The Newport Beach, California-based asset manager is also keeping an eye on how German banks deal with their commercial real estate exposure.</p><p>“The combination of rising rates plus recessionary pressures creates real challenges for commercial real estate, from both a capital markets and fundamentals perspective,” Murray said.</p><p>--With assistance from Neil Callanan and Hannah Levitt.</p><p>(Updates with other banks exposed to property loans in sixth paragraph.)</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

Additionally, more than 60% of Gen Xers — who were born between 1965 and 1980 — cited the need to get away as their primary reason for booking a vacation, a higher percentage than any other generation.</p><p>"More than 6 in 10 Gen Xers say the desire to escape spurred their trip plans, perhaps reflecting the pressures of their current life stage," travel and hospitality analyst Lindsey Roeschke wrote in the Morning Consult report.</p><p>The percentage of Gen Xers planning trips with kids under 18 has dropped from 28% in October 2021 to 17% in February. The Morning Consult report noted that the drop is likely due to changing life circumstances, such as retirement or children moving out of the home.</p><p>According to data collected by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2017/demo/SEHSD-WP2017-27.pdf" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="60">US Census Bureau</a>, there were 22.5 million empty nesters in the US in 2014, the most recent year with available data. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/demo/p70-173.html" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="60">Another study</a> published by the US Census Bureau in 2021 found that 60.2% of parents over the age of 55 did not have any children living at home, and those parents either lived alone or with a partner. However, neither of those studies differentiated between Gen Xers and baby boomers or how those numbers have changed over time.</p><p>Meanwhile, solo travel and trips with friends have increased and surpassed family vacations, signaling a move toward more personal and self-focused travel experiences.</p>
                        <p>"Everyone likes to gloss over Gen Xers, but I'm really intrigued by the way their travel habits are shifting as they enter a new life stage," Roeschke<strong> </strong>wrote.</p>

<p>There is no LUV for Southwest Airlines management this week as activist investor <a href="https://www.elliottmgmt.com/">Elliott</a> has taken more than a 10 percent stake in the airline and wants to fire Chairman Gary Kelly and CEO Bob Jordan. If you thought Carl Icahn’s investment in JetBlue was going to be a big fight, you ain’t seen nothing yet. This is going to get ugly. So far, I am not impressed by Elliott’s take, but if this does push Southwest to act more quickly, then everyone wins.</p>





<p>At JetBlue, Carl Icahn saw opportunity to boost a lagging stock price, but there was a new management team already trying to shake things up. Icahn wanted more oversight at the airline, but he didn’t publicly demand immediate and specific change other than getting a couple board seats.  The situation with Elliott and Southwest is very different.</p>



<p>Elliott has put out a <a href="https://strongersouthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Stronger-Southwest_06102024.pdf">presentation on its Stronger Southwest website</a> saying that the airline is stuck in the mud, and it needs management and strategy to change right away. This is war on the existing management team. Specifically, here is the plan:</p>





<p>The presentation focuses on Board Chair Gary Kelly and CEO Bob Jordan as being the two main targets.  Elliott says this:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Current Executive Chairman and CEO are rigidly committed to the status quo. Southwest<br>must bring in new leadership from outside of the Company for Southwest’s strategy to evolve</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If this were happening at American — and frankly, I’m surprised it’s not but then again, Southwest’s balance sheet is a lot more attractive — this might sound sensible. But this is Southwest, and it’s a first red flag that Elliott doesn’t really appreciate the uniqueness of the airline, or ANY airline for that matter.</p>



<p>Southwest’s years of success and stability — which Elliott <em>does</em> recognize — are largely thanks to a culture focused on growing leadership from within. That is good, but it does also breed a slowness in being willing to adapt and change. It’s a double-edged sword. But bringing in a true outsider to come and change the airline swiftly and mercilessly? That is a recipe for disaster at a company like this. You need something in between.</p>



<p>Yes, Southwest has underperformed — you can see all the details in that presentation if you want. Yes, Southwest is slow to change. Elliott should have focused on ways to fix those issues but without throwing the baby out with the bathwater. In other words, Elliott is coming in way too hot, and it seems like its plan will just create more chaos and possibly destroy value if they really push on this plan.</p>



<p>I don’t disagree with much of what Elliott is saying on a high level. The airline needs to be quicker to adapt and like some other airlines, it could benefit from a more proactive, more independent board. If I were Elliott, I’d have focused on the board level, trying to oust Chairman Gary Kelly and picking up at couple of board seats of my own. But trying to chop off the head of the airline’s day-to-day leadership ranks is a far riskier move that is likely to backfire.</p>



<p>That’s not to say that it shouldn’t try to help reform leadership. As Elliott rightly notes, there is not a lot of outside experience at Southwest. COO Andrew Watterson is the lone exception:</p>





<p>The airline could absolutely benefit from more diversity in background at that level. Maybe it is time for some of the longest-tenured folks to move on. But I also think that it would be beneficial for Elliott to try to work with the current CEO to make changes before resorting to regime-toppling. This could be the kick in the pants the airline needs to actually start speeding up real change.</p>



<p>What I find interesting is that last quarter during earnings, we heard Bob talk more about big possible changes to seating and premium products. We were promised more at investor day in September, something real and substantive. I can understand the concern about Southwest not being prone to action, but you’d think Elliott might want to wait for that day before calling for the CEO’s head.  I want to hear what the plan is, and maybe this will force it to move up sooner.</p>



<p>The more I read the presentation, the less I think Elliott really knows what it’s looking at here.  I just find a lot of the suggestions and conclusions to be poor on the revenue improvement front and only slightly better on the cost containment side.  There seems to be some fundamental misunderstandings of why things are the way they are.  But don’t take that as a full-throated endorsement of management either. </p>



<p>With Elliott trying to remove Bob and bring in outsiders, the airline should rally around its leadership. Labor is fat and happy with new contracts, so they aren’t likely to play games the way they might have a couple years ago. But leadership needs to give the employees something to rally around, a real plan for improvement.</p>





<p>If there’s one thing a company like Southwest is good at, it’s rallying around its people. And its people are good at rallying around it. My guess is that Elliott has overplayed its hand here. That being said, maybe it can effect change to the board structure and call that a win.</p>



<p>In the end, it only really cares about making money on its investment.  This is not how I would have gone about trying to make that happen, but it’s apparently how Elliott likes to operate.</p>
