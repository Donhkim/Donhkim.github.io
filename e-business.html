Sanofi is licensing the technology for the combination COVID-flu vaccine, which is separate from the one currently in Novavax's pipeline.</p><p>In addition to that $1.2 billion, Sanofi is committing up to $200 million for each new vaccine it develops using Novavax's technology.

<ol>
<li><strong>Unstable cocoa prices</strong>: The price of cocoa has been highly volatile in 2023, driven by a combination of factors including a poor crop and speculation by financial investors.</li>
<li><strong>Price increases</strong>: The price of cocoa has increased significantly in the past year, rising to $4,200 per metric ton in December 2022, a level not seen since the 1970s.</li>
<li><strong>Speculation drives prices up</strong>: Financial speculators entered the market, betting on further price increases, which pushed the price above $6,000 a ton in February and $11,000 a ton in mid-April.</li>
<li><strong>Wild price swings</strong>: Since then, the price has fluctuated wildly, falling nearly 30% in two weeks before bouncing back up again.</li>
<li><strong>Current price</strong>: As of the article's publication date, the price of cocoa stood at $8,699 a ton.</li>

For much of the past decade, the price of cocoa in one key global benchmark hovered around $2,500 per metric ton.

Since then, the price has swung wildly, falling nearly 30 percent in just two weeks before bouncing up again. By Thursday, the price was $8,699 a ton.</p></div></div></div>

<p>The founder and former CEO of the parent company behind fast-food chains like Fatburger and Hot Dog on a Stick, was indicted on federal charges in connection to an alleged tax evasion scheme in which $47 million of reportable income went unreported, prosecutors announced.</p>



<p>Former <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fatbrands.com/" target="_blank">Fat Brands Inc.</a> CEO Andrew Wiederhorn, 58 of Beverly Hills, was indicted by a federal grand jury on Thursday, according to United States Attorney Martin Estrada. Widerhorn is still the controlling shareholder of the publicly traded company.</p>



<p>That unreported income came in the form of “shareholder loans” that were paid out to Wiederhorn and his family without the need of collateral, interest payments or any other requirements of a typical corporate loan, the indictment says. </p>

<p>Prosecutors claim that Wiederhorn himself determined the amount, timing and forgiveness of the “sham loans” without informing the board of directors of Fat Brands and another former affiliate company. He had no intention of repaying the loans, the indictment says.</p>



<p>“This defendant, the former CEO of a publicly traded company, is alleged to have engaged in a long-running scheme to defraud investors and the United States Treasury to the tune of millions of dollars,” said Estrada. “Instead of looking out for shareholders, the defendant allegedly treated the company as his personal slush fund, in violation of federal law. “The Corporate and Securities Fraud Strike Force of my office focuses on rooting out corporate malfeasance by corporate insiders, and we will continue to protect the public by bringing these important prosecutions.”</p>



<p>The misappropriated funds, prosecutors say, were used to purchase luxuries like “private-jet travel, vacations, a Rolls Royce Phantom, other luxury automobiles, jewelry and a piano.”</p>





<p>According to prosecutors, Wiederhorn is charged with “one count of endeavoring to obstruct the administration of the Internal Revenue Code, six counts of tax evasion, and one count of false statements and omission of material facts in statements to accountants in connection with audits and reviews.”</p>



<p>Other associates close to Wiederhorn charged in the indictment include William J. Amo, who provided him with tax advisory, and former Fat Brands CFO Rebecca D. Hershinger.</p>



<p>In addition to the tax charges, Wiederhorn was issued a second indictment on allegations that he illegally possessed a firearm and ammunition as a convicted felon. He served 15 months in prison and was ordered to pay $2 million in fines after pleading guilty to charges of paying an illegal gratuity to an associate and to filing a false tax return in 2004, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-10/former-executive-fatburger-indicted" target="_blank">according to the Los Angeles Times</a>.</p>



<p>In a statement to KTLA, Wiederhorn’s attorney Nicola Hanna, Partner at Gibson Dunn, called the charges “wrong.”</p>





<p>“These charges are wrong on both the facts and the law. Mr. Wiederhorn consulted and followed the advice of world-class professionals in all of his business dealings,” Hanna said. “He has led an extraordinarily successful company that has performed beyond expectations since the merger of FAT Brands and Fog Cutter Capital in 2020. We look forward to making clear in court that this is an unfortunate example of government overreach – and a case with no victims, no losses and no crimes.”</p>



<p>As CEO of Fat Brands, Wiederhorn oversaw brands such as Round Table Pizza, Fatburger and Johnny Rockets.</p>

            A major US health care system said Thursday that it is diverting ambulances from “several” of its hospitals following a cyberattack this week.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvzzn9x500043b6jxh3jkptg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The cyberattack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals in 19 states, is also disrupting access to electronic health records, some phone systems and “various systems utilized to order certain tests, procedures and medications,” Ascension said in a <a href="https://about.ascension.org/cybersecurity-event" target="_blank">statement</a> distributed Thursday evening.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvzzn9x500053b6jknvbcpkn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The sprawling health care network, which also owns 40 senior living facilities, said that it would be using “downtime procedure for some time,” because of the cyberattack. Downtime procedures are typically when health providers revert to backup processes, including paper records, that allow them to care for patients when computers are down.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw0njqps00003j6hbqrwb461@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Four sources briefed on the investigation told CNN that Ascension suffered a ransomware attack, in which cybercriminals typically try to lock computers and steal data for extortion. Those sources said that the type of ransomware used in the hack is known as Black Basta, which hackers have used repeatedly to attack health care organizations in recent years. Black Basta, also the name of a broad criminal group that uses the ransomware, includes Russian-speakers, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/black-basta-threat-profile.pdf" target="_blank">according</a> to the Department of Health and Human Services.
    </p>

            On Friday, the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a cyber threat sharing group for big health care providers worldwide, published an <a href="https://h-isac.org/black-basta-threat-actor-emerges-as-a-major-threat-to-the-healthcare-industry/" target="_blank">advisory</a> warning that hackers using Black Basta ransomware have “recently accelerated attacks against the healthcare sector.”
    </p>

            That includes at least two health care organizations in Europe and the US that in the last month<strong> </strong>have “suffered severe operational disruptions” because of Black Basta ransomware,” the advisory said, without naming the health care organizations.

            <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/08/tech/cyberattack-disrupts-healthcare-network/index.html">News of the hack of Ascension broke</a> on Wednesday, and Ascension has in the last 24 hours followed a familiar playbook for many American organizations that have been assaulted by cybercriminals. Ascension has notified federal authorities of the incident, hired prominent US cybersecurity firm Mandiant to recover from the incident and shut down systems to try to keep the incident under control.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw0nkl1500023j6hvegclv2s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Senior US officials have been in repeated contact with Ascension CEO Joseph Impicciche since the ransomware attack to understand how the hack might impact patient care, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvzzn9x500073b6jzlz0g0em@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “We are actively supporting our ministries as they continue to provide safe, patient care with established downtime protocols and procedures, in which our workforce is well trained,” Ascension said in its statement Thursday evening.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvzzn9x500083b6j05yx28gb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            It was not clear how many Ascension hospitals were sending ambulances to other locations because of the cyberattack. Ascension spokesperson Gene Ford did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.
    </p>

            It’s only the latest major hacking incident that has hobbled a big US health care network and sent US officials scrambling to offer support.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvzzn9x5000a3b6jlljyzkdt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            A February ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of health care giant UnitedHealth Group, caused billing disruptions at pharmacies across the US and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/09/tech/medical-supply-chain-cybersecurity/index.html">threatened to put</a> some health providers out of business. A third of Americans may have had their personal data swept up in the hack, UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/politics/data-stolen-healthcare-hack/index.html">estimated</a> in testimony to Congress this month. UnitedHealth paid a $22 million ransom to the cybercriminals to try to protect patient data, Witty said.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvzzn9x5000b3b6j21get8gt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            That Change Healthcare hack incensed US lawmakers and prompted questions across the federal government about the vulnerability of America’s health care system to disruptive cyberattacks with cascading impacts — questions that the cyberattack on Ascension will do nothing to assuage.

But officials are reportedly nervous about the willingness of China’s government to subsidize the auto manufacturing sector. China is the number one exporter of cars globally, even though virtually none of them end up in the US. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">The Chinese auto industry is the largest in the world, and roughly 30 percent of the country’s vehicle sales are electric. Most of the world’s EV batteries are manufactured in China, and many of the country’s most popular models have been praised for their design, functionality, and price. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">But US automakers have long been worried that an influx of Chinese EVs could effectively put them out of business. Earlier this year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk — who sells most of his cars in China — warned that Chinese manufacturers would “demolish” domestic rivals without trade barriers.  The concern is that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/1/23854230/debbie-dingell-interview-ev-china-tesla-gop">Chinese EVs are so cheap</a> — BYD’s Seagull sells for around $10,000 — that domestic automakers couldn’t possibly compete. Other politicians have called for an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128457/whos-afraid-of-the-big-bad-chinese-ev">outright ban</a> of Chinese-made EVs. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Fear of Chinese-made EVs has guided much of the Biden administration’s consumer and manufacturing policies over the past three years. The $7,500 EV tax credit, for example, is structured in a way to encourage automakers to source their batteries from within the US or its trade partners. Vehicles, batteries, and other components from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24148003/ev-tax-credit-rule-battery-mineral-flexibility">“foreign entities of concern,”</a> which includes China, are ineligible for the credit. And earlier this year, the administration <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/29/24086490/us-biden-administration-investigation-chinese-vehicles-security-threat">launched an investigation</a> into the potential security risks posed by smart car technology produced in China. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Despite these policies, Republicans, led by former President Donald Trump, have criticized Biden’s EV policies as setting the stage for a takeover by Chinese companies. In fact, Biden has kept many of the trade restrictions on China imposed by Trump — and introduced a few new ones of his own. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">The new tariffs are also expected to apply to other clean energy goods, like solar panels and critical minerals, the <em>Journal </em>reports. This comes amid reports that China is preparing to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/the-world-is-in-for-another-china-shock-3d98b533?mod=article_inline">flood the global market</a> with less expensive products amid its own <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/many-china-economy-feels-like-it-is-recession-2024-01-17/">flagging domestic economy</a>. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Of course, the dearth of affordable electric vehicles in the US is partly contributing to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934889/electric-vehicle-ev-transition-sales-delays-politics">slowdown in sales</a>. And that could imperil Biden’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions attributable to transportation. </p></div></div></div>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Target confirmed Friday that it won’t carry Pride Month merchandise at all stories this spring after the discount retailer <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/target-pride-collection-lgbtq-merchandise-backlash-cf4a19844579e6041c6938b13568e17c">experienced a backlash</a></span> and lower sales over its collection honoring LGBTQ+ communities.</p><p>Target, which operates roughly 2,000 stores, said decisions about where to stock Pride-themed products, including adult apparel, home goods, foods and beverages would be based on “guest insights and consumer research.”</p><p>A Target spokesperson declined to disclose the number of stores where the merchandise will not be available, but the company said its online shop would offer a full assortment. The moves were first reported by Bloomberg. </p><p>“Target is committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round,” Target said in an emailed statement. “Most importantly, we want to create a welcoming and supportive environment for our LGBTQIA+ team members, which reflects our culture of care for the over 400,000 people who work at Target.”</p>
    

<p>Kelley Robinson, president of the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, said Target’s decision was disappointing and risks alienating LGBTQ+ individuals and allies at the risk of not only profits, but also their values.</p>

Target also moved displays to the back of its stores in certain Southern locations last year.</p><p>But Target faced a second backlash <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/target-lgbtq-pride-month-bathing-suits-21393e91a8eb6110b46623d17a3bf507">from customers upset</a></span> by the discount retailer’s reaction to aggressive, anti-LGBTQ+ activism, which has also been sweeping through <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/transgender-health-care-republican-legislatures-5d98832c0234de079263672c738e0631">Republican state legislatures.</a></span> Civil rights groups scolded the company for caving to customers who expressed outrage over a selection of gender-fluid bathing suits it carried last year. The anti-LGBTQ+ customers also posted threatening videos on social media from inside the stores.</p>
    

<p>Target’s latest moves are just another example of how companies are struggling to cater to different groups of customers at a time of extreme cultural divisions, particularly around transgender rights. Last year, beer brand Bud Light angered some customers with its attempt to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/Target%20declined%20to%20confirm%20which%20items%20it%20was%20removing%20but%20among%20the%20ones%20that%20garnered%20attention%20were%20adult%20women%E2%80%99s%20swimsuits%20that%20can%20be%20used%20to%20tuck%20%E2%80%9Cmale%20genitalia.%E2%80%9D%20A%20group%20of%20designs%20by%20British%20designer%20Eric%20Cullen%20whose%20T-shirts%20referred%20to%20Satan%20also%20were%20targets%20of%20intense%20outcry.%20The%20merchandise%20hit%20stores%20and%20online%20in%20early%20May.%20Target%20confirmed%20that%20it%20had%20already%20relocated%20its%20section%20of%20Pride%20merchandise%20from%20the%20front%20of%20the%20stores%20to%20the%20back%20in%20some%20Southern%20stores%20after%20confrontations%20and%20backlash%20from%20shoppers%20in%20those%20areas.">broaden its customer base</a></span> by partnering with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. </p><p>Minneapolis-based Target and other retailers, such as Walmart and H&amp;M, expanded their Pride Month offerings a decade ago or longer. But transgender rights, including to gender-affirming health care and sports participation, have become politicized social issues, prompting lawmakers in some states to try to reverse activists’ previous gains. </p><p>Target’s move to scale back its presence of Pride merchandise for this year isn’t unexpected.</p><p>Last August, CEO Brian Cornell told reporters that Target learned from the backlash and said the company would be more thoughtful about merchandise decisions for heritage months that celebrate the achievements of marginalized groups. </p>
    

<p>Target said it would have a slightly more focused assortment and will reconsider the mix of its own and national brands with its external partners.</p><p>“As we navigate an ever-changing operating and social environment, we’re applying what we’ve learned to ensure we’re staying close to our guests and their expectations of Target,” Cornell said.</p>

<ol>
<li>The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has changed the rate structure for most California residents, effective next year.</li>
<li>Under the new system, most customers will pay a fixed monthly charge of $24.15, with low-income customers paying $6 to $12 a month.</li>
<li>The fixed charge will be paired with a reduction in rates assessed by energy usage, with rates decreasing by around 20% for each kilowatt-hour used.</li>
<li>California's residential electric rates are the highest in the country after Hawaii, with an average rate of 31.2 cents per kilowatt-hour in February.</li>
<li>The regulatory change aims to support the use of electric vehicles and appliances that run on electricity, rather than fossil fuels, and reduce monthly bills for millions of Californians.</li>

    <div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Utility regulators in California on Thursday changed how most residents will pay for energy by adding a new fixed monthly charge and lowering the rates that apply to energy use. Officials said the shift would reduce monthly bills for millions of residents and support the use of electric vehicles and appliances that run on electricity, rather than fossil fuels.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The decision by the California Public Utilities Commission will apply to the rates charged by investor-owned utilities, which provide power to about 70 percent of the state. Starting next year, most customers of those companies will be required to pay a $24.15 monthly charge. Low-income customers will pay $6 to $12 a month.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Regulators said the revenue from the fixed charge would be paired with a roughly 20 percent reduction in rates assessed by how many kilowatts of energy were used per hour by a home or business. (The average American home uses around 1,000 kilowatt-hours in a month.) California’s residential electric rates, which averaged 31.2 cents per kilowatt-hour in February, are the highest in the country after Hawaii, where rates were about 44 cents, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. The national average in February was 16.1 cents.</p><p class="css-zry96z" aria-live="polite" role="note"><a class="css-1081t4c" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=8WXW7">Subscribe to The Times</a> to read as many articles as you like.</p></div></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pasco Shikishima Corporation, a well-known Japanese bread brand, is recalling around 104,000 packs of its sliced white bread after parts of a black rat were found in at least two packets.</li>
<li>The bread was produced at a factory in Tokyo, and the company has suspended the assembly line. There have been no reported cases of anyone falling sick due to the contamination.</li>
<li>Pasco has apologized for the incident and pledged to "do our utmost to strengthen our quality controls so that this will never happen again".</li>
<li>The affected bread was exported to countries such as the US, China, Australia, and Singapore, among others.</li>
<li>Food recalls are rare in Japan, known for its high standards of sanitation, but there have been recent health scares involving food, including a recent outbreak of illnesses due to contaminated milk and a recall of dietary supplements linked to five deaths.</li>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-billionaire-real-estate-investor-expects-banking-struggles">Billionaire Real Estate Investor Expects Banking Struggles</h4>
<p>Throughout the year, the United States has been navigating an economy of increased frailty. Indeed, the Federal Reserve had enacted a two-year tightening campaign, increasing interest rates to combat high inflation. Now, the Central Bank has yet to cut rates, with many projecting dangers for the economy as a result. </p>


<p>One of them is billionaire real estate investor Barry Sternlicht, who expects one bank failure per week. Speaking to CNBC, the co-founder of the $115 billion Starwood Capital Group shared his grim prognosis for the current state of interest rates and their effect on smaller banks. </p>

<p>“I think people are looking for these cracks, and you’re going to see the crack develop now,” Sternlicht said. “You’re going to see a regional bank fail every day, or not—every week, maybe two a week,” he added. </p>
<p>2023 saw the highly publicized collapse of First Republic Bank. A regional lender in the Northeast, the institution had nearly $6 billion in assets and $4 billion in deposits. Indeed, the bank was the first casualty of what could be many as a result of high interest rates amid large real estate holdings. </p>
<p>Sternlicht has been a consistent voice, discussing the worrisome effect the rising rate would have on real estate and banking. In 2022, he was one of the first to profess the inevitability of a recession for the US economy, as it first began its tightening campaign. </p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gold prices surged</strong>: Gold prices rose by 1% to $2,369.49 per ounce, driven by weaker U.S. jobs data, which reinforced expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.</li>
<li><strong>Interest rate expectations</strong>: Financial markets expect the Federal Reserve to start easing its cycle in September, which could lead to a rate cut, benefiting gold prices as gold pays no interest.</li>
<li><strong>Technical factors</strong>: The surge in gold buying is mostly technically driven, with investors responding to recent changes in gold prices and market sentiment, according to Phillip Streible, chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of inflation data</strong>: Investors are looking forward to next week's U.S. producer price index and consumer price index data, which could significantly impact gold and silver prices. Hot inflation data could reduce expectations of an interest rate cut in September.</li>
<li><strong>Regional demand</strong>: In India, a key festival season sees near-record domestic prices stifling demand for physical gold, despite gold being a popular gift item during festivals.</li>
