Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, adding to opposition for the carmaker ahead of its annual general meeting next week.</p><p class="paywall-selector"></p><div class="paywall">



<p>“We remain concerned about the total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk,” Norges Bank Investment Management – the official name of the fund – said in a <a href="https://www.nbim.no/en/responsible-investment/voting/our-voting-records/meeting?m=1856850" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.nbim.no/en/responsible-investment/voting/our-voting-records/meeting?m=1856850" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">statement</a> Saturday. </p>



<p>The vote at next week’s AGM will be the second time Musk’s pay package has been put before shareholders. A judge voided an initial vote that approved the package in 2018. Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis &amp; Co. have recommended investors reject the proposal.</p>



<p>NBIM also voted against the pay package in 2018, though about three-quarters of investors backed it at the time. A Delaware judge voided the deal earlier this year, saying investors weren’t fully informed of key details.</p>



<p>The decision is “consistent with our vote on the same award in 2018,” the Norwegian fund said, adding it will “continue to seek constructive dialog with Tesla on this and other topics.” </p><p></p>



<p>The outcome of the shareholder vote is only advisory, though a loss would be a major embarrassment to Tesla’s board and to its top executive. Musk has also threatened to build products outside of Tesla if he can’t increase his equity holdings in the company, something the pay deal would allow him to do.</p>



<p>While NBIM said it would vote in favor of a management proposal to move the company’s corporate home to Texas from Delaware, it plans to back a shareholder proposal calling on Tesla to adopt new policies related to collective bargaining and freedom of association.</p>



<p>The latter proposal, a response to an almost seven-month long strike by Swedish Tesla technicians, is being supported by several of the Nordic region’s biggest asset owners. Tesla has urged shareholders to vote against it, saying “the company is already committed to protecting its employees’ rights.”</p>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) — Economists are divided over how many interest-rate cuts Federal Reserve officials will signal for 2024 at their policy meeting next week, following a pop in recent inflation figures.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>Policymakers are likely to back away from a longstanding forecast for three rate reductions this year, but it’s a close call on whether they will still pencil in two or not. A 41% plurality of economists expect the “dot plot” to show two cuts, while 41% expect the forecasts to show just one or no cuts at all, according to a Bloomberg survey.</p><p>The Federal Open Market Committee, which has held its benchmark rate at a two-decade high since last July, was encouraged by a sharp decline in inflation in the second half of 2023 to pencil in a gradual reduction in rates for this year. But those plans have been pushed back following a lack of progress to start 2024.</p><p>“The Fed is waiting for a string of data that strengthens its confidence that inflation is on sustained path toward its 2% target,” Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a survey response. “The balance of risks to our forecast for inflation are still weighted to the upside.”</p><figure class="caas-figure"></figure><p>Officials are all but certain to keep the rate steady in a 5.25% to 5.5% range for a seventh consecutive meeting next week. Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues will update their economic and rate projections at the June 11-12 meeting for the first time since March.</p><p>Fewer cuts would indicate a later start to reductions. That could have implications for the presidential election in November, though Fed officials uniformly say their decisions are based solely on economic considerations.</p><p>Fed watchers expect the first cut to happen at the central bank’s September policy meeting, the final gathering before voters head to the polls on Nov. 5. They also see policymakers slightly raising their 2024 inflation estimates, while reiterating their forecasts for growth in US gross domestic product at an annual rate of 2.1% and a year-end unemployment rate of 4%.</p><p>The poll of 43 economists was conducted from May 31 to June 5.</p><p>The vast majority of those surveyed said the Fed will cut rates in response to lower inflation, rather than some shortfall in the labor market or economic shock. None of the economists said there is much likelihood that the next rate move will be higher — an outcome occasionally mentioned as a possibility by officials such as Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>A host of Fed leaders have suggested in recent weeks they see no rush to cut rates, with inflation more persistent and the outlook for growth staying solid. Inflation by the Fed’s preferred measure was 2.7% in the year through April, and economists expect relatively little progress toward the central bank’s 2% goal in the second half of the year when compared to low monthly figures in late 2023.</p><figure class="caas-figure"></figure><p>Prior to a self-imposed quiet period, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the central bank might consider lowering rates “at the end of this year,” a view echoed by Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic. Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester said she wants to see “a few more months of inflation data that looks like it’s coming down,” while the Boston Fed’s Susan Collins said “patience really matters.”</p><p>Almost all respondents expect the Fed to maintain its May 1 guidance that no reduction would be appropriate until the central bank has more confidence inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. The economists are split on how the FOMC will characterize inflation, with a plurality expecting the committee to repeat that there has been a lack of recent progress.</p><p>“The FOMC is likely to say there has been some encouraging data, but that it needs to see more evidence for confidence to return,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust.</p><p>On the second day of next week’s meeting, the government will report the May consumer price index. While the Fed focuses on a separate measure of prices, the CPI is expected to show continued cooling of inflation.</p><p>“The CPI print is likely to impact the tone of the FOMC,” said Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research. “While we expect a tame print, a number below 0.30% could be seen as further evidence of slowing inflation.”</p><p>The Fed staff has been forecasting a soft landing for the economy since last July. Economists themselves have become increasingly optimistic about the growth outlook. Just 3% of respondents are forecasting a recession in the next 12 months, far below the 58% seen last July.</p><p>While Fed leaders have been vague on exactly what set of economic metrics would prompt a rate cut, 60% of the economists said an important catalyst would be three consecutive positive core inflation reports. Inflation figures from January to March disappointed, and economists say an equal number of good reports would set the stage for a rate cut.</p><figure class="caas-figure"></figure><p>Beyond that, “clear evidence of a slowdown in the labor market” might prompt reductions in rates, said Elisabet Kopelman, US economist for Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB.</p><p>The government’s May jobs report, published Friday, showed a mixed picture with regard to the state of the labor market. Growth in payrolls and wages accelerated, though the unemployment rate ticked higher and labor force participation fell.</p><p>Traders read the jobs data as likely to push back the timing of rate cuts on net, and now anticipate about 1.5 quarter-point reductions this year, according to futures contracts.</p><p>—With assistance from Sarina Yoo and Alex Tanzi.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

A year ago, just 8.2% of credit card debt was severely delinquent.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">If you’re experiencing delinquency, or at risk of it, experts advise speaking with a nonprofit credit counselor and negotiating with your creditors directly. Here’s what you should know:</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Bruce McClary, ​​​​​​​senior vice president at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, says that anyone at risk of delinquency should reach out as soon as possible for help from a nonprofit credit counselor, some of whom can be <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nfcc.org/">found through his organization</a>. The consultation is free, and a non-judgmental counselor can give guidance towards a long-term solution.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Nonprofits can also help create debt management plans that have lower interest rates, no late fees, and a single payment each month, McClary said. These plans may come with maintenance fees, which vary, but the fees are offset by the overall savings on the debt. McClary urged borrowers to be careful of scammers and for-profit debt consolidation companies, which often charge much higher fees than nonprofit organizations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-credit-counseling-en-1451/">a helpful breakdown comparing the two</a>.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Martin Lynch, president of the Financial Counseling Association of America, echoed this advice.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“Taking that first step and contacting a counselor is difficult for many people," Lynch said. He emphasized that consumers in debt should do their best to “first, relax,” and then to be as forthcoming as possible about their circumstances with the counselor.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“You’ll be talking to someone for free, who will listen to you describe your situation,” he said. “You can share your concerns without being judged for falling into difficulty.” </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Both Lynch and McClary urge borrowers to reach out directly to credit card companies to negotiate interest rates, fees, and long-term payment plans, noting that it's in the companies' best interests if you pay before the debt goes into collections.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“The best thing to do is to reach out, give an honest assessment of your ability to pay over time, and ask what options are available to you both ‘on and off-the-menu,’” McClary said. This kind of phrasing can give creditors an opening to offer more flexibility, he said. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">McClary and other experts stress that most credit card companies and other lenders have hardship programs available for cases like these. Such options gained visibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, when more companies publicly advertised that consumers facing difficulty may skip or defer payments without penalties. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The average annual interest rate on a new credit card is 24.71%, according to LendingTree, the highest since the company began tracking in 2019.

<li>American Airlines CEO Robert Isom has offered a 17% wage increase to flight attendants, which would bring new hires' starting salary above the threshold for food stamp eligibility.</li>
<li>The airline has offered the increase with no strings attached, citing "unusual times", and claimed the increase would take effect immediately.</li>
<li>The Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA) has rejected the offer, calling it a "PR move" and a attempt to improve the airline's public image ahead of strike negotiations.</li>
<li>Flight attendants have been struggling with low wages, with starting salaries of around $27,315 per year, which has not kept pace with inflation, which has surged 33% since 2014.</li>
<li>The proposed 17% increase would raise the starting wage to $31,959 per year, or $35.5 per flight hour, which would be enough to put junior flight attendants living alone above the threshold for food stamp eligibility in certain states.</li>

<p>As the airline and its attendants negotiate, American CEO Robert Isom this week sent a video message offering a 17% wage increase, just enough to push new Boston and Miami flight attendants above food stamp eligibility.</p>



<p>The airline said the pay increase would take effect immediately and claimed it is not “asking anything from the union in return,” an unusual move, Isom said in the video message, which was confirmed by an American Airlines spokesperson. “But these are unusual times.” </p>



<p>Still, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA) rejected the offer, calling it a “PR move” ahead of strike negotiations that will take place between American Airlines and the union next week. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Inflation surges, pay stays flat</h2>



<p>APFA and American Airlines have been in negotiations over a new contract on and off since the previous one expired in 2019, APFA President Julie Hedrick told <em>Fortune</em>. </p><p></p>



<p>“We’re behind on everything,” Hedrick said. She cited low wages and low pay for food expenses on trips as the most pressing issues. When flight attendants go on domestic trips, they receive an additional $2.20 an hour for food expenses; for international flights, they receive $2.50. These numbers are “very behind” what food actually costs today, Hendrick said. </p>



<p>Since 2014, when the previous contract was negotiated, flight attendants have been left with measly starting salaries even as inflation has shot up 33%, Hedrick said According to an employment verification letter from American, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/21/american-airlines-flight-attendant-starting-salary-ceo-food-stamps-union/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/21/american-airlines-flight-attendant-starting-salary-ceo-food-stamps-union/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">which circulated on Reddit</a> a few weeks ago, an entry-level flight attendant can expect to make $27,315 a year, before taxes. (Like many airlines, American pays its attendants only for the time <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/02/12/flight-attendants-don-t-earn-their-hourly-pay-until-aircraft-doors-close-here-s-why/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.opb.org/article/2024/02/12/flight-attendants-don-t-earn-their-hourly-pay-until-aircraft-doors-close-here-s-why/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">the plane is in the air</a>.Boarding passengers, waiting between flights, and traveling to and from the airport all mean flight attendants typically work about two hours for each “flight hour” they are paid.) </p>



<p>With American’s proposed 17% increase, the starting wage jumps to $31,959 per year, or $35.5 per flight hour. That rate pushes junior flight attendants who live alone above the level for qualifying for food stamps in states like Massachusetts or Florida. </p>



<p>Most new flight attendant hires are required to live in cities like Dallas, Miami, and New York, which have high costs of living that they cannot afford, Hedrick noted. </p>



<p>American flight attendants are sleeping in their cars, she said. Some of them fight for trips just for the chance to eat the plane meals, if the pilots don’t take their meals first. </p><p></p>



<p>“Our new hire flight attendants are struggling,” Hendrick said, adding that new hires most strongly rejected the 17% hike.</p>



<p>For these attendants, lagging pay adds insult to injury when seen against the backdrop of the post-pandemic years, which exacerbated longstanding issues in the industry including staffing shortage, long hours, and unruly passengers, some of whom <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2024/01/09/flight-diverted-man-punches-flight-attendant/72165848007/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2024/01/09/flight-diverted-man-punches-flight-attendant/72165848007/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">assault airline staff.</a> </p>



<p>That’s leading to record burnout among attendants. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">18 months of pickets</h2>



<p>“We have picketed for a year and a half, and we’ve done at least 11 pickets,” Hedrick said. “Our flight attendants have demonstrated our resolve and our solidarity to get a contract, an industry meeting-contract that we deserve and we will take nothing less.”</p>



<p>APFA is proposing a raise of 33% — in line with the rise in inflation since 2014—with a cap at $91 per hour during the first year of a new contract, with pay raises for each year after.</p><p></p>



<p>An American Airlines spokesperson told <em>Fortune</em> that the video message “represents the latest from American.” They did not answer questions about the proposal or the upcoming negotiations. </p>



<p>Of the 39 separate issues on the table – such as sick leave or crew rest, APFA and American have reached a “tentative agreement” on 25. The other 14 are associated with compensation, expenses, vacations, and other terms of agreement. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">100-year law could snarl strike</h2>



<p>Union leaders face an uphill battle as they head to Washington next week to negotiate. Airline strikes are exceedingly rare—the last one occurred in 2010, <a href="https://public.alpa.org/PressRoom/SpiritPilotsonStrike/tabid/4581/Default.aspx" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://public.alpa.org/PressRoom/SpiritPilotsonStrike/tabid/4581/Default.aspx" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">when Spirit Airlines pilots went on strike for five days. </a></p>



<p>That’s because railway and airline workers are not allowed to strike unless given the green light by federal mediator groups, via the 1926 <a href="https://railroads.dot.gov/sites/fra.dot.gov/files/fra_net/1647/Railway%20Labor%20Act%20Overview.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://railroads.dot.gov/sites/fra.dot.gov/files/fra_net/1647/Railway%20Labor%20Act%20Overview.pdf" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Railway Labor Act. </a>One such group, the National Mediation Board, will oversee the American Airlines negotiations, and can allow a strike to occur if it finds that the groups are at an impasse. Still, the federal government can also block a strike—as happened in December 2022, when President Joe Biden signed a measure <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/12/02/congress-passes-bill-imposing-rail-contract-avert-crippling-railroad-shutdown-without-paid-sick-days-unions-wanted/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2022/12/02/congress-passes-bill-imposing-rail-contract-avert-crippling-railroad-shutdown-without-paid-sick-days-unions-wanted/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">passed by Congress</a> to impose a contract between rail companies and workers that many workers had rejected. </p>



<p>Biden, <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/13/biden-most-pro-union-president-us-history-massive-looming-uaw-auto-workers-strike-put-to-test/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/09/13/biden-most-pro-union-president-us-history-massive-looming-uaw-auto-workers-strike-put-to-test/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">who has called himself</a> “the most pro-union president” in history, enforced the agreement to avoid an “economic catastrophe” during the holidays, he said at the time. With multiple major railroad companies at threat of a industry-wide strike, the stakes for an agreement were <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/11/22/rail-worker-strike-looming-devastate-economy-supply-chains/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2022/11/22/rail-worker-strike-looming-devastate-economy-supply-chains/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">extremely high</a>; $2 billion could’ve been lost every day of a strike. </p><p></p>



<p>The stakes for a possible strike at American are less dire, since other major carriers would not be affected.</p>



<p>But American attendants aren’t the only one calling for wage hikes. <a href="https://fortune.com/company/united-continental-holdings/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/united-continental-holdings/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">United Airlines</a> is <a href="https://www.afacwa.org/ual_picket_contract_executive_comp_skyrockets" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.afacwa.org/ual_picket_contract_executive_comp_skyrockets" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">still negotiating</a> a new contract with their flight attendants. <a href="https://fortune.com/company/southwest-airlines/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/southwest-airlines/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Southwest Airlines</a>, in April, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/24/southwest-airlines-raises-union-negotiations/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/24/southwest-airlines-raises-union-negotiations/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">approved a contract</a> that includes pay raises totaling more than 33% over four years. The union representing Southwest flight attendants, the Transport Workers Union, said that it provided record gains for flight attendants and sets an industry standard. </p>



<p>APFA, likewise, is asking for a 33% hike, with raises of 5%, 4%, and 4% for the remaining years of a four-year agreement. </p>



<p>The union has also stated that they will not accept any deal without retroactive pay. Last year, American Airlines awarded pilots $230 million in retroactive pay after negotiations with its pilots’ union. </p>



<p>Hendrick’s message regarding the 17% hike seems to be: We want the whole package, not piecemeal raises. </p><p></p>



<p>“Our flight attendants want nothing to do with it,” she said. “They, overwhelmingly, yesterday said, ‘No, we want a contract. We’ve been in negotiations long enough, and it’s time to get this deal done.’”</p></div></div>

<li><strong>Reasons for the surge</strong>: Investors are reacting favorably to the upcoming stock split, which is seen as a positive sign from management that the share price is expected to continue to rise.</li>
<li><strong>Stock splits can boost demand</strong>: Stock splits make individual shares cheaper and more accessible to retail investors, which can help boost demand and drive up the share price.</li>

<li><strong>Dow Jones Index rules</strong>: The Dow Jones Index is price-weighted, which means that the degree to which each stock impacts the index is based on its share price. This means that Nvidia's high stock price would distort the index if it were to be added to the Dow.</li>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>Shares of <strong>Nvidia </strong><span class="ticker">(NASDAQ: NVDA)</span> have soared since the company reported a strong first-quarter earnings report on May 22 and announced a 10-for-1 stock split.</p><p>Since then, the stock has jumped roughly 20% in less than two weeks, and its momentum seems to be continuing into the <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/s/stock-split/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4decf920-c903-4d67-a9ba-243aba7d145a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stock split;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="0">stock split</a>, which is scheduled to go into effect after hours on June 7. Shares have climbed nearly 10% after the initial bounce on those announcements.</p><p>There are a number of reasons investors are reacting favorably to Nvidia's upcoming split. First, even though stock splits don't change the fundamentals of a stock or the business, investors seem to believe that splits are a positive sign from management that it expects the share price to keep moving up.</p><p>A stock split also acts as a reset for the share price, effectively signaling that it has reached a certain milestone and is ready to run up again.</p><p>Splits also make individual shares cheaper, leaving them more accessible to retail investors, which can help boost demand. And there's also evidence that stock splits are correlated with outperformance over the next year, which could be due to a combination of both the momentum in the business that led to the stock split in the first place and enthusiasm from investors resulting from the split.</p><p>However, in the case of Nvidia's upcoming split, there's an added reason investors have become even more bullish.</p><p>Some investors believe that Nvidia could replace <strong>Intel </strong><span class="ticker">(NASDAQ: INTC)</span> in the <strong>Dow Jones Industrial Average </strong><span class="ticker">(DJINDICES: ^DJI)</span>, fully establishing it as a blue chip tech stock.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">Image source: Getty Images.</figcaption></p></figure><h2>Why Nvidia isn't in the Dow yet</h2><p>The Dow Jones is a price-weighted index, which means that the degree to which each stock impacts the index is based on its share price. That's an important difference from the <strong>S&amp;P 500 </strong>and the <strong>Nasdaq </strong>indexes, which are weighted based on market cap.</p><p>If Nvidia were to be added to the Dow at its pre-split share price, it would have by far the highest weight and distort the index, which is based on 30 blue chip stocks from diverse industries and meant to reflect the broad market.</p><p>However, the stock should have a share price of around $110 to $120 after the split, which puts it near the median price of current Dow companies.</p><h2>Why Intel could get booted from the Dow</h2><p>There aren't strict criteria for stocks to be admitted or kicked out of the Dow Jones, but according to <strong>S&amp;P Global</strong>, which manages the index, a Dow stock should be a blue chip company; have an excellent reputation, sustained growth, and wide investor interest, and contribute to sector balance.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>At this point, it's fair to question Intel's ability to deliver sustained growth because it has long been a laggard in the <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/semiconductor-stocks/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4decf920-c903-4d67-a9ba-243aba7d145a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:semiconductor industry;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="0">semiconductor industry</a>. Over the last decade, the stock has gained just 11%, trailing the Dow Jones by a wide margin, and Intel hasn't posted a quarter with double-digit revenue growth in nearly four years even as peers like Nvidia report much faster growth.</p><p>The last stock to be removed from the Dow Jones was <strong>Walgreens Boots Alliance</strong>, which came after several quarters of underperformance and weak results, similar to what Intel has been experiencing.</p><p>If Intel were to be dropped from the Dow, Nvidia would be a logical replacement -- both stocks represent the semiconductor industry. Nvidia is also now much larger than Intel, with a market cap of $2.8 trillion, compared to Intel's $129 billion.</p><h2>What joining the Dow would mean for Nvidia stock</h2><p>Being admitted to the Dow likely wouldn't have a huge effect on Nvidia's stock price. Unlike the S&amp;P 500, the Dow isn't widely tracked by ETFs, meaning that investors don't generally invest in it directly the way they do with the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>In fact, only one ETF, the <strong>SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF</strong>, offers a way to get direct exposure to the Dow Jones index and only the Dow Jones.</p><p>Still, it would be a psychological win for Nvidia to gain entry to the hallowed blue chip index. And it would make sense because Nvidia is now the third most-valuable company in the world -- and the most valuable not to be included in the Dow because both <strong>Apple </strong>and <strong>Microsoft </strong>are members.</p><p>It would also act as a stamp of approval from the committee that Nvidia's success isn't seen as a fleeting phenomenon or a bubble.</p><p>At the same time, removal would be the latest setback for Intel, but it seems to be deserved, given its long-term underperformance. At this point, there are clearly better representatives from the semiconductor industry to include in the index.</p><p>Reviews and rebalancing are rare for the Dow Jones, but it makes sense here. Don't be surprised to see Nvidia replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average once the stock split goes through, though the timing of such a decision will remain a mystery.</p><h2>Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?</h2><p>Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:</p><p>The <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the <strong><a href="https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=6b978bfe-bb56-4585-b831-ed1aa2a583ee&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-foolcom-sa-bbn-dyn%3Faid%3D8867%26amp%253Bsource%3Disaeditxt0010895%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D13885&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4decf920-c903-4d67-a9ba-243aba7d145a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 best stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="0">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

<p>(WJW) — <a href="http://fox8.com/tag/red-lobster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Lobster</a> plans to close eight Ohio locations, including three in Northeast Ohio, amid its Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring, court filings show.</p>



<p>The seafood restaurant chain <a href="https://www.redlobster.com/news-press/press/2024/05/19/red_lobster-files-voluntary-chapter-11-petitions-to-strengthen-financial-position-and-maximize-value-for-stakeholders/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.redlobster.com/news-press/press/2024/05/19/red_lobster-files-voluntary-chapter-11-petitions-to-strengthen-financial-position-and-maximize-value-for-stakeholders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a news release last month</a> announced it would sell off “substantially all of its assets” as it looks to streamline following financial losses.</p>



<p>In all, nearly 100 locations across the country may shut down if the company can’t renegotiate their leases. </p>



<p>According to bankruptcy court filings in Florida, Red Lobster has rejected unexpired leases at eight of its Ohio locations:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Columbus</strong>: 1691 Dublin-Granville Road</li>



<li><strong>Dayton</strong>: 6500 Miller Lane</li>



<li><strong>Findlay</strong>: 2340 Tiffin Ave.</li>



<li><strong>Maumee</strong>: 1422 Reynolds Road</li>



<li><strong>New Philadelphia</strong>: 255 Graff Road SE</li>



<li><strong>Parma</strong>: 7607 Day Drive</li>



<li><strong>Strongsville</strong>: 17227 Southpark Center</li>



<li><strong>Toledo</strong>: 4990 Monroe St.</li>
</ul>



<p>Filings show the restaurant chain has also rejected the lease for its former Orange Village location at 3655 Orange Place, which closed in 2022 after 45 years, according to reports.</p>



<p>The company closed dozens of locations last month before filing for bankruptcy, and planned to auction off those eateries’ kitchen equipment and furniture, <a href="https://fox8.com/news/red-lobster-is-closing-dozens-of-restaurants-and-auctioning-off-furniture-equipment/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fox8.com/news/red-lobster-is-closing-dozens-of-restaurants-and-auctioning-off-furniture-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexstar reported</a>.</p>





<p>The company endured an executive shakeup between 2021 and 2022. Though the addition of the company’s “Ultimate Endless Shrimp” limited special to its regular menu drove business in 2023, it ultimately backfired, leading to an $11 million operating loss in one quarter, <a href="https://fox8.com/news/red-lobster-is-closing-dozens-of-restaurants-and-auctioning-off-furniture-equipment/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fox8.com/news/red-lobster-is-closing-dozens-of-restaurants-and-auctioning-off-furniture-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexstar reported</a>.</p>



<p>Several other Northeast Ohio locations are still open, according to its website, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Akron</strong>: 3901 Medina Road</li>



<li><strong>Ashtabula</strong>: 3013 N. Ridge Road E</li>



<li><strong>Canton</strong>: 4600 Belden Village St. NW</li>



<li><strong>Cuyahoga Falls</strong>: 1090 Graham Road</li>



<li><strong>Elyria</strong>: 6935 Midway Mall Blvd.</li>



<li><strong>Mansfield</strong>: 2322 W. 4th St.</li>



<li><strong>Mentor</strong>: 7744 Reynolds Road</li>



<li><strong>North Olmsted</strong>: 25615 Brookpark Road</li>



<li><strong>Sandusky</strong>: 4016 Milan Road</li>



<li><strong>Wooster</strong>: 3805 Burbank Road</li>



<li><strong>Youngstown</strong>: 1410 Boardman-Poland Road</li>
</ul>

                                        <p>BOSTON (AP) — A soaring demand for food delivered fast has spawned small armies of couriers — and increasing alarm — in big cities where scooters, motorcycles and mopeds zip in and out of traffic and hop onto pedestrian-filled sidewalks as their drivers race to drop off salads and sandwiches. </p><p>Officials in Boston, New York and Washington, D.C., have started cracking down on delivery companies by issuing warning letters, seizing illegally registered or driven vehicles, and launching special street patrols to enforce speed limits. The pushback is not limited to the U.S.: There have also been a series of crackdowns in London and other British cities.</p><p>For their part, the delivery companies have pledged to work with city officials to ensure that all of their drivers operate both legally and safely.</p><p>In a letter this week to food delivery companies DoorDash, Grubhub and Uber, Boston officials cited an “alarming increase in unlawful and dangerous operation of motorcycles, mopeds and motorized scooters” that they said put the drivers, other motorists and pedestrians “in imminent danger.” </p>
    

<p>The letter alleged that some drivers were operating unregistered vehicles and breaking traffic laws, and warned of an imminent crackdown on the vehicles. It also demanded that the companies explain how they can ensure their drivers are operating safely. The Massachusetts State Police said they identified dozens of mopeds and scooters that were improperly registered or being operated by unlicensed drivers. Fourteen illegal mopeds and scooters were seized Wednesday in one Boston neighborhood alone.</p>



<p>In New York City, authorities have seized 13,000 scooters and mopeds so far this year; on Wednesday, they crushed more than 200 illegal mopeds and other delivery vehicles. Authorities in Washington, D.C., meanwhile, launched a program Wednesday called Operation Ride Right to ensure drivers of two-wheeled vehicles are complying with the law. Since it began, authorities have made five arrests and impounded 17 mopeds. </p>
    
<p>“They have terrorized many of our pedestrians, particularly our senior and older adults,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Wednesday at an event in which motorized two-wheeled delivery vehicles were destroyed. “Riders who think the rules don’t apply to them, they’re going to see an aggressive enforcement policy that’s in place.”</p>
    

<p>When food delivery services had their major resurgence during the COVID-19 pandemic, most drivers used cars to deliver their fare. That led to increased traffic congestion, prompting a shift to motorcycles and other two-wheeled modes of transportation.</p><p>The drivers, many of them immigrants from Latin American countries but also from West Africa and South Asia, say they are just trying to earn a living and are providing a service that gets customers their food fast. </p><p>“We’re not all bad,” said Luis López, a delivery driver from the Dominican Republic who spoke to The Associated Press on Friday from his motorcycle in an area of multiple fast-food restaurants near the Boston Public Library. “We come to work, to earn a living, pay the rent and send something to our families.” </p>
    

<p>López, who came to the U.S. about three years ago, acknowledged that some drivers are unlicensed or driving unregistered vehicles, and he’s seen them running red lights and onto sidewalks, menacing pedestrians. Some people are so reckless that they’re also putting other delivery drivers at risk, he said. </p><p>He said he was among a group of 10 delivery drivers outside a Chick-fil-A on Thursday night when a police officer approached them with a flyer describing how to register their scooters and mopeds. The whole group agreed to do just that.</p><p>“We have to respect the law,” he said, speaking in Spanish. “We are going to respect the law so that they let us work here.”</p><p>Drivers of motorized two-wheeled vehicles are coming under much more scrutiny than was faced years ago by other gig workers in cars, such as Uber and Lyft drivers, because they can more easily violate traffic laws, said Hilary Robinson, an associate professor of law and sociology at Northeastern University.</p>
    

<p>The switch to the vehicles “is really an attempt to make low-wage, high-risk labor available so that all of us can have cheap goods and services,” Robinson said. “It’s perhaps one of the reasons why people are starting to realize that there really is no such thing as a free lunch.”</p><p>William Medina, a delivery worker in New York who is also an organizing leader with the Los Deliveristas Unidos Campaign, blames the delivery companies. </p><p>“This is a problem that started because the companies force you to complete the deliveries from far distances,” he said in a telephone interview Friday. Medina started out delivering food on a bicycle, switched to an electric bike, and now is using a moped to make the longer trips.</p>
    

<p>“If you have to complete the delivery 6 miles, 7 miles, you have to complete it,” he said.</p><p>Among those advocating for tougher enforcement in Boston is City Councilor Edward Flynn, who said on Facebook that it “can no longer be the Wild West on the streets of Boston.”</p><p>“Everyone using city roads needs to abide by the rules of the road. If you’re able to go 25 mph like a car — you should be licensed, registered, and carry liability insurance in the event of an accident and injury,” he wrote.</p><p>Some Boston residents are supportive of tougher action against the scooters.</p><p>“I get frustrated when they don’t follow the traffic laws,” said Anne Kirby, a 25-year-old student having lunch in a Boston neighborhood within a few hundred feet of several scooters. “I feel like I almost get hit every day when they go through the crosswalk when it’s not their turn to go.”</p><p>But Jaia Samuel, a 25-year-old hospital worker from Boston, was more conflicted. She said she agreed that delivery scooters can be dangerous, but she also acknowledged that she relies heavily on delivery services for her food.</p><p>“I do think it’s unsafe to an extent, the weaving in between cars and the not stopping for red lights,” she said. “But I feel like everybody should be able to make a living, so who am I to say anything? It would be unfortunate for me. I would be taking a hit with the crackdown on them. I order a lot of Uber Eats, DoorDash.”</p><p>Three major food delivery services have pledged to work with officials and neighborhood advocates to address the problem.</p><p>“The overwhelming majority of Dashers do the right thing and like all drivers must follow the rules of the road. If they don’t, then they face consequences — just like anyone else,” DoorDash said in a statement Wednesday.</p><p>Grubhub said its employees already agree to obey all local traffic laws. “While enforcement of the law is best handled by the police, we take safety seriously and will take action to address any reports of unsafe driving,” the company said in a statement Thursday.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Michael Warren in Decatur, Georgia, and Lisa J.

The price. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The average cost of a Shein-branded clothing item is just £7.90 and at any one time, it has as many as 600,000 items for sale on its online platform, dwarfing rivals like Zara or Boohoo.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It's also snapped up competitors like Missguided, while Xu Yangtian, who rarely gives interviews, is now said to be one of China's richest men.  </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The real turning point for the brand came during the pandemic, when online shopping took off and Shein's sales soared, says Louise Déglise-Favre from analysts GlobalData.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The firm has also made smart use of social media, recruiting popular influencers and university students to promote its clothing on TikTok and Instagram.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"The brand’s success coincided with a boom in TikTok usage in Europe and the US," says Ms Déglise-Favre. "The Chinese social media platform participated greatly in spreading awareness about the Shein’s ultra-affordable proposition." </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It has drawn in shoppers by getting pop stars like Rita Ora and Katy Perry to perform at its virtual concerts, but it also attracts a vast amount of organic user-generated content.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">You might well have scrolled past so-called "haul" videos of young women emptying out their newly-arrived packages and giving their frank reviews of crop tops, dresses or beauty blenders from the site.</p></div><p

bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Shein's business model is similar to Amazon's, in that it partners with thousands of third-party suppliers - many of them in China, Brazil and Turkey - to manufacture its clothes and then ships them from giant, centralised warehouses.  </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It has also sped up the "test and repeat" model made famous by other fast fashion giants including H&amp;M and Zara owner Inditex. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">This sees Shein suppliers produce items in small numbers, of between 100-200 pieces, and then produce more of any style that is a hit.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The brand can turn around a new item in just 25 days - something that would take other retailers months. </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It also uses "gamification" strategies to boost customer engagement on its shopping app which is used by millions of people worldwide.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Users get points and discounts for logging in daily, sharing purchases on social media and referring friends.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"That encourages users to repeat such behaviours to earn more rewards and, as a result, they keep coming back, engaging with the app, and making purchases," says Vilma Todri, an associate professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business School in the US.   </p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 cgtasL"><div data-testid="image"

    <div><div class="regwall">



<p>Back in 2010, the U.S. had around 12 million more unemployed people than it had job vacancies, senior McKinsey partner Anu Madgavkar said during the consultancy’s media day last week. “Despite the ups and downs of Covid, things are more normal now, but we still have a deficit—2.5 million more vacancies than job seekers.”</p>



<p>That imbalance, coupled with the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/anthropics-chief-of-staff-avital-balwit-ai-remote-work/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/anthropics-chief-of-staff-avital-balwit-ai-remote-work/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">ever-present advancements in AI</a>, has led to what Madgavkar calls a “skills tsunami.” She defined the term as the massive shift in capabilities workers are soon going to need. There’s also, she added, a “silver tsunami,” which describes the institutional loss of talent and perspective as <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/23/baby-boomers-keeping-economy-afloat/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/23/baby-boomers-keeping-economy-afloat/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">millions of older workers</a> head into retirement. </p>



<p>Reacting to both those tsunamis with agility comes back to employee support and nurturing. “How do we increase internal mobility to help our existing workforce learn more skills?” Madgavkar said. “How do you come back to performance management? The companies that do that well, end up most successful.” </p>



<p>A key aspect to performance oversight will be continual productivity growth. On the panel, Kweilin Ellingrud, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute, defined productivity growth as simply “producing more, with either the same or less inputs.” It matters to everyone, even those at the very bottom of the corporate ladder, because over time, productivity growth drives standards of living. The good news: Median productivity growth has increased sixfold since the turn of the millennium, Ellingrud said. “Globally, productivity is a great story.”</p><p></p>



<p>AI, of course, will play a significant role too. Per McKinsey’s<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL"> newest research report</a> on the state of AI, released Thursday, nearly two-thirds of companies are already using generative AI regularly—double the percentage that said the same 10 months ago. Three quarters of respondents said they think gen AI will lead to “significant” or “disruptive” changes in their industries going forward.</p>



<p>To be prepared for those changes, many American businesses are currently considering a “relayering” of their workforce, which in practice often means leaving more room for nuance in organizational structure—and often redefining the <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/26/middle-managers-burned-out-stressed-rto-layoffs-glassdoor/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/26/middle-managers-burned-out-stressed-rto-layoffs-glassdoor/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">middle manager role</a> from scratch. </p>



<p>“Clients are asking, how do I equip the middle manager to deliver full value for his other teams?” Brooke Weddle, a senior McKinsey partner, said. “That requires, probably, fewer managers, and for those that remain, re-scoping their role.”</p>



<p>Then there are the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/30/ai-skill-shortages-automation-honeywell/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/01/30/ai-skill-shortages-automation-honeywell/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">persistent talent shortages</a>, both in tech and skilled trades. “Given the churn we’re experiencing, not only do we not have enough skilled trade workers, we have a mismatch resulting in what we call $5 billion worth of cost to U.S. companies,” Weddle said.</p></div></div>

              </figcaption></figure><p>As homebuyers in today's market know, timing is everything. If they had acted in 2020 or 2021, for example, they'd have locked in an ultra-low <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-todays-mortgage-and-mortgage-refinance-interest-rates/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">mortgage or mortgage refinance rate</a></span>. Over the next few years, however, <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-june-cpi-report-hit-new-high-40-years-9-1-percent/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">inflation</a></span> surged and <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/interest-rate-mortgage-highest-since-2000/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">rates</a></span> more than doubled, currently hovering near their highest point since 2000. So it's critical to act when the opportunity presents itself.</p><p>That's also true for savers and those looking to exploit today's high-rate climate. By opening a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/high-yield-savings-account/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">high-yield savings</a></span> or <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whats-a-certificate-of-deposit-cd/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">certificate of deposit (CD)</a></span> account in the last few years, savers were able to earn exponentially more than if they had acted when rates were low. </p><p>The timing surrounding a CD opening, however, is also critical to get right. And despite some cooling in the inflation rate, now is still an opportune time to get started. And there are a few compelling reasons why savers may want to be prepared to open an account next week, in mid-June. Below, we'll break down two of them.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-cd-in-mid-june&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-cd-in-mid-june%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=9902d69b-3a63-4f86-8af2-6f42e09c682c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See how much more you could be earning with a top CD account here now</a>.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Why you should open a CD in mid-June</strong></h2><p>If you've been considering opening a CD this inflationary cycle, the timing could be right to act next week, specifically on June 12 and June 13. Here's why:</p>

    
<p id="leader-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="leader-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-leader-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"leader-plus-outstream-middle"'>
    </p>
<h3><strong>The next inflation report will be released</strong></h3><p>Inflation reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics have been mixed so far in 2024, with most showing little progress in further reducing the inflation rate. After <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-cpi-consumer-price-index-march-2024/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">rising in March</a></span> inflation <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-cpi-report-april-2024/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">barely fell in April</a></span>, moving from 3.5% to 3.4%. That's more than a full percentage point above the Federal Reserve's target 2% goal. </p><p>But a new inflation report will be released on June 12, revealing the latest progress toward taming inflation. If that report is as disappointing as many of the others releases this year, it could indicate a "higher rates for longer" approach taken by the Federal Reserve. And if the report is particularly problematic, it could result in the Fed raising rates — <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-hikes-interest-rate-to-22-year-high-july-2023/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">already at a 23-year high</a></span> — even higher to complete the cooling of this inflationary cycle.</p><p>If either happens, then, savers should be prepared to take advantage of the rate climate (<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-todays-cd-interest-rates/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">CD rates</a></span> change often) by locking in the highest CD rate they can find. Since rates on these types of accounts are locked, savers could earn high returns for months and even years to come, even if inflation and interest rates were to fall in the future.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-cd-in-mid-june&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-cd-in-mid-june%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=9902d69b-3a63-4f86-8af2-6f42e09c682c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Start shopping for the right CD online today</a>.</p><h3><strong>The next Fed rate announcement will be released</strong></h3><p>In an ironic twist, the Federal Reserve will release its latest announcement on the future of interest rates on the same day the newest inflation report comes out. But a formal hike to the federal funds rate — currently at a range between 5.25% and 5.50% — doesn't necessarily have to occur for rates on CDs to head upward. </p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'>
    </p>
<p>Even a simple indication that rate cuts will be put off to later in the year or be pushed off into 2025 and beyond, could cause a slight increase in what lenders offer on savings vehicles. So those looking for a CD should be prepared to act, both on June 12 and June 13, after the revelation of the inflation numbers and Fed announcement have had a chance to reverberate throughout the wider economy.</p><p>Plus, even if the Fed announces an imminent cut — which appears unlikely at this stage — it will almost certainly be a minimal one (25 basis points to start). While that may potentially reduce what you can earn with a CD, considering that many come with <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/best-cds-to-open-for-june-2024-up-to-5-30/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">rates over 5%</a></span> right now, it's still worth opening for many savers.</p><h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>This June offers a rare opportunity for savers to take advantage of both inflation and the Fed's interest rate actions — on the same day. However, it will take some time to research your options and understand which lenders are offering the best rates and terms. So consider starting now so you're prepared to act when the opportunity arises. And be sure to carefully consider the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/short-term-cds-pros-and-cons-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">pros and cons of CDs</a></span> right now as depositing too much into one could ultimately result in paying an <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cd-early-withdrawal-penalties-what-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">early withdrawal penalty</a></span> to get your money back.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/cbsint_a10ef_cbsnews?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankrate.com%2Flanding%2Fcbsnews%2Fbest-cd-options%2F%3Fsub-id%3Dwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-cd-in-mid-june&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fwhy-you-should-open-a-cd-in-mid-june%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;article_id=9902d69b-3a63-4f86-8af2-6f42e09c682c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more about today's top CDs here now</a>.</p>

<p>I've read far too many books on ChatGPT and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p>Almost all of them are a waste of time when it comes to applying them to education.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p class="article_paragraph_2"></p>
<p>But, there are five books educators on LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook have recommended. And it's these five books I recommend to every educator exploring AI.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>
<p>I've authored a best-seller for educators on artificial intelligence, "<a href="https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" aria-label="The AI Classroom: The Ultimate Guide to Artificial Intelligence in Education">The AI Classroom: The Ultimate Guide to Artificial Intelligence in Education</a>," and I'm currently working on a practical guide for leaders on AI strategy. Being deeply immersed in the world of AI books for educators, I can confidently say that whether you are new to AI, experimenting with it, or already incorporating it into your practices, these are books worth your time:</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p>


<p>AI for Educators is a readable guide that translates AI through a teacher lens.</p>
<p>It offers practical ideas you can use in class right away. It unlocks powerful ways to streamline teaching, save time and paints a picture of the future our students will face, providing questions you can help them grapple with.</p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" class="inread-active" display-called=""></fbs-ad>
<p>Dana Leonardo, a technology integration educator from Gilbert, Arizona, praises the book for its clarity and practical advice: "Miller's book gets at the heart of what educators need to know about AI, including practical applications, benefits, and cautions. This text brilliantly explains how and why we need to use AI as a tool, while leveraging our most valuable asset—our humanity."</p>








<p>Salman Khan, the visionary behind Khan Academy, explores how AI and GPT technology will transform learning.</p>
<p>Khan offers a road map for teachers, parents and students to navigate this exciting new world. Beyond technology, Khan delves into the ethical and social implications of AI, providing insights on how administrators, guidance counselors and hiring managers can harness AI to build a more accessible education system.</p>

<p>Kevin Soli, a homeschooling parent from Papua New Guinea, highlights the book's value: "I homeschool my children so this book is very encouraging for me as a parent. ChatGPT is like your tech-buddy—not just to answer your prompts but to prompt you too, asking probing questions that challenge assumptions, clarify concepts and encourage deeper dialogue."</p>

<p>Furze explores the opportunities and challenges of AI in education.</p>
<p>He offers insights into its workings and ethical considerations. The book guides readers through the construction and ethics of generative AI, navigates policy landscapes and provides practical strategies. It has detailed sections on text and image generation and preparations for multimodal technologies like video, audio and 3D generation.</p>
<p>Al Kingsley, chair of Hampton Academies Trust in the UK, emphasizes the book’s approach: “This is an excellent book. It’s highly accessible, evidence informed and structured to step you through AI basics, ethics and assessment.”</p>

Edward Watson</h2>
<p>Bowen and Watson present emerging and powerful research on the seismic changes AI is already creating in schools and the workplace, providing invaluable insights into what AI can accomplish in the classroom and beyond.</p>
<p>Dr. Heather M. Brown, an instructional designer from Virginia, shared, “The book resonates with me because it adopts a holistic view of AI's potential, challenging us to embrace this revolution as an opportunity to reimagine education.”</p>

<p>The key to successfully integrating any digital tool, according to Clark, is to focus on the deep learning and masterful pedagogy teachers can achieve amidst educational shifts.</p>
<p><em>The AI Infused Classroom</em> emphasizes that AI will bring about changes, but it does not replace the need for well-trained and highly qualified teachers in the classroom. Students need educators’ guidance now more than ever to prepare for the world of AI. With the right mindset, questions and strategies, educators can use AI to create and broaden meaningful learning experiences for every student.</p>

But educators always welcome more guidance on this topic. That's why I’m looking forward to the upcoming book, "The Promises and Perils of AI in Education" by Ken Shelton and Dee Lanier. It’s not published yet, but it should be available soon.</p>

<p>Reading is great, but applying what you read is better.</p>
<p>Reading books on AI in education feels productive. And it is! Until a certain point. Then, it turns into procrastination disguised as "research." How do you avoid falling into this trap?</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Justice Department and eight states have filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, alleging an adtech monopoly.</li>
<li>The government had planned to add a damages claim in the lawsuit and pursue a trial by jury, which could have led to unpredictable outcomes.</li>
<li>However, Google recently filed a $2.3 million cashier's check, which would cover triple the monetary damages requested by the government, plus interest.</li>
<li>The court has scheduled the case for a judge's hearing in the fall, as preferred by Google.</li>
<li>The development may reduce the likelihood of a jury trial, as the government may be more likely to settle the case rather than risk an unpredictable jury verdict.</li>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">PowerSchool is a web-based platform that helps educational institutions manage operations such as enrollment, grades, attendance and communications with parents and students. Founded in 1997 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/porter-ventures-gp/">Greg Porter</a>, initially as a student information system for schools, the company was <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2001/03/14Apple-to-Acquire-PowerSchool/">acquired by Apple in 2001 for $62 million</a> in Apple stock, a figure that would be worth around $26 billion today as Apple grew into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/30/apples-market-cap-hits-3-trillion-once-again/">$3 trillion company</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Apple subsequently <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2006/05/25Pearson-to-Acquire-PowerSchool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold PowerSchool to Pearson five years later</a>, which in turn <a href="https://www.powerschool.com/news/pearson-sell-powerschool-vista-equity-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold it on to Vista Equity Partners</a> in 2015, and Canadian private equity firm Onex Partners joined as investor <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/08/01/1545725/0/en/Onex-Completes-Investment-in-PowerSchool.html">three years later</a>. The duo pushed PowerSchool into the public markets in 2021, with the NYSE listing giving the company an initial valuation of around <a href="https://marketbrief.edweek.org/financing-investment/powerschool-major-ed-tech-provider-valued-at-3-5-billion-following-initial-public-offering/2021/07">$3.5 billion</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In the intervening years, PowerSchool went through the now-familiar pandemic-era peaks and troughs — it surged to a valuation of $5.5 billion in late 2021 before falling to $1.8 billion within a year. For the past couple of years it has hovered at around the $3.5 billion mark.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bain Capital’s bid weighs in at $22.80 per share in cash, representing a 37% premium on PowerSchool’s May 7 closing share price of $16.64 — the date when rumors <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/acquisitions/2024/bain-capital-explores-6-billion-deal-for-powerschool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emerged</a> that Bain Capital was eyeing an acquisition. These rumors also surfaced as PowerSchool reported <a href="https://uk.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-powerschool-sees-16-yoy-revenue-growth-in-q1-2024-93CH-3484457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong Q1 2024 earnings</a>, with revenues up 16% year-on-year to $185 million, and analysts predicting the company would reach profitability this year.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">With take-private deals such as this, it’s all about spotting companies with potential and helping them reach that potential away from the pressures of the public markets. That is what Bain is doing here with its majority investment in PowerSchool.</p>

	
	

<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">
</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“As demand for K-12 educational technology grows, we believe there are significant opportunities to expand access to PowerSchool’s best-in-class product suite around the world,” Bain Capital partner Max de Groen said in a statement.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">There has been a spate of similar deals so far in 2024. Last month, U.K. private equity firm Permira <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/13/permira-is-taking-squarespace-private-in-6-6-billion-deal/">revealed it was doling out $6.9 billion</a> to take Squarespace private. Elsewhere, Thoma Bravo said it was taking cybersecurity company Darktrace private <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/26/thoma-bravo-to-take-uk-cybersecurity-company-darktrace-private-in-5b-deal/">in a $5 billion deal</a> and paying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/01/thoma-bravo-takes-critical-event-management-software-company-everbridge-private-in-1-5b-deal/">$1.8 billion</a> for critical event management software company Everbridge. Revenue optimization platform Model N <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/08/vista-equity-partners-to-take-revenue-optimization-platform-model-n-private-in-1-25b-deal/">is also being taken private</a> by Vista Equity Partners for $1.25 billion.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bain Capital said it expects to close the PowerSchool acquisition in the second half of 2024, subject to the usual regulatory and shareholder approvals. Existing investors Vista and Onex will retain minority investments in PowerSchool once the deal concludes.</p>

<p>Huang hit another milestone on Friday, passing personal computer pioneer Michael <a href="https://fortune.com/company/dell-technologies/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/dell-technologies/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Dell</a> to become the world’s 13th-richest person with a net worth of $106.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His wealth has surged more than $62 billion this year as demand for Nvidia chips used to power artificial intelligence tasks remains insatiable.</p>



<p>Huang, 61, is leading a new wave of tech billionaires as AI-fueled “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/nvidia-s-rise-to-3-trillion-fuels-jensanity-across-tech-world" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/nvidia-s-rise-to-3-trillion-fuels-jensanity-across-tech-world" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Jensanity,</a>” as one analyst termed it, takes over Silicon Valley. Other beneficiaries include Lisa Su, chief executive officer of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/advanced-micro-devices/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/advanced-micro-devices/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Advanced Micro Devices</a> Inc., as well as <a href="https://fortune.com/company/super-micro-computer/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/super-micro-computer/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Super Micro Computer</a> Inc.’s Charles Liang. Last month, Huang’s fortune <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-23/nvidia-s-huang-is-richer-than-every-walton-as-ai-surge-continues" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-23/nvidia-s-huang-is-richer-than-every-walton-as-ai-surge-continues" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">surpassed</a> each individual member of the Waltons, America’s richest family, following another blowout quarter from the chipmaker. </p>



<p>Huang’s wealth is derived from his 3.5% stake in Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia, which he co-founded in 1993 with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Nvidia became the first computer-chip company to hit <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-05/nvidia-nvda-tops-3-trillion-in-market-value-as-ai-rally-steams-ahead" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-05/nvidia-nvda-tops-3-trillion-in-market-value-as-ai-rally-steams-ahead" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">$3 trillion</a> in market capitalization on Wednesday, surpassing the value of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/apple/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/apple/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Apple</a> Inc., and was flirting with that benchmark again on Friday. </p>



<p>Dell, 59, with a net worth of $105.9 billion, has been a computer hardware-industry outlier among the tech super-rich, who often owe their wealth to software companies. Dell made much of his fortune through his namesake firm, which sells personal computers and servers.</p><p></p>



<p>Still, Dell Technologies Inc. has been a beneficiary of the recent AI success as corporations need servers and other infrastructure to utilize advanced chips from Nvidia. Investors have increasingly seen Dell, along with Super Micro, as Nvidia’s chosen partner for this business line.</p>



<p>In early March, Dell joined the small group of people with fortunes exceeding <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-01/michael-dell-joins-100-billion-club-as-ai-driven-shares-surge" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-01/michael-dell-joins-100-billion-club-as-ai-driven-shares-surge" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">$100 billion</a> as the company’s shares rose to a record high. The stock has since retreated after posting results that disappointed investors, reducing its founder’s wealth almost $12 billion in a single day. </p>



<p>Nvidia today commands an ecosystem of hardware and software solutions that rivals from AMD to <a href="https://fortune.com/company/intel/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/intel/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Intel</a> Corp. are trying hard to break up or replicate, thanks to its dominant share of the market for the high-end accelerators used to train AI.</p>



<p>And it has shown no signs of slowing down or letting its rivals catch up. Huang <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-02/jensen-huang-computex-keynote-nvidia-reveals-new-ai-software-and-services" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-02/jensen-huang-computex-keynote-nvidia-reveals-new-ai-software-and-services" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">said</a> the firm plans to upgrade its so-called AI accelerators every year. </p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the future of business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/eye-on-ai?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=eye_on_ai" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/eye-on-ai?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=eye_on_ai" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li>The Biden administration has tightened fuel economy standards for cars and SUVs, aiming to improve the average efficiency of new vehicles to beyond 50 miles per gallon by 2031.</li>
<li>The new standards will improve fuel efficiency over a five-year span starting with 2027 models, and are projected to cut fuel consumption by 70 billion gallons of gasoline by 2050.</li>
<li>The fuel savings are estimated to translate to about $600 less in gas costs over the life of a new vehicle, as calculated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).</li>
<li>The final version of the standards is weaker than an initial proposal by the agency, which automakers had argued would be impossible to meet.</li>
<li>The new standards aim to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, with the goal of cutting gasoline consumption by 70 billion gallons over the next three decades.</li>
