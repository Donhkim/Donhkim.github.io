<p>Business Activity Index at 49.6%; New Orders Index at 47.3%; Employment Index at 46.1%; Supplier Deliveries Index at 52.2%</p>
<p><span class="legendSpanClass"><span class="xn-location">TEMPE, Ariz.</span></span>, <span class="legendSpanClass"><span class="xn-chron">July 3, 2024</span></span> /PRNewswire/ -- Economic activity in the <b>services sector</b><b> contracted in June </b>for the second time in the last three months, say the nation's purchasing and supply executives in the latest <b>Services ISM<sup>®</sup><i> Report On Business<sup>®</sup></i></b>. The Services PMI<sup>®</sup> registered 48.8 percent, indicating sector contraction for the third time in 49 months.</p>
<p>The report was issued today by <span class="xn-person">Steve Miller</span>, CPSM, CSCP, Chair of the Institute for Supply Management<sup>® </sup>(ISM<sup>®</sup>) Services Business Survey Committee: "In June, the Services PMI<sup>®</sup> registered 48.8 percent, 5 percentage points lower than May's figure of 53.8 percent. The reading in June was a reversal compared to May and the second in contraction territory in the last three months. Before April, the services sector grew for 15 straight months following a composite index reading of 49 percent in <span class="xn-chron">December 2022</span>; the last contraction before that was in <span class="xn-chron">May 2020</span> (45.4 percent). The Business Activity Index registered 49.6 percent in June, which is 11.6 percentage points lower than the 61.2 percent recorded in May and the first month of contraction since <span class="xn-chron">May 2020</span>. The New Orders Index contracted in June for the first time since <span class="xn-chron">December 2022</span>; the figure of 47.3 percent is 6.8 percentage points lower than the May reading of 54.1 percent. The Employment Index contracted for the sixth time in seven months and at a faster rate in June; the reading of 46.1 percent is a 1-percentage point decrease compared to the 47.1 percent recorded in May.</p>
<p>"The Supplier Deliveries Index registered 52.2 percent, 0.5 percentage point lower than the 52.7 percent recorded in May. The index remained in expansionary territory — indicating slower supplier delivery performance — in June for a second month after three straight months in 'faster' territory. (Supplier Deliveries is the only ISM<sup>®</sup> <i>Report On Business</i><sup>®</sup> index that is inversed; a reading of above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries, which is typical as the economy improves and customer demand increases.)</p>
<p>"The Prices Index registered 56.3 percent in June, a 1.8-percentage point decrease from May's reading of 58.1 percent. The Inventories Index contracted in June registering 42.9 percent, a decrease of 9.2 percentage points from May's figure of 52.1 percent. The Inventory Sentiment Index (64.1 percent, up 6.4 percentage points from May's reading of 57.7 percent) expanded for the 14th consecutive month. The Backlog of Orders Index contracted in June for the first time since March, registering 44 percent, a 6.8-percentage point decrease compared to the May reading of 50.8 percent.</p>
<p>"Eight industries reported growth in June. Though the Services PMI<sup>®</sup> contracted for the second time in three months, that was preceded by 15 consecutive months of growth, a contraction in <span class="xn-chron">December 2022</span> and 30 months of expansion before that. That indicates sustained growth for the sector, as the PMI<sup>®</sup> has not recorded back-to-back months in contraction since April and <span class="xn-chron">May 2020</span>."</p>
<p>Miller continues, "The decrease in the composite index in June is a result of notably lower business activity, a contraction in new orders for the second time since <span class="xn-chron">May 2020</span> and continued contraction in employment. Survey respondents report that in general, business is flat or lower, and although inflation is easing, some commodities have significantly higher costs. Panelists indicate that slower supplier delivery performance is due primarily to transportation challenges, not increases in demand."</p>
<p><b>INDUSTRY PERFORMANCE<br class="dnr"></b>The eight services industries reporting growth in June — listed in order — are: Other Services; Management of Companies &amp; Support Services; Health Care &amp; Social Assistance; Construction; Utilities; Finance &amp; Insurance; Educational Services; and Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services. The eight industries reporting a decrease in the month of June — listed in order — are: Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing &amp; Hunting; Real Estate, Rental &amp; Leasing; Mining; Retail Trade; Public Administration; Wholesale Trade; Transportation &amp; Warehousing; and Information.</p>
<p><b>WHAT RESPONDENTS ARE SAYING</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>"Sales and traffic remain soft compared to last year. High gas prices in <span class="xn-location">California</span> and constant news about inflation and restaurant menu prices are culprits." [Accommodation &amp; Food Services]</li>
<li>"Costs seem to have stabilized but are still higher. The company is holding steady to see what the election will hold." [Construction]</li>
<li>"Currently, our operations are normal, but we are experiencing slightly higher costs due to the increase in fuel. We are at the end of our fiscal year, when an increase in expenditures is typical." [Educational Services]</li>
<li>"Steady, with no major shifts in pricing or availability of services." [Finance &amp; Insurance]</li>
<li>"Demand for services has moderated after near-record patient levels in the last month." [Health Care &amp; Social Assistance]</li>
<li>"We are still experiencing supply chain challenges with the increased cost of chemicals, as well as the domestic and overseas freight costs associated with them." [Management of Companies &amp; Support Services]</li>
<li>"Slightly higher prices across the board, but less pricing pressure for some items. Still long lead times for heavy equipment, fire apparatus, ambulances and the like." [Public Administration]</li>
<li>"Inflation continues to be a general concern for both purchasers and sellers. For example, with inflation continuing, will customers have enough discretionary funds to spend?" [Retail Trade]</li>
<li>"Supply issues have calmed down. Prices on many products remain high, with no sign of decreases." [Utilities]</li>
<li>"Market seems to be slowing in June. This is complicated by increased ocean freight rates and tight container bookings." [Wholesale Trade]</li>

<p><b><u>Services PMI</u></b><b><sup>®<br class="dnr"></sup></b>In June, the Services PMI<sup>®</sup> registered 48.8 percent, a 5-percentage point decrease compared to the May reading of 53.8 percent. A reading above 50 percent indicates the services sector economy is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates it is generally contracting.</p>
<p>A Services PMI<sup>®</sup> above 49 percent, over time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy. Therefore, the June Services PMI<sup>®</sup> indicates the overall economy is contracting for the first time in 17 months. Miller says, "The past relationship between the Services PMI<sup>®</sup> and the overall economy indicates that the Services PMI<sup>®</sup> for June (48.8 percent) corresponds to no increase in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis."</p>

<p><b><u>About This Report<br class="dnr"></u></b>DO NOT CONFUSE THIS NATIONAL REPORT with the various regional purchasing reports released across the country. The national report's information reflects the entire U.S., while the regional reports contain primarily regional data from their local vicinities. Also, the information in the regional reports is not used in calculating the results of the national report. The information compiled in this report is for the month of <span class="xn-chron">June 2024</span>.</p>
<p>The data presented herein is obtained from a survey of supply executives in the services sector based on information they have collected within their respective organizations. ISM<sup>®</sup> makes no representation, other than that stated within this release, regarding the individual company data collection procedures. The data should be compared to all other economic data sources when used in decision-making.</p>
<p><b><u>Data and Method of Presentation<br class="dnr"></u></b>The <b>Services</b><b> ISM<sup>®</sup><i> Report On Business<sup>®</sup></i></b> (formerly the Non-Manufacturing ISM<sup>®</sup><i> Report On Business<sup>®</sup></i>) is based on data compiled from purchasing and supply executives nationwide. Membership of the Services Business Survey Committee (formerly Non-Manufacturing Business Survey Committee) is diversified by NAICS, based on each industry's contribution to gross domestic product (GDP). The Services Business Survey Committee responses are divided into the following NAICS code categories: Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing &amp; Hunting; Mining; Utilities; Construction; Wholesale Trade; Retail Trade; Transportation &amp; Warehousing; Information; Finance &amp; Insurance; Real Estate, Rental &amp; Leasing; Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services; Management of Companies &amp; Support Services; Educational Services; Health Care &amp; Social Assistance; Arts, Entertainment &amp; Recreation; Accommodation &amp; Food Services; Public Administration; and Other Services (services such as Equipment &amp; Machinery Repairing; Promoting or Administering Religious Activities; Grantmaking; Advocacy; and Providing Dry-Cleaning &amp; Laundry Services, Personal Care Services, Death Care Services, Pet Care Services, Photofinishing Services, Temporary Parking Services, and Dating Services). The data are weighted based on each industry's contribution to GDP. According to BEA estimates (the average of the fourth quarter 2022 GDP estimate and the GDP estimates for first, second, and third quarter 2023, as released on <span class="xn-chron">December 21, 2023</span>), the six largest services sectors are: Real Estate, Rental &amp; Leasing; Public Administration; Professional, Scientific, &amp; Technical Services; Health Care &amp; Social Assistance; Information; and Finance &amp; Insurance.</p>
<p>Survey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month. For each of the indicators measured (Business Activity, New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Inventory Change, Inventory Sentiment, Imports, Prices, Employment and Supplier Deliveries), this report shows the percentage reporting each response and the diffusion index. Responses represent raw data and are never changed. Data is seasonally adjusted for Business Activity, New Orders, Prices and Employment. All seasonal adjustment factors are subject annually to relatively minor changes when conditions warrant them. The remaining indexes have not indicated significant seasonality.</p>
<p>The Services PMI<sup>®</sup> is a composite index based on the diffusion indexes for four of the indicators with equal weights: Business Activity (seasonally adjusted), New Orders (seasonally adjusted), Employment (seasonally adjusted) and Supplier Deliveries. Diffusion indexes have the properties of leading indicators and are convenient summary measures showing the prevailing direction of change and the scope of change. An index reading above 50 percent indicates that the services economy is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally declining. Supplier Deliveries is an exception. A Supplier Deliveries Index above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries and below 50 percent indicates faster deliveries.</p>
<p>A Services PMI<sup>®</sup> above 49 percent, over time, indicates that the overall economy, or gross domestic product (GDP), is generally expanding; below 49 percent, it is generally declining. The distance from 50 percent or 49 percent is indicative of the strength of the expansion or decline.</p>
<p>The <b>Services</b> <b>ISM<sup>®</sup><i> Report On Business<sup>®</sup></i></b> survey is sent out to Services Business Survey Committee respondents the first part of each month. Respondents are asked to ONLY report on U.S. operations for the current month. ISM<sup>®</sup> receives survey responses throughout most of any given month, with the majority of respondents generally waiting until late in the month to submit responses to give the most accurate picture of current business activity. ISM<sup>®</sup> then compiles the report for release on the third business day of the following month.</p>
<p>The industries reporting growth, as indicated in the <b>Services</b> <b>ISM<sup>®</sup><i> Report On Business<sup>®</sup></i></b> monthly report, are listed in the order of most growth to least growth. For the industries reporting contraction or decreases, those are listed in the order of the highest level of contraction/decrease to the least level of contraction/decrease.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a decline of 12.2 million barrels in crude oil inventories for the week to June 28, surprising the market and leading to higher oil prices.</li>
<li>Gasoline inventories also declined, falling by 2.2 million barrels, compared to a build of 2.7 million barrels in the previous week.</li>
<li>The EIA estimated draws in fuel inventories for the last week of June, with gasoline production averaging 10.1 million barrels daily and middle distillate production averaging 5.1 million barrels daily.</li>
<li>Geopolitical factors have also supported oil prices, with worries about a further escalation of violence in the Middle East and potential production disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Beryl.</li>
<li>Oil prices remained at two-month highs after the American Petroleum Institute estimated a significant weekly inventory draw of 9 million barrels, and traders are positioning for potential supply disruptions in the region.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Brazil blocks Meta's AI training plan</strong>: Brazil's national data protection agency (ANPD) has suspended Meta's latest privacy policy, which would allow the company to use Brazilians' Instagram and Facebook posts to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models.</li>
<li><strong>Meta's plans were criticized</strong>: The plan was criticized for allowing Meta to use personal information from public posts to train its AI products, which could potentially harm users' privacy and fundamental rights.</li>
<li><strong>Meta faces fines if it doesn't comply</strong>: Meta has been given five working days to amend its privacy policy to exclude the use of personal information from public posts to train AI models. If it fails to comply, it will face a daily fine of R$50,000 (£6,935).</li>
<li><strong>Meta previously cancelled similar plans in the UK and EU</strong>: Meta had announced plans to use UK and European users' posts for AI training, but cancelled the plans after receiving a request from the Irish Data Protection Commission to delay the training of large language models.</li>
<li><strong>Meta remains committed to AI development</strong>: Despite being blocked in Brazil, Meta remains committed to developing its AI products and believes that the ban on using public posts for AI training is a "step backwards" for innovation and competition in the field.</li>

<li><strong>Liquidation Sale</strong>: Under the liquidation sale, Bob's Stores is offering discounts of 30%-70% off prices on its merchandise, with the goal of clearing out its inventory ahead of the permanent closures.</li>

Most of the big spending comes from large chains, which have the capital and scale to make the technology work for their businesses.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>Even before the pandemic, labor costs had been rising for restaurants, leading operators to look to technology to boost their profit margins. Then Covid came, which not only accelerated labor costs but also led to a shift away from dining rooms and toward drive-thru lanes. California’s decision earlier this year to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/01/california-fast-food-minimum-wage-other-business-may-raise-pay.html">hike wages for fast-food workers</a> to $20 an hour has only made operators more inclined to embrace technology to cut their labor costs, which has so far helped <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/12/chipotle-tests-robot-to-prepare-avocados-for-guacamole.html">mostly in the automation of back-of-the-house tasks</a>.</p><p>At the same time, ChatGPT and other AI tools have fueled new excitement for generative AI in restaurants, though the industry is typically slow to embrace technological advances.</p><p>One stumbling block for the burgeoning tech came in June, when <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-4"><a href="/quotes/MCD/">McDonald’s</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/mcdonalds-to-end-ibm-ai-drive-thru-test.html">told its franchisees</a> that it would end its trial of Automated Order Taker, AI technology meant for its drive-thru lanes through a partnership with IBM. Once an early mover in the voice-ordering race, the fast-food giant now plans to turn to other vendors.</p><p>Then there’s <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-6"><a href="/quotes/PRST/">Presto Automation</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span>, the AI drive-thru technology company which disclosed last year in Securities and Exchange Commission filings that it uses “human agents” in places like the Philippines and India to complete orders. Presto interim CEO Gee Lefevre maintains that using humans is common in the AI industry and helps train the technology without straining the restaurant’s workforce. The company unveiled a fully autonomous version in May. Still, the initial lack of transparency may scare off some operators.</p><p>While some restaurants may be skeptical of using AI for drive-thrus now, adoption may increase in the coming months and years.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>The tipping point for voice ordering is likely in 12 to 18 months, according to T.D. Cowen analyst Andrew Charles. That’s when he thinks at least two of the nation’s top 25 restaurant chains will go all in, expanding their small trial runs of the technology across their footprints.</p><p>“It’s like third-party delivery a few years ago: Everyone was testing it, then when McDonald’s went with Uber, everyone else followed with their own partnerships,” Charles said.</p><p>This time, McDonald’s likely won’t be the first mover.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline0"></a>The pros and cons of AI ordering</h2><div class="group"><p>Companies with voice-ordering technology say their AI doesn’t replace jobs — it just frees up workers for other tasks.

SoundHound also said that its AI can speed up drive-thru lanes by roughly 10% because it can process orders faster. Plus, AI tries to upsell customers every order, raising average check size.</p><p>Moreover, in the future, AI could be able to take orders from non-English speakers, representing a large opportunity both internationally and domestically, according to Charles.</p><p>But for all the possible pros, there are also some drawbacks to generative AI.</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108001096" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">Sanford, Florida, McDonald’s Restaurant drive thru order area, with line of cars. </p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>For one, restaurants risk damaging their reputations by using artificial intelligence, Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Friday. For example, inaccurate orders can cause delays and frustration, even if the AI transfers customers to a human restaurant worker.</p><p>Moreover, while younger customers might enjoy the increased efficiency and lack of human interaction, older age cohorts tend to think differently. The majority of baby boomers would prefer fewer technology options while dining, according to a <a href="https://restaurant.org/research-and-media/media/press-releases/serving-up-technology-new-data-shows-how-tech-integration-is-transforming-the-restaurant-experience/" target="_blank">consumer survey</a> from earlier this year conducted by the National Restaurant Association.</p><p>Then there’s the fact that the technology isn’t perfect. Restaurants with weak Wi-Fi will need to speed up their internet connections. Locations by noisy highways will likely find that voice-ordering tech will need a few years to catch up and better understand customers. And restaurants with long, complicated menus will likely find that the AI struggles are more pronounced.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline1"></a>Why McDonald’s dropped IBM partnership</h2><div class="group"><p>For McDonald’s, the risks aren’t worth it — for now.</p><p>The fast-food giant’s foray into AI for the drive-thru began in 2019, when the company bought Apprente, renaming it McD Tech Labs. Two years later, McDonald’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/27/mcdonalds-enters-strategic-partnership-with-ibm-to-automate-drive-thru-lanes.html">sold McD Tech Labs</a> to IBM and announced a global partnership with the tech company for undisclosed terms. McDonald’s had already tested the technology at a handful of Chicago area locations. Offloading the tech to IBM led to a larger scale test of roughly 100 restaurants.</p><p>But the results from the trial run fell short of McDonald’s standards. The technology had issues interpreting different accents and dialects, hurting order accuracy, among other challenges, two sources familiar with the matter<strong> </strong>told CNBC. At the time, McDonald’s declined to comment on the technology’s accuracy or challenges, while IBM did not respond to a request to comment on the tool’s accuracy.</p><p>Despite the setback, McDonald’s isn’t abandoning the goal of using artificial intelligence to take drive-thru orders.</p><p>“While there have been successes to date, we feel there is an opportunity to explore voice ordering solutions more broadly,” Mason Smoot, senior vice president and chief restaurant officer for McDonald’s U.S., wrote in a memo to franchisees. </p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline2"></a>Yum, Wendy’s test AI ordering</h2><div class="group"><p>The Golden Arches isn’t the only chain with a voice-ordering test.</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107408345" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">Gastonia, North Carolina, Taco Bell Mexican fast food restaurant and drive thru at dusk. </p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p><span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-10"><a href="/quotes/YUM/">Yum Brands’</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> Taco Bell is expanding its test of voice AI from five locations to 30 restaurants in California “based on positive consumer feedback,” executives said in early May. White Castle plans to use SoundHound’s technology in more than 100 of its restaurants by year-end.

Cowen’s Charles said. The industry metric refers to a chain’s average annual sales by restaurant. Because those chains’ locations have lower sales, there’s more financial incentive to use AI to mitigate higher labor costs, according to Charles.</p><p>Panera Bread <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/24/ron-shaich-book-mcdonalds-tried-to-buy-panera-bread-5-other-reveals.html">founder Ron Shaich</a> told CNBC that the real winners will be a “fast follower” rather than the first mover with voice ordering.

in the week.</p><p>Tesla ticking higher today after friend of the show we analyst Dan Ives raised his price target on the stock to $300 a share.</p><p>There you're seeing shares of Tesla higher by about 3.4% here in the early innings of today's activity here.</p><p>But we should also note that it really comes in a period where there was so much concern coming into these prints that it was almost just this massive weight and perhaps pushing down some expectations, limiting expectations and companies essentially coming out and saying, no, there's there's still a fair bit of, uh, of fodder out there in terms of the consumers that are willing to get into landscape, for Tesla's sake and then for Ford, this is a big deal, especially as they've kind of moderated their own plans within their own development.</p><p>Thinking about the Ford Blue business versus the Ford ice business as well.</p><p>Historically, yeah, it's interesting, too, given what we've seen from some of the other analysts ahead of the deliveries numbers that we got out of Tesla.</p><p>In particular, this note stood out to me from Citi, saying they recommended buying Tesla August 24th, 195 dollar calls ahead of three upcoming catalyst They list, of course, the vehicle deliveries that we just got quarterly earnings for Tesla expected coming up on July 19th.</p><p>We've got the upcoming Robo Taxi Day

market share in Beijing.</p><p>But still, that didn't impact that headline number, and I guess that's what the street is focused on, particularly to put a name on it.</p><p>They, they absolutely are continuing to not just take market share but potentially be a market share leader for an extended period of time, too.</p><p>That compared to what Tesla and the inroads that they've tried to develop within that region, bringing to reach to that region in Shanghai and then also ensuring that they could try and put even more of that mass market model three in the region as well.</p><p>Now Ford has also been trying to do the same with, of course, making sure that they've got a lightning that is available essentially internationally and specific models region by region here.</p><p>It was

        <div class="content article-descr news-summary">
    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Elon Musk has warned Bill Gates not to bet against Tesla again, saying that he and anyone else who short sells the company will be "obliterated" once Tesla's autonomy and robot taxi services are fully up and running.</li>
<li>The feud between Musk and Gates began in 2022, when Gates declined to support Musk's charitable work because he had a short position against Tesla, which Musk argued was hypocritical given Gates' claims to support climate change.</li>
<li>Gates had previously bet against Tesla, but had already regretted his decision by the time the messages leaked. It's unclear whether he still has a short position in the company.</li>
<li>Musk's claim that shorts will be "obliterated" is seen as bold given Tesla's poor performance in 2024, with vehicle sales down 6.6% through the first half of the year.</li>
<li>Musk has a history of standing up to short sellers, having already taken down famous Tesla shorts like David Einhorn and Jim Chanos, and has been building a floor under the stock since April by increasing production and introducing new products.</li>

    <div><p>Elon Musk gave Bill Gates advance warning on Tuesday not to trifle with him again. The <a href="https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Microsoft</a> cofounder faces annihilation if he makes any further attempt to bet against <a href="https://fortune.com/company/tesla/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/tesla/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Tesla</a>.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>That’s because Musk believes he will have transformed the carmaker into an AI colossus worth a staggering $30 trillion as soon as Tesla completes its pivot from selling EVs first and foremost to operating a lucrative fleet of robo-taxis and humanoid robots.</p>



<p>“Once Tesla fully solves autonomy and has [its droid] Optimus in volume production, anyone still holding a short position will be obliterated,” he posted to social media on Tuesday. “Even Gates.” </p>







<p>The duo’s rivalry became public after an exchange leaked in 2022 showing the world’s wealthiest entrepreneur had refused to support Gates’ charitable work upon learning the latter still had a half billion dollars riding on a wager the Tesla stock price would fall. </p><p></p>



<p>“Sorry, but I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla, the company doing the most to solve climate change,” Musk wrote in the undated text messages.</p>



<p>By the time those messages had leaked, Gates was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CkQYqkmGBs&amp;t=27s" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CkQYqkmGBs&amp;t=27s" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">already regretting</a> his bearish call on Tesla. It’s unclear whether he still has a position in the stock, and he could not be reached by <em>Fortune</em> for comment.</p>



<p>Musk’s warning that shorts will be “obliterated” is, however, a bold claim for someone whose company had been the worst-performing name in the S&amp;P 500 this year. </p>



<p>Tesla vehicle sales are down 6.6% through the first half of the year; his Cybertruck has struggled to meet its high expectations; and he finally <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/24/tesla-drops-delivery-goal-musk/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/24/tesla-drops-delivery-goal-musk/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">buried</a> Tesla’s target of boosting volumes from 1.8 million EVs last year to 20 million by 2030.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Musk builds floor under the stock since April</h2>



<p>But Musk is not one for backing down in the face of adversity, and he’s dispatched other famous Tesla shorts like David Einhorn and Jim Chanos, who made a fortune betting against Lehman Brothers and Enron, respectively.</p><p></p>



<p>In fact, the Tesla CEO has been on a rebound ever since he put a floor under the stock in April.</p>



<p>First, he teased the unveiling of a new “CyberCab” robo-taxi model, implying he will finally solve autonomy. Then he announced that 2025 could see a <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/24/elon-musk-tesla-first-quarter-earnings-low-cost-car-new-models/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/24/elon-musk-tesla-first-quarter-earnings-low-cost-car-new-models/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">return to EV sales growth</a> with new low-cost models, marking the bottom in the stock.</p>







<p>Lingering concerns that the totemic CEO might resign from the company entirely over the loss of his 2018 compensation deal—now worth a whopping $70 billion at the current stock price—were all but put to bed <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/elon-musk-tesla-shareholder-vote-annual-meeting-ceo-compensation-pay-deal/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/elon-musk-tesla-shareholder-vote-annual-meeting-ceo-compensation-pay-deal/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">last </a>month when its second biggest investor, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/vanguard/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/vanguard/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Vanguard</a>, joined with others to support him. </p>



<p>Finally, Tesla revealed on Tuesday that it had staved off an even steeper decline in <a href="https://fortune.com/company/q2/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/q2/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Q2</a> vehicle sales by liquidating excess inventory. Throttling EV production to its lowest level since the third quarter of 2022 meant he had spare battery cells he could now plow into his stationary energy storage business, more than doubling its already record Q1 volume to the unheard-of amount of 9.4 gigawatt-hours deployed. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>Tesla has now added $100 billion in market cap in the space of the past two days. </p><p></p>



<p>It is trading at 70 times next year’s earnings, a steep multiple even for a growth stock, let alone one whose revenue and earnings in 2024—the period with the greatest visibility—are both forecast to shrink.</p>



<p>However, if you’re one of the investors who believes Musk will do for robot butlers what he did for EVs, it’s a trifle. </p>



<p>In his mind, there will be a <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/09/29/tesla-ai-day-2022-will-elon-musk-finally-unveil-optimus-robot/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2022/09/29/tesla-ai-day-2022-will-elon-musk-finally-unveil-optimus-robot/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">robot not just in every business or every home, but for everyone</a>—from toddler to senior. </p>



<p>He anticipates demand, therefore, at 1 billion droids per year, with Tesla conservatively controlling a tenth of the global market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tesla worth a third of the world’s current combined GDP?</h2>



<p>He would sell these Optimus robots, which currently are still in their <a href="https://x.com/Tesla/status/1801373674345533908" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/Tesla/status/1801373674345533908" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">early prototype stage</a>, at a price tag of $20,000 each, even though unit production costs will only tally $10,000, leaving him a 50% margin per robot. </p><p></p>



<p>Total annual profits in that scenario would hit <a href="https://x.com/wallstengine/status/1801372407065690427" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/wallstengine/status/1801372407065690427" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">$1 trillion</a>, which, coupled with a fairly standard earnings multiple of 25, yields a market cap of $25 trillion. </p>



<p>Add a paltry $5 trillion to the robo-taxi fleet once it is launched, and you’re talking about real value for investors buying in at the current $740 billion market cap.</p>



<p>The problem with this kind of back-of-the-envelope math is that Musk’s assumptions can be off by orders of magnitude. </p>



<p>Musk predicts the market’s unit volume is much closer to smartphone demand, which costs nowhere near the $20,000 he anticipates. Cars are a better proxy here, and they tend to max out at 100 million new vehicles a year, owing in part to their much higher price.</p>



<p>Chanos, for example, argued Musk’s latest prediction means Tesla would have a market cap equivalent to nearly a third of the total annual economic output of the entire world. </p>







<p>Take, for example, his calculus on Tesla’s now-defunct 2030 annual volume target. Most companies with serious targets do a bottom-up macroeconomic analysis of their markets and the projected demand over time for the product categories in which they compete.</p><p></p>



<p>By comparison, Musk derived his 20 million EV sales figure, an amount greater than the two largest carmakers in the world combined, by taking the global installed fleet of 2 billion cars already on the road and spitballing an assumption Tesla could replace 1% of that every year. </p>



<p>No wonder it was buried well before 2030.</p>



<p>Unless Musk can produce solid figures this time to back up his claims, maybe Gates will take him up on his bet.</p></div></div>

<li>
<p><strong>Shares of Paramount Global surge</strong>: Paramount Global's stock price increased by 6.9% to $11.46/share on July 3, the highest level in nearly a month, after a renewed agreement was reached between Skydance Media and Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Renewed agreement between Skydance and Shari Redstone</strong>: The agreement, reached on July 3, would merge Skydance and Paramount, with Skydance buying out National Amusements Inc. (NAI) and then combining the two companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New deal includes a "go-shop" provision</strong>: Unlike the previous agreement, the new deal includes a 45-day window for Paramount and NAI to solicit an offer to match or beat Skydance's terms, designed to fend off shareholder litigation and give the Paramount Global board cover to "reasonably say they considered all options for maximizing the value paid out to common shareholders".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skydance would buy out NAI and combine with Paramount</strong>: Under the agreement, Skydance would buy out NAI and then combine with Paramount, with nonvoting Paramount Class B shareholders entitled to cash out nearly half their shares at $15/share.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Deal is being reviewed by the Paramount Global board's special committee</strong>: The deal is now being reviewed by the Paramount Global board's special committee established to evaluate M&amp;A offers, and reps for the special committee did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

	<strong>UPDATED:</strong> Shares of <a href="https://variety.com/t/paramount-global/" id="auto-tag_paramount-global" data-tag="paramount-global">Paramount Global</a> sprang to life ahead of the July 4 holiday on a <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/skydance-media-shari-redstone-national-amusements-deal-1236059665/">renewed agreement</a> between <a href="https://variety.com/t/skydance-media/" id="auto-tag_skydance-media" data-tag="skydance-media">Skydance Media</a> and controlling shareholder <a href="https://variety.com/t/shari-redstone/" id="auto-tag_shari-redstone" data-tag="shari-redstone">Shari Redstone</a> that would merge Skydance and Paramount.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	On Wednesday (July 3), Paramount’s stock opened up 13% to over $12/share, its highest levels in nearly a month. However, the price drifted down throughout the morning to close at $11.46/share (up 6.9%) for the shortened session that ended at 1 p.m. ET. Last month shares had tumbled after <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-skydance-ends-talks-shari-redstone-1236027264/">Redstone nixed Skydance’s previous offer</a> on June 11, falling to all-time lows of under $10.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The bump comes on the news Tuesday that <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/skydance-media-shari-redstone-national-amusements-deal-1236059665/">Redstone reached a preliminary deal with David Ellison’s Skydance</a> production company — three weeks after the previous talks fell apart. The basic structure of the pact is the same: Skydance would buy out National Amusements Inc. and then combine Paramount and Skydance, with nonvoting Paramount Class B shareholders entitled to cash out nearly half their shares at $15/share. The deal is now being reviewed by the Paramount Global board’s special committee established to evaluate M&amp;A offers. (Reps for the special committee did not respond to requests for comment.)

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Crucially, what’s different in the new agreement: It includes a “go-shop” provision, under which Paramount and NAI are understood to have a 45-day window to solicit an offer to match or beat Skydance’s terms. That appears designed to be in lieu of giving Paramount’s nonvoting shareholders approval over the deal and is likely intended to fend off shareholder litigation, by giving NAI and the Paramount Global board cover to “reasonably say they considered all options for maximizing the value paid out to common shareholders,” <em>Variety</em> <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/skydance-media-shari-redstone-national-amusements-deal-1236059665/">reported</a>.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The latest offer would reduce Redstone’s payout for NAI to about $1.75 billion, per reports by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/skydance-media-national-amusements-paramount-deal-fe88132c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wall Street Journal</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/paramount-shares-pop-9percent-on-news-of-preliminary-skydance-media-deal.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>; that’s down from roughly $2.1 billion under the most recent Skydance offer. In addition, Skydance and its financial backers, RedBird Capital Partners and KKR, would contribute $1.5 billion in cash (the same as under their previous offer) to help Paramount pay down its nearly $15 billion in debt. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The lift in Paramount’s stock price came after shares had risen 5.7% Tuesday following a report that the company was in talks <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/paramount-bet-buyout-talks-scott-mills-1236059457/">to sell BET for $1.6 billion-$1.7 billion</a> to a group led by BET CEO Scott Mills. Meanwhile, <em>Variety</em> confirmed a CNBC report that Warner Bros. Discovery is in talks with Paramount Global for <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/max-paramount-plus-warner-bros-discovery-streaming-joint-venture-1236058533/">partnership between WBD’s Max and Paramount+ </a>— a strategy that would likely continue to be pursued if the Skydance deal goes through.

	If the Skydance-NAI-Paramount deal is consummated this time around, the expectation is that the Skydance team would install new senior management at the media conglomerate. After Paramount Global removed Bob Bakish as CEO in April, the board appointed a three-person Office of the CEO led by Chris McCarthy, CEO of Showtime/Paramount Networks and MTV Studios; George Cheeks, CEO of CBS; and Brian Robbins, CEO of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon. They’ve outlined a strategy to slash costs through layoffs and other measures to save upwards of $500 million annually, as well as sell off assets to pay off debt and ink a joint venture for the Paramount+ streaming biz.</p>

<li><strong>Elliott's goal is to boost Southwest stock</strong>: The activist investor claims its plan could boost Southwest's stock price by $49 per share within 12 months, a 77% return, and is seeking to increase its influence over the company to achieve this goal.</li>

    <div><section><p class="body-text-paragraph">Dallas-based <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/topic/southwest-airlines/" target="_blank">Southwest Airlines</a> adopted a “poison pill” provision for shareholders to stop activist investor Elliott Investment Management from wresting more influence over the company and undermining management plans to guide the carrier through recent turmoil.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Southwest’s board enacted the “limited-duration shareholder plan” Wednesday morning as pressure grows from Elliott <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2024/06/10/southwest-airlines-leadership-under-fire-as-activist-investor-takes-19-billion-stake/" target="_blank">after amassing a stake worth nearly $2 billion</a>. The shareholder plan, a form of a “poison pill” used when publicly traded companies are under fire from disgruntled investors, would make it much more difficult for Elliott to increase its stake that currently stands at about 11% of Southwest shares.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">The “poison pill” is a bold move often used to thwart activist investors that have targeted companies that they perceive are performing weakly and have financial upside.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">“If it’s not invalidated for some reason, there is really no way around a poison pill,” said Keith Gottfried, a Maryland-based shareholder activism defense advisor. “The punitive effect of going above the triggering threshold could cause the activist stake to be diluted by a very large amount.”</p><div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__YgCAW md_pb-9 md_mb-7 md_pt-9 md_mt-7 pb-6 mb-9 px-9 w-full h-64 bg-blue-light border-t border-b border-gray-light pt-6 mt-9"><div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__P1yIN inline-flex col-span-1 row-span-1 pb-4"><div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__vRSrF flex-auto w-full"><p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__3hNhh primaryBold primaryBold-50 mb-3">Aviation News</p><p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__zWZy- mb-4">Stay prepared. Receive the latest airlines news, delivered straight to your inbox.</p></div></div></div><p class="body-text-paragraph">While Elliott doesn’t have enough voting shares to singularly replace board members or oust leadership, <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2024/06/13/southwest-airlines-maverick-culture-under-fire-as-activist-investor-takes-aim/" target="_blank">activist investors traditionally lobby other major institutional shareholders to support their plan</a>. If they can garner support from investors with a majority of shares, an activist such as Elliott could place its own nominees on Southwest’s board of directors.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">But sometimes board influence or an outright takeover isn’t the only goal.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Elliott says its plan could boost Southwest stock $49 per share within 12 months, a 77% return during the period, which would net the investors hundreds of millions of dollars in profit. Southwest’s stock prices have fallen about 50% in the last three years, similar to that of cross-town rival <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/topic/american-airlines/" target="_blank">American Airlines</a>. Southwest’s stock price jumped 7% on the day Elliott announced its stake and is still up 3.5% compared to before Elliott got involved.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">The limited-duration shareholder rights plan is effective immediately and applies equally to all current and future shareholders in Southwest. This particular plan is triggered when a shareholder acquires a certain amount of its common stock, which would let all other shareholders buy stock at a discount. It expires in a year.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Ariel Hernãndez, a corporate lawyer at NTT Data, said this mechanism makes the acquisition more difficult and costly for an acquirer, like Elliott.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">“If Elliott purchases 12.5% or more of Southwest Airlines’ shares, current shareholders gain the option to buy additional shares at a lower price,” he explained. “This action dilutes Elliott’s holdings, decreasing their value and making it more costly and difficult for them to gain control of the company.”</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">When shareholders buy additional shares at discounted prices, Hernãndez said, the total number of outstanding shares increases. As a result, Elliott’s shares represent a smaller portion of the company, decreasing their value. Elliott would have to buy additional shares at a higher cost in order to regain the same level of control in the company.</p><article id="related-story-embed-4WKTRLQ2O5BXXGS4YFVUEWGHNM" data-oembed-type="related-story" class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__8iRXq block w-full inline-block my-2 p-7 bg-gray-lighter border border-gray-light ignore-body-text secondaryBold secondaryBold-7"><label class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__dzAkK pr-3 text-blue-dark">Related:</label><a class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__82BFj" href="/business/airlines/2024/06/13/southwest-airlines-maverick-culture-under-fire-as-activist-investor-takes-aim/">What’s going on between Southwest Airlines and activist investor Elliott Management?</a></article><p class="body-text-paragraph">“In light of the potential for Elliott to significantly increase its position in Southwest Airlines, the board determined that adopting the Rights Plan is prudent to fulfill its fiduciary duties to all shareholders,” said Gary Kelly, executive chairman of the board. “Southwest Airlines has made a good faith effort to engage constructively with Elliott Investment Management since its initial investment and remains open to any ideas for lasting value creation.”</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Elliott declined to comment further on the matter.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Southwest has long been a maverick in an industry where competitors tend to mirror one another. The airline doesn’t charge for the first two bags for passengers and doesn’t assign seating, two lucrative revenue sources for U.S. airlines.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">“You’ve got to be very informed before you start proposing changes that could affect the business model of Southwest Airlines,” Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told reporters last month.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">The letter to Southwest’s board specifically called for the removal of Kelly and Jordan.<a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2024/06/12/southwest-airlines-ceo-bob-jordan-says-he-wont-resign-after-pressure-from-elliott/" target="_blank"> Jordan publicly told reporters he has no plans to leave</a>.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Elliott’s letter, originally sent to Southwest’s board of directors in June, asked the company to take into account three recommendations: enhance the board, upgrade leadership and undertake a business review.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">According to a release Wednesday, Southwest’s board and advisers considered Elliott’s stake, the fact that it had not reported its full purported position in Southwest on any filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and that Elliott has made regulatory filings with U.S. antitrust authorities that would provide it the flexibility to acquire a significantly greater percentage of Southwest Airlines’ voting power across two of its funds starting as early as July 11.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Other publicly traded companies have also adopted rights plans, designed to make it harder for outside investment groups to gain enough control of a company’s stock to prevent a board of directors takeover or other moves to control the firm.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">In 2022, Twitter Inc., now known as X, adopted a similar shareholder rights plan which became exercisable if a party acquired 15% of the stock without prior approval, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-15/twitter-adopts-poison-pill-to-ward-off-musk-takeover" target="_blank">according to Bloomberg.</a> At the time, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk was making large cash offers for the company, among other parties interested in buying twitter. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html" target="_blank">Later that year, Musk bought the social media platform for $44 billion.</a></p><p class="body-text-paragraph">To further break it down, Southwest will issue one right for each share of common stock, which will initially trade with Southwest common stock and will become exercisable only if any person or group acquires 12.5% or more, of the company’s outstanding common stock.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">If the rights become exercisable, all holders of rights will be entitled to acquire shares of common stock at a 50% discount to the then-current market price or the company may exchange each right held by such holders for one share of common stock, according to Southwest. Any shareholder that currently owns more than the triggering percentage may continue to own its shares of common stock, but the rights will become exercisable if a shareholder subsequently increases its ownership by one or more shares.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">From a messaging standpoint, Gottfried said, this announcement gives Elliott a “sound bite” that the company is taking steps to bolster its offenses.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">It could further escalate shareholder tensions when Southwest hasn’t been performing well financially. <a href="https://www.southwestairlinesinvestorrelations.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations" target="_blank">Southwest reports its second-quarter results on July 25</a>. <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2024/06/26/southwest-airlines-lowers-financial-expectations-as-activist-investor-pressure-intensifies/" target="_blank">Last week, Southwest lowered its financial expectations for the quarter,</a> “driven primarily by complexities in adapting its revenue management to current booking patterns in this dynamic environment.”</p><p data-oembed-type="raw-html" id="isolated-embed-R7KIHEY7QNDZZJ55JYWVQYICHY"></p><div class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__bZ-w3 py-5 px-7 border border-gray-light my-8 clear-both"><div class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__mrnG- w_full py-5 border-t border-gray-light flex"><a class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__P4zn3 inline-block w-1/3 md_w-1/4 lg_w-1/5 xl_w-1/6 flex flex-col" href="/business/airlines/2024/07/01/airfares-cheaper-for-4th-of-july-travelers-in-dallas-fort-worth-this-year/"><img loading="lazy" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain dmnc_images-modern-image-module__P3kZ4 w-full" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/VMXAVN3YJ5FFZN3WQAFI44NHZQ.jpg?auth=7d8f8314cc49bc5c440e487d916f3a371fe81148e0c8c75cb3155228d611efc2&amp;height=127&amp;width=190&amp;smart=true&amp;quality=40" alt="Travelers walk between the gates of Terminal E at DFW Airport on Monday, June 24, 2024." pinger-seen="true"></a><div class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__DfYNg pl-8 inline-block w-2/3 md_w-3/4 lg_w-4/5 xl_w-5/6"><a class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__1yqCm w-full primaryBold primaryBold-20 mb-3 align-center" href="/business/airlines/2024/07/01/airfares-cheaper-for-4th-of-july-travelers-in-dallas-fort-worth-this-year/"><span class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__HbkRM mr-4">Airfares cheaper for 4th of July travelers in Dallas-Fort Worth this year</span><span class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__27bGq relative inline-flex"></span></a><p class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__T453o w-full break-normal text-gray-dark secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-15">Domestic airfare for the holiday weekend is down 18% from last year, averaging $263 per ticket, according to travel site Hopper.

<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new Alzheimer's treatment called donanemab, also known as Kisunla, developed by Eli Lilly.</p>

These patients will need to get the drug from doctors enrolled <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare/coverage/coverage-evidence-development/monoclonal-antibodies-directed-against-amyloid-treatment-alzheimers-disease-ad" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">in a study</a> gathering data tracking its effectiveness.</p><p>"CMS is committed to helping people get timely access to treatments and improving care for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families," a CMS spokesperson said.</p><p>Eli Lilly noted in a statement: "The potential to complete treatment after a limited-duration course of therapy, along with 30-minute infusions once per month, could result in lower patient out-of-pocket treatment costs and fewer infusions compared to other amyloid-targeting therapies."</p><h2>How effective was the treatment for Alzheimer's symptoms?</h2><p>Eli Lilly measured donanemab's effectiveness primarily through <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/179167/download#page47" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">rating scales</a> designed to measure the cognitive and functional decline caused by dementia symptoms in patients with early stages of Alzhiemer's.</p><p>Compared with patients who received only a placebo, Eli Lilly <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/179240/download#page=23" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> those who got the drug saw their decline slow. The gap widened over time, slowing by 22% overall at 76 weeks after first starting the donanemab infusions.</p><p>"Importantly, the magnitude of impact on these clinical endpoints meets, and in several respects exceeds prior approvals for demonstration of clinical benefit and effectiveness," the company said of the results in a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/179167/download#page=17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">briefing document</a> given to the FDA panel.</p>

<p>The company says this translated to effectively prolonging how long it took until patients stepped down into the next stage of Alzheimer's disease. </p><h2>What are the side effects of donanemab?</h2><p>The labels for all of the anti-amyloid treatments greenlighted by the FDA to date for Alzheimer's already carry a <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2023/761269Orig1s001lbl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">boxed warning</a> about "amyloid-related imaging abnormalities" that can show up on MRI scans. </p><p>While these abnormalities generally result in no symptoms, they have been linked to rare but serious issues in some patients like brain function issues and seizures. </p><p>These abnormalities were seen in around a quarter of participants in Eli Lilly's trials of donanemab. At least five deaths were reported in donanemab recipients in patients with these kinds of abnormalities, mostly from hemorrhages in the brain. </p><p>Eli Lilly <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/179167/download#page=75" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">says</a> their trials of donanemab tested the drug in harder to treat patients than other treatments studied around the same time. That means the trial included older trial participants as well as those with <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a gene</a> called APOE ε4 that can increase the risk of Alzheimer's as well as these abnormalities.</p><p>Close to 1 in 10 trial participants who took donanemab also experienced a reaction to the infusion, compared to 0.5% of placebo participants. The most common symptoms included chills, skin reddening, nausea, shortness of breath, headache and chest pain.</p><p>Approximately 3% of donanemab-treated participants developed hypersensitivity to the infusion, including 0.3% who had a severe allergic reaction.</p>

In order for that lender to make a profit and reduce risk to itself, it will charge interest on the principal — that is, the amount you borrowed.</p><p>Expressed as a percentage, a mortgage interest rate is essentially the cost of borrowing money. It can vary based on several factors, such as your <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/credit-score-needed-for-mortgage" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>credit score</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/what-is-your-dti-ratio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>debt-to-income ratio</u></a> (DTI), <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/first-time-homebuyer-down-payment-assistance?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>down payment</u></a>, loan amount and repayment term.</p><p>After getting a mortgage, you’ll typically receive an <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/first-time-homebuyers-mortgage-amortization-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>amortization schedule</u></a>, which shows your payment schedule over the life of the loan. It also indicates how much of each payment goes toward the principal balance versus the interest.</p><p>Near the beginning of the loan term, you’ll spend more money on interest and less on the principal balance. As you approach the end of the repayment term, you’ll pay more toward the principal and less toward interest.</p><p>Your mortgage interest rate can be either fixed or adjustable. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the rate will be consistent for the duration of the loan. With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate can fluctuate with the market.</p><p>Keep in mind that a mortgage’s interest rate is not the same as its annual percentage rate (APR). This is because an APR includes both the interest rate and any other lender fees or charges.</p><p>Mortgage rates change frequently — sometimes on a daily basis. Inflation plays a significant role in these fluctuations. Interest rates tend to rise in periods of high inflation, whereas they tend to drop or remain roughly the same in times of low inflation. Other factors, like the economic climate, demand and inventory can also impact the current average mortgage rates.</p><p>To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible’s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score. You can also use Credible’s <a href="https://www.credible.com/mortgage/calculators/mortgage-calculator?utm_source=fox&amp;utm_medium=partner_link&amp;utm_campaign=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxbusiness.com%2Fpersonal-finance%2Ftodays-mortgage-rates-july-3-2024&amp;meta=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" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>mortgage calculator</u></a> to estimate your monthly mortgage payments.</p><h2><a name="what-determines-the-mortgage-rate" id="what-determines-the-mortgage-rate"></a>What determines the mortgage rate?</h2><p>Mortgage lenders typically determine the interest rate on a case-by-case basis. Generally, they reserve the lowest rates for low-risk borrowers — that is, those with a higher credit score, income and down payment amount. Here are some other personal factors that may determine your mortgage rate:</p><ul><li>Location of the home</li><li>Price of the home</li><li>Your credit score and credit history</li><li>Loan term</li><li>Loan type (e.g., conventional or FHA)</li><li>Interest rate type (fixed or adjustable)</li><li>Down payment amount</li><li>Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio</li><li>DTI</li></ul><p>Other indirect factors that may determine the mortgage rate include:</p><ul><li>Current economic conditions</li><li>Rate of inflation</li><li>Market conditions</li><li>Housing construction supply, demand, and costs</li><li>Consumer spending</li><li>Stock market</li><li>10-year Treasury yields</li><li>Federal Reserve policies</li><li>Current employment rate</li></ul><h2><a name="how-to-compare-mortgage-rates" id="how-to-compare-mortgage-rates"></a>How to compare mortgage rates</h2><p>Along with certain economic and personal factors, the lender you choose can also affect your mortgage rate. Some lenders have higher average mortgage rates than others, regardless of your credit or financial situation. That’s why it’s important to compare lenders and loan offers.</p><p>Here are some of the best ways to compare mortgage rates and ensure you get the best one:</p><ul><li><strong>Shop around for lenders: </strong>Compare several lenders to find the best rates and lowest fees. Even if the rate is only lower by a few basis points, it could still save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.</li><li><strong>Get several loan estimates: </strong>A loan estimate comes with a more personalized rate and fees based on factors like income, employment, and the property’s location. Review and compare loan estimates from several lenders.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved for a mortgage: </strong><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/mortgage-preapproval?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-approval</a> doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a loan, but it can give you a better idea of what you qualify for and at what interest rate. You’ll need to complete an application and undergo a hard credit check.</li><li><strong>Consider a mortgage rate lock: </strong>A <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/money/lock-or-float-mortgage-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>mortgage rate lock</u></a> lets you lock in the current mortgage rate for a certain amount of time — often between 30 and 90 days. During this time, you can continue shopping around for a home without worrying about the rate changing.</li><li><strong>Choose between an adjustable- and fixed-rate mortgage: </strong>The interest rate type can affect how much you pay over time, so consider your options carefully.</li></ul><p>One other way to compare mortgage rates is with a mortgage calculator. Use a calculator to determine your monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan. Just remember, certain fees like homeowners insurance or taxes might not be included in the calculations.</p><p>Here’s a simple example of what a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might look like versus a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage:</p><h3>15-year fixed-rate</h3><ul><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>$300,000</li><li><strong>Interest rate: </strong>6.29%</li><li><strong>Monthly payment: </strong>$2,579</li><li><strong>Total interest charges: </strong>$164,186</li><li><strong>Total loan amount: </strong>$464,186</li></ul><h3>30-year fixed-rate</h3><ul><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>$300,000</li><li><strong>Interest rate: </strong>6.89%</li><li><strong>Monthly payment: </strong>$1,974</li><li><strong>Total interest charges: </strong>$410,566</li><li><strong>Total loan amount: </strong>$710,565</li></ul><h2><a name="pros-and-cons-of-mortgages" id="pros-and-cons-of-mortgages"></a>Pros and cons of mortgages</h2><p>If you’re thinking about taking out a mortgage, here are some benefits to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Predictable monthly payments: </strong>Fixed-rate mortgage loans come with a set interest rate that doesn’t change over the life of the loan. This means more consistent monthly payments.</li><li><strong>Potentially low interest rates: </strong>With good credit and a high down payment, you could get a competitive interest rate. Adjustable-rate mortgages may also come with a lower initial interest rate than fixed-rate loans.</li><li><strong>Tax benefits: </strong>Having a mortgage could make you eligible for certain tax benefits, such as a <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/mortgage-interest-deduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>mortgage interest deduction</u></a>.</li><li><strong>Potential asset: </strong>Real estate is often considered an asset. As you pay down your loan, you can also build home equity, which you can use for other things like debt consolidation or home improvement projects.</li><li><strong>Credit score boost: </strong>With on-time payments, you can build your credit score.</li></ul><p>And here are some of the biggest downsides of getting a mortgage:</p><ul><li><strong>Expensive fees and interest: </strong>You could end up paying thousands of dollars in interest and other fees over the life of the loan. You will also be responsible for maintenance, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/property-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>property taxes</u></a>, and homeowners insurance.</li><li><strong>Long-term debt: </strong>Taking out a mortgage is a major financial commitment. Typical loan terms are 10, 15, 20, and 30 years.</li><li><strong>Potential rate changes: </strong>If you get an <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/adjustable-rate-mortgage-definition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>adjustable rate</u></a>, the interest rate could increase.</li></ul><h2><a name="how-to-qualify-for-a-mortgage" id="how-to-qualify-for-a-mortgage"></a>How to qualify for a mortgage</h2><p>Requirements vary by lender, but here are the typical steps to qualify for a mortgage:</p><ol><li><strong>Have steady employment and income: </strong>You’ll need to provide proof of income when applying for a home loan. This may include money from your regular job, alimony, military benefits, commissions, or Social Security payments. You may also need to provide proof of at least two years’ worth of employment at your current company.</li><li><strong>Review any assets: </strong>Lenders consider your assets when deciding whether to lend you money. Common assets include money in your bank account or investment accounts.</li><li><strong>Know your DTI: </strong>Your DTI is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward your monthly debts — like installment loans, lines of credit, or rent. The lower your DTI, the better your approval odds.</li><li><strong>Check your credit score: </strong>To get the best mortgage rate possible, you’ll need to have good credit. However, each loan type has a different credit score requirement. For example, you’ll need a credit score of 580 or higher to qualify for an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment.</li><li><strong>Know the property type: </strong>During the loan application process, you may need to specify whether the home you want to buy is your primary residence. Lenders often view a primary residence as less risky, so they may have more lenient requirements than if you were to get a secondary or investment property.</li><li><strong>Choose the loan type: </strong>Many types of mortgage loans exist, including conventional loans, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/va-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>VA loans</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/usda-loans-what-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>USDA loans</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/how-to-use-fha-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>FHA loans</u></a>, and jumbo loans. Consider your options and pick the best one for your needs.</li><li><strong>Prepare for upfront and closing costs: </strong>Depending on the loan type, you may need to make a down payment. The exact amount depends on the loan type and lender. A USDA loan, for example, has no minimum down payment requirement for eligible buyers. With a conventional loan, you’ll need to put down 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI). You may also be responsible for paying any closing costs when signing for the loan.</li></ol><h2><a name="how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage" id="how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage"></a>How to apply for a mortgage</h2><p>Here are the basic steps to apply for a <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/what-is-a-mortgage?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mortgage</a>, and what you can typically expect during the process:</p><ol><li><a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/money/some-of-the-best-mortgage-lenders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Choose a lender</u></strong></a><strong>: </strong>Compare several lenders to see the types of loans they offer, their average mortgage rates, repayment terms, and fees. Also, check if they offer any down payment assistance programs or closing cost credits.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved: </strong>Complete the pre-approval process to boost your chances of getting your dream home. You’ll need identifying documents, as well as documents verifying your employment, income, assets, and debts.</li><li><strong>Submit a formal application: </strong>Complete your chosen lender’s application process — either in person or online — and upload any required documents.</li><li><strong>Wait for the lender to process your loan: </strong>It can take some time for the lender to review your application and make a decision. In some cases, they may request additional information about your finances, assets, or liabilities. Provide this information as soon as possible to prevent delays.</li><li><strong>Complete the closing process: </strong>If approved for a loan, you’ll receive a closing disclosure with information about the loan and any closing costs. Review it, pay the down payment and closing costs, and sign the final loan documents. Some lenders have an online closing process, while others require you to go in person. If you are not approved, you can talk to your lender to get more information and determine how you can remedy any issues.</li></ol><h2><a name="how-to-refinance-a-mortgage" id="how-to-refinance-a-mortgage"></a>How to refinance a mortgage</h2><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/how-to-refinance-mortgage-easy-steps" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Refinancing your mortgage</u></a> lets you trade your current loan for a new one.

<li><strong>Gasoline prices are expected to rise</strong>: The national average price of gas is expected to increase by $0.05 to $0.10 per gallon over the next seven days, according to Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.</li>
<li><strong>Record number of Americans traveling over Fourth of July weekend</strong>: AAA expects 60.6 million Americans to hit the road during the Fourth of July holiday weekend, which will lead to increased demand for gasoline and higher prices.</li>
<li><strong>Crude oil prices rise due to escalating Middle East tensions and hurricane concerns</strong>: Crude oil prices have risen roughly $10 per barrel since June 4 due to escalating Middle East tensions and traders are also monitoring Hurricane Beryl's trajectory.</li>
<li><strong>Refinery disruptions possible</strong>: If Hurricane Beryl hits the Gulf Coast, it could disrupt the center of US refining capacity, which is about 50% of total capacity in the US. Refineries in Corpus Christi, Texas are particularly at risk, as they account for 4.8% of the total US refining capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Seasonal demand and refinery operating capacity also contributing to price increases</strong>: Rising seasonal demand has helped lift crude prices to two-month highs, and the fact that Gulf Coast refiners are already operating at 90% to 95% of their capacity means there is no slack in the system to make up for lost production during a refinery shutdown.</li>

Markets care about that because a president can’t implement his full agenda unless a friendly Congress is able to pass the legislation he supports.</p><p>“This is all about bond investors beginning to price in the possibility that not only will Donald Trump emerge victorious but that the GOP will take the House and Senate too,” economist David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research wrote in a July 3 analysis. “Investors are sniffing something out here, which is GOP control of Congress.”</p><p>As a real estate developer who once called himself the “<a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/trump-king-of-debt-224642" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:king of debt;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="15">king of debt</a>,” Trump favors the lowest rates possible.

First, Trump wants to impose new tariffs on imports, which would raise prices on thousands of everyday items, which is basically inflationary. This would come at a time when built-in inflationary pressures, such as <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-prices-underpinned-by-us-inventory-data-attacks-russian-refineries-2024-03-14/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tight global energy markets;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="18">tight global energy markets</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/03/07/Red-Sea-Attacks-Disrupt-Global-Trade" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shipping disruptions in the Red Sea;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="19">shipping disruptions in the Red Sea</a>, are much stronger than when Trump was president from 2017 to 2021.</p><p><a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="mailto:rnewman@yahoofinance.com" data-ylk="slk:Drop Rick Newman a note;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="20"><strong><em>Drop Rick Newman a note</em></strong></a><strong><em>, </em></strong><a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://twitter.com/rickjnewman" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:follow him on Twitter;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="21"><strong><em>follow him on Twitter</em></strong></a><strong><em>, or </em></strong><a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://authory.com/RickNewman" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sign up for his newsletter;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="22"><strong><em>sign up for his newsletter</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p>In 2022, the Federal Reserve began rapidly raising short-term rates to combat inflation that peaked at 9% that year. The Fed stopped raising rates last summer, and inflation is now 3.3%. Recent data suggests that if nothing changes, inflation should continue to decline and the Fed might be able to start gradually cutting interest rates by the fall, which would benefit home and car buyers and many other borrowers.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="23"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>But Trumpflation, if it develops, could put a halt to those rate cuts. The Fed could postpone rate cuts even on the prospect that Trump might win in November — especially if markets are signaling that that’s the expected outcome. And if Trumpflation actually materialized, the Fed might have to raise rates rather than cut.</p><p>Trump also wants to cut the corporate tax rate by another percentage point and extend individual tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of 2025. Such moves would force the Treasury to borrow much more than current forecasts, pushing record-high federal deficits even higher.</p><p>There have already been some disconcerting blips in Treasury auctions in recent months because of the sheer volume of federal debt on the market. Issuing even more could trigger the debt crisis many analysts have been expecting for years. That will happen if/when there aren’t enough buyers for all the debt Uncle Sam is issuing, which will force rates up in order to attract buyers. When Treasury rates rise, all borrowing rates rise in tandem.</p><p>The recent rise in the 10-year rate following the June 27 debate was even more stark until Fed Chair Jerome Powell made <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-powell-says-more-evidence-falling-inflation-needed-before-rate-cuts-2024-07-02/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:optimistic remarks about the outlook for inflation on July 2;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="24">optimistic remarks about the outlook for inflation on July 2</a>. That brought long-term rates down a bit and reignited hopes for a rate cut in September.</p><p>But there’s still a Trump premium on rates. The total run-up before Powell spoke was about 20 basis points, or two-tenths of a point. So it’s fair to consider that markets, for now, are pushing long-term rates two-tenths of a point higher than they would otherwise be based on the odds of a Republican sweep.</p><p>If Trump did win, and rates rose the way investors seem to expect, it would likely put Trump on wartime footing from Day One. Trump has a long history of bashing the Fed and its chair, Powell, for <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/09/11/donald-trump-federal-reserve-jerome-powell/2283889001/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:not pushing rates lower;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="25">not pushing rates lower</a>. During Trump’s first term, he could argue that there was little risk of inflation, so why not lower rates?</p><p>Inflationary pressures are much stronger now, and that won’t change if Biden leaves office, since much of the pressure comes from outside the United States. If Trump managed to jawbone the Fed into lowering rates anyway, the result would most likely be higher inflation — and the same ire from voters that has driven Biden’s popularity underwater. Voters may not see that until 2025, but it’s already a big blip on the market’s radar.</p><p><em>Rick Newman is a senior columnist for </em><a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/author/rick-newman/?.tsrc=fin-srch" data-ylk="slk:Yahoo Finance;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="26"><em>Yahoo Finance</em></a><em>.

<p>A California-based credit union with over 450,000 members said it suffered a ransomware attack that is disrupting account services and could take weeks to recover from.</p>
<p>"The next few days—and coming weeks—may present challenges for our members, as we continue to navigate around the limited functionality we are experiencing due to this incident," Patelco Credit Union CEO Erin Mendez told members in a <a href="https://www.patelco.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/July-1-CEO-Update.pdf">July 1 message</a> that said the security problem was caused by a ransomware attack. Online banking and several other services are unavailable, while several other services and types of transactions have limited functionality.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>Patelco Credit Union was hit by the attack on June 29 and has been posting updates on <a href="https://www.patelco.org/securityupdate">this page</a>, which says the credit union "proactively shut down some of our day-to-day banking systems to contain and remediate the issue... As a result of our proactive measures, transactions, transfers, payments, and deposits are unavailable at this time. Debit and credit cards are working with limited functionality."</p>
<p>Patelco Credit Union is a <a href="https://www.patelco.org/about-patelco/who-we-are">nonprofit cooperative</a> in Northern California with $9 billion in assets and 37 local branches. "Our priority is the safe and secure restoration of our banking systems," a July 2 update said. "We continue to work alongside leading third-party cybersecurity experts in support of this effort. We have also been cooperating with regulators and law enforcement."</p>

<p>Patelco member Enrique Juarez said he was having trouble accessing his Social Security payment, according to <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/07/02/no-end-in-sight-to-patelco-credit-union-security-attack/">the Mercury News</a>. "I've never had a problem before," Juarez told the news organization. "Everything's frozen, I can't even check my balance until this is resolved—and they don't know [when that will happen]."</p>
<p>Patelco says that check and cash deposits should be working, but direct deposits have limited functionality.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Security expert <a href="https://www.profbanafa.com/">Ahmed Banafa</a> "said Tuesday that it looks likely that hackers infiltrated the bank's internal databases via a phishing email and encrypted its contents, locking out the bank from its own systems," the Mercury News reported. Banafa was paraphrased as saying that it is "likely the hackers will demand an amount of money from the credit union to restore its systems back to normal, and will continue to hold the bank's accounts hostage until either the bank finds a way around the hack or until the hackers are paid."</p>
<p>Change Healthcare, a health payment processing company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/change-healthcare-hacked-through-stolen-password-for-account-with-no-mfa/">hit by ransomware</a> this year, <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/what-we-learned-change-healthcare-cyber-attack">told lawmakers</a> that it paid a ransom of $22 million in bitcoin. Change Healthcare owner UnitedHealth failed to use multifactor authentication on critical systems.</p>
<p>Patelco hasn't revealed details about how it will recover from the ransomware attack but acknowledged to customers that their personal information could be at risk. "The investigation into the nature and scope of the incident is ongoing," the credit union said. "If the investigation determines that individuals' information is involved as a result of this incident, we will of course notify those individuals and provide resources to help protect their information in accordance with applicable laws."</p>
<h2>Patelco waives fees, warns of more outages</h2>
<p>Patelco said it is waiving overdraft, late payment, and ATM fees "until we are back up and running." Members who need to access funds from direct deposits can do so by writing a check, using an ATM card to get cash, or by making a purchase, Patelco said.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, members could expect to "experience short, intermittent outages at Patelco ATMs," the organization said. "This is normal and to be expected during our recovery process. Access to shared ATMs will not be interrupted as part of this process and they remain available for cash withdrawals and deposits."</p>
<p>A chart on the security update page says the services that remain unavailable include online banking, the mobile app, outgoing wire transfers, monthly statements, Zelle, balance inquiries, and online bill payments.</p>
<p>Patelco branches, call center services, and live chats have "limited functionality," as do debit card transactions, credit card transactions, and direct deposits, according to the chart. Services that are listed as available include check and cash deposits, ATM withdrawals, ACH transfers, ACH for bill payments, and in-branch loan payments.</p>
