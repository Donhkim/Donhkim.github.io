<ol>
<li>The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) halted trading for some major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway, due to a technical issue that occurred on Monday.</li>
<li>The technical issue caused the stock prices to drop, with Berkshire Hathaway's stock price falling to 99.97% as a result.</li>
<li>The issue was resolved, and the impacted stocks reopened for trading, with all systems operational again.</li>
<li>An investigation by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of NYSE, has found no evidence to suggest that the glitch was caused by a cyberattack.</li>
<li>The issue was caused by a technical issue with industry-wide price bands, which triggered trading halts on up to 40 symbols listed on NYSE Group exchanges. The price bands are published by the Consolidated Tape Association's (CTA) Security Information Processor (SIP).</li>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwtpoqiz0007356jojm86mgm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The increase is projected to be even higher in some parts of the US. Those living in the mid-Atlantic and Pacific are expected to see their bills spike more than 12%, while residents in parts of the Midwest could have to contend with jumps of roughly 10%.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwtpoqiz0008356jhro4hftw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Although electricity prices have fallen slightly, usage is expected to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/07/climate/record-hot-april/index.html">climb along with the thermometer</a>, which will result in bigger bills,<strong> </strong>said Mark Wolfe, the association’s executive director. He pointed to the National Weather Service’s prediction that much of the country will probably have above-normal temperatures this summer.

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwtpoqiz0009356js83oz0lq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “You’ll need more electricity to get through the summer,” he said.

            The association’s cost estimate is higher than that of the US Energy Information Administration, which last month predicted that the average residential electric bill will be $519 for all of June, July and August, up 2.9% from the same period a year earlier. The agency also predicts larger spikes for the mid-Atlantic, Pacific and parts of the Midwest, though not as high as the association’s estimate.

            The difference in projections stems from the association assuming higher rates of usage because of hotter temperatures, Wolfe said. Also, the association’s estimate of the total bill is larger because it includes the month of September in its summer forecast.

            For some Americans, soaring utility bills can lead to death or <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/20/politics/extreme-heat-health-care-costs/index.html">major health consequences</a>. Heat-related deaths are also on the rise, with just over 2,300 people succumbing last year, up from just over 1,600 in 2021, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

            But the US doesn’t have a comprehensive policy to help people stay cool as climate change fuels heat waves that are more intense, last longer and occur more frequently, Wolfe said.

            Currently, about 80% of the federal funding to help people pay for their utilities is used for heating assistance. And while some states and localities provide air conditioners to low-income households, many folks are afraid to use them because of the cost, said Diana Hernandez, an associate professor and co-director of the Energy Opportunity Lab at Columbia University.
    </p>

            At a recent focus group in Chicago, Hernandez met a mother who rides the public buses with her children during hot summer days since she can’t afford to run her air conditioner regularly.

            “There’s a need to rethink and modernize energy assistance programs to reflect current climate realities, which have a lot to do with warming temperatures and increasing needs to stay cool at home for health, safety and survivability,” Hernandez said. “This is real, but our policies don’t reflect the reality.”
    </p>

            Though many Americans are struggling to pay their utilities, federal assistance for these bills was slashed by one-third this fiscal year. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, has $4.1 billion to help consumers with heating and cooling costs, down from $6.1 billion in the prior fiscal year.
    </p>

            States, which distribute the funds to eligible residents, have told the energy assistance directors association that the cut will force them to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/24/politics/home-heating-assistance-program-liheap/index.html">reduce the number of households served</a>, by about 1 million. And those that receive help may have a smaller portion of their arrears paid off or may not have their cooling bills covered.

            The number of people behind in their utility bills and the amount of money they owe are at record highs, according to the association, which began tracking these figures when arrearages exploded in 2020 at the start of the pandemic.

            Some 21.2 million households in the US — or more than 1 in 6 — owed money on their electricity bills in December, up from 20.1 million a year earlier. Electricity and natural gas arrearages combined hit $20.3 billion, up from $17.8 billion the year before.

            What’s more, only 17 states and the District of Columbia provide protections from power shutoffs during summer heat waves, though most states have moratoriums during cold winters. But even in the states with summertime bans, the rules are outdated and inadequate, consumer advocates say. Some only kick in during very high temperatures, while others are triggered by National Weather Service heat advisories or warnings — even though people can overheat even when the thermometer doesn’t climb that high.

<li><strong>Lawsuit filed against Poppi soda</strong>: A San Francisco woman, Kristin Cobbs, has filed a class action lawsuit against VNGR Beverage LLC, the manufacturer of Poppi soda, alleging that the company's claims about the prebiotic fiber content of its products are false and misleading.</li>
<li><strong>Insufficient prebiotic fiber content</strong>: The lawsuit claims that Poppi soda contains only 2 grams of prebiotic fiber per can, which is not enough to cause meaningful gut health benefits. Consumers would need to drink more than four cans a day to receive any potential health benefits, which may be offset by the soda's high sugar content.</li>
<li><strong>High sugar content</strong>: The lawsuit also alleges that Poppi soda contains high levels of cane sugar, which can harm gut health. Drinking enough Poppi to promote gut health would result in harmful levels of cane sugar consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing claims disputed</strong>: The lawsuit disputes Poppi's marketing claims, which promise that the soda can help with gut health. The lawsuit claims that the products are "basically sugared water" and that the company's marketing claims are misleading.</li>
<li><strong>Poppi's response</strong>: The company issued a statement defending its products and stating that it will vigorously defend against the allegations. The company claims to be "proud of the Poppi brand" and its mission to revolutionize the soda industry.</li>

The complaint alleges Poppi sodas only contain two grams of prebiotic fiber, which means "a consumer would need to drink more than four Poppi sodas in a day to realize any potential health benefits."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"However, even if a consumer were to do this, Poppi’s high sugar content would offset most, if not all, of these purported gut health benefits," according to the suit filed in the Northern District of California.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Pictured are cans of Poppi at Poppi Soda's Back Beach Bash at Gurney's Montauk on July 28, 2023, in Montauk, New York." src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/03/USAT/73958231007-1577677497.jpg?width=660&amp;height=441&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/03/USAT/73958231007-1577677497.jpg?width=1320&amp;height=882&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x"><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Pictured are cans of Poppi at Poppi Soda's Back Beach Bash at Gurney's Montauk on July 28, 2023, in Montauk, New York." data-c-credit="Eugene Gologursky, Getty Images For Poppi"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Drinking enough Poppi to "promote gut health" would cause consumers to drink "harmful levels of cane sugar," which the soda is primarily made of, the complaint alleges. Too much cane sugar has been shown to harm gut health, the legal filing continues.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Despite Poppi’s 'prebiotic' marketing claims, which assure consumers, on the can, that they can 'Be Gut Happy (and) Be Gut Healthy,' as one nutritionist bluntly explained: the products 'are basically sugared water,'" according to the complaint.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Poppi addressed the suit in a statement emailed Monday to USA TODAY.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We are proud of the Poppi brand and stand behind our products. We are on a mission to revolutionize soda for the next generation of soda drinkers, and we have diligently innovated to provide a tasting experience that millions of people have come to enjoy," the statement said. "We believe the lawsuit is baseless, and we will vigorously defend against these allegations."</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">What is Poppi soda?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><a href="https://drinkpoppi.com/pages/benefits-101" data-type="link" data-id="https://drinkpoppi.com/pages/benefits-101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">According to Poppi's website</a>, Poppi drinks combine agave inulin, apple cider vinegar and fruit juice into a soda that's 25 calories or less, contains 5 grams of sugar or less and contains prebiotics.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The website notes that the agave inulin is a prebiotic and natural sweetener extracted from the agave tequilana plant.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Inulin is a prebiotic fiber that may support gut health by diversifying the gut microbiome and providing fuel for good bacteria, particularly Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli," the website adds.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/03/USAT/73958274007-1577671236.jpg?width=660&amp;height=507&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/03/USAT/73958274007-1577671236.jpg?width=1320&amp;height=1014&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Stephen Ellsworth and Allison Ellsworth, the founders of Poppi, attend the Poppi Soda's Back Beach Bash at Gurney's Montauk on July 28, 2023, in Montauk, New York."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Stephen Ellsworth and Allison Ellsworth, the founders of Poppi, attend the Poppi Soda's Back Beach Bash at Gurney's Montauk on July 28, 2023, in Montauk, New York." data-c-credit="Eugene Gologursky, Getty Images For Poppi"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Poppi's founders, Allison and Stephen Ellsworth, featured their drink on ABC's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pnR5SOEOOA" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Shark Tank</a>," which led to the sodas being placed on the shelves of Whole Foods Market stores.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">According the the complaint, Poppi's sales topped $100 million as of 2024, and those numbers continue to grow as the drink represents 19% of the U.S. market share, surpassing Coke but 1.5 times.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"With the help of an investment on Shark Tank, Poppi has gone from farmers'-market-favorite to sitting pretty on the shelves of every major retailer across the nation," the <a href="https://drinkpoppi.com/pages/our-story" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">company's website</a> says, while noting that the sodas are "beloved" by stars like Post Malone, Hailey Bieber, Kylie Jenner, Billie Eilish, Russell Westbrook, Jennifer Lopez and Olivia Munn.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Cobbs would not have bought Poppi if she knew the soda 'could negatively impact her health'</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Cobbs last purchased Poppi sodas in March 2024, and based on the drinks' labeling, her understanding was that the products contained "prebiotics" that would make her "gut healthy," the complaint says. If Cobbs knew about Poppi soda's actual prebiotic fiber content, and how the excessive consumption of the product "could negatively impact her health," then she would not have bought the drinks, according to the legal document.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Poppi sodas' inclusion of agave inulin, a type of naturally soluble fiber that when extracted from the agave plant functions as a prebiotic, is mentioned in the complaint. Consuming too much inulin can cause "adverse health results," including a build-up of gas, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and liver damage, according to the suit.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Cobbs, who is suing individually and on behalf of others who bought Poppi sodas under the same assumptions she had, is seeking "restitution and all other forms of equitable monetary relief," according to the complaint.</p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"></p></div></div>

Although the cuts will affect the department that contributes to the HoloLens 2 augmented reality headset, Microsoft plans to continue selling the device.</p><p>The reduction comes a year after the software maker said it would make changes to its hardware lineup as part of a round of layoffs that hit 10,000 employees, including some in mixed reality.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>American Express (Amex) has successfully shifted its focus to appeal to a younger generation of consumers, including Gen Zers and millennials, without compromising its prestige image.</li>
<li>Amex has updated its benefits to focus on rewards that resonate with younger consumers, such as credits on Uber rides, Disney streaming services, and newspapers like The New York Times and Wall Street Journal.</li>
<li>The company has seen significant growth in its premium card offerings, with millennial and Gen Z consumers making up 33% of its billed business in its consumer division.</li>

    news
    </div><div class="content article-descr news-text">
    <div><p class="drop-cap preview">American Express used to be your dad's card. OK, your rich dad's card. Or, fine, your rich friend's rich dad's card. But now, for a growing cohort of Gen Zers and millennials, it's their card, too. Amex has cracked the code with the youngs, and it's managed to do so without giving up its prestige image.</p><div class="premium-content"><p class="premium">But that has started to shift. Amex has updated its benefits mix to focus on younger people with the things they might like. It has used those perks to get Gen Zers and millennials — many of whom have that "wealthy" status — to sign up for premium cards sooner rather than later. The companies' acceptance rate, at least in the US, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wsj-reports-amex-paying-merchants-accept-credit-cards-2019-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="20">is also much improved</a>. You no longer have to enter a restaurant or store checking to see whether the American Express sticker is on the door. Add all this up, and Amex morphs into a popular, relatively accessible status symbol for young consumers.</p><p class="premium">The fruits of the new strategy were pretty clear in the company's first-quarter earnings presentation: Gen Z and millennial consumers made up 33% of its billed business in its consumer division, basically meaning using its products for purchases. By contrast, Gen X represented 37%, and baby boomers 31%. According to the company, millennials and Gen Z consumers made up 60% of its new customer acquisitions worldwide, and 75% of its new platinum and gold accounts were opened by millennial and Gen Z members. Those accounts come with some nice rewards — and some high accompanying fees. The gold card costs $250 a year, and the platinum $700.</p><p class="premium">"We realized that going after millennials and Gen Z was a key thing for us," Amex CEO Steve Squeri said in an April interview with Jim Cramer on CNBC. He explained that while the company used to target them with no-fee cards, it had now turned to trying to attract them with premium, high-fee cards. "With millennials and Gen Zs, what we realized is that they wanted access, they wanted experiences, they wanted to get special privileges," he said. So Amex delivered.</p><p class="premium">Amex has implemented a number of tactics to pull off its youth revolution and cement its place as a status symbol among relatively affluent millennial and Gen Z consumers. For one thing, as Squeri alluded to, it's done some thinking about what the younger crowd wants in terms of rewards. Yes, travel points for flights and hotels are nice, but so are other benefits that have helped turn it into more of a lifestyle card than just a travel card, Michael Miller, an analyst at Morningstar Research, said. The company has folded in rewards such as credits on Uber rides, Disney streaming services, and New York Times and Wall Street Journal subscriptions. It puts money toward Saks shopping sprees and offers credits for Walmart+ memberships.</p><p class="premium">"The way they finance this is they work with the actual retailers to split the cost, and they essentially act as really high-end coupons," Miller said. "That's really how they keep the appeal and keep it luxury, by not really compromising on the price of the cards themselves."</p><p class="premium">Amex gives some of its customers special access for various events, including a chance to buy tickets early or get certain passes to the US Open and Coachella. And it sometimes gives them reserved spaces inside those events, too, keeping its reputation of exclusivity intact. I, for one, have found myself at events staring at some American Express exclusive space and trying to see whether anyone I'm with has the magic card to get us in.</p><p class="premium">"Amex is like, 'You know what? We know that this age cohort is attending Coachella. We're going to have — if you have a platinum card, you can get into the Amex tent. And we're going to have simple things that are really hard to get or expensive to access at Coachella, free water fountains, a place to kind of sit in air conditioning,'" Daisy Hernandez, the credit-cards editor at The Points Guy, said. "Those are the kinds of people who are like, 'I'm going to have this credit card because I want this extra premium access.'"</p><p class="premium">Millennials and Gen Zers, many of whom are hungry for experience over possessions, are not sleeping on the Amex travel perks, either. The platinum card, for example, offers credits on hotels and airline fees, covers the cost of a Clear Plus membership for airport security, and grants complimentary lounge access at multiple airports. It also has restaurant-reservation perks through the platform Resy.</p><p class="premium">"They haven't ditched the travel stuff at all," Miller said. "It's really more of an addition."</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-quote="They're laying the groundwork for the next generation." data-quote-updated="true" data-source="Add source (optional)" data-source-updated="false" class="premium">
                              <blockquote class="pullquote-wrapper pullquote-breakout">
                                <q class="pullquote-quotation headline-bold ignore-typography">They're laying the groundwork for the next generation.</q>
                                
                              </blockquote>
                            </es-blockquote><p class="premium">For many young consumers, having an Amex rewards card is sort of like having a good, varied subscription service that runs them less than $60 a month. Amex says that the platinum card's credits are worth something like $1,500 a year, which is more than double the annual fee. (Amex, of course, has a ton of cards that aren't premium and have a variety of different perks or benefits. It's a real choose-your-own-adventure situation depending on which one you might want, if you do at all.)</p><p class="premium">On American Express' part, this all makes sense. Many young consumers <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/intelligence/the-death-of-cash" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="80">don't carry cash</a> and expect to be able to put everything on their cards. The company's continued focus on high-income, high-spending customers, including Gen Zers and millennials, gives it more bargaining power with merchants who don't want to turn those consumers away. And once Amex gets those customers in the pipeline, it has a lot more time to get value out of them compared with older consumers who are closer to retirement and, you know, death.</p><p class="premium">"They're laying the groundwork for the next generation, and they feel they have a great offering and great growth potential because if you've only catered to the much older, those folks are not going to be around, potentially, in 20 years, whereas the millennial still will be," Stephen Biggar, the director of financial-institutions research at Argus Research, said.</p><p class="premium">Amex isn't alone in targeting the rich, young crowd. Chase Sapphire, for example, is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-sapphire-reserve-vs-amex-platinum-card" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">giving it a run for its money</a> with some of its offerings, namely, its Reserve card. And all consumers might want to consider the trade-offs of their pricey rewards cards. Research has found that rewards cards can be a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich because of the high swipe fees that come with them (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/visa-mastercard-swipe-fees-premium-credit-cards-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">though those swipe fees are coming down a little for a few years</a>). And even if you're not concerned about what happens to the guy paying cash behind you at the bodega, if you don't pay off your credit-card bill every month and instead carry a balance, you may not get the bang for your buck on your rewards.</p><p class="premium">All that aside, the Amex Platinum Card seems neat. Did I spend a significant part of the reporting for this story repeatedly looking up said card and trying to decide whether I should eat the fee and get one? I did. I've got some travel coming up, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coolest-features-of-the-new-amex-centurion-lounge-jfk-airport-2020-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">the Centurion Lounge sounds nice</a>.</p><hr class="premium"><p class="premium"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/emily-stewart" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100"><em>Emily Stewart</em></a><em> is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.</em></p></div>

	<a href="https://variety.com/t/paramount-global/" id="auto-tag_paramount-global" data-tag="paramount-global">Paramount Global</a>‘s months-long M&amp;A drama may soon be coming to a conclusion. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The special committee established by Paramount Global’s board of directors to evaluate M&amp;A proposals has reached an agreement with David Ellison’s <a href="https://variety.com/t/skydance-media/" id="auto-tag_skydance-media" data-tag="skydance-media">Skydance Media</a> and his private-equity backers on the terms of a complicated deal that would merge Skydance and Paramount while keeping Paramount publicly traded, <em>Variety</em> has confirmed. Skydance and its partners, RedBird Capital and KKR, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-skydance-merger-deal-sweeten-1235963443/">sweetened the original buyout offer</a> to make it more attractive to nonvoting shareholders of Paramount Global.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Now, the deal awaits approval by <a href="https://variety.com/t/shari-redstone/" id="auto-tag_shari-redstone" data-tag="shari-redstone">Shari Redstone</a>, non-executive chair of Paramount Global, whose National Amusements Inc. owns 77% of the voting shares in Paramount Global. Redstone has not officially decided whether or not to go forward on the deal, sources said — and the terms of the Skydance-NAI part of the agreement have yet to be worked out. If she does agree, it would end her family’s decades-long control over the media conglomerate and its predecessor companies.

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The Skydance-Paramount merger would not require approval by Paramount’s Class B shareholders.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	On word of the Skydance-Paramount deal potentially nearing the finish line, the price of Class B shares of Paramount Global were trading up 7.5% Monday to about $12.80/share. New details of Skydance’s deal terms were reported earlier by the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/revised-skydance-offer-gives-paramount-shareholders-opportunity-to-cash-out-at-15-a-share-3c2a16b1" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/03/paramount-skydance-merger-deal-update.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Reps for Skydance, Paramount Global and the Paramount board’s special committee declined to comment.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	A rep for NAI said in a statement to <em>Variety</em>, “We received the financial terms of the proposed Paramount/Skydance transaction over the weekend and we are reviewing them.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Under the new offer from Skydance-RedBird-KKR, Paramount Class B shareholders will be able to sell a bit less than half of their stock for $15 per share and the remainder of their shares would be converted into shares in the newly merged Paramount-Skydance, according to sources.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The pact proposes that Skydance will acquire the shares of NAI for roughly $2 billion in cash, thereby assuming control of Paramount Global. Skydance would merge with Paramount, valuing Skydance at less than the previous $5 billion figure under the prior offer, at which point Skydance-RedBird-KKR would own about two-thirds of the combined Paramount-Skydance (and legacy Class B Paramount Global shareholders would own the remainder). Skydance and its financial partners would also pay Paramount $1.5 billion in cash, intended to go toward reducing Paramount’s $14.6 billion in long-term debt (as of the end of March).

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Paramount Global is holding its 2024 annual shareholders meeting on Tuesday (June 2) starting at 9 a.m. ET, but it is unlikely that a deal with Skydance will officially be a go by then.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	After Redstone and Skydance did not clinch a deal on Skydance’s previous offer, Sony Pictures and private-equity giant Apollo Global Management <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/sony-apollo-paramount-global-acquisition-offer-cash-1235981220/">emerged as prospective bidders for Paramount Global</a> but have since backed off their $26 billion all-cash offer to buy the entire company. The Sony-Apollo bid would face a number of regulatory hurdles, including requiring a separate ownership structure for CBS’s owned TV stations.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Oil prices fell by up to 3.5% on Monday after OPEC+ decided to start unwinding some voluntary cuts earlier than expected due to soft demand and recent price declines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures fell to below $75 per barrel, while Brent crude fell to around $78.60 per barrel in midday trading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision to unwind some voluntary cuts comes as the oil alliance, led by Saudi Arabia, extends its existing cuts of 3.6 million barrels per day until the end of next year, but begins to lift additional reductions of 2.2 million barrels per day starting in October.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysts believe that the move could be premature, as a demand slowdown is forecast for next year, and that OPEC's massive effective spare capacity could make it difficult to accommodate further supply reductions in the second half of 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The downward trend in oil prices has resulted in a decline of around 13% from the April peak, with oil futures still down by around 8% from their April peak.</p>

Meanwhile, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers rose 4.1% through 2023. At half the companies in AP's annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company’s pay scale almost 200 years to make what their CEO did.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“In this post-pandemic market, the desire is for boards to reward and retain CEOs when they feel like they have a good leader in place,” said Kelly Malafis, founding partner of Compensation Advisory Partners in New York. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The AP’s CEO compensation survey included pay data for 341 executives at S&amp;P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Hock Tan, the CEO of Broadcom, topped the AP survey with a pay package valued at about $162 million. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Broadcom granted Tan stock awards valued at $160.5 million on Oct. 31, 2022, for the company's 2023 fiscal year. Tan was given the opportunity to earn up to 1 million shares starting in fiscal 2025, according to a securities filing, provided that Broadcom’s stock meets certain targets – and he remains CEO for five years. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">At the time of the award, Broadcom’s stock was trading at $470. The stock has skyrocketed since, and reached an all-time high of $1,436.17 on May 15. Tan will receive the full award if the average closing price is at or above $1,125 for 20 consecutive days between October 2025 and October 2027. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Broadcom noted that under Tan its market value has increased from $3.8 billion in 2009 to $645 billion (as of May 23) and that its total shareholder return during that time easily surpassed that of the S&amp;P 500. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Other CEOs at the top of AP’s survey are William Lansing of Fair Isaac Corp, ($66.3 million); Tim Cook of Apple Inc. ($63.2 million); Hamid Moghadam of Prologis Inc. ($50.9 million); and Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix ($49.8 million). </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Lisa Su, CEO of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, was the highest paid female CEO in the AP survey for the fifth year in a row in fiscal 2023, bringing in compensation valued at $30.3 million — flat with her compensation package in 2022. Her overall rank rose to 21 from 25.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Workers across the country have been winning higher pay since the pandemic, with wages and benefits for private-sector employees rising 4.1% in 2023 after a 5.1% increase in 2022, according to the Labor Department. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Even with those gains, the gap between the person in the corner office and everyone else keeps getting wider. Half the CEOs in this year’s pay survey made at least 196 times what their median employee earned. That’s up from 185 times in last year’s survey.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The disparity between what the chief executive makes and the workers earn wasn't always so wide. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">After World War II and up until the 1980s, CEOs of large publicly traded companies made about 40 to 50 times the average worker’s pay, said Brandon Rees, deputy director of corporations and capital markets for the AFL-CIO, which runs an Executive Paywatch website that tracks CEO pay.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“The (current) pay ratio signals a sort of a winner take all culture, that companies are treating their CEOs as, you know, as superstars as opposed to, team players,” Rees said. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Despite the criticism, shareholders tend to give overwhelming support to pay packages for company leaders. From 2019 to 2023, companies typically received just under 90% of the vote for their executive compensation plans, according to data from Equilar. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Shareholders do, however, occasionally reject a compensation plan, although the votes are non-binding. In 2023, shareholders at 13 companies in the S&amp;P 500 gave the pay package less than 50% support. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said Say on Pay votes are important because they “shine a spotlight on some of the most egregious cases of executive access, and it can lead to negotiations over pay and other issues that shareholders might want to raise with corporate leadership.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">After its investors gave another resounding thumbs down to the pay packages for its top executives, Netflix met with many of its biggest shareholders last year to discuss their concerns. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Following the talks, Netflix announced several changes to redesign its pay policies. For one, it eliminated executives’ choice to allocate their compensation between cash and options. It will no longer give out stock options, which can give executives a payday as long as the stock price stays above a certain level. Instead, the company will give restricted stock that executives can profit from only after a certain amount of time or after certain performance measures are met.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The changes will take effect in 2024. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">More broadly, say on pay votes haven't made a big difference, Anderson says. “I think the impact, certainly on the overall size of CEO packages has not had much effect in some cases.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">___</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN">Ortutay reported from San Francisco.

<p>Spotify is once again raising the price of Spotify Premium in the United States. Although the ad-supported free tier remains available, the price of Spotify’s Premium tier is now more expensive than <a href="https://tinyurl.com/getapplemusic">Apple Music</a>. Spotify customers will be notified of the increases over the next month.</p>



<p>Spotify Premium Individual is now priced at $11.99 per month, compared to $10.99 per month for Apple Music. The Family plan price is also up and now costs $19.99, compared to $16.99 for Apple Music Family …</p>



<span id="more-951486"></span>



<p>Spotify Premium Duo, which allows for streaming by two people in the same household, is now $16.99 – the same price as what Apple Music charges for Family, which supports up to six family members.</p>



<p>In an email to customers, Spotify says that the price of its services are rising so that it can “continue to invest in and innovate on our product offerings and features”. The company has expanded into podcasts and audiobooks content in recent years. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/Email-Screenshot.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all" alt="" class="wp-image-951489" srcset="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/Email-Screenshot.jpg 480w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/Email-Screenshot.jpg?resize=155,128 155w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/Email-Screenshot.jpg?resize=350,289 350w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/Email-Screenshot.jpg?resize=140,116 140w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/Email-Screenshot.jpg?resize=150,124 150w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></figure>



<p>For instance, Spotify Premium includes 15 hours of audiobook listening per month, something that Apple doesn’t offer.</p>



<p>However, long-requested music features like lossless audio or Spatial Audio remain absent. (When those features do finally arrive, Spotify is expected to charge extra to get them — unlike Apple Music where they are included at no additional charge.)</p>



<p>For context, Apple Music last raised its <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/10/24/apple-music-tv-prices-going-up/">prices in October 2022</a>. It is of course possible Apple will increase prices in kind in the coming months, but nothing has been announced as of yet.</p>

<p>Adult content has always proliferated on Twitter, but the platform now called X recently clarified its <a href="https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/adult-content">policy</a> to officially allow "consensually produced and distributed adult nudity or sexual behavior."</p>
<p>X's rules seem simple. As long as content is "properly labeled and not prominently displayed," users can share material—including AI-generated or animated content—"that is pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal."</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>"We believe that users should be able to create, distribute, and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it is consensually produced and distributed," X's policy said.</p>
<p>The policy update seemingly reflects X's core mission to defend all legal speech. It protects a wide range of sexual expression, including depictions of explicit or implicit sexual behavior, simulated sexual intercourse, full or partial nudity, and close-ups of genitals, buttocks, or breasts.</p>
<p>"Sexual expression, whether visual or written, can be a legitimate form of artistic expression," X's policy said. "We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality."</p>
<p>Today, X Support promoted the update <a href="https://x.com/Safety/status/1797669613775282677">on X</a>, confirming that "we have launched Adult Content and Violent Content policies to bring more clarity of our Rules and transparency into enforcement of these areas. These policies replace our former Sensitive Media and Violent Speech policies—but what we enforce against hasn’t changed."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Seemingly also unchanged: none of this content can be monetized, as X's ad policy says that "to ensure a positive user experience and a healthy conversation on the platform, X prohibits the promotion of adult sexual content globally."</p>
<p>Under the policy, adult content is also prohibited from appearing in live videos, profile pictures, headers, list banners, or community cover photos.</p>
<p>X has been toying with the idea of fully embracing adult content and has even planned a feature for adult creators that could position X as an OnlyFans rival. That plan was delayed, Platformer <a href="https://www.platformer.news/twitters-other-porn-problem/">reported</a> in 2022, after red-teaming flagged a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to the launch: "Twitter cannot accurately detect child sexual exploitation and non-consensual nudity at scale."</p>
<p>The new adult content policy still emphasizes that non-consensual adult content is prohibited, but it's unclear if the platform has gotten any better at distinguishing between consensually produced content and nonconsensual material. X did not immediately respond to Ars' request to comment.</p>
<p>For adult content to be allowed on the platform, X now requires content warnings so that "users who do not wish to see it can avoid it" and "children below the age of 18 are not exposed to it."</p>
<p>Users who plan to regularly post adult content can adjust their account's media settings to place a label on all their images and videos. That results in a content warning for any visitor of that account's profile, except for "people who have opted in to see possibly sensitive content," who "will still see your account without the message."</p>
<p>Users who only occasionally share adult content can choose to avoid the account label and instead edit an image or video to add a one-time label to any individual post, flagging just that post as sensitive.</p>
<p>Once a label is applied, any users under 18 will be blocked from viewing the post, X said.</p>

<li><strong>Broad application</strong>: The data suggests the potential for the shot to help treat a "broad range" of melanoma patients, regardless of certain factors such as tumor mutation or PD-L1 protein levels.</li>
<li><strong>Pipeline boost</strong>: The positive results have helped shore up investor sentiment for Moderna, whose Covid vaccine demand plummeted last year, making this pipeline therapy a key part of its pipeline.</li>

The combination also slashed the risk of melanoma spreading to other parts of the body, or death, by 62%.</p><p>The most common side effects associated with the vaccine were fatigue, injection site pain and chills, according to the data. The majority of those side effects were mild. Patients who received the combination had slightly higher immune-related side effects.</p><p>The vaccine, which uses the same mRNA technology as Moderna’s Covid vaccine, is custom-built based on an analysis of a patient’s tumors after surgical removal. The shot is designed to train the immune system to recognize and attack specific mutations in cancer cells. </p><p>Moderna is excited about working to reduce the time between the initial analysis of a tumor and when a patient gets injected with the shot, CEO Stephane Bancel said in an interview with CNBC.</p><p>Meanwhile, Merck’s Keytruda, which is approved to treat melanoma and other cancers, belongs to a class of widely used immunotherapies designed to disable a certain protein that helps cancer evade the immune system.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February gave <a href="https://www.merck.com/news/moderna-and-merck-announce-mrna-4157-v940-an-investigational-personalized-mrna-cancer-vaccine-in-combination-with-keytruda-pembrolizumab-was-granted-breakthrough-therapy-designation-by-the/" target="_blank">breakthrough therapy designation</a> to the cancer vaccine for the treatment of melanoma. That designation aims to speed up the development and review of treatments for serious and life-threatening diseases.</p><p>But Moderna and Merck also plan to file for accelerated approval with the FDA, Bancel noted. The process allows for expedited approvals of drugs for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need.</p><p>Melanoma is responsible for the large majority of skin cancer deaths, according to the American Cancer Society. The rate of melanoma has increased rapidly over the past few decades, according to the organization.</p><p>About 100,000 people will be diagnosed with melanoma in the U.S. this year and nearly 8,000 people are expected to die from the disease, according to the American Cancer Society.</p><p>The two drugmakers are studying the combination as a treatment for late-stage melanoma in a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-moderna-begin-late-stage-study-mrna-cancer-vaccine-2023-07-26/" target="_blank">phase-three trial</a>, which began in July. Bancel said the progress of that trial is “ahead of our plans” so far. </p><p>Merck is also conducting another phase three trial of the vaccine in patients with a type of lung cancer. </p><p>This year, Merck and Moderna started a two-part mid- to late-stage trial on the vaccine and Keytruda in patients at an advanced stage of a common skin cancer. The companies are also conducting a phase two trial in certain patients with a type of kidney cancer, and another study on people with a type of bladder cancer.</p></div></div>

                                        <p>Opening stores used to mean everything to pharmacy chains. </p><p>CVS Health once boasted of opening or buying more than 2,900 locations in a five-year period. Now it’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cvs-pharmacy-labor-strike-earnings-5cdb7e195d6b92dd6ab74924af2bf974">shuttering hundreds</a></span>, while Walgreens, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/rite-aid-bankruptcy-pharmacy-desert-0739cda0df8d199d3a6c001612b0e8fc">Rite Aid</a></span> and independent drugstores also pull back. </p><p>An industry that saw waves of store growth before the COVID-19 pandemic faces headwinds like falling prescription reimbursement, persistent theft and changing shopping habits. But as drugstores right-size their physical footprint, experts say they can leave behind communities that have come to depend on them as trusted sources of care and advice — both of which can be hard to find in many urban and rural areas. </p>



<p>“That trust, you just can’t quantify it,” said Omolola Adepoju, a University of Houston health services researcher. “And I don’t think it gets spoken about enough when we talk about pharmacy closures.”</p>
    

<p>There’s a pattern to who has access to pharmacies, with gaps forming in urban and rural neighborhoods.</p><p>Residents of neighborhoods that are largely Black and Latino have fewer pharmacies per capita than people who live in mostly white neighborhoods, according to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://interactives.ap.org/pharmacy-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Associated Press analysis</a></span> of licensing data from 44 states, data from the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs and the American Community Survey. It’s consistent with prior research that documents where urban “pharmacy deserts” are more likely to be concentrated. </p>
    

    
<p>The AP also analyzed data from 49 states and found those with the fewest retail pharmacies per capita include Alaska, Oregon and New Mexico. About two-thirds of retail pharmacies in those states were owned by chains, while independent pharmacies tend to concentrate more in urban markets or states with bigger populations. </p><h2>PHARMACY AS A CARE LOCATION</h2><p>Drugstores have become <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cvs-health-corp-business-medicare-1244b36f28b00d45688ced3bdfcb5a79">bigger sources of care</a></span> in recent years, sometimes by design or necessity — especially for customers who work multiple jobs and can’t easily get to a doctor. Many pharmacies, including <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/walgreens-villagemd-clinics-0d03184cfa3934705d615e8bd1e8bb51">the two largest chains</a></span>, offer clinics and more than a dozen vaccines to treat patients. They’ve also encouraged pharmacists to counsel patients more on managing conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure. </p>
    

<p>Prakash Patel at Bert’s Pharmacy in Elizabeth, New Jersey, said sometimes the pharmacy is a sick customer’s “first stop.”</p><p>“There is no easy access to a doctor’s office. You need an appointment. They have limited hours,” the store owner and pharmacist said. “So any time any child or adult — whoever is sick — where are they going to go first?

    </div><p>In rural areas, drugstores often serve multiple roles for their communities, with pharmacists seeing regular customers more than a doctor does, said Megan Undeberg, a community pharmacy expert at Washington State University. That means they may be the first to notice signs of things like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease and suggest the patient seek help.</p><p>“You’re the smoking cessation counselor, you’re the suicide prevention counselor,” she said. ”You know just about everything about everyone, but it’s confidential.” </p>
    

<p>A few weeks before the CVS in Herscher, Illinois, closed in early March, farmer Kip Harms picked up a muscle relaxer for a back injury. He asked the staff if he could take it with Tylenol. </p><p>Harms said he’ll have other options in the rural area that’s nearly 80 miles south of Chicago, but it won’t be the same. </p><p>“You can stand here and have a conversation,” said Harms, 56, from nearby Cullom. “You go to the big giant one where there’s 40 people in line, you feel like you’re inconveniencing the person that’s helping you.”</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth="">

But drugstores routinely close because they aren’t doing well or the population has dropped — and the pace of closures is picking up. </p><p>CVS said in 2021 that it planned to close 900 stores over three years; more than 600 already have shuttered. Rite Aid is expected to close hundreds as it works through <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/rite-pharmacy-bankruptcy-f80c3d231946d675b03e4e797f627fa6">a bankruptcy reorganization.</a></span></p>
    

<p>Across the U.S., more than 7,000 pharmacies have closed since 2019, according to data from University of Pittsburgh researcher Lucas Berenbrok, who considers that estimate conservative. Of those pharmacies, 54% were independent drugstores, an AP analysis of Berenbrok’s data found.</p><p>“I think what (drugstores) have realized in the past couple years is that they are a little thinly spread out,” said Keonhee Kim, an analyst at the research firm Morningstar.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth="">

That’s tough when customers also are less reliant on drugstores now than in decades past. </p><p>He said shoppers buy more things online or during bigger trips to Costco or Walmart, and discount stores look even more attractive when inflation pushes up prices.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth="">

    <div><div class="story_text"><p>Business mogul Rupert Murdoch has started a new chapter in his life at 93 years old. The former co-chairman of the Fox Corporation has tied the knot for the fifth time. His new bride Elena Zhukova, is a 67-year-old retired molecular biologist. It is never too late to embark on a path of happiness, more so if you have found a partner to share the joy with. Mr Murdoch surely understands the sentiment. Pictures of the couple's hush-hush <a href="https://swirlster.ndtv.com/sex-relationships/eminems-daughter-hailie-jade-is-ready-to-wake-up-a-wife-after-getting-married-to-evan-mcclintock-5720565">wedding</a> ceremony at the business magnate's picturesque Bel Air vineyard and estate in California have surfaced online. While the newlyweds looked as radiant as the bright summer sun, we cannot stop gushing at their simple yet elegant nuptial costumes. Minus any fancy or over-the-top elements, Mr and Mrs Mudroch upheld the charm of simplicity in their contrasting colour-coded costumes. The pair served as proof that marriage unions can also be sophisticated and understated.</p><p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails"></p><p>(Also Read: <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://swirlster.ndtv.com/travel/egypt-came-to-life-as-the-backdrop-of-indian-billionaire-ankur-jain-and-ex-wwe-wrestler-erika-hammonds-wedding-5549947">Egypt Came To Life As The Backdrop Of Indian Billionaire Ankur Jain and Ex-WWE Wrestler Erika Hammond's Wedding</a>)</p><blockquote class="insta-lazy-load instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7vm5gxIQMH/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"></blockquote><p>Elena Zhukova chose an off-shoulder <a href="https://swirlster.ndtv.com/style/ahead-of-her-cannes-2024-red-carpet-debut-kiara-advani-in-a-white-prabal-gurung-gown-channels-chic-french-riviera-style-5689252">white gown</a> for her D-day. The figure-hugging silhouette came with a unique structured neckline and quarter-sleeves. The cinched bodice plunged into an A-line fit, ending just a few inches above her ankles. The ensemble was minus any drama but delivered a maximal effect with its touch of grace. At a time when veils have become a wedding staple, Ms Elena said goodbye to wearing one. Taking the path less trodden, she wove femininity with modernity beautifully. </p><p>A delicate floral bracelet and diamond studs rounded off Elena Zhukova's accessory department. She held a Lilly bouquet in her hands, doubling up the all-white allure. For makeup, she took the rosy, soft-glam route.
