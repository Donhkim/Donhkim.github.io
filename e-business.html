<ol>
<li>A company called American Rounds has installed computerized vending machines in grocery stores in Alabama, Oklahoma, and Texas that sell ammunition, allowing customers to purchase bullets alongside groceries.</li>
<li>The machines use facial recognition software and an identification scanner to verify the purchaser's age and are designed to be "quick and easy" to use, similar to a computer tablet.</li>

<li>The CEO of American Rounds, Grant Magers, argues that the age-verification technology makes the transactions more secure than online sales or retail store sales, which may not require proof of age or are vulnerable to shoplifting.</li>
<li>The company has currently installed machines in 6 locations and plans to expand to additional locations in Texas and Colorado in the coming weeks, with Magers comparing the concept to selling ammunition at a store like Walmart.</li>

                                        <p>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — A company has installed computerized vending machines to sell ammunition in grocery stores in Alabama, Oklahoma and Texas, allowing patrons to pick up bullets along with a gallon of milk.</p><p>American Rounds said their machines use an identification scanner and facial recognition software to verify the purchaser’s age and are as “quick and easy” to use as a computer tablet. But advocates worry that selling bullets out of vending machines will lead to more shootings in the U.S., where gun violence killed at least 33 people <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gun-violence-shootings-july-fourth-90bd7b9473e280e14429489decafd552">on Independence Day alone</a></span>. </p><p>The company maintains the age-verification technology means that the transactions are as secure, or more secure, than online sales, which may not require the purchaser to submit proof of age, or at retail stores, where there is a risk of shoplifting. </p><p>“I’m very thankful for those who are taking the time to get to know us and not just making assumptions about what we’re about,” CEO Grant Magers said. “We are very pro-Second Amendment, but we are for responsible gun ownership, and we hope we’re improving the environment for the community.”</p>
    

<p>There have been 15 mass killings involving a firearm so far in 2024, compared to 39 in 2023, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/mass-killings/index.html">according to a database</a></span> maintained in a partnership of The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. </p>



<p>“Innovations that make ammunition sales more secure via facial recognition, age verification, and the tracking of serial sales are promising safety measures that belong in gun stores, not in the place where you buy your kids milk,” said Nick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety. “In a country awash in guns and ammo, where guns are the leading cause of deaths for kids, we don’t need to further normalize the sale and promotion of these products.”</p>
    
<p>Magers said grocery stores and others approached the Texas-based company, which began in 2023, about the idea of selling ammunition through automated technology. The company has one machine in Alabama, four in Oklahoma and one in Texas, with plans for another in Texas and one in Colorado in the coming weeks, he said. </p>
    

<p>“People I think got shocked when they thought about the idea of selling ammo at a grocery store,” Magers said. “But as we explained, how is that any different than Walmart?” </p><p>Federal law requires a person to be 18 to buy shotgun and rifle ammunition and 21 to buy handgun ammunition. Magers said their machines require a purchaser to be at least 21.</p><p>The machine works by requiring a customer to scan their driver’s license to validate that they are age 21 or older. The scan also checks that it is a valid license, he said. That is followed by a facial recognition scan to verify “you are who you are saying you are as a consumer,” he said.</p><p>“At that point you can complete your transaction of your product and you’re off and going,” he said. “The whole experience takes a minute and a half once you are familiar with the machine.” </p><p>The vending machine is another method of sale, joining retail stores and online retailers. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://smokinggun.org/report/underage-ammo-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A March report</a></span> by Everytown for Gun Safety found that several major online ammunition retailers did not appear to verify their customers’ ages, despite requirements. </p>
    

<p>Last year, an online retailer <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="agreed%20to%20maintain%20an%20age%20verification%20system%20for%20customers%20buying%20ammunitio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settled a lawsuit</a></span> brought by families of those killed and injured in a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-us-news-ap-top-news-greg-abbott-shootings-32220cb5316b4fbf9dd7f9d5b125c6f9">2018 Texas high school shooting</a></span>. The families said the 17-year-old shooter was able to buy ammunition from the retailer who failed to verify his age. </p><p>Vending machines for bullets or other age-restricted materials is not an entirely new idea. Companies have developed similar technology to sell alcoholic beverages. A company has marketed automated kiosks to sell cannabis products in dispensaries in states where marijuana is legal.</p><p>A Pennsylvania police officer created a company about 12 years ago that places bullet-vending machines in private gun clubs and ranges as a convenience for patrons. Those machines do not have the age verification mechanism but are only placed in locations with an age requirement to enter, Master Ammo owner Sam Piccinini said. </p>
    

<p>Piccinini spoke with a company years ago about incorporating the artificial intelligence technology to verify a purchaser’s age and identity, but at the time it was cost-prohibitive, he said. For American Rounds, one machine had to be removed from a site in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, because of disappointing sales, Magers said. </p><p>Magers said much of the early interest for the machines has been in rural communities where there may be few retailers that sell ammunition. The American Rounds machines are in Super C Mart and Fresh Value grocery stores in small cities, including Pell City, Alabama, which has a population over 13,600, and Noble, Oklahoma, where nearly 7,600 people live. </p><p>“Someone in that community might have to drive an hour or an hour and a half to get supplied if they want to go hunting, for instance,” Margers said. “Our grocery stores, they wanted to be able to offer their customer another category that they felt like would be popular.”</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 Max jet experienced an unusual flight condition known as a "Dutch roll", characterized by a swaying, rhythmic motion of the tail and wingtips.</li>
<li>The plane had been parked overnight at the New Orleans airport on May 16 during a strong storm with gusting winds up to 84 mph, and then underwent routine maintenance before the incident on May 25.</li>
<li>After the incident, Southwest mechanics found "substantial" damage to the aircraft's tail, including fractures in the metal bracket and ribs that hold a backup power control unit to the rudder system.</li>
<li>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has not yet determined when the damage occurred, but experts believe it may have been caused by the strong storm winds that slammed the rudder back and forth while the plane was parked.</li>
<li>The plane was grounded for over a month but has since returned to service, and investigators are examining the damaged parts to determine the cause of the Dutch roll incident.</li>

The Southwest jet experienced the movement at 34,000 feet and again after descending to 32,000 feet while flying from Phoenix to Oakland, California.</p>
    

<p>The condition can be dangerous, and modern planes have a “yaw damper” to stop the oscillations that characterize Dutch roll.</p><p>After the plane landed, Southwest mechanics found fractures in the metal bracket and ribs that hold a backup power control unit to the rudder system. Investigators examined the damaged parts last week in Ogden, Utah.</p>



<p>The NTSB said the plane was parked overnight at the New Orleans airport on May 16 during thunderstorms that packed gusting winds up to 84 mph, heavy rain and a tornado watch.</p>
    
<p>On May 23, the plane underwent scheduled maintenance, and afterward pilots noticed the rudder pedals moving when the yaw damper was engaged. Pilots on the May 25 flight felt the pedals moving during the Dutch roll and even after landing, the NTSB said. </p><p>John Cox, a former airline pilot and now a safety consultant, said the NTSB preliminary report indicates that the plane was most likely damaged during the storm. He said the near hurricane-force winds could have caused the rudder on the parked jet to slam back and forth. </p>
    

<p>Cox said there was “absolutely no way in the world” the Dutch roll caused such severe damage, nor does he think it was related to the maintenance work.</p><p>“I do not see this as a Max issue. I do not see this right now as a 737 issue,” he said. “I see this as a one-off.”</p><p>Southwest inspected its 231 Max jets last month and found no other cases of damage around the rudder power units and no problems in new planes it has received since, according to the NTSB.</p><p>Dallas-based Southwest declined to comment.</p><p>It could be a year or longer before the NTSB determines a probable cause for the incident. </p>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">BYD Has Its Eyes Set On Conquering Europe</figcaption></p></figure><p>On Monday, BYD Company Limited (OTC: <a class="link " href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BYDDY" data-ylk="slk:BYDDY;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" data-rapid_p="12">BYDDY</a>) signed a deal to open a $1 billion electric-vehicle factory in Turkey, directly threatening the dominance of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: <a class="link " href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TSLA" data-ylk="slk:TSLA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" data-rapid_p="13">TSLA</a>) in several European markets.</p><h3>BYD Is Boosting Its Presence In Europe</h3><p>Although BYD has already been selling its EVs in Europe since 2021, most of its sales are still in China, but the Tesla killer is aggressively expanding its footrpint outside its home market. This will be its second facility in Europe, with the first currently undergoing construction in Hungary. Its facility in Turkey will be located in Manisa province, allowing BYD to avoid 40% tariffs in the country. In addition, Turkey has a customs trade deal with the European Union, which hit BYD with provisional tariffs for imported Chinese electric vehicles last week, adding a 17.4% charge to the existing 10% rate for vehicles that were not manufactured within the EU.</p><p>According to Investor’s Business Daily, the annual capacity of BYD’s facility in Turkey will be 150,000 EV, and it will also include a research and development division.</p><h3>BYD Continues To Expand Its Global Footprint</h3><p>Last Thursday, BYD opened its first EV plant in Southeast Asia or more precisely, in Thailand. Its first facility outside Asia will be in Brazil, as BYD took over old plant of Ford Motor<strong> </strong>(NYSE: <a class="link " href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=F" data-ylk="slk:F;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" data-rapid_p="14">F</a>) and started revamping it into an EV facility earlier this year. In June, Bloomberg reported BYD is also finalizing talks for a plant in Mexico, which is expected to create about 10,000 jobs. In this aspect, BYD is following the footsteps of Tesla, taking a leaf from its Gigafactory book.</p><p>While Tesla reported a second consecutive fall in deliveries, BYD posted record June and second-quarter sales. Tesla did beat estimates as the global sales drop of 4% was lower than what Wall street analysts expected, but BYD posted record second quarter sales of 986,720 EVs, which translates to an increase of 57%. In June alone, BYD reported a 35% YoY growth as it sold 341,658 EVs. These robust figures are the result of affordable pricing as BYD led a price war during the first quarter with which it hurt its rivals, Tesla included.</p><p>Putting BYD's agressive approach aside, challenges and competitive threats remain.</p><p>However, even BYD has challenges ahead with much smaller rivals and startups intensifying their efforts. One example is Nio Inc (NYSE: <a class="link " href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NIO" data-ylk="slk:NIO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" data-rapid_p="15">NIO</a>) that also reproted record June and second quarter sales last week. Last month, Nio revealed its affordable EV brand, Onvo.  Also, Nio will be bringing an affordable EV to Europe next year.  With Nio, along with other startups, planning to launch more affordable EVs in the coming months, the competitive threat is intensifying both for Tesla and BYD, whose margins have been hurt by price wars which they both used to boost demand.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="16"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p><em>DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Eight of the stores slated for sale are in Chicago.</p>
<p>If Kroger and Albertsons — <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2022/10/13/jewel-and-marianos-could-join-forces-in-possible-kroger-albertsons-megamerger/">which first announced plans to merge in 2022</a> — secure approval for the deal, the store locations listed would be sold  to C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers for $2.9 billion. Most Kroger-owned Mariano’s would be divested under the plan, which calls for selling 31 of the company’s 44 stores. Kroger has also said it would sell the Mariano’s brand name to C&amp;S.</p>
<p>Just four of the planned divestitures are Albertsons-owned Jewel-Osco locations.</p>


<p>In an initial divestiture plan announced in September, the companies said they planned to sell off more than 400 grocery stores nationwide, including 14 <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2023/09/08/kroger-will-sell-marianos-brand-name-and-some-marianos-stores-as-it-prepares-to-merge-with-albertsons/">in Illinois.</a></p>
<p>Facing federal scrutiny over their planned $24.6 billion megamerger, the companies <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/04/22/kroger-albertsons-will-sell-off-more-illinois-stores-illinois-divestiture-plan/">upped the number of planned divestitures</a> to a total of 579 in April with 35 planned divestitures in Illinois, though they did not specify at the time exactly where those stores would be located.</p>
<p>It’s still not clear if the plan will satisfy federal regulators. The Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/02/26/us-sues-to-block-merger-of-grocery-giants-kroger-and-albertsons-saying-it-could-push-prices-higher/">sued to block</a> the merger in February, saying it could lead to higher prices for consumers and lower wages for workers. A trial in that case, which was joined by several states including Illinois, is scheduled to begin Aug. 26.</p>
<p>The merger has also faced scrutiny from labor unions and elected officials. When Illinois joined the FTC lawsuit filed in February, Attorney General Kwame Raoul said the planned merger would “greatly reduce competition in the grocery market while leading to fewer choices for consumers and increased grocery prices at a time many families are struggling to keep up.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a coalition of United Food &amp; Commercial Workers local unions released a joint statement pledging to continue their opposition to the merger, saying it would harm workers, shoppers and suppliers.</p>				
<p>“Today’s announcement changes nothing,” the statement from the coalition of locals, all of which are located outside of Illinois, read. “The merger is not a done deal, far from it.”</p>
<p>In a news release in April, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said all frontline grocery workers would keep their jobs and that their existing collective bargaining agreements would be honored.</p>
<p>“Our proposed merger with Albertsons will bring lower prices and more choices to more customers and secure the long-term future of unionized grocery jobs,” McMullen said in a statement at the time.</p>

<p>Robots, whether they are bipedal humanoids handling basic factory tasks or four-legged military “robot dogs” intended for urban combat, need brains. Historically, these have been highly specialized and purpose-built. But a Pittsburgh-based robotics startup claims it’s created a single off-the-shelf intelligence that can be plugged into different robots to enable basic functions.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p class="article_paragraph_2"></p>
<p>Founded in May 2023 by Abhinav Gupta and Deepak Pathak, two former Carnegie Mellon University professors, Skild AI has created a foundational model for what it describes as a “general purpose brain” that can be slotted into a variety of robots, enabling them to do things like climbing steep slopes, walking over objects obstructing its path and identifying and picking up items.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p>The company announced Tuesday it has raised $300 million at a $1.5 billion valuation in a Series A funding round led by Lightspeed Ventures, Softbank, Coatue and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos with participation from CRV, Felicis Ventures, Menlo Ventures, Amazon and General Catalyst, among others.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>
<p>Raviraj Jain, the Lightspeed partner who also led the company’s seed round in July 2023 told <em>Forbes</em> he was wildly impressed with Skild AI’s models when he first saw them being pressure tested last April. Robots using them were able to perform tasks in environments that they’d never seen before and hadn’t been designed for demos. “The robots at that time were able to climb stairs, and I think it's really crazy how well they were able to do it because it's a very complex stability problem,” he said.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p><fbs-ad position="top" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-top"><p id="article-0-top"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>More impressive, still: The robots using Skild’s AI models also demonstrated “emergent capabilities”— entirely new abilities they weren’t taught. These are often simple, like recovering an object that slips out of hand or rotating an object. But they demonstrate the model’s ability to perform unanticipated tasks, a tendency that occurs in advanced artificial systems like large language models.</p>

<p class="article_paragraph_7"></p><p>Skild has pulled this off by training its model on a massive database of text, images and video — one it claims is 1000 times larger than those used by its rivals. To create this massive database, the cofounders, both former AI researchers at Meta, blended a mix of data collection techniques, which they have developed and tested over years of research.</p>
<p>One way was to hire human contractors to operate robots remotely and collect data about those actions. Another was to have the robot carry out random tasks, record the results and learn by trial and error. The AI model was also trained on millions of public videos.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-1"><p id="article-0-topx-1"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>As a PhD student at UC Berkeley, Pathak developed a way of instilling “artificial curiosity" into robots by rewarding the system for producing outcomes that come about when it can’t predict the results of its actions. “The more uncertain the agent is about the prediction of the effect of its actions, the more curious it gets to explore,” he explained. The technique incentivized the AI to navigate more scenarios and collect more data.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://pathak22.github.io/large-scale-curiosity/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://pathak22.github.io/large-scale-curiosity/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pathak22.github.io/large-scale-curiosity/" aria-label="research">research</a> on curiosity-driven learning was published in 2017 and has been cited more than 4000 times, he said. Pathak also devised a way for robots to use written information from large language models like GPT (of how to open a can of milk, for example) and convert that into actions.</p>

<p>Skild AI faces steep competition from a string of robotics companies that have emerged with billions of dollars in venture funding thanks to the AI boom.

<p>Cofounder Gupta claims that Skild AI’s access to large amounts of data separates it from others in the space but declined to disclose exactly how much data its model is trained on.</p>
<p>Ken Goldberg, a professor of robotics and automation at UC Berkeley agrees that data is the key to scaling robotics, but robots require a specific type of data that isn’t widely available on the internet. Plus, using data gathered from simulation doesn’t always translate to the real world.</p>
<p>“The whole idea that robotics is excited about right now is that we can do something analogous to large language models and large vision language models where they both have internet scale data accessible where you have billions of examples,” he said. It’s not a straightforward task for robotics, but Skild AI aims to address the issue by combining all of its data collection techniques with more information drawn from simulations.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-3"><p id="article-0-topx-3"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>Pathak and Gupta envision a future for their company that is similar to OpenAI, where different use cases and products can be built on top of Skild’s foundational model by fine tuning it. “This is exactly how we aim to disrupt the robotics industry,” Gupta said, adding that eventually they want to achieve artificial general intelligence (a hypothetical AI system that can rival or surpass human capabilities) for robots but one that people can interact with in the physical world.</p>
<p>“A GPT-3 moment is coming to the world of robotics,” said Stephanie Zhan, a partner at Sequoia Capital and an existing investor in Skild AI. “It will spark a monumental shift that brings advancements similar to what we’ve seen in the world of digital intelligence, to the physical world.”</p>

He also noted that there’s a risk in the Fed moving to cut interest rates too late or too little, warning either scenario could end up weaking the economy and job market.</p><p>Powell’s testimony offered little new guidance on the Fed’s plans for when it might lower interest rates. Traders are still betting that there’s a 70% chance that the central bank will cut its main interest rate as soon as September, according to data from CME Group. </p>
    

<p>“The market is really seeing no surprises today and so that’s allowing it to modestly drift higher,” said Lisa Erickson, head of public markets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.</p>



<p>Treasury yields rose slightly in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged up to 4.30% from 4.28% late Monday.</p>
    
<p>The Fed has remained cautious about making a move on interest rates, holding its benchmark interest rate at its highest level in more than two decades as it waits cautiously for more signals that inflation is still cooling.</p><p>While prices have eased sharply over the last two years as the Fed raised interest rates, the central bank’s goal is to cool inflation back to its target of 2% without slowing economic growth too much.</p><p>Most measures of inflation show that it is easing, though at a much slower pace throughout 2024. The rate is hovering around 3% and continues exerting pressure on consumers, especially those with lower incomes.</p>
    

<p>In his testimony Tuesday, Powell noted that “elevated inflation is not the only risk we face.” Cutting rates “too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment,” he said.</p><p>A strong jobs market and consumer spending have been supporting economic growth, though the pace has slowed. Consumer spending has also been weakening as inflation prompts shifts in priorities for many to necessities over discretionary items. Borrowing costs are also higher because of elevated interest rates, adding more pressure on consumers.</p><p>Wall Street is hoping for rate cuts this year that could alleviate some pressure on both consumers and investors. Most experts are expecting one rate cut from the Fed this year, but not until September. The Fed holds its next policy meeting later this month.</p><p>“If the Fed can’t start cutting rates in the next couple months, the economy would be at risk of weakening even further in the short term and that would also push back when we’d expect the economy to re-accelerate,” said Dave Sekera, chief U.S. market strategist at Morningstar.</p>
    

<p>Gains in banks helped outweigh a pullback in industrials, energy and other sectors in the S&amp;P 500 index Tuesday. JPMorgan Chase rose 1.2% and Bank of America added 2%.</p><p>Chipmaker Intel rose another 1.8% following Monday’s 6.2% gain as bullish analysts suggest the company’s next processors will be in high demand for AI-related products.</p><p>Consumer goods company Helen of Troy, which makes Osprey and OXO products, sank 27.7% after posting first-quarter results that fell far short of forecasts.</p><p>Stocks have been gaining ground steadily over the last several months and that has helped push the S&amp;P 500 to 36 records so far this year.</p><p>All told, the S&amp;P 500 rose 4.13 points to 5,576.98. The Nasdaq added 25.55 points to close at 18,429.29. The Dow fell 52.82 points to 39,291.97.</p><p>Powell is scheduled to testify on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. His testimony comes ahead of the new inflation updates later this week. </p>
    

<p>Wall Street expects the latest government report on Thursday to show consumer prices eased to 3.1% in June from 3.3% in May. A report for inflation at the wholesale level, before costs are passed on to consumers, is expected Friday.</p><p>Traders are also looking ahead to several earnings reports this week. Delta Air Lines will report its results on Thursday.</p><p>JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo will report results on Friday. Those updates could provide more insight into consumer debt levels and whether banks are worried about payments and potential delinquencies.</p><h2>___</h2><p>AP Economics Writer Christopher Rugaber contributed to this report.</p>

<li><strong>FTC's increased scrutiny</strong>: The report marks a significant shift in the agency's approach to policing PBMs, with chair Lina Khan leading the charge to increase scrutiny and potentially bring enforcement actions or lawsuits against the industry.</li>
<li><strong>No lawsuit or enforcement action yet</strong>: While the report is critical of PBMs, the FTC has not yet brought a lawsuit or enforcement action against the industry. However, the report could lead to a formal investigation or lawsuit accusing PBMs of anticompetitive conduct.</li>
<li><strong>Potential legislative impact</strong>: The report's findings could fuel legislative efforts in Congress and at the state level to impose limits on the PBM industry, potentially leading to changes in how PBMs operate.</li>
<li><strong>Industry fears a backlash</strong>: PBMs are worried about a backlash from the report, which could lead to an increase in regulatory scrutiny and potential legal action.</li>

            “We view this resolution as an opportunity to make NGL better than ever for our users and we think the agreement is in our best interest,” Figueiredo said. “While we believe many of the allegations around the youth of our user base are factually incorrect, we anticipate that the agreed upon age-gating and other procedures will now provide direction for others in our space, and hopefully improve policies generally.”

            The computer-generated messages were purposely written to prey on teens’ social anxieties or aspirations, the lawsuit said, citing examples such as “I know what you did” and “I’ve had a crush on you for years.”

            NGL created more than 1,000 different such messages posing as real users and sent them millions of times to persuade teens to pay to see who sent them, the complaint said. But when users paid for information about both the fake and the real messages, sometimes as much as $9.99 a week, the app didn’t show the sender’s name but instead provided “hints” such as the user’s rough location or the type of device being used, according to the lawsuit.

            The messages started being sent in 2022, a year after the app’s lackluster launch, the complaint said. After users began suspecting the fake messages, many wrote negative reviews of the app and some even called it a scam, according to the lawsuit.

            NGL had allegedly boasted in its marketing that the app was a “safe space for teens” and that it used AI-based content moderation to protect users. Behind the scenes, however, the app’s co-founders allegedly ignored or denigrated users who complained, with Figueiredo responding “lol” in an internal message to a report about one upset customer, according to the lawsuit.

            In addition to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/tech/lina-khan-ai-warning/index.html">warning</a> that generative artificial intelligence may “turbocharge” fraud and scams, Khan has proposed multiple regulations that would clamp down on how businesses may collect, use and share consumer data.

            The FTC is also currently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/03/tech/ftc-meta-younger-users/index.html">seeking to prohibit Meta</a> from monetizing children’s data, a move that company has challenged in court. In 2022, the FTC <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/19/tech/fortnite-epic-ftc-settlement/index.html">forced Epic Games</a>, maker of the hit video game “Fortnite,” to pay $520 million to settle allegations that it used sneaky user-interface tricks known as “dark patterns” to dupe users into making in-game purchases.

            The FTC move comes against the backdrop of a flurry of state legislation seeking to limit young people’s access to social media. In another first this year, New York <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/20/tech/new-york-hochul-social-media-algorithms-children/index.html">approved legislation</a> that regulates the algorithms powering social media feeds on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and other apps. States such as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/arkansas-social-media-age-limit/index.html">Arkansas</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/25/tech/florida-social-media-law-age/index.html">Florida</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/08/tech/louisiana-parental-consent-bill-social-media/index.html">Louisiana</a> and many others have also passed laws clamping down on social media companies’ approach to teens. Opponents, however, say the laws violate the First Amendment rights of teens and the Supreme Court has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-hear-challenge-texas-age-verification-online-porn-2024-07-02/" target="_blank">agreed to consider</a> the constitutionality of age-based website restrictions in its next term.

            Highlighting the groundbreaking nature of the NGL settlement, FTC Commissioner Andrew Ferguson described Tuesday’s action as a “novel” use of the agency’s legal powers. For the first time, he said in a statement, the FTC claimed that NGL broke the law “by marketing an anonymous messaging app to children and teenagers despite knowing that anonymous messaging apps are harmful to these groups.”

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyem7wy1000o3b6kwiy0uhtg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “This alleged conduct, tailormade to manipulate the vulnerable teenage psyche, was reprehensible and unfair,” Ferguson said. But, he argued, the public should not interpret the lawsuit to mean that it is illegal in general to market any anonymous messaging app to teens.

            On Tuesday, the FTC credited the consumer advocacy group Fairplay and the social media critic Kristin Bride for “invaluable assistance” on the NGL investigation. Last year, Bride testified before Congress in a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/14/tech/senate-online-kids-safety/index.html">high-profile hearing</a> about social media’s risks for teens, recounting how her teenage son Carson died by suicide in 2020 after receiving a barrage of anonymous cyberbullying messages. In October, Bride and Fairplay <a href="https://fairplayforkids.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NGL_complaint.pdf" target="_blank">wrote to the FTC</a> calling for an agency investigation into NGL and accusing it of unfair and deceptive business practices in violation of federal law.

            In a statement Tuesday, Bride applauded the lawsuit and settlement.

            “This dangerous business model keeps kids engaged while struggling to identify their unknown harassers so that these companies can profit from more data collection,” Bride said. “It is unconscionable that NGL would not only charge vulnerable teens for useless hints as to who was messaging them but that the developers themselves were sending harassing messages to teens and joking about it as parents expressed cyberbullying concerns.”

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Fast-food chain Whataburger’s app has gone viral in the wake of Hurricane Beryl, which left around <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/09/hurricane-beryl-houston-power-outages-impacts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">1.8 million utility customers</a> in Houston, Texas without power. Hundreds of thousands of those people may remain without power for days as Houston anticipates a heat wave, with temperatures climbing into the mid-90s.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Amid frustrations with the local utility company CounterPoint Energy, which doesn’t offer an app, some Houstonians got creative with their attempts to track the power outages. They turned to the Whataburger app instead.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Whataburger is a San Antonio-based fast-food chain with <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/texans-outraged-whataburger-app-works-better-centerpoint-energy-1922934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">127 stores</a> in the Houston area, according to Newsweek. On the Whataburger app, users can see a map of Whataburger locations, with an orange logo indicating a store is open, and a grey logo meaning it’s closed.</p>

	
	


	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Since CounterPoint Energy doesn’t have an online map of outages, an X user with the screen name BBQBryan found that the map of which Whataburger stores are open could be a useful tool for seeing where there’s power.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“The Whataburger app works as a power outage tracker, handy since the electric company doesn’t show a map,” BBQBryan wrote in <a href="https://x.com/BBQBryan/status/1810509150842974308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post</a> that now has over 22,000 likes and 6.9 million impressions.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“Well there’s a use for our app we didn’t think of!” the Whataburger X account <a href="https://x.com/Whataburger/status/1810675466899992990" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied</a>. “We hope you and everyone else are okay!”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This viral moment seems to have boosted Whataburger’s download numbers. In the iOS App Store, Whataburger is currently <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whataburger/id1141643627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ranked 16th</a> in the food and drink category. Just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240620131007/https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whataburger/id1141643627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">three weeks ago</a>, it was ranked 40th.</p>

	
	

<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">
</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Though the Whataburger revelation is funny, the app’s value is indicative of ongoing issues in Texas, where residents feel unsupported in the face of extreme weather. In 2021, when Texas was hit with a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/17/us/winter-storm-weather-live">fierce winter storm</a>, millions of residents were left without power in dangerous, freezing weather. To make matters worse, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) was spotted <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/turns-out-people-still-havent-forgiven-ted-cruz-for-cancun-2024-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">flying to a resort in Mexico</a> while his state was in the midst of a historically fatal power grid failure. So, when Cruz made a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/tedcruz/status/1810117735965245451">post</a> on Sunday urging Texans to stay safe amid the hurricane’s landfall, some constituents were <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/turns-out-people-still-havent-forgiven-ted-cruz-for-cancun-2024-7?amp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">frustrated</a> by the hypocrisy and responded in kind on X.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It’s an infrastructural failure that a burger app has become a crucial resource for Houston residents looking for more information on power outages. The Whataburger app may be able to offer a vague idea of where there’s power, but there could be other reasons why a store is closed — after all, Houston is in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster.</p>
