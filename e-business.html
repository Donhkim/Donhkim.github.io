Republicans and their allies routinely refer to the policy incorrectly as a government mandate.</p><p>But Brown has pledged to oppose a rule change this summer proposed by Biden to allow EVs that are built in the United States but include Chinese-made components to qualify for the credit.</p><p>“This will allow China to infiltrate the American auto supply chain, at American taxpayers’ expense," Brown said in a statement in May. “American tax dollars should support American manufacturing and American workers — not enrich Chinese companies.”</p><p>Brown, a progressive with a pro-worker mantra, has little to worry about in maintaining his party’s base. But he appears to be aware of the risks of being seen as allying too strongly with Biden, who is unpopular in Ohio, said former Ohio Rep.

But he has no interest in getting one until he can visit his grandkids without making multiple stops and taking time to charge the vehicle.</p><p>“I don’t want to wait a half-hour unless they start putting them in bars," said Hiskey, adding that his vote will not be influenced by which party or politician backs EVs.</p><p>Others said the vehicles are cost-prohibitive, even with the tax credit.</p><p>“How can they afford electric vehicles when it’s hard to afford living?” said Dru Wilson, 21, who attends college outside Toledo.</p><p>Although the petroleum manufacturers represent a fraction of what the two major parties' political action committees are spending in battleground states, it dwarfs the counterprogramming on the part of pro-EV and environmental groups.</p><p>Environmental Defense Action Fund and a related group have spent a little more than $772,000 on ads, according to AdImpact, and little of it is targeted in key presidential or Senate states.</p><p>Climate Power, a strategic communication group promoting Biden’s climate reduction goals, has committed to spending $80 million on promoting the administration’s measures, including on advertising in battleground states. The group declined to specify how much it expects to spend on advertising and noted that its efforts will also include voter outreach on an array of Biden measures, including promoting EVs.</p><p>Missing is one unifying call for Americans to embrace the technology, akin to President John F. Kennedy's 1961 moon landing goal within the decade, said veteran Democratic strategist Joel Benenson, who was a pollster and senior adviser to Barack Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaigns.</p><p>“No one’s telling an inspiring story for EVs. So, how do you develop that story and what it’s going to mean for America going forward?" Benenson said. “That could be a powerful narrative.”</p><p>______</p><p>Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

Virtual fashion models. A digital simulation of the entire earth. </p> <p>Those were just a few of the products and ideas floated by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during his keynote address at the 2024 Taipei International Information Technology Show, better known as Computex. Huang enthralled a packed house with the claim that the world has entered a "new industrial revolution."</p><p>"In the future, Taiwan will build computers that walk," Huang said as he showed images of nine <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/fox-news-robots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humanoid robots</a> and several wheeled robots while emphasizing that this robotic "future" is already here. </p> <p>The possibilities are endless, he said. Artificial Intelligence will create AI teams with an "agent" that interacts with you. The "agent," however, is a combination of dozens of different types of generative AIs. Artificial intelligence that masters the laws of physics. A new computer board with a chip called Blackwell so fast it makes a mockery of Moore’s Law.</p> <p>In a talk that lasted nearly two hours, Huang spoke passionately about how radically different "the generative computing era" will be from the past. Much of the tech talk was incomprehensible to non-experts, but the overall message was clear: the computing world has been mostly running on ideas that are 60 years old. But, after 20 years of work in collaboration with other Taiwanese tech giants such as TSMC, Nvidia and its partners have reinvented the computing wheel. No more info retrieval. Instead, when you want info, it will be generated – thus being more relevant and up-to-date than anything that can be "found." </p><p data-unit-credible=",," data-in-article="true" class="credible"></p><p>Huang showed off four new "<a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI laptops,</a>" and spoke about the next wave of AI: Physical AIs. These will include robots that learn in a virtual world that simulates the laws of physics, teaching the robot to flawlessly act in the real world. "In the future, anything that moves will be automated," said a voiceover in one of the videos Huang showed. But he stressed that "the future" isn’t some abstract idea, noting that everything he had shown is currently in development. Huang spoke of "robotic factories" being created in Taiwan now by companies such as Foxconn, the world’s largest electronics maker. </p><p>Watching Huang’s presentation offered a great deal of validation to the fears that AI and robots will take or replace human jobs, and perhaps humans themselves. But Huang sees a bright future as we break free of CPUs and enter a "tectonic shift" that includes something called "the omniverse." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/most-americans-expect-ai-abuses-impact-2024-election-survey"><strong>MOST AMERICANS EXPECT AI ABUSES TO IMPACT 2024 ELECTION: SURVEY</strong></a></p><div class="inline image-ct"> <div class="caption"><p><span>Jensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia Corp., gives a talk in Taipei, Taiwan.</span><span> (Annabelle Chih/Bloomberg via / Getty Images)</span></p></div></div><p>Huang is immensely popular in Taiwan. Since he arrived in Taipei on May 26 he’s been hounded by packs of somewhat aggressive reporters. When leaving a dinner with some of the richest tech titans on the planet, Huang hopped into a regular yellow taxicab, not some chauffeured limo. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/former-openai-board-member-reveals-why-sam-altman-ousted-last-november"><strong>FORMER OPENAI BOARD MEMBER REVEALS WHY SAM ALTMAN WAS OUSTED LAST NOVEMBER</strong></a></p><div class="inline image-ct"> <div class="caption"><p><span>Jensen Huang displays the capabilities of AI at an event.</span><span> (Annabelle Chih/Bloomberg via / Getty Images)</span></p></div></div><p>Local newspapers use terms like "rockstar" to describe him, while another common comparison is to Steve Jobs. Like Jobs, Huang understands the power of a "look," almost always wearing his trademark black leather jacket, despite temperatures in Taiwan this time of year hovering around 85 degrees. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jobs,</a> however, was called "difficult" by even close friends and had a reputation for being somewhat aloof and inaccessible. In this regard, Huang couldn’t be more different. He’s self-deprecating, especially about his language skills, despite apparently being relatively fluent in Mandarin Chinese. During the Computex presentation, he told the crowd he’d like to speak in Chinese but that his brain couldn’t run that fast so he’d stick to English, which he mostly did while getting in plenty of well-timed Chinese one-liners as well as several sentences in Taiwanese (or Hokkien, a local language spoken by some 70% of Taiwanese).</p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/elon-musks-xai-gets-6-billion-new-funding-announces-valuation"><strong>ELON MUSK'S XAI GETS $6B IN NEW FUNDING AND ANNOUNCES VALUATION</strong></a></p><div class="inline image-ct"> <div class="caption"><p><span>Jensen Huang discussing the function of Nvidia chips with the use of AI.</span><span> (Annabelle Chih/Bloomberg via / Getty Images)</span></p></div></div><p>Huang ended his address with a tribute to Taiwan, "the unsung hero of the coming AI industrial revolution." His praise for his birthplace of Taiwan was, of course, popular with the crowd and those watching the livestream of the event, but Huang has used both words and deeds to demonstrate his sincerity. </p><p>Just before throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at a Saturday game between two of Taiwan’s <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professional baseball teams,</a> Huang told the media, "This is a very exciting time for Taiwan… We are at the beginning of a new age of computing, the age of AI, and Taiwan is at the center." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</u></strong></a></p><p>Huang has repeatedly touted the overachieving, underappreciated nation of Taiwan.</p><p>"Taiwan is one of the most important countries in the world. It is at the center of the electronics industry. The computer industry is built because of Taiwan, so it’s a very, very important country," he told a local reporter who asked for a comment as Huang was buying snacks at a night market in Taipei. </p><p>Huang repeated the word, <i>country</i>, not "area," "region," or some other generic neutral geographic moniker. His comments became headline news in Taiwan, and few think Huang misspoke. As Huang showed the 100-plus "countries and regions" that are working with Nvidia and other Taiwan tech companies to create this new future, one large area was not shaded green: <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/china" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The People’s Republic of China.</a></p></div> </div>

<li>Film producer David Ellison has made an offer to buy out a portion of Paramount Global's non-voting shareholders for about $15 a share, a roughly 26% premium to the company's previous closing price.</li>
<li>The offer is part of a multi-step process to take over Paramount Global, which involves buying out the Redstone family's controlling stake and merging the company with Ellison's Skydance Media.</li>
<li>The deal includes a cash payout and a significant investment from Ellison and his partners, including RedBird Capital Partners and KKR &amp; Co.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of homes on the market without buyers has increased significantly, leading to a predicted decline in home prices starting as soon as summer.</li>
<li>The year-over-year percentage increase in unsold existing homes for sale is the highest since the Great Financial Crisis, according to Brian Nick, senior investment strategist at Macro Institute.</li>
<li>Despite being in the traditional spring selling season, the housing market is experiencing a "disappointment" with a surge in inventory and tepid demand from buyers due to high prices.</li>
<li>As the selling season winds down in the summer and fall, home prices are expected to start dropping, which could lead to increased concerns over consumer confidence and spending.</li>
<li>Nick warns that as housing prices begin to fall, consumers may become less willing to spend, leading to a potential slowdown in growth and a shift away from the current economic narrative.</li>

    <div><div data-cy="article-content" class="rawHtml-content-no-nativo"><p>More homes on languishing on the market without any buyers, setting up prices to start falling as soon as this summer, according to Brian Nick, senior investment strategist at Macro Institute.</p><p class="paywall-selector"></p><div class="paywall">



<p>In fact, the year-over-year percentage increase in unsold existing homes for sale is the highest since the Great Financial Crisis, he told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-05-30/bloomberg-surveillance-05-30-2024" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-05-30/bloomberg-surveillance-05-30-2024" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-05-30/bloomberg-surveillance-05-30-2024" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">Bloomberg TV </a>on Thursday.</p>



<p>“That’s going to put downward pressure on prices in the next three to six months,” he predicted.</p>



<p>For now, the housing market is still in its traditional spring selling season, when Americans typically shop for homes while families try to secure a new dwelling before the start of the next school year.</p>



<p>By some accounts, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/housing-market-crisis-inventory-buyer-demand-home-prices-mortgage-rates-fed-cuts/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/housing-market-crisis-inventory-buyer-demand-home-prices-mortgage-rates-fed-cuts/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/06/01/housing-market-crisis-inventory-buyer-demand-home-prices-mortgage-rates-fed-cuts/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">this season is a disappointment</a> so far as the increasing supply of homes has been met with tepid demand from buyers who are revolting against on high prices.</p><p></p>



<p>And when the selling season winds down in the summer and heading into the fall, Nick said home prices will start to drop and erode consumer confidence. While high prices have demoralized prospective buyers, they have buoyed sentiment among the owners of those homes along with the strong labor market.</p>



<p>“Once they start seeing housing prices falling—maybe the home next to them going for a little bit less than asking as opposed to what they’ve been seeing the last couple of years—that will dent their ability to spend and their willingness to spend as well,” he warned. “The housing market is really the first domino to fall on what we think is going to be a slower growth story down the road.”</p>



<p>Other housing market watchers have also pointed to a shift, with <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/26/housing-market-outlook-buyers-vs-sellers-lower-home-prices-inventory-supply/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/26/housing-market-outlook-buyers-vs-sellers-lower-home-prices-inventory-supply/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/26/housing-market-outlook-buyers-vs-sellers-lower-home-prices-inventory-supply/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">more buyers pushing back</a> against the high home prices that sellers are demanding.</p>



<p><a href="https://fortune.com/company/compass/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/compass/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">Compass</a> cofounder and CEO Robert Reffkin told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/22/compass-ceo-robert-reffkin-on-housing-market-we-are-now-seeing-more-sellers-than-buyers.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/22/compass-ceo-robert-reffkin-on-housing-market-we-are-now-seeing-more-sellers-than-buyers.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">CNBC</a> last month that 30% of the inventory on the market has seen a price drop, more than anytime in last decade, with supply up 16%.</p>



<p>“It is a different environment. We are now seeing more sellers than buyers,” he said.</p><p></p>



<p>But such weakness is still masked by nationwide numbers, which show home prices are rising. The most recent <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/housing-market-outlook-home-prices-all-time-high-case-shiller/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/housing-market-outlook-home-prices-all-time-high-case-shiller/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/housing-market-outlook-home-prices-all-time-high-case-shiller/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index</a> showed prices were up 6.5% in March from a year earlier, hitting a fresh all-time high. Separate <a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/redfin-home-price-index-april-2024/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.redfin.com/news/redfin-home-price-index-april-2024/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">data from Redfin</a> showed they rose 7.3% in April from the prior year. </p>



<p>For his part, the Macro Institute’s Nick noted that the number of existing homes for sale is now up 8%-10% annually, suggesting that prices will soon come down.</p>



<p>“That supply-demand imbalance is starting to correct, which could mean you start seeing lower prices as soon as this summer,” he said.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Saudi Aramco is the largest oil producer in the world</strong>: Producing 9 million barrels of oil per day, which is nearly 10% of the world's total oil production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Low production costs</strong>: Saudi Aramco's production costs are $3 per barrel, significantly lower than its competitors in the Western private sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highest profits</strong>: Over the past two years, Saudi Aramco generated a staggering $282 billion in total net profit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Less carbon emissions</strong>: Despite producing oil, Aramco's emissions are lower than those of its competitors, making its product more appealing in a world concerned about global warming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vision for diversification and decarbonization</strong>: Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman has a strategy to end the country's reliance on oil, diversify the economy, and decarbonize energy production, with Saudi Aramco playing a key role in this vision.</p>

The state-run oil colossus produces 9m barrels of oil a day, more than any other firm and nearly a tenth of the world’s total (see chart 1). It boasts by far the largest remaining proven reserves of the stuff, which would last into second half of the century at current pumping rates. Its piddling production costs of $3 a barrel, a tenth of what many Western private-sector rivals must content themselves with, allowed it to generate an eye-watering $282bn in total net profit over the past two years. And though its oil burns as dirtily as any other, Aramco emits less carbon liberating it from geological formations than competitors do. That makes the company’s product appealing in a world increasingly concerned about global warming but still <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/03/14/oils-endgame-could-be-highly-disruptive" data-analytics="in_body:link_1:para_1">hooked on hydrocarbons</a>.</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0">As less generously endowed rivals fall by the wayside, Aramco’s market share would, in other words, be almost certain to rise with a few modest investments in maintaining reservoirs. Yet the company’s employees are busier than ever. That is because Aramco is the linchpin of the strategy of <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2022/07/28/mbs-despot-in-the-desert" data-analytics="in_body:link_2:para_2">Muhammad bin Salman</a>, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto ruler, to end his country’s reliance on oil, diversify its economy and decarbonise its energy production.</p></div></div>

<p>The makers of Enhertu, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca, said the new data, if cleared by regulators, could shift the way physicians treat hormone receptor-positive, metastatic breast cancer, and create a new standard of care in which patients with breast tumors that express even the faintest amount of HER2 protein can benefit.</p>
<p>“It’s not an overestimation to say that trastuzumab deruxtecan is the most potent drug ever developed for breast cancer,” said Paolo Tarantino, a medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, using the scientific name for Enhertu. “It does come with side effects that we’re learning to manage, but with that said, I’ve never seen data like what’s being reported here.”</p>

    <div><div class="group"><p>Inflation rose about as expected in April, with markets on edge over when interest rates might start coming down, according to a measure released Friday that is followed closely by the Federal Reserve.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index" target="_blank">personal consumption expenditures price index</a> excluding food and energy costs increased just 0.2% for the period, in line with the Dow Jones estimate, the Commerce Department reported.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>On an annual basis, core PCE was up 2.8%, or 0.1 percentage point higher than the estimate.</p><p>Including the volatile food and energy category, PCE inflation was at 2.7% on an annual basis and 0.3% from a month ago. Those numbers were in line with forecasts.</p><p>Fed officials prefer the PCE reading over the more closely followed consumer price index, which the Labor Department compiles. The Commerce Department measure accounts for changes in consumer behavior such as substituting less expensive items for costlier alternatives, and has a wider scope than the CPI.</p><p>“The core index came in at 2.8%. That’s fine, but it’s been trading in a range for five months now, and that’s pretty sticky to me,” said Dan North, senior economist for North America at Allianz Trade. “If I’m [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell, I’d like to see that start moving down, and it’s barely creeping. ... I’m not reaching for the Pepto yet, but I’m not feeling great. This is not what you want to see.”</p><p>A 1.2% rise in energy prices helped push up the headline increase. Food prices posted a 0.2% decline on the month.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>Goods prices rose 0.2% while services saw a 0.3% increase, continuing a normalization trend for an economy in which services and consumption provide much of the fuel.</p><p>Along with the inflation reading, Friday’s release included data about <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/personal-income-and-outlays-april-2024" target="_blank">income and spending</a>.</p><p>Personal income increased 0.3% on the month, matching the estimate, while spending rose just 0.2%, below the 0.4% estimate and off March’s downwardly revised 0.7%. Adjusted for inflation, the spending numbers showed a 0.1% decline, due in large part to a 0.4% decrease in spending on goods and just a 0.1% rise in services expenditures.</p><p>Market reaction following the release saw futures tied to major stock averages rising while Treasury yields moved lower.</p><p>“The PCE Price Index didn’t show much progress on inflation, but it didn’t show any backsliding, either. Based on the initial reaction in stock index futures, the market will see it mostly as a positive,” said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing for E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.</p><p>“Investors will have to remain patient, though,” he added. “The Fed has suggested it will take more than one month of favorable data to confirm inflation is reliably moving lower again, so there’s still no reason to think a first rate cut will come any earlier than September.”</p><p>As inflation data has come in hotter than expected, central bank officials have encouraged a cautious approach. That means less likelihood that they will be cutting rates anytime soon.</p><p>Most recently, New York Fed President John Williams said Thursday that while he is confident inflation will continue to recede, prices are still too high and he has not seen sufficient progress on moving to the Fed’s 2% annual goal.</p><p>Markets have reined in their expectations for rate reductions this year. Pricing Friday morning indicated a probability that the first move likely won’t come until November, at the Fed’s meeting that concludes two days after the presidential election.</p></div></div>

Enfortumab vedotin led to an overall response rate (ORR) of 43% and a median overall survival (OS) of over a year (12.3 months).<sup class="text-inherit">1 </sup>Enfortumab vedotin alone led to AEs including fatigue, hair loss, appetite loss, dysgeusia, nausea, peripheral sensory neuropathy, pruritus, and diarrhea.

The EV-103 study [NCT03288545] looked at multiple combinations of [enfortumab vedotin].”</p><p class="pb-2"></p><p class="pb-2">In cohort K of EV-103, experts evaluated enfortumab vedotin or enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab (Keytruda; EVP) as a first-line therapy for patients who were cisplatin-ineligible with locally advanced or mUC.5 Patients were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio and given enfortumab vedotin as a monotherapy on days 1 and 8, or in combination with pembrolizumab on day 1 of the 3-week cycles.</p><p class="pb-2"></p><p class="pb-2">Enfortumab vedotin alone led to an ORR of 45.2% (95% CI, 33.5-57.3) and with EVP, the ORR was 64.5% (95% CI, 52.7-75.1). Safety findings showed that treatment-related AEs consisted of skin reactions (67.1%) and peripheral neuropathy (60.5%) in the EVP arm.<sup class="text-inherit">5</sup></p><p class="pb-2"></p><p class="pb-2">These results led to the FDA granting an accelerated approval to the combination in April 2023 for the treatment of patients with cisplatin-ineligible mUC.</p><p class="pb-2"></p><p class="pb-2">“That regimen also was given accelerated US FDA approval, followed on the heels by the EV-302 study,” said Tagawa.</p><p class="pb-2"></p><p class="pb-2">In EV-302, EVP <a target="_blank" href="https://www.targetedonc.com/view/updated-trials-at-esmo-reveal-new-frontline-combo-in-urothelial-carcinoma"><strong>resulted in significantly better outcomes</strong></a> compared with chemotherapy as a treatment for patients with untreated locally advanced or mUC.6 The safety profile of the combination was consistent with what was observed in previous reports.</p><p class="pb-2"></p><p class="pb-2">Specifically, the median OS was 31.5 months (95% CI, 25.4-not reached) in the EVP arm vs 16.1 months (95% CI, 13.9-18.3) in the chemotherapy arm (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.38-0.58; <em>P </em>&lt; .00001). A significant improvement in PFS was also seen with EVP vs chemotherapy at 12.5 months (95% CI, 10.4-16.6) vs 6.3 months (95% CI, 6.2-6.5), resulting in a 55% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.38-0.54; <em>P</em> &lt; .00001).<sup class="text-inherit">6</sup></p><p class="pb-2"></p><p class="pb-2">EVP is currently the standard first-line treatment for cisplatin-ineligible patients with locally advanced or mUC.

The 2 treatment arms were the experimental drug tisotumab vedotin vs traditional chemotherapy, investigators’ choice chemotherapy. What we found here is that those women who were treated with the experimental drug had a 30% decreased risk of death vs those treated with the traditional therapy,” said Brian Slomovitz, MD, director of gynecologic oncology at Mount Sinai Medical Center and primary investigator of innovaTV 301, in an interview with Targeted Oncology<sup class="text-inherit">TM</sup>.</p><p class="pb-2"></p><p class="pb-2">“We saw similar changes, as well, in the progression-free survival… [with a] 33% decrease in progression-free survival. We saw a response rate that was approximately 3 to 4 times higher in the tisotumab vedotin arm vs chemotherapy. [For] the safety profile, there were no new safety signals to make us concerned that something else was going to come up,” Slomovitz continued.</p><p class="pb-2"></p><p class="pb-2">Tisotumab vedotin is also being investigated in combinations with other agents for the treatment of cervical cancer.</p><p class="pb-2"></p><p class="pb-2">“As far as combinations go, we are exploring them,” Slomovitz explained. “There are earlier trials looking to [combine] tisotumab vedotin with a series of combinations, including carboplatin with pembrolizumab and other agents. At this point, I think the results of this study will make us further explore to see if some of the future directions will include combination therapy, but for now, based on the current landscape, it will be a good treatment option in the second or third line [for] patients, these patients who recur.”<br><br></p><h2 class="text-2xl pb-4 pt-2">Mirvetuximab Soravtansine</h2><p class="pb-2">Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx (Elahere) is a folate receptor alpha (FR⍺)-targeted ADC for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ripple (XRP) performed its customary act of locking tokens</strong>: On June 1, Ripple completed two separate 500 million XRP transactions, similar to its act of locking tokens since 2017.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>XRP's reaction to the development was unusual</strong>: Unlike previous times, the reaction to this development was not negligible. The article suggests that this time, holders of the token decided to send many XRPs to cold wallets moments after Ripple's action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Declining volumes and price suggested a possible rebound</strong>: Despite the unusual reaction, the declining volumes and price of XRP suggested that the altcoin might rebound in the short term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased active addresses on the XRP Ledger</strong>: The article observed a notable increase in active addresses on the XRP Ledger, which rose to 32,000 - almost double the numbers seen on June 1. This indicates that more participants were involved in making successful transactions using the token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network activity on the XRP Ledger</strong>: Despite the increase in active addresses, the article notes that there are times when network activity can dip, even with demand for XRP.</p>

</ul>
<p>On 1 June, <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/category/xrp-ripple-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ripple</a> performed its customary act of locking tokens. This time, the blockchain payments firm completed the activity in two separate 500 million XRP transactions, according to data from Whale Alert.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the market terrain, Ripple has been locking this amount since 2017. This idea behind this action is to provide cover for the large token supply over 55 months. This means that 55% of the total XRP supply would take part in this scheme. Most of the time, XRP’s reaction to this development is usually negligible.</p>
<p>Hence, the question – Was it the case this time too?</p>

<h2>Times have changed</h2>
<p>Well, not quite. AMBCrypto <a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/7mnA9Xsy__sCl" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">noticed</a> a change on the XRP Ledger this time, with the first observation being a notable increase in active addresses.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, XRP’s 24-hour active addresses had risen to 32,000 – Almost double the numbers seen on 1 June. The hike in active addresses revealed that more participants were involved in making successful transactions using the token over the last 12-24 hours.</p>
<p>However, there are times when <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/xrp-sees-a-dip-despite-the-demand-for-xrpl-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">network activity</a> rises and the price stalls or declines. This was the case here too, with XRP’s price falling marginally to $0.51 on the charts. Will this correction continue though? According to the Mean Coin Age (MCA), no.</p>
<p>The MCA is the average age of all tokens on the blockchain. When the metric spikes, it means that old coins are moving and this could trigger selling pressure and a price depreciation.</p>
<p>However, a notable fall in XRP’s MCA indicated that more tokens are being retired into cold wallets. At press time, XRP’s 90-day Mean Coin Age had fallen from 40.29 to 33.74.</p>

<p>Considering the “laws” mentioned above, it would seem that the selling pressure around XRP might soon stop. Subsequently, the price can <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/xrp-ready-to-soar-key-signals-point-to-a-major-breakout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bounce</a> on the charts and a hike to $0.55 might be possible too.</p>
<h2>XRP to fall to $0.50, following which…</h2>
<p>Traders might need to watch out for the altcoin’s volume too. At press time, the same was down to $587.39 million. Volume could serve as strength for the crypto’s price.</p>
<p>Therefore, a decline in the same indicates that XRP’s downtrend has been getting weak. While XRP’s value could still <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/xrp-under-bear-watch-market-sentiment-sways-toward-a-price-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">fall to $0.50</a>, a bounce could be close as falling volume and decreasing price, together, can be interpreted a bullish sign.</p>
<p>If XRP does rebound, the $0.55 prediction might come to pass. In a highly bullish situation, the price of the cryptocurrency might rally to $0.60 too.</p>

<hr>
<p>Despite the optimistic outlook, however, XRP holders should be wary of changes in the market— especially <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/category/bitcoin-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin’s [BTC]</a> influence.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin’s price appreciates on the charts, then XRP might be able to hike too. However, a collapse in BTC’s value could invalidate the thesis explained above.</p>

            Consumers are bravely opening their palette to bolder, spicier, more fiery flavors and the marketplace for foods and drinks is happily obliging them.

            “The spicy trend is here to stay,” Sally Lyons Wyatt, packaged goods and foodservice industry advisor with market research firm Circana, said in an interview with CNN.

            From chips, popcorn, burgers to ice cream, frozen pizza, alcohol, Starbucks drinks to Coca-Cola, a growing variety of foods and beverage brands are punching up their offerings by adding the spice, bold “swicy” flavor or outright heat.
    </p>

            “My whole motto for a couple of years has been, ‘The hotter the better,’ because consumers gravitate to it. Traditionally it was younger consumers that were driving this but now we’ve seen bold flavors being embraced by most age groups but the dominant are still younger consumers,” Lyons Wyatt said.

            While it might seem as though we’re surrounded by spiciness in every grocery aisle lately, the start of this trend goes back at least a decade and is well established with spicy flavors in snacking, she said.

            To her point, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/ko">Coca-Cola</a> in February launched its first new permanent soda flavor addition in years. The flavor it chose:<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/07/food/coca-cola-spiced-launch/index.html"> Coca-Cola Spiced.</a> The company told CNN that its own research had surfaced an “increase in consumer willingness to try a spiced beverage” and “more bold flavors and more complex flavor profiles” both in food and beverages.

            It said the refreshers, targeting Gen Z and Millennials, are punched up by adding Starbucks’ spicy chili powder blend to the concoctions.

            “The younger generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, are also much more global in their outlook than previous generations. To them a chilli crisp or a salsa macha is as much a regular condiment as say a mayo or ketchup,” Creevy said.

            “Take the rise of K-Drama and K-Pop as an example.

Gochujang, a red chili paste, is a popular Korean condiment.

<p>The class of 2024 is waking up from graduation to realize they are in a financial black hole.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p>"The cost of college has steadily increased over the last 30 years," notes recent Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/average-student-loan-debt-statistics/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/average-student-loan-debt-statistics/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/average-student-loan-debt-statistics/" aria-label="research">research</a> into student loan debt statistics. "In that timeframe, tuition costs at public four-year colleges grew from $4,160 to $10,740 and from $19,360 to $38,070 at private non-profit institutions (adjusted for inflation). As costs have risen, so has the need for student loans and other forms of financial aid."</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p class="article_paragraph_2"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the older you are, the thicker the shackles of college debt entwine. Noticeably, the Forbes research pointed out that those who are in their senior years are most likely to be encumbered with up to $100,000 or more of student debt. And the sad reality is that this ongoing vicious cycle is only getting worse. "Today, more than half of students leave school with debt," the report said.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>
<p>What if that cycle could be reversed? What if it was possible to graduate from college and start your career on the right foot?</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p>
<p>Perhaps it would be better to consider making as much money as possible in the earlier years of your career, to get your student loan repayments off to a flying headstart, than to pay ludicrous fees in dribs and drabs for a lifetime.</p>

<p>If you're graduating and setting your sights on landing your first job so you can launch a successful career, here are three entry-level jobs you might want to consider concentrating on so you can get out of debt faster (salaries extracted from Salary.com and Glassdoor):</p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"><p id="article-0-inread"></p></fbs-ad>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">1. Remote Software Developer/Engineer</h2>
<p>By now, it's probably a well-known fact that software development and software engineering are by far the most highly compensated careers globally, even when starting at the entry-level. Even from graduation, you can make up to $87,000, and then as you gain more technical skills and experience, go on to earning six figures annually.</p>

<p>Typically, software engineers and developers need degrees in computer science and even mathematics, but these days, hopeful developers are able to get their foot in the door through attending bootcamps and online training courses, and joining groups.</p>






<p><strong>Average salary (after graduation):</strong> $85,000 to $128,000</p>
