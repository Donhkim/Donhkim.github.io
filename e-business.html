We look at the price history for that product to make sure no brands are inflating prices to make the discount seem more substantial than it is.</li><li>Quality reviews and testing are important for all product. If you're unhappy the first time you use it, the discount wasn't really worthwhile. </li><li>Remaining sale time is a huge part of our vetting process. If a deal seems like it will only be around for a short while or will only be available for the remaining stock, we'll let you know upfront so you don't come back to the deal later only to be disappointed. </li></ul></div></div>

            Scott Keyes, founder of travel site <a href="https://www.going.com/cheap-tickets" target="_blank">Going</a>, said that because of the way <a href="https://reason.org/aviation-policy-news/why-new-york-airspace-remains-a-mess/" target="_blank">air traffic control maps are divvied up</a>, airports in New York City metro area and in Florida have a slightly higher chance of being affected by air traffic control issues.<strong></strong>

            “I wouldn’t, you know, not take that trip to New York or to Miami because of air traffic control,” he said in an interview with CNN Travel. People flying in and out of those markets should try to get early morning flights and nonstop flights to help minimize problems if they come up.

            “Hot air is thin air. While this reduces the lift on which planes rely for takeoff, the main impact is felt on engine thrust. Aircraft engines will produce less thrust during takeoff and ascent as a result,” said Bob Thomas, assistant professor of aeronautical science. “The only way to make a takeoff possible on shorter runways would be to lower the weight of the aircraft.”

            He said airlines generally reduce weight by removing baggage or passengers, especially as temperatures reach the triple digits. Cancellations are even possible. The report suggested trying to book early morning and late evening flights when you expect to fly in hot weather zones.

            And if you haven’t heard, meteorologists warn we’re phasing out of an El Niño cycle in the equatorial Pacific (with warmer waters) and phasing into a La Niña period (with cooler waters).

They think four to seven of them could reach at least a strength of Category 3, which have sustained winds of 111 to 129 mph.

            Keyes said new plane deliveries and additional flights will ease the load factor. “There’s about 10 to 15 percent more capacity this year than there was a year ago. And … more seats mean there’s going to be more elbow room for folks this summer even during the busy travel season.”

            Secondly, Keyes says he likes to find a quieter, more restful pocket of the airport away from his gate in which to hang out before his flight. He downloads the airline’s mobile app, which notifies him just before boarding is about to start.

  <p>Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart partnered with Capital One in 2019 after ending its previous credit card deal with Synchrony Financial.

The lawsuit also said Capital One "admitted" it had failed to meet some of Walmart's service standards. Capital One said the service issues did not constitute grounds for the partnership to end, and said Walmart was attempting to "end the deal early." </p>

																										<p>Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis has shared a few thoughts on the ongoing vote to ratify Elon Musk’s 2018 compensation plan, ahead of the company’s upcoming shareholders meeting.</p>

<p>In a note to clients shared on Saturday, Glass Lewis said it recommends voting against <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-shareholders-voting-musk-pay/">Musk’s $56 billion compensation plan</a>, noting its “excessive size,” as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-25/tesla-shareholders-should-reject-musk-s-pay-glass-lewis-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports. Along with the size of the payment plan, the firm said it was concerned about the deal having a dilutive effect on shareholders.</p>
<p>“Mr. Musk’s slate of extraordinarily time-consuming projects unrelated to the Company was well-documented before the 2018 grant, and only expanded with his high-profile purchase of the company now known as X,” wrote the firm.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="o7BlXlZB9D"><p><a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-autopilot-self-driving-robotics-rehire/">Tesla looks to rebuild Autopilot, self-driving, robotics departments after layoffs</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The suggestion comes as many shareholders are deciding how to vote on the proposal, after it was <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package-gets-voided-judge-rules-in-favor-shareholder/">struck down by a Delaware judge in January</a> despite being approved by investors in 2018. Following the move to void the compensation plan, Tesla has launched a new vote to ratify the previously approved package, leaving many shareholders divided on how to vote following <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/">multiple rounds of layoffs</a> at the company.</p>
<p>The re-incorporation and Musk compensation proposals are numbered three and four, respectively.  Tesla will hold its annual shareholders meeting on June 13, and the company’s board has <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-encourage-approval-musk-2018-comp-package-tx-reincorporation/">recommended voting in favor of ratifying Musk’s pay package, along with moving to re-incorporate the automaker in Texas</a>.</p>
<p>The company has been pushing hard to encourage shareholders to vote yes on the proposals, <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-investors-vote-musk-texas/">sharing ads on various platforms</a> and even launching a <a href="https://www.votetesla.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> dedicated to explaining how investors can vote—along with suggesting they vote in favor of the two proposals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-koguan-leo-push-against-elon-musk-pay-package/">Tesla’s largest individual shareholder has also been outspoken about his opposition to the proposals</a>, recommending that other investors<a href="https://www.teslarati.com/major-tesla-shareholder-criticizes-musk-pay/"> vote against the compensation plan</a>. There has been substantial discussion over the last several weeks as to whether to vote in favor of or against the package,</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-explains-25-percent-voting-share-tsla/">Musk has threatened to develop AI and robotics development outside of Tesla</a> if he doesn’t gain enough shares to have around 25 percent voting control within the company.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The US is experiencing a similar situation to 1972, when an energy crisis caused by OPEC restricting oil exports led to a surge in oil prices and a decline in large, gas-guzzling American cars.</li>
<li>In the 1970s, Japanese automakers like Toyota, Nissan, and Honda emerged as a major force in the global automotive market, producing affordable, efficient cars that Americans wanted.</li>
<li>In response to the energy crisis and the dominance of Japanese automakers, American car companies like Ford and General Motors failed to produce cheap, efficient cars, leading to a decline in popularity of their products.</li>
<li>Instead, Japanese automakers opened manufacturing plants in the US to produce affordable cars, which became popular among middle-class Americans who could no longer afford large, gas-hungry vehicles.</li>
<li>Today, the US has a unique car culture, with 92% of daily trips made by car, compared to 45% in Europe and 30% in Asia. While American car companies sell to their most profitable customers, the middle class has largely abandoned them for Japanese and other foreign-made cars.</li>

<hr>
<p>Perhaps Biden has forgotten the last time America’s land yachts, marketed to the most affluent, became impossibly expensive symbols of conspicuous consumption. It was the same year he entered Congress after all, 52 years ago. But America and its car companies have indeed faced almost exactly the same situation as they face now, and responded very differently. And America’s car companies thrived.</p>
<p>There are similarities and differences of course. History doesn’t repeat, it merely rhymes (thanks, Mark Twain, American author). What happened in 1972 that is a lot like what’s happening now? It was an energy crisis, the OPEC Oil Crisis to be specific. A bunch of non-American countries that produced a lot of oil that America needed for its profligate ways decided to shut off the taps, causing a spike in oil prices.</p>
<p>Prior to that, the USA was awash in cheap foreign and domestic oil, and hence gasoline. Detroit’s average vehicle weighed two of those weird Imperial American tons. Today, American cars average 2.05 American tons. The supersizing of American automobiles today has an almost identical echo from the past. But when OPEC shut off the taps, those land yachts were suddenly incredibly expensive and inconvenient.</p>
<p>What happened? Toyota, Nissan, and Honda were building cheap, reliable, efficient cars because they weren’t Americans. Japan was emerging as an economic and industrial powerhouse. Fears about it eclipsing America were starting to arise. North American automakers failed miserably to build cheap, affordable, and fuel efficient cars.</p>
<p>Enter Japanese automakers. America (i.e., Detroit) embraced them to build the cheap, efficient, low-margin cars that American automakers weren’t interested in building. In 1982, 1983, and 1984, Honda, Nissan, and Toyota respectively opened American car manufacturing plants for the cheap cars Detroit couldn’t build. A lot of Americans who suddenly couldn’t afford land yachts could buy the cars that are so necessary for America’s unusual man-spreading suburbs.</p>
<p>And unusual it is. 92% of American’s daily trips are by car, compared to 45% for Europe and 30% in Asia. One of these things is not like the other. In North America, cars are incredibly hard to live without. In the rest of the world, they are usually a status symbol, sometimes a flaunting inconvenience, and often easy to live without.</p>
<p>Did American car companies disappear? No, they kept selling cars to their most profitable customers, the top 40% of American income earners. The middle 20% to 40% stopped wasting salespeople’s time kicking tires and bought Japanese cars. The bottom 20% to 40% had different used cars to buy. American car companies did just fine.</p>
<p>That’s history. During an energy transition in the USA, foreign car companies came in that could build and sell cars at low margins that less affluent Americans needed in order to live in the urban sprawl that a weird confluence of American nuclear war paranoia, racism, and corporate antipathy to transit had created. It worked out somewhat adequately. Was it without controversy? Not even remotely.</p>
<p>In the article “Can America Win the Car War?” in <em>Reader’s Digest</em>, Ronald Schiller highlighted the concerns about Japanese automakers, suggesting that American car manufacturers were struggling to compete with the high-quality, efficient production of Japanese companies. He emphasized the dire state of American competitiveness, framing the situation as a critical economic battle​. U.S. auto executives frequently testified before Congress about the challenges posed by Japanese imports. They often argued that Japanese companies were benefiting from unfair trade practices and government support, while American manufacturers faced high tariffs and restrictive standards in Japan. These testimonies often included stark warnings about the potential collapse of the U.S. auto industry if corrective actions were not taken​. Reagan, responding to industry pressures, negotiated a “voluntary export restraint” with Japan in 1981. He described the situation as one where American automakers needed “breathing room” to catch up to Japanese competitors, implying that without intervention, the U.S. industry could be overwhelmed by Japanese imports​.</p>
<p>Does any of this sound familiar? Is there any reason that the <em>Chinese-cars-are-coming</em> hysteria of today is different from the <em>Japanese-cars-are-coming</em> hysteria of the 1980s?</p>
<p>There was another thread emerging in American culture. While post-WWII America lifted all boats unequally, at least it lifted almost all boats. Black GIs may not have received the preferential rate mortgages for suburban homes that white GIs did, but America was a leading global manufacturer and there were jobs, jobs, jobs. Black people, women, and Hispanics may not have been receiving anywhere near the same pay or increases in pay as white men, but they were receiving incomes that were bigger. American manufacturing, grown to extraordinary size during the war, was trying, almost desperately, to find something to do with both that capacity and the returning GIs. The women who had been a mainstay of American manufacturing during the war were encouraged to return to kitchen and bedroom duties while the newly returned men did manly work.</p>
<p>Then came Reaganomics. That’s when very rich, mostly white men realized that money could buy tax breaks for themselves. Supply side economics, also known as voodoo economics, also known as the free market wet dreams of Friedman and Hayek — or at least their much less nuanced and much more predatory disciples — came into play. That’s when in America, the rich got richer while the temporarily embarrassed millionaire class — everyone outside of the 1% to 10% — started getting poorer.</p>
<p>From 1980 to recently, the bottom 80% — the massive majority — had flat or even declining real money incomes and buying power, while the top 20% and especially the top 1% accelerated away from most Americans. The Gini Index — the measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income or wealth inequality within a nation — for the USA went the other direction from most other western liberal democracies. In the USA, unlike most of Europe and Canada, the rich got a lot richer while everyone else didn’t get rich at all, or even lost real wealth.</p>
<p>That has had horrible consequence, but I’ll try to stick to the plot of Chinese vs US EVs. It’s easy to tell stories related to widespread and deserved grievances exploited by populist Republicans in the past decade, but the point is Biden’s 100% tariffs on EVS.</p>
<p>Related to EVs is the ability of the average American to buy a new car vs. a used car. The top 20% buy new cars every 1 to 4 years. Some of the 60% to 80% find it in their means to buy a new car every 4 to 8 years. Everyone else buys used cars that are increasingly old. In 1980, the average age of cars in the United States was about 5.6 years. By 1990, this average had increased to around 7.8 years. In 2023, it was 12.5 years.</p>
<p>Some of this is due to cars actually being better. They last longer now because all the bits are better. But a lot of it is due to rich people being able to afford new cars, American car companies shifting their product lines to pander to the richest and highest profit customers, and no one else being able to afford SUVs and oversized pickups.</p>
<p>Remember, in 1970, American cars were huge, gas was cheap, and then the crunch came. Now American cars are huge, only 20% of Americans can afford them, and a reality check has arrived.</p>
<p>Can American car companies adapt and sell the equivalent of Japanese econoboxes from the early 1980s? Not a chance, just as they couldn’t do it then. Could America say to Chinese automobile firms, sure, sell cheap cars that the average person can afford in North America, just do it with Chinese cars built in Chinese-owned factories on American soil, mostly employing Americans? Of course.</p>
<p>That’s what America did in the 1980s, and American car companies did okay. Of course, now Japanese car firms with factories in North America are the American car companies of 1970, also selling only higher margin SUVs and pickups to the top 20% of US income earners. They aren’t going to save America from itself because they now have a related corporate COVID, where plug-in hybrid vehicles are one of the symptoms.</p>
<p>Why is Biden, instead of following in Reagan’s footsteps and opening the doors to cheap Chinese EVs that will be great for the bottom 80% but not expensive ones that will compete with American or Japanese firms selling to the top 20%, putting 100% tariffs on cheap Chinese EVs? It’s obviously a destructive choice for most Americans, America’s economy, and America’s climate goals.</p>
<p>I think there are four or five things going on.</p>
<p>The first is that Biden is beholden to the union power block. This was apparent when unionized GM was feted as the leader in electric vehicles when it managed to sell 40 vehicles in a quarter while non-unionized Tesla was ignored. Unions are great until they aren’t. They are inherently protectionist of jobs for workers and that’s playing out around the world. Why? Electric vehicles are a lot simpler, so a lot fewer workers are required to do the assembling. Unions aren’t pleased with this. Workers’ organizations in multiple countries are fighting electrification because it might require fewer workers and hence less political power for the unions and workers’ organizations. Is this to say that unions are bad? Not at all. Just that like all human organizations, they have both good and bad impulses that express themselves in good and bad ways.</p>
<p>The second is America’s institutional Sinophobia. When Japan was threatening American industry, it was the defeated evil, the bombed enemy, the MacArthur pacified island nation, its flag lowered and its leaders bowing to Americans. America never defeated China. In the various east and southeast Asia proxy wars from 1950 to 1975, America didn’t exactly have any resounding successes. Korea? Vietnam? Cambodia? Laos? These aren’t celebrated in USA’s annual days of martial victory.</p>
<p>Third, there’s a lot of basic xenophobia and racism inherent to the USA. The amount of “China can’t do x or y because they are inferior because a or b” I’ve heard from Americans is mind boggling. China is graduating a lot more STEM PhDs than the USA annually, both domestically and in every educational institution abroad, and these are not buy-a-PhD children of Chinese mandarins. The quality 20 years ago was easy to consider inferior, but not today. Similarly, China’s patents have outstripped Americas, and they are not crap patents, if they ever were.</p>
<p>Next, there’s another ugly underbelly of America. Like all countries, it likes to have an external, dehumanized enemy it can rally most of its populace around. For 60 years, that’s been any country that could in any way have the label Communist attached to it. It’s invaded multiple tiny, barely defended countries since 1970 with overwhelming force based on the C-word. That it’s won a lot of battles and lost the vast majority of wars should be a cause for reflection, but it’s not. Now China is the great Communist boogey man, although CCP really should be extended to the Chinese Confucianist Party Regulating a Vibrant Market Economy.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s the march of history. While Ray Dalio’s principles and algorithms have turned out to be more commonly overridden by Dalio’s gut than observed, his <em>Changing World Order</em> is a reasonably good framework for understanding the world, a better and more dispassionate one than Allison’s <em>Destined for War</em>. The USA is in the moderately stagnant end phases of empires, likely but not inevitably required to cede its globetrotting swagger to the next empire, even if one founded a lot more on trade and commerce than guns and bombs. However, the title of Allison’s book is vastly more internalized in Washington than the soft-peddled lesson of the book that <em>the USA is the problem</em>, never mind Dalio’s transition of empires phases or Mahbubani’s or Jacques’ discussions of the realities of China and the USA.</p>
<p>Japan was the defeated enemy and a client state of the USA. Welcoming it to manufacture cars on American ground helped everyone. China should be welcomed in, as it’s only the imagined martial enemy because Washington’s politicians and military industrial complex require an external, Communist boogey man. But they can’t simultaneously vilify and embrace China. They were able to make it clear Japan was inferior while accepting superior Japanese cars, but even then the cognitive dissonance was powerful.</p>
<p>Not so much China. It has vastly more people than the USA. It is just as big geographically. Its economy has already surpassed the USA’s in real economic output based purchasing power parity, and it is one which is still growing much faster than the USA’s. It is the only scaled manufacturer of most of the products the world needs to decarbonize, offerings that the USA ceded entirely to China in pursuit of quarterly stock prices and dividends for shareholders over all else for the past 40 years.</p>
<p>Japan was humbled, hence acceptable and controllable. China isn’t.</p>
<p>And so we have Biden’s massive failure of a 100% tariff on cheap Chinese EVs. It’s not about what is best for Americans. It’s not about what is best for climate change. It’s not about what is best for American car companies that have proven themselves unable to service the bottom 80% of Americans for the past 40 years. It’s about China being scary and probably superior, with no illusions except the boogeyman of Communism to hide behind.</p>

    <div><p>Work from home regulations for banks are changing, and some of the industry’s biggest players would rather bring employees in <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/11/remote-work-return-to-office-miami-new-york-wall-street-80-percent/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/11/remote-work-return-to-office-miami-new-york-wall-street-80-percent/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">five days a week</a> than make the effort to comply—including making regular inspections of workers’ homes.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>During the pandemic, brokerage industry watchdog the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), suspended rules on workplace inspections to make it easier for banks to allow their employees to work from home. The agency is now set to move back to its pre-pandemic requirements for monitoring workplaces, meaning some home offices will have to be registered with regulators and remotely inspected at least every three years under a new pilot program.</p>



<p>Now, some of the banks that had been most flexible with their work from home policies, including <a href="https://fortune.com/company/citigroup/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/citigroup/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Citigroup</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/barclays/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/barclays/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Barclays</a>, and HSBC, have decided complying with the renewed rules isn’t worth the effort, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-23/citi-hsbc-order-more-staff-to-work-in-offices-five-days-a-week?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;sref=2jPYL79S" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-23/citi-hsbc-order-more-staff-to-work-in-offices-five-days-a-week?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;sref=2jPYL79S" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">reported</a>. Between them, the three banks are bringing thousands of their workers back to the office five days a week.</p>



<p>Citigroup said on Thursday that it is requiring 600 employees previously eligible to work from home to come into the office five days a week, although it said in a statement that most of its staff can still work remotely two days a week, per the outlet. Barclays cited “new regulatory policies” in a Thursday memo as part of why it is bringing thousands of its investment banking employees worldwide back to five days a week in-person. And 530 of HSBC’s New York workers may need to change their remote work habits soon as well, Mabel Rius, the head of human resources for the US and Americas told Bloomberg. </p>



<p>Michael Roberts, HSBC CEO of the US and Americas, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-05-23/hsbc-won-t-force-workers-back-to-office-five-days-a-week?sref=2jPYL79S" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-05-23/hsbc-won-t-force-workers-back-to-office-five-days-a-week?sref=2jPYL79S" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">told Bloomberg</a> that, while the bank will comply with the FINRA regulations, he wants employees to want to come back to the office. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“What we did not want to do is to force people to come back simply out of decree,” Roberts told Bloomberg in a Thursday interview.</p>



<p>Part of enticing workers to work in person means listening to why employees like coming to the office at all. Roberts said the bank has incorporated much of that input at its <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240524327/hsbcs-new-offices-are-coaxing-hybrid-workers-into-the-office-more-frequently#:~:text=%22This%20is%20a%20place%20where,Yards%20development%20in%20Midtown%20Manhattan." target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240524327/hsbcs-new-offices-are-coaxing-hybrid-workers-into-the-office-more-frequently#:~:text=%22This%20is%20a%20place%20where,Yards%20development%20in%20Midtown%20Manhattan." rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">new U.S. headquarters</a> in New York City’s Hudson Yards, to make it “conducive to people coming back.”</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>“We will adjust to the FINRA rules, we’ll make sure that whoever needs to be there five days a week will be here five days a week, but I don’t want to decree people coming back,” Roberts said. “I want them to come back because they want to come back.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, some of the industry’s other giants, including <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/25/bank-of-america-threatening-workers-return-to-office-disciplinary-action/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/01/25/bank-of-america-threatening-workers-return-to-office-disciplinary-action/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Bank of America</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/01/13/goldman-sachs-employees-back-in-the-office-one-year-later/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs'%20CEO%20called%20on,still%20aren't%20showing%20up&amp;text=Nearly%20a%20year%20after%20CEO,points%20below%20pre%2Dpandemic%20levels." target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/01/13/goldman-sachs-employees-back-in-the-office-one-year-later/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs'%20CEO%20called%20on,still%20aren't%20showing%20up&amp;text=Nearly%20a%20year%20after%20CEO,points%20below%20pre%2Dpandemic%20levels." class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Goldman Sachs</a>, have already handed down mandates for five day in-person weeks. </p>

Those changes “provide member firms greater flexibility — not less — to allow eligible registered persons to work from home,” FINRA said. </p>



<p>“FINRA has seen recent statements from firms stating that new, stringent rules from FINRA will require them to bring their workforce back to the office full time,” it wrote in the statement. “This is incorrect.”</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

																										<p>The United Automotive Workers (UAW) has filed a petition to hold a new election at a Mercedes-Benz factory in Alabama, after the company’s workers voted against joining the union last week.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/mercedes-alabama-against-uaw/">union election held at the Mercedes factory in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, held last week</a>, 56 percent of workers voted against UAW membership, though the union accused the automaker of union-busting tactics and signage encouraging employees to vote no. On Friday, the UAW officially filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to hold a new election at the factory, citing a “relentless anti-union campaign,” according to a report from <a href="https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/uaw-asks-us-board-new-unionization-vote-mercedes-alabama-plant" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Automotive News</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="U11bcHOYGq"><p><a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-uaw-next-battleground-sweden-strikes-wedbush/">Tesla could be ‘the next battleground’ for UAW amid Sweden strikes: analyst</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The filing also <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/mercedes-benz-alabama-voting-uaw/">alleges that Mercedes fired employees who were pro-union</a> and held regular anti-union meetings.</p>
<p>“We sincerely hoped the UAW would respect our team members’ decision,” said a Mercedes-Benz spokesperson. “Throughout the election, we worked with the NLRB to adhere to its guidelines and we will continue to do so as we work through this process.”</p>
<p>In the recent election, 56 percent of the roughly 4,687 votes cast were against the Mercedes plant recognizing the UAW.</p>
<p>The election followed a similar <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/volkswagen-tennessee-uaw-election/">union election at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee</a>, where <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/volkswagen-tennessee-join-uaw/">workers about 73 percent of employees voted in favor of joining the UAW</a> last month. It also comes after the <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/uaw-union-drive-tesla-automakers/">UAW launched union campaigns at Tesla</a>, Toyota, Hyundai, Rivian, and nine others—including Volkswagen and Mercedes.</p>
<p>Last year, the <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/uaw-big-three-ratify-contracts-64-percent-workers/">UAW held six-week strikes against Ford, General Motors (GM), and Stellantis</a>, ultimately garnering record wage increases for employees in contract negotiations. After much <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/uaw-could-try-to-unionize-tesla-and-other-automakers-next/">speculation that the UAW would set its sights on Tesla</a>, the union officially launched the updated campaigns in November.</p>
<p>At the time, <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/uaw-president-tesla-workers-future-union-members/">UAW President Shawn Fain had also called workers at Tesla and Toyota “members of the future,”</a> later saying that he hoped to see a <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/uaw-tesla-big-five-six/">“Big Five or Six” at the bargaining table in 2028</a>, instead of just the Big Three.</p>

<p><em>Editor’s Note: This story has been updated to clarify that the recall was initiated in March and classified by the FDA last week, and to add in comment from the company.</em></p>



<p>TOPEKA (<a href="https://www.ksnt.com/news/kansas/nearly-1-9-million-cases-of-water-impacted-by-fda-recall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KSNT</a>) – The Food and Drug Administration (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FDA</a>) has determined thousands of cases of bottled water affected by a March recall are “not likely to cause adverse health consequences” in a new update. </p>



<p>In March, the FDA announced Natural Waters of Viti Limited was <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/?Event=94172" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/?Event=94172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voluntarily recalling</a> more than 78,000 cases of “<a href="https://www.fijiwater.com.au/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.fijiwater.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fiji Natural Artesian Water</a>” due to manganese and three bacterial genera.</p>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDC</a>) reports <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/tsp/toxfaqs/toxfaqsdetails.aspx?faqid=101&amp;toxid=23#:~:text=Exposure%20to%20excess%20levels%20of%20manganese%20may%20occur,the%20brain%2C%20liver%2C%20kidneys%2C%20and%20the%20developing%20fetus." data-type="link" data-id="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/tsp/toxfaqs/toxfaqsdetails.aspx?faqid=101&amp;toxid=23#:~:text=Exposure%20to%20excess%20levels%20of%20manganese%20may%20occur,the%20brain%2C%20liver%2C%20kidneys%2C%20and%20the%20developing%20fetus." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manganese </a>as a trace element that is needed in small amounts in our food and water. However, exposure to more than the usual requirement of manganese can lead to brain damage.</p>



<p>Last week, the FDA classified the recall as <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/postmarket-requirements-devices/recalls-corrections-and-removals-devices#2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Class III</a>, a status given to recalled products that are “not likely to cause adverse health consequences.”</p>



<p>The water was sent to the state of Washington before distribution nationally to customers through online retailers like Amazon.com, according to a March <a href="https://x.com/FIJIWater/status/1767632812235264379" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/FIJIWater/status/1767632812235264379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> from the company. </p>





<p>“The FDA classification announced yesterday relates to a matter from several months ago that never posed any health or safety risk,” a company spokesperson said in a statement to Nexstar’s KSNT. “It affected products that were sold through only one distributor, and 99% of all those affected bottles were reclaimed with the remainder in warehouses to be returned. There is no higher priority to us than the safety and quality of Fiji Water. There is no health or safety risk posed from manganese or bacteria in the recalled lots of FIJI Water. Moreover, FIJI Water conducts regular testing to ensure consumers enjoy the soft, smooth taste of FIJI Water that they expect and love.”</p>





<p>The water cases contained 24 bottles of water apiece, meaning about 1,884,792 individual bottles were affected. More details on the recalled cases can be found below: </p>



<ul>
<li>Case UPC Code –  6 32565 00004 3</li>



<li>Bottle UPC Code – 6 32565 00001 2</li>



<li>Production dates – Nov. 11, 2023; Nov. 12, 2023; Nov. 13, 2023; Nov. 24, 2023 and Nov. 25, 2023</li>
</ul>



<p>Affected bottles of Fiji Water were only sold between February 1 and March 3 this year, according to the company.</p>

In that article, I highlighted five high-quality stocks that offered a very attractive combination of current dividend income along with dividend sustainability through various<span class="paywall-full-content invisible"> market cycles, as well as the potential to continue growing that dividend at a rate that meets or even beats inflation over the long term. Those five stocks are Enterprise Products Partners (</span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EPD" title="Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Common Units" class="paywall-full-content invisible">EPD</a><span class="paywall-full-content invisible">), Brookfield Renewable Partners (</span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BEP" title="Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P.

Unfortunately, only one of those stocks meets the 25-year-plus payout growth streak qualification necessary to be considered a Dividend Aristocrat, and even that one, Enterprise Products Partners, as an MLP, is not technically included in<span class="paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible"> the list of Dividend Aristocrats (</span></span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NOBL" title="ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF" class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">NOBL</a><span class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">). However, for the purposes of this article, which is exploring a hypothetical 10-stock retirement portfolio made up entirely of Dividend Aristocrats, I will classify it as one given that what I'm really concerned about is the dividend growth streak and not some other aspect of the company that qualifies it to belong in a certain index or not.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Without further ado, here are the 10 Dividend Aristocrats that I would buy if I were limited to only holding 10 stocks, they had to be Dividend Aristocrats, and they had to have the potential to fund my living expenses indefinitely, while also growing at a rate in aggregate that meets or beats inflation over the long term.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">#1. Enterprise Products Partners</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As already discussed, this is one of my top picks if I were to retire with only five stocks and actually is my top pick if I had to retire with only <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4689082-only-retire-with-one-stock-it-would-be-enterprise-products-partners">one stock</a>. I really like Enterprise Products Partners as a retirement stock because it offers a very attractive approximately 7.5% distribution yield that is covered 1.7 times by distributable cash flow. It also has a stellar balance sheet with the best credit rating in its sector at A-, backed by a very low leverage ratio of 3.0 times, which should only decrease further as it brings its $6.9 billion growth capital backlog online in the coming quarters and years. In addition to giving it significant flexibility on its balance sheet, this growth backlog should also continue to drive mid-single-digit distribution growth per year, helping to preserve and even increase the purchasing power of its already hefty payout.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Moreover, its business model is battle-tested and has proven to generate returns on invested capital of 10% or higher through all sorts of market cycles. Putting it all together, Enterprise Products Partners not only delivers significant current income to help meet my living expenses but also should continue to grow that income at an inflation-beating rate over the long term, regardless of the economic conditions we face.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">#2. Realty Income (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/O" title="Realty Income Corporation">O</a>)</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The next Dividend Aristocrat that I would be interested in holding in this portfolio is Realty Income. I like Realty Income for many of the same reasons that I like Enterprise Products Partners. It has an A- credit rating, a very well-diversified and defensive business model that is likely to generate stable cash flows through all sorts of business cycles. Moreover, it has a very impressive dividend growth track record and continues to grow its dividend at a rate that should either meet or slightly beat inflation over the long term. Last but not least, its triple net lease business model, combined with its enormous and well-diversified property portfolio, should enable it to be extremely defensive regardless of the economic environment. Given the 6% current dividend yield, Realty Income is a great stock to include in a retirement portfolio.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">#3. Amcor (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMCR" title="Amcor plc">AMCR</a>)</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The next Dividend Aristocrat that I would want to include in my portfolio is Amcor. Amcor has a competitively positioned and well-diversified portfolio of products and customers, giving it fairly stable performance through cycles as well as numerous growth opportunities as a global leader in packaging solutions for industries ranging from food and beverages to pharmaceuticals. Additionally, it is a consistent dividend grower and has done so at paces that should be able to continue to grow at a rate approximately in line with inflation over the long term. Moreover, its aggressive buyback program and successful track record of making accretive acquisitions should fuel earnings per share growth that far exceeds inflation over the long term. Given that it has a well-positioned, competitive-edge business model and an investment-grade balance sheet, an attractive 5.1% current dividend yield supplemented by a generous share repurchase program, Amcor looks like a great long-term compounder as part of a well-diversified portfolio of Dividend Aristocrats for someone focused on steadily growing income.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">#4. Chevron Corporation (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX" title="Chevron Corporation">CVX</a>)(<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHEV:CA" title="Chevron Corporation">CHEV:CA</a>)</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Another Dividend Aristocrat that I would like to add to my portfolio is Chevron Corporation. With a 4.2% forward dividend yield, a strong dividend growth rate that easily beats inflation in recent years, and its status as a blue-chip energy company with a very strong balance sheet, Chevron Corporation serves as an excellent inflation hedge for my portfolio while still generating very attractive current income.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">#5. Federal Realty Investment Trust (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FRT" title="Federal Realty Investment Trust">FRT</a>)</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Another Dividend Aristocrat that I'd like to add to my portfolio is Federal Realty Investment Trust. It owns many grocery-anchored shopping centers that make it quite defensive, coupled with a very strong investment-grade balance sheet and a 4.4% current dividend yield. Its strong management team also makes it a very reliable dividend payer that should continue to grow its already attractive dividend at a solid clip for years to come. Moreover, it is positioned to weather all sorts of economic environments.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">#6. International Business Machines (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM" title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM</a>)(<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM:CA" title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM:CA</a>)</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Another Dividend Aristocrat that I would want to add to this hypothetical portfolio is IBM. While IBM is not nearly as exciting of a tech company as some of the mega-cap companies, it is still a strategically positioned company with a fairly strong moat around its existing business. It is also one of the highest-yielding major plays on artificial intelligence available on the market today. Given its fairly attractive dividend yield of nearly 4%, growth potential from its involvement in artificial intelligence and other technology platforms, as well as its commitment to growing its dividend each year, IBM is another worthwhile component of a Dividend Aristocrat-only portfolio that helps provide nice diversification while still getting a decent yield.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">#7. Johnson &amp; Johnson (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ" title="Johnson &amp; Johnson">JNJ</a>)(<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ:CA" title="Johnson &amp; Johnson">JNJ:CA</a>)</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Another Dividend Aristocrat that I want to add for my healthcare exposure is Johnson &amp; Johnson. Johnson &amp; Johnson is a very well-diversified healthcare company with a very impressive track record of consistently growing its dividend through thick and thin. While its 3.3% forward dividend yield is not extremely exciting, it is extremely reliable, as the company has a very strong balance sheet and continues to grow its dividend at an annual pace that should exceed inflation for years to come.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">#8. Coca-Cola Company (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO" title="The Coca-Cola Company">KO</a>)</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Another Dividend Aristocrat that I would add to this hypothetical portfolio to give me my consumer product exposure is The Coca-Cola Company. It's a great company that Warren Buffett has famously said he would never sell a share of. With a 3.1% forward dividend yield, a very competitively positioned and fairly defensive business model, a strong balance sheet, and a dividend growth pace that should continue to exceed inflation for the foreseeable future, it makes a nice diversification play that helps to create a more defensive posture for my portfolio as well.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">#9. Consolidated Edison (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ED" title="Consolidated Edison, Inc.">ED</a>)</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Rounding out this portfolio of 10 stocks, 10 Dividend Aristocrats, are two utility stocks. Consolidated Edison is the first one, as it posts very solid dividend growth rates that should meet or exceed inflation for the foreseeable future, alongside a fairly attractive 3.5% dividend yield supported by a highly defensive regulated utility business model.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">#10. NextEra Energy (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEE" title="NextEra Energy, Inc.">NEE</a>)</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Next on the list is NextEra Energy, which offers a lower dividend yield of 2.73% but operates in a very high-growth jurisdiction primarily focused in Florida, where it is a leader in renewable energy. This also gives it a more exciting growth profile. It is also expected to grow its dividend at a high single-digit rate moving forward, making it a nice dividend growth engine for the overall portfolio and helping its fairly lackluster dividend yield grow into a much more impressive one over time.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Investor Takeaway</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">By building a portfolio that is diversified across the real estate, industrials, energy, technology, utilities, healthcare, and consumer products sectors, filled with Dividend Aristocrats that are known for having very battle-tested, resilient business models able to generate rising earnings and thereby dividends over multi-decade periods despite all sorts of technological and economic disruptions being thrown at them, retirees can sleep fairly well at night knowing that their income is likely to continue being paid out while also growing at a rate that meets or exceeds inflation.</p> <span class="table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><span class="table-scroll-wrapper"><span data-intersection-boundary="start"></span><table> <tbody><tr> <td><strong>Stock</strong></td> <td><strong>Yield</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>EPD</td> <td>7.5%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>O</td> <td>6.0%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AMCR</td> <td>5.1%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>CVX</td> <td>4.2%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>FRT</td> <td>4.4%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>IBM</td> <td>4.0%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>JNJ</td> <td>3.3%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>KO</td> <td>3.1%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ED</td> <td>3.5%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>NEE</td> <td>2.7%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong><em>Average</em></strong></td> <td><strong><em>4.4%</em></strong></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <span data-intersection-boundary="end"></span></span><button class="table-enlarge-button"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="table-enlarge-icon"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M16 11a5 5 0 0 1-5 5H5a5 5 0 0 1-5-5V5a5 5 0 0 1 5-5h6a5 5 0 0 1 5 5v6zm-4.5-2.5h2v-6h-6v2h4v4zm-9-1h2v4h4v2h-6v-6z"></path></svg>Click to enlarge</button></span> <p class="before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With this particular portfolio, assuming an equal weighting in each position, investors can enjoy a dividend yield that should be enough to cover their living expenses if following the 4% rule while also expecting their dividend payouts to grow at a solid mid-single-digit clip each year that should exceed the rate of inflation over the long term.</p></div></div>

The Dow, made up of 30 stocks, is a price-weighted average, meaning that higher-priced stocks cause the index to move more than a lower-priced one, even if the percentage move in each is the same.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>Here’s the thing: In a price-weighted average, an expensive stock has more influence than a cheap stock, because it’s the dollar value that really matters. A $1 move for a $100 stock has the same effect as a $1 move in a $10 stock, despite it being a 1% move for the more expensive stock and a 10% move for the smaller-priced stock.</p><p>Look at it another way. A $1 change in <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-8"><a href="/quotes/UNH/">UnitedHealth Group</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span>, with a stock price of $508.17 at Friday’s close, equals just a 0.19% move in its stock. The same $1 change in <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-9"><a href="/quotes/INTC/">Intel</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> equals a far bigger 3.3% move in the stock. But those one dollar moves have the exact same effect on the Dow.</p><p>Right now, any $1 move in a stock in the Dow causes the average to rise or fall about 6.6 points.</p><p>If Nvidia were added to the Dow, it would be the third-biggest company in the index by market capitalization, after <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-10"><a href="/quotes/MSFT/">Microsoft</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> and <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-11"><a href="/quotes/AAPL/">Apple</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span>. But it would rank 22nd when ordered by share price, after accounting for the 10-for-1 split. But its annual volatility more than makes up for its diminutive share price.</p><p>Post-split, NVDA would be the ninth biggest influence on the index, according to CNBC estimates of its expected daily volatility. That roughly $3 move puts it in line with <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-12"><a href="/quotes/BA/">Boeing</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> or <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-13"><a href="/quotes/AMZN/">Amazon.com</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span>, the most recent addition to the Dow.

Just as louder voices tend to dominate, so too do higher-priced stocks in a price-weighted index. You might have 30 guests all of whom have interesting perspectives, but 29 of them can be drowned out by the loudest talker in the room.</p><p>As we know, a stock split doesn’t mean anything for a company’s fundamentals and is mostly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/23/what-nvidia-stock-split-means-for-investors.html">a psychological matter for investors</a>. Fractional trading and exchange traded funds render the issues with high-priced shares mostly vestigial. One area where a lower share price can make a difference? Options still trade on contracts of 100 shares. NVDA stock is a darling among retail traders and a lower per share price could make its options more attractive.</p></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

<ol>
<li><strong>US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg defended the Biden administration's goal to build 500,000 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations along US highways by 2030</strong>. However, only eight chargers have been built since President Biden signed the infrastructure package in 2021.</li>
<li><strong>Buttigieg maintained that the first handful of chargers are now being physically built</strong>, contradicting the slow progress made so far.</li>
<li><strong>The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act earmarked $7.5 billion for EV charging programs</strong>, including the construction of 500,000 charging stations by 2030.</li>
<li><strong>Biden's goal is to make the EV revolution American-led</strong>, with a focus on domestic manufacturing and development.</li>
<li><strong>Only 8 out of 500,000 EV charging stations have been built so far</strong>, sparking concerns about the feasibility of reaching the administration's ambitious target of 500,000 charging stations by 2030.</li>
