Sinclair owns or operates 185 TV stations in 86 markets.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>The stations are a mix of affiliates including Fox, NBC, ABC, CBS and the CW. If sold together, their average revenue for 2023 and 2024 is an estimated $1.56 billion, the people said.

Sinclair said during earnings on Wednesday that it pre-booked $77 million in political advertising for the second half of the year through Election Day, compared with $21 million at the same point in 2020, the last time former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden were on the ticket.</p><p>The company’s overall revenue and advertising revenue both rose slightly during the first quarter. Sinclair’s stock was up 12% on Thursday.</p><p>Sinclair’s broadcast stations have been known for having a conservative editorial voice, and the company faced backlash in 2018 after <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/03/the-real-danger-in-sinclair-broadcasts-fake-news-scandal.html">requiring</a> some of its stations to read promos criticizing the media about “fake stories.”</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline1"></a>Diamond woes</h2><div class="group"><p>The process also comes after Sinclair faced headaches in the regional sports networks business.</p><p>Sinclair acquired the largest portfolio of regional sports networks from Disney in 2019 for $10.6 billion, including $8.8 billion in debt.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell this week, dropping to 7.09%, according to Freddie Mac, marking the first decline in over a month.</li>
<li>The recent rate volatility has prompted some financial institutions to adjust their mortgage outlook for the rest of 2024, including Fannie Mae, which predicted a year-end interest rate of 6.4%, up from 5.9% earlier.</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve held the federal funds rate steady last week, while mortgage rates have surged past 7% over the last three weeks, influenced by the Fed's benchmark.</li>
<li>To achieve the modified forecast, Fannie Mae's chief economist Douglas Duncan said the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) will need to drop toward 2% for at least three consecutive months.</li>
<li>The volatile mortgage rate environment is impacting the housing market, with many potential sellers hesitant to list their homes due to lower mortgage rates from years prior, leading to elevated house prices and affordability challenges for buyers.</li>

<li><strong>SoundHound AI (SOUN) to release Q1 earnings report</strong>: The company, which specializes in conversational experiences, will release its first-quarter earnings report on May 9.</li>
<li><strong>Analysts predict a loss, but bullish on long-term prospects</strong>: Analysts expect SoundHound to post a loss per share of 9 cents on revenue of $10.1 million, driven by growing demand for its conversational AI platform.</li>

<li><strong>Competition rising in AI market</strong>: SoundHound faces increased competition from rival offers in the AI market, particularly in customer service and voice assistant fields.</li>
<li><strong>Institutional investors may be trimming exposure</strong>: Recent examples include billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller trimming his exposure to Nvidia (NVDA) stock, which may be a warning sign for other high-flying tech stocks like SOUN.</li>

						<div class="entry-content story">
							<p>Artificial intelligence (<span class="ignore-ticker-auto-linking">AI</span>) specialist <strong>SoundHound AI</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ipm-ticker-link" href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/soun-stock-quote/"><strong>SOUN</strong></a>) — which specializes in facilitating <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOUN/profile" rel="nofollow">conversational experiences</a> — saw its shares decline ahead of a key litmus test. The company will release its first-quarter earnings report on May 9. While there’s no denying that long-term demand for AI has bolstered the entire technology ecosystem, SOUN stock could face downside risks due to overhype and profit-taking.</p>



<p>Overall, analysts anticipate that SoundHound will <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOUN/analysis" rel="nofollow">post a loss per share of 9 cents</a> on revenue of $10.1 million. The most optimistic target calls for a loss of 7 cents on sales of $10.17 million. In last year’s Q1, the company posted a loss of 13 cents with a top-line print of $6.71 million. Notably, SoundHound missed projections for both the top and bottom lines back then.</p>



<p>Zacks Equity Research notes that the tech specialist “is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for its conversational AI platform, owing to the increasing popularity of generative AI and large language models.” In particular, demand for smart customer-oriented solutions — especially in the restaurant and automotive spaces — should help boost SoundHound’s performance.</p>



<p>In March, the company introduced an in-vehicle voice assistant, providing powerful generative AI capabilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Risk Factors Rise for SOUN Stock</h2>



<p>Although SOUN stock benefits from both underlying catalysts and broader sector enthusiasm, several concerns exist about its forward viability. For one thing, shares have already gained over 130% on a year-to-date basis. Thus, the AI-fueled narrative may be getting overstretched.</p>



<p>Another risk factor for SOUN stock centers on competition. Zacks points out that rival offerings have increased in the AI market, especially in the customer service and voice assistant fields. That could act as a counterweight to SoundHound’s Q1 performance.</p>



<p>In addition, investors — especially the institutional variety — may be incentivized to pocket their extraordinary profits. Recently, billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller revealed that he <a href="https://investorplace.com/2024/05/stanley-druckenmiller-cut-his-stake-in-nvidia-nvda-stock/">trimmed his exposure</a> to <strong>Nvidia</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ipm-ticker-link" href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/nvda-stock-quote/"><strong>NVDA</strong></a>). Although Druckenmiller believes in the long-term narrative of AI, he views NVDA as somewhat overhyped in the near term.</p>



<p>Adding to the concerns, several publicly traded enterprises with ties to AI are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/07/here-are-other-ai-stocks-vulnerable-to-profit-taking-as-druckenmiller-sells-some-nvidia.html" rel="nofollow">trading at rich premiums</a>. With entities like <strong>Super Micro Computer</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ipm-ticker-link" href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/smci-stock-quote/"><strong>SMCI</strong></a>) suffering a big drop despite beating earnings targets, SOUN stock faces significant risks.</p>



<p>Still, the other side of the equation is that Nvidia continues to see reiterated buy ratings among analysts. So, it’s also possible that the AI narrative can continue moving forward.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why It Matters</h2>



<p>At the moment, analysts rate SOUN stock as a <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/soun/forecast" rel="nofollow">consensus moderate buy</a>. This assessment breaks down into four buys, one hold and one sell. On average, the price target stands at $7.15, implying roughly 50% upside. The most optimistic target calls for $9.50, almost doubling the current market price.</p>

                                        <p>TikTok will begin labeling content created using artificial intelligence when it’s been uploaded from outside its own platform in an attempt to combat misinformation. </p><p>“AI enables incredible creative opportunities, but can confuse or mislead viewers if they don’t know content was AI-generated,” the company said in a prepared statement Thursday. “Labeling helps make that context clear—which is why we label AIGC made with TikTok AI effects, and have required creators to label realistic AIGC for over a year.”</p><p>TikTok’s shift in policy is part of an broader attempt in the technology industry to provide more safeguards for AI usage.

Users on Facebook and Instagram users would see labels on AI-generated images. </p>
    

<p>Google said last year that AI labels are coming to YouTube and its other platforms.</p><p>A push for digital watermarking and labeling of AI-generated content was also part of an executive order that U.S. President Joe <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-ai-artificial-intelligence-executive-order-cb86162000d894f238f28ac029005059">Biden signed in October</a></span>.</p>



<p>TikTok is teaming up with the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity and will use their Content Credentials technology. </p><p>The company said that the technology can attach metadata to content, which it can use to instantly recognize and label AI-generated content. TikTok said it began to deploy the technology Thursday on images and videos and will be coming to audio-only content soon.</p>
    
<p>In coming months, Content Credentials will be attached to submissions made on TikTok, which will remain on the content when downloaded. This will help identify AI-generated material that’s made on TikTok and help people learn when, where and how the content was made or edited. Other platforms that adopt Content Credentials will be able to automatically label it.</p>
    

<p>“Using Content Credentials as a way to identify and convey synthetic media to audiences directly is a meaningful step towards AI transparency, even more so than typical watermarking techniques,” Claire Leibowicz, head of the AI and Media Integrity Program at the Partnership on AI, said in a prepared statement. “At the same time we need to better understand how users react to these labels and hope that TikTok reports on the response so that we may better understand how the public navigates an increasingly AI-augmented world.”</p><p>TikTok said it’s the first video-sharing platform to put the credentials into practice and will join the Adobe-led Content Authenticity Initiative to help push the adoption of the credentials within the industry. </p><p>“TikTok is the first social media platform to support Content Credentials, and with over 170 million users in the United States alone, their platform and their vast community of creators and users are an essential piece of that chain of trust needed to increase transparency online,” Dana Rao, Adobe’s executive vice president, general counsel and chief trust officer, said in a blog post.</p>
    

<p>TikTok’s policy in the past has been to encourage users to label content that has been generated or significantly edited by AI. It also requires users to label all AI-generated content where it contains realistic images, audio, and video.</p><p>“Our users and our creators are so excited about AI and what it can do for their creativity and their ability to connect with audiences.” Adam Presser, TikTok’s Head of Operations &amp; Trust and Safety told ABC News. “And at the same time, we want to make sure that people have that ability to understand what fact is and what is fiction.”</p><p>The announcement initially came on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Thursday. </p><p>TikTok’s AI actions come just two days after TikTok said that it and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, had <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-3b4c1fa44c89d4568d26f1c7caf303ec">filed a lawsuit</a></span> challenging a new American law that would ban the video-sharing app in the U.S. unless it’s sold to an approved buyer, saying it unfairly singles out the platform and is an unprecedented attack on free speech. </p><p>The lawsuit is the latest turn in what’s shaping up to be a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-bytedance-lawsuit-biden-386e6d81e2eef61a756bcdea96cd0aef">protracted legal fight</a></span> over TikTok’s future in the United States — and one that could end up before the Supreme Court. If TikTok loses, it says it would be forced to shut down next year.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bruce Garelick, an investor, has been convicted of insider trading by a federal jury in New York. He was accused of sharing non-public information about a merger between Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) and Trump Media, the owner of the Truth Social app.</li>
<li>Garelick had been a member of the board of directors of DWAC at the time of the alleged insider trading. He was accused of sharing information with others about the planned merger with Trump Media.</li>
<li>The merger was announced in October 2021, and prosecutors claimed that Garelick, as well as two co-defendants, Michael and Gerald Shvartsman, made trades on DWAC stock based on non-public information, resulting in profits.</li>
<li>Garelick was acquitted of five counts of securities fraud and conspiracy, and his trial took place in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. He is scheduled to be sentenced on September 12.</li>
<li>The Trump Media merger with DWAC was widely covered in the media, and it was announced after the market closed on October 20, 2021. The merger was significant because it marked a major media deal for former President Donald Trump, who is the majority shareholder of Trump Media.</li>
