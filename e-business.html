    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hackers stole records detailing the phone contacts of almost all AT&amp;T Wireless customers, exposing the numbers called or texted by over 100 million customers between May 2022 and January 2023.</li>
<li>The stolen data includes the numbers themselves, as well as the frequency and combined durations of interactions, but does not contain customer names or the content of the communications.</li>
<li>The cache of data provides a roadmap for criminals to impersonate friends or relatives, potentially tricking victims into divulging sensitive information, such as passwords or financial information.</li>
<li>The data could also be used to reveal identities of U.S. spies if workplace relationships are identified, and impersonators could mimic texts from financial institutions to trick account holders.</li>
<li>The breach is considered one of the most serious in recent years, and AT&amp;T has not disclosed how the hackers gained access to the data or how the breach occurred.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The European Commission has accused Elon Musk of violating regulations regarding "dark patterns, advertising transparency, and data access for researchers" on his Twitter platform, now called X.</li>
<li>The specific issue is Musk's decision to remove blue checks from verified users, then bring them back for free, and offer them for $8 a month to other users.</li>
<li>The European Commission's Commissioner Thierry Breton has criticized Musk's approach to blue checks, but the article argues that this is a matter of personal preference rather than a regulatory issue.</li>
<li>The article suggests that the European Commission's move is an example of overreach, as the market should be allowed to regulate itself, and there is no need for government intervention in a private company's business decisions.</li>
<li>The article concludes that rather than being a serious regulatory issue, the dispute between Musk and the European Commission is a trivial matter that gets lost in the noise of bigger problems facing the world.</li>

                                        <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The world’s first hydrogen-powered commercial passenger ferry will start operating on San Francisco Bay as part of plans to phase out diesel-powered vessels and reduce planet-warming carbon emissions, California officials said Friday, demonstrating the ship.</p><p>The 70-foot (21-meter) catamaran called the MV Sea Change will transport up to 75 passengers along the waterfront between Pier 41 and the downtown San Francisco ferry terminal starting July 19, officials said. The service will be free for six months while it’s being run as part of a pilot program. </p><p>“The implications for this are huge because this isn’t its last stop,” said Jim Wunderman, chair of the San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation Authority, which runs commuter ferries across the bay. “If we can operate this successfully, there are going to be more of these vessels in our fleet and in other folks’ fleets in the United States and we think in the world.” </p>
    

<p>Sea Change can travel about 300 nautical miles and operate for 16 hours before it needs to refuel. The fuel cells produce electricity by combining oxygen and hydrogen in an electrochemical reaction that emits water as a byproduct.</p>



<p>The technology could help clean up the shipping industry, which produces nearly 3% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions, officials said. That’s less than from cars, trucks, rail or aviation but still a lot — and it’s rising.</p>
    
<p>Frank Wolak, president and CEO of the Fuel Cell &amp; Hydrogen Energy Association, said the ferry is meaningful because it’s hard to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vessels.</p><p>“The real value of this is when you multiply out by the number of ferries operating around the world,” he said. “There’s great potential here. This is how you can start chipping away at the carbon intensity of your ports.”</p><p>Backers also hope hydrogen fuel cells could eventually power container ships.</p>
    

<p>The International Maritime Organization, which regulates commercial shipping, wants to halve its greenhouse gas releases by midcentury.</p><p>As fossil fuel emissions continue warming Earth’s atmosphere, the Biden administration is turning to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hydrogen-hubs-energy-biden-climate-pennsylvania-west-virginia-d609a455a6dd018fca5af785f245c6fd">hydrogen as an energy source</a></span> for vehicles, manufacturing and generating electricity. It has been offering $8 billion to entice the nation’s industries, engineers and planners to figure out how to produce and deliver clean hydrogen.</p><p>Environmental groups say hydrogen presents its own pollution and climate risks.</p><p>For now, the hydrogen that is produced globally each year, mainly for refineries and fertilizer manufacturing, is made using natural gas. That process warms the planet rather than saving it. Indeed, a new study by researchers from Cornell and Stanford universities found that most hydrogen production emits carbon dioxide, which means that hydrogen-fueled transportation cannot yet be considered clean energy.</p><p>Yet proponents of hydrogen-powered transportation say that in the long run, hydrogen production is destined to become more environmentally safe. They envision a growing use of electricity from wind and solar energy, which can separate hydrogen and oxygen in water. As such renewable forms of energy gain broader use, hydrogen production should become a cleaner and less expensive process.</p>
    

<p>The Sea Change project was financed and managed by the investment firm SWITCH Maritime. The vessel was constructed at Bay Ship and Yacht in Alameda, California, and All-American Marine in Bellingham, Washington.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press journalist Jennifer McDermott contributed to this report from Providence, Rhode Island.</p>

    <div><p>Human resource software company Lattice learned the hard way that employees are not quite ready to work alongside AI counterparts. </p><div class="paywall">



<p>The tech unicorn—founded by Sam Altman’s brother Jack Altman and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/lattice-raises-175m-more-at-a-3b-valuation-for-its-people-management-platform/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/lattice-raises-175m-more-at-a-3b-valuation-for-its-people-management-platform/" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">valued at $3 billion</a> in 2022—announced it “<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lattice-to-become-the-first-company-to-introduce-digital-worker-employee-records-302191582.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lattice-to-become-the-first-company-to-introduce-digital-worker-employee-records-302191582.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">made history</a>” this week by giving so-called “digital workers” employee records and integrating them into organization charts, allowing its human coworkers to see the roles of AI in their workplace. After a surge of online pushback, the company said it would no longer pursue the project only three days after its initial announcement.</p>



<p>“This innovation sparked a lot of conversation and questions that have no clear answers yet,” CEO Sarah Franklin said in a statement to <em>Fortune</em>. “We look forward to continuing to work with our customers on the responsible use of AI but will not further pursue digital workers in the product.”</p>



<p>Lattice’s announcement was part of the company’s greater effort to integrate AI into the workplace in a “responsible” way, according to the company, which ostensibly meant treating the technology like a human hiree: training it, onboarding it, and even assigning it a manager.</p>



<p>“It takes the idea of an ‘AI employee’ from concept to reality – and marks the start of a new journey for Lattice, to lead organizations forward in the responsible hiring of digital workers,” Franklin <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7216472651043676160/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7216472651043676160/" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">said in a LinkedIn post</a> Tuesday.</p><p></p>



<p>Lattice <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-altman-steps-down-ceo-cofounder-lattice-2023-12" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-altman-steps-down-ceo-cofounder-lattice-2023-12" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">skyrocketed to success</a> thanks to pandemic-era remote work and a tight labor market that forced companies to confront hiring and employee-support practices that were previously unconventional. But the announcement from the people-focused company struck a nerve with its <a href="https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">LinkedIn</a> followers, who responded to Franklin’s announcement with shock and concern for the future of AI integration into the workspace.</p>



<p>“This strategy and messaging misses the mark in a big way, and I say that as someone building an AI company,” Sawyer Middeleer, chief of staff at AI sales platform Aomni, wrote in response to Franklin’s post. “Treating AI agents as employees disrespects the humanity of your real employees. Worse, it implies that you view humans simply as ‘resources’ to be optimized and measured against machines.”</p>



<p>There’s already mounting anxiety around the role of AI in the workplace, particularly as its use proliferates across industries. A March 2023 <a href="https://fortune.com/company/goldman-sachs-group/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/goldman-sachs-group/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">Goldman Sachs</a> report found AI could replace or degrade <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2023/03/31/goldman-sachs-predicts-300-million-jobs-will-be-lost-or-degraded-by-artificial-intelligence/?sh=2a5e4ac1782b" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2023/03/31/goldman-sachs-predicts-300-million-jobs-will-be-lost-or-degraded-by-artificial-intelligence/?sh=2a5e4ac1782b" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">up to 300 million jobs</a> in the U.S. and Europe, while venture capitalist Kai-Fu Lee predicted <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/25/ai-job-displacement-forecast-50-percent-2027-kai-fu-lee-chatgpt-openai/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/25/ai-job-displacement-forecast-50-percent-2027-kai-fu-lee-chatgpt-openai/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">50% of human workers</a> will be replaced by AI by 2027. The predictions have taken a toll on workers, with <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/workforce/hopes-and-fears-2022.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/workforce/hopes-and-fears-2022.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">one-third of employees</a> saying they’re worried about their jobs being replaced by technology, consulting service PWC found in 2022.</p>



<p>Lattice’s own transition to AI may not have assuaged those anxieties. Its announcement about responsibly hiring AI employees comes a year after the company <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://layoffs.fyi/" rel="noopener" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">laid off 15% of its staff</a>—over 100 workers—in January 2023 amid hiring and spending slowdowns.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Will AI really replace us?</strong></h2>



<p>The initial ripple of the AI technology in the workplace is already starting to make waves—though maybe not in the way anxious workers initially anticipated. Amid a strategic shift to invest in generative AI, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/intuit/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/intuit/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">Intuit</a> will <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/10/intuit-layoffs-email-hiring-ai-transformation/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/07/10/intuit-layoffs-email-hiring-ai-transformation/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">lay off 1,800 workers</a>—an effort that does not have to do with cutting costs, its CEO said in an internal memo. The financial software company said it will instead rehire almost the same number of employees who are better suited for the position. About 1,000 of those laid-off employees failed to meet performance expectations, Intuit said.</p><p></p>



<p>Tech leaders aren’t convinced these layoffs are a harbinger of a wave of AI taking over jobs. “I talk to a lot of CEOs, and I’ve learned very quickly that they are not thinking of AI replacing us—I can say that with full authority,” Ronnie Sheth, CEO of advisory firm Senen Group, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/23/ai-replace-jobs-ceo-strategy/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/23/ai-replace-jobs-ceo-strategy/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">told <em>Fortune</em></a>.</p>



<p>While the technology may eventually replace some assembly-line jobs, administrative and analytical tasks—which may result in some layoffs—responsibilities like branding and management are not yet under threat. CEOs are more interested in constructing and preserving <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/26/microsoft-earnings-satya-nadella-ai-artificial-intelligence-payoff-workplace-culture/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/26/microsoft-earnings-satya-nadella-ai-artificial-intelligence-payoff-workplace-culture/" class="sc-82aca549-0 klXAci">strong company culture</a> than they are with the quantitative benefits AI may provide, according to Sheth. Moreover, the addition of AI in workplaces may not mean those employees can’t find meaningful work opportunities elsewhere, Sheth argued.</p>



<p>“I think there’s a balance between rescaling the labor force and also setting policies in place to ensure that AI is being used for human good,” she said. “And not taking away people’s livelihoods.”</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>

<li>
<p><strong>Apple wins court case</strong>: A California federal court has ruled against a proposed class action suit accusing Apple of blocking iOS developers from using competing technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Restrictions on iOS browsers</strong>: The case alleged that Apple required all iOS browsers to use its WebKit technology, which was seen as stifling competition and adding costs for consumers. However, Apple has stopped requiring this in the EU since January 2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Development costs</strong>: The suit claimed that if developers didn't have to use WebKit on iOS, they could develop once for both iPhone and Android, reducing development costs and resulting in lower prices for consumers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blocking Progressive Web Apps</strong>: The suit also claimed that Apple blocked the use of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) to prevent them from replacing native App Store apps. In February 2024, Apple announced that PWAs would no longer be allowed in the EU.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact on competition</strong>: The lawsuit challenged Apple's "closed ecosystem of apps and services", arguing that Apple's restrictions on iOS browsers and PWAs prevent competition and innovation in the app development market.</p>

                    <p class="col-sm-12 article-lead">A California federal court has ruled against a proposed class action suit accusing Apple of blocking <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ios" title="iOS" data-kpt="1">iOS</a> developers from using competing technology.
</p><div class="col-sm-12"><p>As of <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/01/25/browsers-like-chrome-and-firefox-can-abandon-webkit-in-eu-with-ios-174">January 2024</a>, Apple has stopped requiring all iOS browsers to use its WebKit technology in the EU. In that same month, three California residents sued Apple over its App Store practices, including requiring the use of WebKit.
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>According to <em>Reuters</em>, their filing challenged what <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/apple-defeats-us-consumer-lawsuit-over-third-party-iphone-apps-2024-07-11/">they described</a> as Apple's "closed ecosystem of apps and services." 
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.423937/gov.uscourts.cand.423937.1.0.pdf">full text</a> of the filing is chiefly an account of how expensive it would be to develop an alternative to either Apple or Google's app platforms. It then seeks to claim that Apple requiring iOS browser developers to use WebKit stifles competition, and also adds costs for consumers.
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>In that case, the logic appears to be that if a developer didn't have to use WebKit on iOS, they could develop once for both <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone" title="iPhone" data-kpt="1">iPhone</a> and Android. So there would be no further development cost for the iPhone, therefore consumers would pay less.
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>Alongside this, the suit claimed that Apple acted to block the use of Progressive Web Apps (PWA) to prevent them replacing native <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/app-store" title="App Store" data-kpt="1">App Store</a> apps. "Apple used contractual restraints on its iOS ecosystem," says the filing, "to exclude the
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>introduction of cross-platform PWAs on iPhones."
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>In February 2024, Apple did say that PWAs would no longer be allowed in the EU. It then <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/03/01/apple-reverses-course-on-death-of-progressive-web-apps-in-eu">reversed that decision</a> in March 2024.
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>For this specific case, US District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco does not have the required legal standing to pursue the case. That ruling was based in part on Apple's argument against the suit's claim of it artificially increasing prices.
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>"Apple's prices are not artificially inflated," Apple told the court in June, "they are competitive in light of the fierce competition Apple faces from its competitors."
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>Judge Seeborg said that Apple's argument for a dismissal of the case, "cast doubt on whether plaintiffs are the correct class of harmed individuals to bring this case."
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>The plaintiffs have been given 30 days to submit an amended lawsuit. Neither their lawyers nor Apple have commented.
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>This does appear to be a small case, but winning it also sets a precedent that Apple will doubtlessly refer to in other cases. The defeat of this particular filing may specifically help Apple because it was partly accusing the company of a duopoly with Google.
</p></div><div class="col-sm-12"><p>Apple's having won with its argument that it faces "fierce competition," could now well be used in its legal case with the Department of Justice. Central to the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/03/21/apple-will-crush-the-doj-in-court-if-garland-sticks-with-outdated-arguments">DOJ's case</a> is the argument that Apple has become a monopoly.</p></div><p></p>

    <div><div class="gnt_ar_b"><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In the midst of Northwest Indiana's ongoing discussions about economic development and solar energy, I often hear comments suggesting that these projects will bring more harm than good.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">With so much changing suddenly around here, it’s only natural for concerns to arise. I know and respect everyone’s opinions, but believe it is best to base such decisions on facts. So I decided to look at some recent research that examined how solar projects impact their communities. Based on this research and my own observations of the solar projects underway in our community, I feel it is important to point out the research-based facits that dispel many of the negative claims circling in the communities:</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">False claim: Solar projects negatively impact biodiversity.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Fact: Large-scale solar projects actually sustain and increase natural biodiversity. The shade provided by solar panels enhances floral abundance, attracting more insects, pollinators and bird species. This added shade also prevents soil moisture loss, boosting plant growth and diversity according to a 2018 study by First Solar. Solar developers often invest in habitat restoration once solar projects are installed and after a project’s lifespan.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">False claim: Solar energy is more expensive than fossil fuels and completely dependent on subsidies.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Fact: The unsubsidized cost of utility-scale solar was $60 per megawatt hour (MWh), according to a 2023 study conducted by Lazard Asset Management, while the mean unsubsidized cost of gas was $70 per MWh and $117 per MWh when it comes to coal. Solar accounted for only 33% of total renewable energy subsidies in 2022, totaling $7.4 billion according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At the moment, solar accounts for more subsidies, in the same year, while the coal and gas industries received $2.1 billion in federal subsidies. Even when considering government subsidies, subsidized and unsubsidized solar remains the cheaper form of energy production compared to coal and gas at their most cost-competitive peaks.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">False claim: The value of properties decrease when near solar projects.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Fact: Research indicates that solar panels may either maintain or increase property values. For instance, a 2018 investigation on solar projects in Indiana and Illinois concluded that neighboring properties showed "no consistent negative impact" attributable to their proximity to the solar installations. Some researchers even found that properties close to solar projects sold for a slightly higher average compared to properties not near any solar farms.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">False claim: Solar projects are harmful to human health.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Fact: According to a recent study by North Carolina State University, the electromagnetic fields generated at solar projects are comparable in strength to those of household appliances like toaster ovens. They pose no risk of negative health impacts.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Solar energy has the potential to be a positive game-changer for Indiana, if we give it the appropriate opportunity. The advantages extend far beyond electricity generation. Its cost-effectiveness is unmatched, allowing us to diversify our energy portfolio, fortify our grid against disruptions and reduce the burden of electric bills for residents and businesses alike. Moreover, the adoption of solar power promotes environmental sustainability by improving soil conditions and ensuring a healthier ecosystem for future generations to thrive.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">We’ve got a new neighbor in solar energy and we should treat them as such.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><em>Jacob Everett is CEcD &amp; founder of Corsa Strategies, a renewable energy site selection and advisory firm in Indianapolis.</em></p></div></div>

NVDA looks to have grown into the multiple being assigned to it and trades at 48 times 2024 earnings and 30.45 times 2026 earnings. With the amount of growth that NVDA has generated and the amount of earnings growth being forecasted, I feel that NVDA could actually be cheap, and I'll get into that in the next section. My risk factors revolve around demand and innovation, and we won't know how these factors impact NVDA until the story unfolds.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Years ago, Apple (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL" title="Apple Inc.">AAPL</a>) moved away from NVDA GPUs in its products as it moved to fully designing their silicon. First, AAPL moved away from Intel (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC" title="Intel Corporation">INTC</a>) for its CPU, then Advanced Micro Devices (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD" title="Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.">AMD</a>), and NVDA for its GPUs. Currently, anyone who wants to train their LLMs (large language models) on the largest scale is dependent on NVDA.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The <strong>first risk factor</strong> revolves around innovation. AMZN, GOOGL, META, and Microsoft are all designing their own <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/29/technology/ai-chips-nvidia-amazon-google-microsoft-meta.html" rel="nofollow">A.I. chips</a> to reduce their dependence on NVDA. If they are successful is anyone's guess, but they have the capital and engineering to accomplish their goals. If this does occur, it will negatively impact NVDA because these are the companies allocating the most capital to CapEx in the market. If the day comes when NVDA's largest customers can augment their current data center infrastructure with homegrown chips, it could be catastrophic to their forward revenue and earnings projections.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The <strong>next risk factor</strong> for me is demand. Currently, we are experiencing a super cycle as it's a race to build infrastructure. Not every company has a blank check like GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, or META and won't be in a position to upgrade with each new GPU that NVDA produces. At some point, companies will need to depreciate and monetize their assets. We could be in a situation where NVDA is pulling so much growth forward that orders could flatten out or decline over the next several years.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The first risk of innovation could also impact demand because INTC or AMD could come out of nowhere with chips that can compete with NVDA or be good enough to offer a lower-end option as an alternative. Also, if innovation from a use case level tapers off, there may not be a need to scale data centers at the rate we have seen over the past 2 years, and it could take time for the need for enhanced chips to create a new wave of demand.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>I decided to start buying NVDA at the upper range because shares may actually be trading at a good value despite the massive run</strong></h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">There is an old saying: better late than never. I can't get everything correct, and while I have been a shareholder of many companies for a long time, I missed a massive run in NVDA. Rather than sitting on the sidelines waiting for shares to retrace, I tore through <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/balance-sheet">the financials</a> and determined that this was a stock I wanted to invest in despite the easy money being made.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">What if I told you there was a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/cash-flow-statement">company</a> that was generating $79.77 billion in revenue annually, operating at a 75.29% gross profit margin and a 53.4% profit margin? Then I said their revenue grew by 125.85% YoY last fiscal year, and in the trailing twelve months (TTM) their revenue has increased by 30.95% YoY after just the first quarter, and based on the projections, the revenue is expected to grow by <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/earnings/estimates">97.34%</a> throughout this fiscal year? I would be shocked, but those are the facts regarding NVDA. When I build a profitability model, the current valuation looks exciting to me.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/10/12629971-17206668878413012_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="1200" data-height="742" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="true" data-og-image-msn="true" data-og-image-facebook="true" data-og-image-google_news="true" data-og-image-google_plus="true" data-og-image-linkedin="true"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/10/12629971-17206668878413012.png" alt="NVDA Profitability" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I want to preface this section by saying that NVDA has $31.44 billion in cash and short-term investments on the books, with an additional $1.75 billion in long-term investments. NVDA only has $8.46 billion in long-term debt and $11.24 billion in total debt on the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/balance-sheet">balance sheet</a>. NVDA is a cash-rich company that is producing more profitability than they know what to do with, and the best part is that it is only allocating <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/cash-flow-statement">$1.19 billion toward CapEx</a>. All of their R&amp;D is covered in their operating expenses, and they have been able to scale the business and produce this level of profitability with a minimal capital allocation toward CapEx.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In the TTM, NVDA has generated $79.78 billion in revenue. After their cost of revenue is accounted for, NVDA's gross profit was $60.06 billion, which is a 75.86% margin. After total operating expenses, NVDA was left with $47.74 billion, which placed their operating margin at 59.85%. After taxes and interest expenses, NVDA produced $42.6 billion in net income, with a profit margin of 53.4%.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I can't think of another company that I follow with operating and profit margins this high. The margins have also scaled rather than decreasing as revenue grew. In the 2022 fiscal year, NVDA had a gross profit margin of 56.93%, which grew to 72.72% in 2023 and is currently at 75.29%. From a profitability standpoint, NVDA had a profit margin of 16.19% in 2022, and it grew to 48.85% in 2023 before it scaled to 53.40% in the TTM. NVDA's financials look like an anomaly to me, and the analyst community doesn't see the trend reversing anytime soon.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I normally look at the forward EPS estimates and price to FCF when I am evaluating a company, and I will do that in this article for NVDA. Prior to comparing NVDA to its peer group, I built a financial model based on my assumptions, and the results were shocking to me. NVDA recently conducted a 10-1 split, and its share count reached 25 billion at the end of the 2023 fiscal year. NVDA recently repurchased 400 million shares in Q1 of 2024, leaving them with 24.6 billion shares.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">If the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/earnings/estimates">analysts</a> are correct in their forward revenue estimates, then NVDA will generate $120.23 billion of revenue this year and expand its revenue growth to $188.01 billion in 2026. If I assume that NVDA doesn't continue to scale its profit margin higher but maintains a 50% margin which is 3.4% less than what it is in the TTM, they would produce $60.12 billion in net income this year and $94.01 billion in 2026. This would work out to $2.44 of profit per share this year, and $3.82 in 2026. NVDA would be trading at a 55.45 forward P/E based on 2024's profitability, and a 35.46 forward P/E based on 2026's profitability.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/10/12629971-17206668876088274_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="1200" data-height="742" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="true" data-og-image-msn="true" data-og-image-facebook="true" data-og-image-google_news="true" data-og-image-google_plus="true" data-og-image-linkedin="true"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/10/12629971-17206668876088274.png" alt="NVDA Potential Profitability" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Steven Fiorillo</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Now, what happens with all of the cash that NVDA is producing? In the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/filing/8342802">annual report</a> for 2023, NVDA disclosed that as of January 28<sup>th,</sup> 2024, the board authorized an additional $22.5 billion of share repurchases on top of the existing $25 billion that was authorized in August 2023. NVDA utilized $9.7 billion of their first $25 billion allotment and still has $37.8 billion authorized for repurchases. NVDA could generate $60.12 billion in net income this year and authorize additional buybacks.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hypothetically, if NVDA allocates 70% of its profitability this year toward buybacks, it would amount to $42.08 billion in capital. At an average price of $150, NVDA could repurchase 280.54 million shares. This would bring their share count down to 24.32 billion and adjust my forward P/E estimate for 2024 to 54.82 from 55.45. If NVDA allocated 70% of their 2025 profitability toward buybacks, they could repurchase $56.47 billion worth of shares. If they allocated this at an average price of $175 per share, they could repurchase 322.66 million shares and bring their shares outstanding down to 24 billion.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This could bump their forward EPS in 2025 to $3.36 per share and place their forward P/E at 40.21 rather than 41.33. In 2026, NVDA could generate $94 billion in net income based on a 50% margin, and a 70% allocation rate would allow them to repurchase $65.80 billion worth of shares. If NVDA's average price per share was $200, it could repurchase 329.02 million shares and reduce the share count to 23.67 billion shares. This could increase their EPS to $3.97 per share and reduce their 2026 forward P/E from 35.46 to 34.12.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I am shaving a few percent off NVDA's margin in the TTM and modeling out through 2026 based on what could happen. I am using the analyst projections for revenue and making assumptions on how much capital NVDA may allocate toward buybacks based on what they have done over the past year. I believe that I could be conservative in my model, and that NVDA could beat earnings estimates and repurchase more shares than I am modeling for. NVDA may also repurchase shares at a lower average price point than I am estimating.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The forward potential is exciting, and I believe that based on what NVDA has achieved, its current margins, and what could occur, shares are inexpensive today. Normally, I wouldn't be purchasing at all-time highs, but I have put a lot of time into studying NVDA's numbers, and I am happy to be late to the party rather than not participating because the run could be far from over.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/10/12629971-17206668878214629_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="1200" data-height="742" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="true" data-og-image-msn="true" data-og-image-facebook="true" data-og-image-google_news="true" data-og-image-google_plus="true" data-og-image-linkedin="true"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/10/12629971-17206668878214629.png" alt="NVDA Potential Profitability" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Steven Fiorillo</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>How NVDA is comparing to the rest of the Magnificent Seven</strong></h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I always like to compare companies to see how the market is valuing them. NVDA is leading the Magnificent Seven, so rather than compare it to other semiconductors, I am comparing them to AAPL, GOOGL, META, TSLA, AMZN, and MSFT. Only TSLA and AMZN are expected to grow their <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD/earnings/estimates">EPS</a> over the next 2 years by a larger percentage than NVDA.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The Magnificent Seven as a peer group is expected to grow its EPS by 44.41% over the next 2 years, while NVDA has 57.88% of EPS growth on the horizon. NVDA trades at 31.3 times 2026 earnings based on the analyst consensus estimates, while AAPL trades at 29.27 times and MSFT trades at 29.77 times.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">When I look at the projections, I think NVDA is fairly valued and could grow into the valuation with some earnings beats and higher forward guidance.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/10/12629971-17206668876517098_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="1090" data-height="217" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="false" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="false" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="false" data-og-image-msn="false" data-og-image-facebook="false" data-og-image-google_news="false" data-og-image-google_plus="false" data-og-image-linkedin="false"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/10/12629971-17206668876517098.png" alt="NVDA Forward EPS" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On a price-to-free cash flow (FCF) valuation, NVDA looks expensive, as they have generated $39.33 billion of FCF in the TTM. NVDA is currently trading at 84.37x their FCF, while most of the Magnificent Seven trade below 50x. Excluding TSLA, the peer group average trades at 45.95x their FCF, with META trading at the cheapest valuation at 27.39x its FCF.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">When I think about how NVDA is expected to scale their profitability, it could very well generate $90 billion in FCF during the 2026 fiscal year. If I plug in $90 billion, NVDA would have a price to FCF of 36.88 times, which is significantly less than AAPL And MSFT, which trade at 45.5x and 49.1x their FCF. I don't think it's unreasonable that if NVDA does accomplish what the forward projections indicate that the price to FCF will grow into the valuation and continuously trade at a premium compared to most of the Magnificent Seven.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I could see NVDA scaling its FCF and growing into a multiple of 45-50x, which would place their market cap at $4.05 - $4.5 billion in 2026. I think there is still a significant upside in NVDA based on their ability to scale profitability.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/10/12629971-17206668877151566_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="865" data-height="241" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="false" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="false" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="false" data-og-image-msn="false" data-og-image-facebook="false" data-og-image-google_news="false" data-og-image-google_plus="false" data-og-image-linkedin="false"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/10/12629971-17206668877151566.png" alt="NVDA Price to FCF" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">NVDA has produced the largest amount of appreciation I have witnessed over a 5-year period. While replicating these results over the next 5-years isn't probable, I think there is still upside waiting to be unlocked. There are some projections that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-ai-boom-could-use-a-shocking-amount-of-electricity/" rel="nofollow">Nvidia</a> will ship 1.5 million A.I. server units per year by 2027 as companies allocate more capital toward building out their A.I. infrastructure. Nvidia just announced the <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/NVDA-F1Q25-Quarterly-Presentation-FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow">Blackwell product line</a>, and there should be no shortage of customers as companies such as <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4686499-microsoft-corporation-msft-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript">MSFT</a> allocated $14 billion to their CapEx and leases to support scaling its cloud demand. I have never seen profitability margins this high from a company that is generating $80 billion in annualized revenue.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Based on my assumptions and the ability to deploy tens of billions in buybacks on an annual basis, I think that the rally in NVDA can be extended for quite some time. I am late to the party because I was looking at NVDA incorrectly, but I have been buying and plan on continuing to build my position into earnings.</p> <p class="before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/10/12629971-17206668880104728_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="1471" data-height="811" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="true" data-og-image-msn="true" data-og-image-facebook="true" data-og-image-google_news="true" data-og-image-google_plus="true" data-og-image-linkedin="true"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/10/12629971-17206668880104728.png" alt="Q1 Earnings Slide Deck" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Nvidia Corporation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p></div></div>

<ol>
<li><strong>Tesla receives downgrade from Neutral to Sell from UBS</strong>: Despite the downgrade, the firm raised its price target on Tesla to $197 per share.</li>
<li><strong>UBS analysts express difficulty in justifying valuation for Tesla</strong>: The analysts believe that Tesla's investment in AI and its progress has been slow, and the payoff is long dated, making it challenging to justify the company's valuation.</li>
<li><strong>UBS raises price target to $197, but analyst remains bearish</strong>: The price target increase is likely due to Tesla's current trading level, but the analyst remains skeptical about the company's valuation.</li>
<li><strong>UBS breaks down valuation of Tesla's various activities</strong>: The firm values Tesla's auto business at a certain level, while also factoring in energy, robotics, and autonomous driving (FSD) activities.</li>
<li><strong>UBS believes certain activities are overvalued by the market</strong>: According to the analysis, these activities are overvalued by around 60%, which has led to the downgrade from Neutral to Sell.</li>

In order for that lender to make a profit and reduce risk to itself, it will charge interest on the principal — that is, the amount you borrowed.</p><p>Expressed as a percentage, a mortgage interest rate is essentially the cost of borrowing money. It can vary based on several factors, such as your <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/credit-score-needed-for-mortgage" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>credit score</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/what-is-your-dti-ratio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>debt-to-income ratio</u></a> (DTI), <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/first-time-homebuyer-down-payment-assistance?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>down payment</u></a>, loan amount and repayment term.</p><p>After getting a mortgage, you’ll typically receive an <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/first-time-homebuyers-mortgage-amortization-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>amortization schedule</u></a>, which shows your payment schedule over the life of the loan. It also indicates how much of each payment goes toward the principal balance versus the interest.</p><p>Near the beginning of the loan term, you’ll spend more money on interest and less on the principal balance. As you approach the end of the repayment term, you’ll pay more toward the principal and less toward interest.</p><p>Your mortgage interest rate can be either fixed or adjustable. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the rate will be consistent for the duration of the loan. With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate can fluctuate with the market.</p><p>Keep in mind that a mortgage’s interest rate is not the same as its annual percentage rate (APR). This is because an APR includes both the interest rate and any other lender fees or charges.</p><p>Mortgage rates change frequently — sometimes on a daily basis. Inflation plays a significant role in these fluctuations. Interest rates tend to rise in periods of high inflation, whereas they tend to drop or remain roughly the same in times of low inflation. Other factors, like the economic climate, demand and inventory can also impact the current average mortgage rates.</p><p>To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible’s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score.

Generally, they reserve the lowest rates for low-risk borrowers — that is, those with a higher credit score, income and down payment amount. Here are some other personal factors that may determine your mortgage rate:</p><ul><li>Location of the home</li><li>Price of the home</li><li>Your credit score and credit history</li><li>Loan term</li><li>Loan type (e.g., conventional or FHA)</li><li>Interest rate type (fixed or adjustable)</li><li>Down payment amount</li><li>Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio</li><li>DTI</li></ul><p>Other indirect factors that may determine the mortgage rate include:</p><ul><li>Current economic conditions</li><li>Rate of inflation</li><li>Market conditions</li><li>Housing construction supply, demand, and costs</li><li>Consumer spending</li><li>Stock market</li><li>10-year Treasury yields</li><li>Federal Reserve policies</li><li>Current employment rate</li></ul><h2><a name="how-to-compare-mortgage-rates" id="how-to-compare-mortgage-rates"></a>How to compare mortgage rates</h2><p>Along with certain economic and personal factors, the lender you choose can also affect your mortgage rate. Some lenders have higher average mortgage rates than others, regardless of your credit or financial situation. That’s why it’s important to compare lenders and loan offers.</p><p>Here are some of the best ways to compare mortgage rates and ensure you get the best one:</p><ul><li><strong>Shop around for lenders: </strong>Compare several lenders to find the best rates and lowest fees. Even if the rate is only lower by a few basis points, it could still save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.</li><li><strong>Get several loan estimates: </strong>A loan estimate comes with a more personalized rate and fees based on factors like income, employment, and the property’s location. Review and compare loan estimates from several lenders.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved for a mortgage: </strong><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/mortgage-preapproval?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-approval</a> doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a loan, but it can give you a better idea of what you qualify for and at what interest rate. You’ll need to complete an application and undergo a hard credit check.</li><li><strong>Consider a mortgage rate lock: </strong>A <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/money/lock-or-float-mortgage-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>mortgage rate lock</u></a> lets you lock in the current mortgage rate for a certain amount of time — often between 30 and 90 days. During this time, you can continue shopping around for a home without worrying about the rate changing.</li><li><strong>Choose between an adjustable- and fixed-rate mortgage: </strong>The interest rate type can affect how much you pay over time, so consider your options carefully.</li></ul><p>One other way to compare mortgage rates is with a mortgage calculator. Use a calculator to determine your monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan. Just remember, certain fees like homeowners insurance or taxes might not be included in the calculations.</p><p>Here’s a simple example of what a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might look like versus a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage:</p><h3>15-year fixed-rate</h3><ul><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>$300,000</li><li><strong>Interest rate: </strong>6.29%</li><li><strong>Monthly payment: </strong>$2,579</li><li><strong>Total interest charges: </strong>$164,186</li><li><strong>Total loan amount: </strong>$464,186</li></ul><h3>30-year fixed-rate</h3><ul><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>$300,000</li><li><strong>Interest rate: </strong>6.89%</li><li><strong>Monthly payment: </strong>$1,974</li><li><strong>Total interest charges: </strong>$410,566</li><li><strong>Total loan amount: </strong>$710,565</li></ul><h2><a name="pros-and-cons-of-mortgages" id="pros-and-cons-of-mortgages"></a>Pros and cons of mortgages</h2><p>If you’re thinking about taking out a mortgage, here are some benefits to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Predictable monthly payments: </strong>Fixed-rate mortgage loans come with a set interest rate that doesn’t change over the life of the loan. This means more consistent monthly payments.</li><li><strong>Potentially low interest rates: </strong>With good credit and a high down payment, you could get a competitive interest rate. Adjustable-rate mortgages may also come with a lower initial interest rate than fixed-rate loans.</li><li><strong>Tax benefits: </strong>Having a mortgage could make you eligible for certain tax benefits, such as a <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/mortgage-interest-deduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>mortgage interest deduction</u></a>.</li><li><strong>Potential asset: </strong>Real estate is often considered an asset. As you pay down your loan, you can also build home equity, which you can use for other things like debt consolidation or home improvement projects.</li><li><strong>Credit score boost: </strong>With on-time payments, you can build your credit score.</li></ul><p>And here are some of the biggest downsides of getting a mortgage:</p><ul><li><strong>Expensive fees and interest: </strong>You could end up paying thousands of dollars in interest and other fees over the life of the loan. You will also be responsible for maintenance, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/property-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>property taxes</u></a>, and homeowners insurance.</li><li><strong>Long-term debt: </strong>Taking out a mortgage is a major financial commitment. Typical loan terms are 10, 15, 20, and 30 years.</li><li><strong>Potential rate changes: </strong>If you get an <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/adjustable-rate-mortgage-definition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>adjustable rate</u></a>, the interest rate could increase.</li></ul><h2><a name="how-to-qualify-for-a-mortgage" id="how-to-qualify-for-a-mortgage"></a>How to qualify for a mortgage</h2><p>Requirements vary by lender, but here are the typical steps to qualify for a mortgage:</p><ol><li><strong>Have steady employment and income: </strong>You’ll need to provide proof of income when applying for a home loan. This may include money from your regular job, alimony, military benefits, commissions, or Social Security payments. You may also need to provide proof of at least two years’ worth of employment at your current company.</li><li><strong>Review any assets: </strong>Lenders consider your assets when deciding whether to lend you money. Common assets include money in your bank account or investment accounts.</li><li><strong>Know your DTI: </strong>Your DTI is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward your monthly debts — like installment loans, lines of credit, or rent. The lower your DTI, the better your approval odds.</li><li><strong>Check your credit score: </strong>To get the best mortgage rate possible, you’ll need to have good credit. However, each loan type has a different credit score requirement. For example, you’ll need a credit score of 580 or higher to qualify for an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment.</li><li><strong>Know the property type: </strong>During the loan application process, you may need to specify whether the home you want to buy is your primary residence. Lenders often view a primary residence as less risky, so they may have more lenient requirements than if you were to get a secondary or investment property.</li><li><strong>Choose the loan type: </strong>Many types of mortgage loans exist, including conventional loans, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/va-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>VA loans</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/usda-loans-what-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>USDA loans</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/how-to-use-fha-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>FHA loans</u></a>, and jumbo loans. Consider your options and pick the best one for your needs.</li><li><strong>Prepare for upfront and closing costs: </strong>Depending on the loan type, you may need to make a down payment. The exact amount depends on the loan type and lender. A USDA loan, for example, has no minimum down payment requirement for eligible buyers. With a conventional loan, you’ll need to put down 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI). You may also be responsible for paying any closing costs when signing for the loan.</li></ol><h2><a name="how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage" id="how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage"></a>How to apply for a mortgage</h2><p>Here are the basic steps to apply for a <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/what-is-a-mortgage?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mortgage</a>, and what you can typically expect during the process:</p><ol><li><a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/money/some-of-the-best-mortgage-lenders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Choose a lender</u></strong></a><strong>: </strong>Compare several lenders to see the types of loans they offer, their average mortgage rates, repayment terms, and fees.

<p>Its government is implementing a new six-day work schedule which falls under an employment law titled Law 5053/2023. The law is voluntary for companies to adopt, and the idea is to kick-start the economy in a country that is still emerging from the wreckage of Europe’s worst financial crisis in decades.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 4 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 4 of 4</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>But as several countries and companies globally mull the idea of adopting <a href="/podcasts/2023/5/31/is-the-4-day-week-the-future-of-work">four-day working weeks</a> to improve employees’ quality of life, why is Greece instead adding an additional day?</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-new-law-say">What does the new law say?</h2>
<p>Greece’s new law gives employers in some industries, including businesses that offer 24/7 services, the right to compel employees to work a sixth day in return for an additional 40 percent of their daily wage added to their regular daily wage on the extra working day.</p>
<p>So if a worker’s daily wage is $100, and they previously earned $500 in a week, they could now earn an additional $140, taking their weekly earnings up to $640.</p>
<p>The law is not mandatory. However, if a company does adopt it, it must apply uniformly to all its employees. Additionally, employers, under the law, are required to let their employees know at least 24 hours before any new shift begins, with no additional overtime beyond the eight hours allowed that day.</p>
<p>Employees will also be allowed to have a second part-time job and work up to 13 hours per day in total, allowing them to clock in 65 to 78 working hours per week.</p>
<p>Greece’s food and tourism sectors are not included in the new law, as they have previously been allowed to add a sixth working day, according to the Athens Labour Unions Organization, or EKA.</p>
<p>The policy came into effect on July 1. It was approved last September as part of a range of new labour laws announced by the right-leaning, pro-business government of Kyriakos Mitsotakis.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-greece-s-government-in-favour-of-longer-working-hours">Why is Greece’s government in favour of longer working hours?</h2>
<p>“The nucleus of this legislation is worker-friendly, it is deeply growth-oriented,” Mitsotakis said before the Greek parliament endorsed the law in September 2023.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>The Greek leader said both the country’s ageing population – an issue he described as a “ticking time bomb” – and a dearth of skilled workers have made the new scheme necessary. More than 500,000 Greeks have left the country since 2010, when the country’s debt crisis erupted, according to data from Eurostat.</p>
<p>That continuing crisis, coupled with the effects of Europe’s migration crisis – <a href="/features/2020/3/18/a-journey-through-the-refugee-crisis-on-the-greece-turkey-border">which Greece is deeply mired in</a> – has crippled the country’s economy.</p>
<p>The new policy’s rationale is purely economic, as the aim is to drive up productivity and, therefore, Greece’s gross domestic product (GDP), said Elizabeth Gosme, the director of COFACE Families Europe, a rights-based alliance of organisations.</p>
<p>“From an economic point of view, [the policy] is not completely irrational,” Gosme told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>George Dimitriadis, the youth general secretary of the General Confederation of Greek Workers (GSEE), added that increasing productivity and making Greece more competitive on the global market are the main reasons the government has bucked the global trend towards four-day weeks to adopt the controversial new law.</p>
<p>“[The law] emerged during a period when the government was seeking ways to boost the economy and increase competitiveness,” he told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>The government has also said that establishing formal rules about a six-day working week helps eradicate undeclared work and is meant to increase employees’ income, according to a statement from the country’s Ministry of Labour in June.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-critics-opposed-to-a-six-day-week">Why are critics opposed to a six-day week?</h2>
<h3>Employee wellbeing</h3>
<p>Gosme cautioned that, from a human wellbeing perspective, the new scheme could spell “disaster”.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>Numerous studies have shown that overwork has a detrimental impact on one’s mental health and can often lead to burnout, she said.</p>
<p>According to Eurostat, Greeks already work longer hours than most Europeans.</p>
<p>Unions have been among the most vocal critics of the new policy with thousands of Greek public sector workers, including teachers, doctors and transport staff, having marched in Athens on September 21, 2023, a day before the law passed.</p>
<p>Trains and buses ran reduced services, state hospitals operated with emergency staffing and many schools closed that day as the protesters marched to parliament.</p>
<p>The GSEE said the law would lead to a deterioration of working conditions, increase professional burnout and reduce the quality of life for workers.</p>
<p>“This approach is regressive and does not align with modern trends that promote work-life balance and the improvement of workers’ wellbeing,” Dimitriadis said.</p>
<h3>Economic impact</h3>
<p>“While supporters argue that a six-day work week will increase productivity, the GSEE is concerned that the long-term consequences will be negative, leading to higher healthcare costs and reduced productivity due to burnout,” he added.</p>
<h3>Effect on women</h3>
<p>Moreover, the law will disproportionately affect women, who still take on the burden of childcare in a country that is largely traditional, Gosme said.</p>
<p>“Where do people – especially women – find time for a caring role?” she asked, adding that caregivers often need more flexible work hours.</p>
<p>Without access to professional care services – the situation for most people worldwide, she said – families have to step up, and some people, largely women, “may even be forced to stop working entirely”.</p>
<p>The new law, therefore, impacts not just workers’ wellbeing, but will also affect women’s equality, Gosme said.</p>
<h3>Lack of consultation</h3>
<p>Lawmakers from the main opposition, the left-wing Syriza party, have said the government is pushing “a secret agenda” against workers, while the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), has called the bill “monstrous”.</p>
<p>Workers’ rights campaigners are calling for greater dialogue with the government about this issue.</p>
<p>“The GSEE believes that an open dialogue between the government, employers and workers is essential to finding solutions that promote economic growth without sacrificing workers’ rights and wellbeing,” Dimitriadis said. “They propose alternative policies that enhance productivity through technological upgrades and worker training, rather than through increased working hours.”</p>
<h2 id="which-countries-are-testing-four-day-working-weeks">Which countries are testing four-day working weeks?</h2>
<p>While Greece is forging ahead with a longer working week, the trend elsewhere has been to adopt a shorter, four-day rota.</p>
<p>In 2022, Belgium passed legislation allowing workers to condense their hours into four days instead of five. In April this year, Singapore said workers could request shorter work weeks and more flexible hours.</p>
<p>Additionally, pilot schemes have been trialled in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, South Africa, Canada, Spain, Ireland and Iceland.</p>
<p>In the case of the UK, of the 61 companies who trialled a four-day working week, 54 have continued, with 31 saying they would make the move permanent.</p>
<p>Gosme explained that during the COVID-19 pandemic, many around the globe came to realise the importance of work-life balance, especially as people lost their jobs or were forced to work from home – some for the first time.</p>
<p>Many of the four-day working week trials began shortly after the pandemic, with shorter working weeks viewed as an essential component of moving towards achieving this balance.</p>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<h2 id="what-do-experts-say-about-the-benefits-of-a-four-day-week">What do experts say about the benefits of a four-day week?</h2>
<p>In 2022, one of the world’s largest trials of shorter work schedules showed that workers who put in four days were just as productive as they were over a five-day week.</p>
<p>4 Day Week Global, the nonprofit that ran the trial with 33 companies and more than 900 employees in the US and Ireland, called it a “resounding success on virtually every dimension”.</p>
<p>The nonprofit’s <a href="/news/2023/2/21/four-day-workweek-trial-in-uk-shorter-hours-happier-employees">four-day trial in the UK</a> last year, meanwhile, saw a 71 percent decrease in employee burnout and a 35 percent average increase in revenues.</p>
<p>The organisation’s pilot schemes also showed positive results in non-Western economies, including South Africa and Brazil, where increases in both revenue and employee wellbeing were shown.</p>
<p>Additionally, the World Economic Forum has hosted multiple panels with advocates of the reform. During its annual meeting in Davos last year, Sander van ‘t Noordende, CEO of human resources consulting firm Randstad, said the four-day working week was “a business imperative”.</p>
<h2 id="are-any-other-countries-contemplating-a-six-day-week">Are any other countries contemplating a six-day week?</h2>
<p>Six-day working weeks, meanwhile, have been common for some time within many companies in China, where some employees work under the practice dubbed “996” – working from 9am to 9pm, six days a week. Workers have died as a result of exhaustion from the practice, which is illegal in the country despite being relatively widespread, according to media reports.</p>
<p>Some firms in the US are also transitioning to six-day weeks by 2025, US business magazine Fortune has reported. And tech conglomerate Samsung implemented a new, longer-week schedule for its executives in South Korea in April this year.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Paris Olympics are causing a decline in revenue for two airlines, Air France-KLM Group and Delta Air Lines, due to lower demand for flights to and from Paris during the Olympic period.</li>
<li>Air France-KLM Group estimates the impact on its unit revenue from June to August to be between $174.5 million to $196.3 million (€160 million to €180 million), while Delta reports a $100 million impact on travel to Paris during the same period.</li>
<li>The airlines attribute the decline in demand to both international and domestic travelers seeking to avoid Paris during the Olympic period, which is expected to normalize after the events are over.</li>
<li>Air France-KLM Group projects that demand will return to normal from late August onward, while Delta has not provided a specific timeframe for when demand is expected to recover.</li>
<li>The Paris Olympics are set to take place from July 26 to August 11, with the opening ceremony scheduled for July 26.</li>

<p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     ">
	In a much-expected revolt over treatment of minority investors, billionaire money manager Mario Gabelli on Friday filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court for access to Paramount’s books. The legal move could be a precursor to a lawsuit challenging the potential deal that some investors believe enriches controlling shareholder Shari Redstone at their expense.

</p>



<p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     ">
	As part of the merger, class A shareholders will receive $23 per share, while class B shareholders will receive $15 per share.

	</p>


<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     ">
	Gabelli seeks information related to whether Redstone, who owns both voting and nonvoting shares, will get more money for her Class B shares than others, he <a href="https://puck.news/newsletter_content/sun-valley-politics-a-paramount-scoop-thiel-hoffman-scream-therapy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">told <em>Puck</em></a>. “I got to represent all investors here,” he said. Gabelli expressed that doesn’t have an issue with Redstone cashing out her class A shares at a premium</p>



<p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     ">
	Multiple law firms, including Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP, have announced investigations into whether the board of directors for Paramount Global and National Amusements may have breached their fiduciary duties to minority investors.

<p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     ">
	The lawsuit from Gabelli, the largest holder of nonvoting shares, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/shari-redstone-lawsuit-shareholders-paramount-investors-1235890134/">follows</a> a Paramount investor in April filing a similar action to force the company to turn over records related to talks with David Ellison’s Skydance. The Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island alleged that Redstone has “conflicting interests” undermining the company’s motives to find a better deal than the one offered by Skydance.</p>

<li>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been reiterating the need for more data to decide on interest rate cuts, but his recent comments on the cooling labor market have been interpreted as a sign that rate cuts may be imminent.</li>
<li>The latest inflation data, released on Thursday, showed a drop in inflation for the first time since 2020, which has been seen as encouraging news and has increased the likelihood of a rate cut in September.</li>
<li>Markets are now pricing in an 84% chance of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, up from 73% the day before, according to CME FedWatch.</li>
<li>Many market strategists, including Lazard's Ron Temple, believe that a rate cut in September is likely and that the Fed should focus on stimulating economic growth and employment.</li>
<li>The cooling labor market and slowing economic growth have added to the case for a rate cut, with some arguing that the Fed should now prioritize easing monetary policy to support the economy.</li>
