    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is set to reinstate pre-pandemic regulations requiring banks to regularly inspect employees' home offices and register them with regulators.</li>
<li>Some major banks, including Citigroup, Barclays, and HSBC, have decided not to comply with the new regulations and are instead requiring thousands of employees to return to the office five days a week.</li>
<li>Citigroup is requiring 600 employees to come into the office five days a week, while Barclays is bringing back thousands of its investment banking employees worldwide.</li>
<li>HSBC's US and Americas operations are considering requiring 530 New York-based employees to come into the office five days a week.</li>
<li>The banks' decisions to bring employees back to the office are likely motivated by a desire to avoid the effort and cost of complying with the new regulations, rather than a preference for in-person work.</li>

    <div><p>Work from home regulations for banks are changing, and some of the industry’s biggest players would rather bring employees in <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/11/remote-work-return-to-office-miami-new-york-wall-street-80-percent/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/11/remote-work-return-to-office-miami-new-york-wall-street-80-percent/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">five days a week</a> than make the effort to comply—including making regular inspections of workers’ homes.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>During the pandemic, brokerage industry watchdog the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), suspended rules on workplace inspections to make it easier for banks to allow their employees to work from home. The agency is now set to move back to its pre-pandemic requirements for monitoring workplaces, meaning some home offices will have to be registered with regulators and remotely inspected at least every three years under a new pilot program.</p>



<p>Now, some of the banks that had been most flexible with their work from home policies, including <a href="https://fortune.com/company/citigroup/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/citigroup/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Citigroup</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/barclays/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/barclays/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Barclays</a>, and HSBC, have decided complying with the renewed rules isn’t worth the effort, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-23/citi-hsbc-order-more-staff-to-work-in-offices-five-days-a-week?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;sref=2jPYL79S" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-23/citi-hsbc-order-more-staff-to-work-in-offices-five-days-a-week?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;sref=2jPYL79S" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">reported</a>. Between them, the three banks are bringing thousands of their workers back to the office five days a week.</p>



<p>Citigroup said on Thursday that it is requiring 600 employees previously eligible to work from home to come into the office five days a week, although it said in a statement that most of its staff can still work remotely two days a week, per the outlet. Barclays cited “new regulatory policies” in a Thursday memo as part of why it is bringing thousands of its investment banking employees worldwide back to five days a week in-person. And 530 of HSBC’s New York workers may need to change their remote work habits soon as well, Mabel Rius, the head of human resources for the US and Americas told Bloomberg. </p>



<p>Michael Roberts, HSBC CEO of the US and Americas, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-05-23/hsbc-won-t-force-workers-back-to-office-five-days-a-week?sref=2jPYL79S" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-05-23/hsbc-won-t-force-workers-back-to-office-five-days-a-week?sref=2jPYL79S" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">told Bloomberg</a> that, while the bank will comply with the FINRA regulations, he wants employees to want to come back to the office. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“What we did not want to do is to force people to come back simply out of decree,” Roberts told Bloomberg in a Thursday interview.</p>



<p>Part of enticing workers to work in person means listening to why employees like coming to the office at all. Roberts said the bank has incorporated much of that input at its <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240524327/hsbcs-new-offices-are-coaxing-hybrid-workers-into-the-office-more-frequently#:~:text=%22This%20is%20a%20place%20where,Yards%20development%20in%20Midtown%20Manhattan." target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240524327/hsbcs-new-offices-are-coaxing-hybrid-workers-into-the-office-more-frequently#:~:text=%22This%20is%20a%20place%20where,Yards%20development%20in%20Midtown%20Manhattan." rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">new U.S. headquarters</a> in New York City’s Hudson Yards, to make it “conducive to people coming back.”</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>“We will adjust to the FINRA rules, we’ll make sure that whoever needs to be there five days a week will be here five days a week, but I don’t want to decree people coming back,” Roberts said. “I want them to come back because they want to come back.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, some of the industry’s other giants, including <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/25/bank-of-america-threatening-workers-return-to-office-disciplinary-action/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/01/25/bank-of-america-threatening-workers-return-to-office-disciplinary-action/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Bank of America</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/01/13/goldman-sachs-employees-back-in-the-office-one-year-later/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs'%20CEO%20called%20on,still%20aren't%20showing%20up&amp;text=Nearly%20a%20year%20after%20CEO,points%20below%20pre%2Dpandemic%20levels." target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/01/13/goldman-sachs-employees-back-in-the-office-one-year-later/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs'%20CEO%20called%20on,still%20aren't%20showing%20up&amp;text=Nearly%20a%20year%20after%20CEO,points%20below%20pre%2Dpandemic%20levels." class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Goldman Sachs</a>, have already handed down mandates for five day in-person weeks. </p>



<p>And <a href="https://fortune.com/company/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/jpmorgan-chase/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">JPMorgan Chase</a> CEO Jamie Dimon, perhaps the best-known CEO on Wall Street, has <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/01/20/jamie-dimon-davos-remote-work-managers-young-workers-women/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/01/20/jamie-dimon-davos-remote-work-managers-young-workers-women/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">long been</a> <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/28/jamie-dimon-says-remote-works-can-go-elsewhere/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/04/28/jamie-dimon-says-remote-works-can-go-elsewhere/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">critical of remote work</a>. Last year, the bank instituted mandatory return-to-office policies for senior employees, and Dimon said earlier this year that about 60% of the bank’s workers were onsite full-time. </p>



<p>FINRA, for its part, disputed that its renewed policies were to blame for stricter work from home policies by banks. In a Wednesday <a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2024/finra-statement-correct-misinformation-about-new-residential" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2024/finra-statement-correct-misinformation-about-new-residential" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">statement</a> the regulator said that some of its rules weren’t any stricter than they were prior to the pandemic, and that, in fact, it adjusted some rules, including allowing remote workplace inspections. Those changes “provide member firms greater flexibility — not less — to allow eligible registered persons to work from home,” FINRA said. </p>



<p>“FINRA has seen recent statements from firms stating that new, stringent rules from FINRA will require them to bring their workforce back to the office full time,” it wrote in the statement. “This is incorrect.”</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

Capital One will retain ownership and servicing of the credit card accounts.</p>    
  <p>Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart partnered with Capital One in 2019 after ending its previous credit card deal with Synchrony Financial. The rewards card was co-branded and offered rewards like cash back on in-store purchases and online orders set for pickup or delivery, according to a <a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/walmart-credit-card/632402" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">website for the program</a>. The deal was set to run through 2026. </p><p>But Walmart eventually soured on Capital One. In 2023, <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/walmart-sues-capital-one-lawsuit-credit-card/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Walmart sued the McLean, Virginia-based company</a></span>, saying it wanted to terminate the agreement because Capital One was taking too long to process payments and mail replacement cards. The lawsuit also said Capital One "admitted" it had failed to meet some of Walmart's service standards. Capital One said the service issues did not constitute grounds for the partnership to end, and said Walmart was attempting to "end the deal early." </p>

<p>A federal judge ruled in Walmart's favor in March.</p><p>In a government filing Friday, Capital One said there are approximately $8.5 billion in loans in the existing Walmart credit card portfolio.</p><p>It's not yet clear when Walmart might name a new banking partner.

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Thai Union Group became Red Lobster's leading shareholder</strong>: In 2020, Thai Union Group, a seafood conglomerate, gained 49% control of Red Lobster, a seafood restaurant chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assurances to employees</strong>: When Thai Union Group took control, Red Lobster employees were assured that Thai Union would not interfere in key decisions, as outlined in a document titled "Seafood Supplier Talking Points".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial pledges</strong>: According to the document, Thai Union intended to maintain relationships with all current seafood suppliers and not be involved in Red Lobster's day-to-day operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Withdrawal of pledges</strong>: However, by 2022, representatives from Thai Union in Thailand were embedded in Red Lobster's headquarters, holding top roles and closely directing the company.</p>
</li>
<li>

<li><strong>Resilient homes are the key</strong>: Real-estate developer Marshall Gobuty believes that building "over code" and incorporating new technologies is the solution to withstand natural disasters and insurance challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Hunters Point, a model for resilience</strong>: Gobuty's 86-unit community in Cortez, Florida, was built with features such as ground-floor flood vents and full-home metal strappings that made it stand out from other buildings. Despite Hurricanes, the homes produced more energy than they consumed.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance coverage despite challenges</strong>: Despite the insurance carrier initially refusing to renew policies, Gobuty was able to secure coverage by showing the detailed construction of the homes. This success story may inspire other builders to take a similar approach.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance crisis in Florida</strong>: Due to climate change, major insurers have fled Florida, and over a dozen insurance companies have stopped issuing new policies or withdrawn from the state. The state-backed Citizens Property Insurance Corporation is now the top underwriter.</li>
<li><strong>Innovative building practices are crucial</strong>: The success of Hunters Point demonstrates the importance of innovative building practices that prioritize resilience and sustainability. As the climate continues to change, such approaches may become increasingly relevant for builders and policymakers.</li>

<p>While gold’s very near-term outlook appears neutral to slightly bearish, we will need to reassess this view late in the upcoming week when fresh core personal consumption expenditures price data, the Fed's preferred <a href="https://www.dailyfx.com/topics/inflation" title="inflation">inflation</a> measure, is released. Consensus estimates indicate that the underlying PCE deflator advanced 0.3% in April, bringing the annual reading down to 2.7% from 2.8% previously, a small step in the right direction and welcome news for policymakers.</p><p>For gold to reverse course and resume its upward trend, bulls need to see the core PCE report surprise to the downside. Such an outcome could reignite optimism that the disinflationary trend, which began in late 2023 but stalled earlier this year, is back on track, strengthening the argument for the Federal Reserve to start dialing back on policy restraint early in the fall. As it stands, there is about a 45% chance of a 25-bps <a href="https://www.dailyfx.com/topics/monetary-policy" title="rate cut">rate cut</a> occurring at the September <a href="https://www.dailyfx.com/fomc" title="FOMC">FOMC</a> meeting.</p><p><span class="dfx-text-bold dfx-text-italic">Wondering how retail positioning can shape gold prices in the near term?

With bearish momentum seemingly accelerating, sellers could soon make a move on the 50-day SMA at $2,310. On further weakness, the focus will be on the psychological $2,300 threshold, followed by $2,280, May’s swing low.</p><p>In case of a market rebound, resistance could manifest near the $2,375 zone. Surmounting this technical ceiling could prove challenging, yet a breakout could encourage buyers to launch an assault on $2,420.

<li><strong>Shield Blood Test</strong>: The Shield blood test is already commercially available, but FDA approval would broaden availability and coverage as another screening option for people aged 45 and older at average risk.</li>
<li><strong>FDA Approval Timeline</strong>: Guardant Health, the company that makes Shield, expects the FDA to decide on premarket approval later in 2024. FDA approval is not guaranteed, but advisors often agree with the FDA's decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Early Detection</strong>: Colorectal cancer can be found through screening tests, which can detect polyps and cancer early, when they are more treatable. Regular screening can help prevent cancer from developing or detect it at an early stage, when it is more curable.</li>

During this procedure, a doctor inserts a colonoscope -- a long, thin and flexible tube with a camera on the end -- through the anus to examine the rectum and colon. Your doctor may biopsy any suspicious-looking tissues or polyps.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Additionally, stool tests can be performed to look for blood not visible to the naked eye, which is possibly a sign of cancer, according to the <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging.html" target="_blank">ACS</a>.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The United States Preventative Services Task Force currently <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/colorectal-cancer-screening" target="_blank">recommends</a> adults aged 45 and older with average risk to be screened for colorectal cancer. This includes a stool test every one to three years or a colonoscopy every 10 years for people that do not have symptoms.</p><h2 class="RxNCg PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq">How does Shield work?</h2><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Shield detects colorectal cancer by detecting DNA shed by tumors in blood samples. Results takes about two weeks after the samples are received by the laboratory.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In clinical trial data, published in <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2304714" target="_blank">The New England Journal of Medicine</a>, Shield was found to have a 83.1% sensitivity rate, meaning 91% of patients with colorectal cancer detected by a colonoscopy tested positive on the Shield blood test. It also had an 89.9% specificity rate, meaning 89.9% of patients without cancer tested negative on the blood test.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">During the FDA advisory panel meeting, eight of the FDA independent advisers voted yes and one voted no on safety. On efficacy, six voted yes and three voted no. On benefits outweighing risks, seven voted yes and two voted no.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The company says the blood test will help eliminate barriers linked to current screening methods such as colonoscopies or stool-based tests, which can be time-consuming or difficult to complete.
