While most of the 11 workers acknowledged that the deal made sense for Pfizer’s growth, they said the hefty price tag at a time when Covid sales had already started to decline left them uneasy.</p><p>Still, a few former employees said they felt blindsided by the company’s decision to let go of staff, saying they were relatively optimistic about the business before the October cost-cut announcement. </p><p>One former employee who worked at a site focused on gene therapies in <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-invests-685-million-new-state-art-facility-durham" target="_blank">Durham, North Carolina</a>, said they were repeatedly told their job would be safe — even as Pfizer divested much of its early stage portfolio for those treatments at the start of 2023.

While some workers were asked to come in only two or three days a week, even that was impossible for staff members who lived too far from their sites, according to the employees.</p><p>Some remote workers who did not comply over time were let go, the current and former employees said.

The company first announced those plans in 2021. Pfizer told news outlets that the majority of employees would be relocated to its headquarters in New York City. </p><p>For one employee, a 15-minute commute to work became closer to an hour-and-a-half trip.</p><p>During another town hall, on Oct. 26, Pfizer Chief Global Supply Officer Mike McDermott said the decision to close the Peapack site “wasn’t made lightly.” But he said having Peapack employees work in person at the company’s headquarters was “right for Pfizer’s culture,” according to a recording heard by CNBC. </p><p>He said the company isn’t taking away remote work as an option. Pfizer leadership has been vocal about asking employees to work in person again. </p><p>“Teleconferencing is simply no substitute for the personal interaction that makes it possible to share ideas, build connection, or even agree to disagree,” Bourla said during the <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/announcements/pfizer-ceo-albert-bourla-discusses-curing-epidemic-exclusion-apec-ceo-summit" target="_blank">APEC CEO Summit</a> in November. </p><p>Pfizer is just one of several companies across different industries to push for in-person work again after the pandemic.

A few workers said they struggled to keep up with abrupt internal changes, such as being assigned to new managers or being moved onto different teams.</p><p>Some current employees said Pfizer has held several so-called transparency meetings, which allow workers to anonymously ask questions and provide feedback to<strong> </strong>senior leadership.</p><p>Faith in executive leadership also plunged among some workers, according to most of the current and former employees who spoke with CNBC.</p><p>Some employees acknowledged that executives have a duty to care about their company’s stock price but said that Bourla and other officials appeared to be hyper-focused on Pfizer shares even as people lost their jobs.</p><p>Some current workers said that hasn’t appeared to change after the town hall on May 2. Others said Bourla’s remarks were encouraging and sounded far more genuine.</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107366268" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">People pass by the Pfizer headquarters building on January 29, 2023 in New York City. </p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Kena Betacur | Corbis News | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>Some employees also said they feel uncertain about how the company’s business will perform moving forward.</p><p>One current worker called it “reassuring” to see Pfizer report positive first-quarter results but noted that it does not “guarantee smooth sailing” ahead for the business and employees.</p><p>Pfizer’s rebound partly hinges on how its once-daily version of danuglipron performs in an early clinical trial this year. It will also heavily depend on the commercial success of Seagen’s pipeline of cancer drugs, though it will likely take several years before Pfizer sees big returns from those products.</p><p>During the May 2 town hall, Bourla said he could tell that morale was down toward the end of 2023. </p><p>“I could feel that people were affected,” he said, according to the recording heard by CNBC. “Because we were at the top of the pyramid, we were at the top of our all-time reputation, of our all-time recognition from the world. And suddenly within six months, we started feeling that people are questioning that. That is not something that we like, and it’s not something that we feel good about.”</p><p>But Bourla congratulated employees for delivering a strong first quarter. He cautioned that the company isn’t “out of the woods yet” but said it is starting to head in a positive direction. </p><p>“There will be hiccups, ups and downs in our way. But the direction I’m very confident is going to be upwards. I’m sure that sooner rather than later, we will all feel the pride that we were feeling in years ’20, ’21, ‘22 and ’23, the first six months,” Bourla said. </p></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

It provides car dealerships with software to handle operations like financing, inventory, back office, payroll and more. CDK’s services are used by over 15,000 car dealerships across North America. The company also employs thousands of people.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</strong></a></p><h2><strong>Timeline of the attacks</strong></h2><p>Cybercriminals targeted CDK twice. The first attack occurred this month, and while CDK Global didn’t reveal details, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cdk-global-hacked-again-while-recovering-from-first-cyberattack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Bleeping Computer</u></a> reported it was related to the company’s always-on VPN.</p><p>Car dealerships use a special kind of VPN connection that's always on to connect to CDK's data centers. This lets their dealership software, installed on their computers, access CDK's platform. Since the CDK software has permission to update itself (like admin privileges) automatically, it makes sense why CDK recommended disconnecting from their data centers during the security incident.</p><p>CDK reported restoring some services on June 20 and told CyberGuy that its systems were again offline due to another cyberattack.</p><p>"Late in the evening of June 19, we experienced an additional cyberincident and proactively shut down most of our systems. In partnership with third-party experts, we are assessing the impact and providing regular updates to our customers," said Lisa Finney, senior external communications manager at CDK Global.</p><p>"We remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible," Finney added.</p><p>CDK Global announced on June 24 that the breach was, in fact, a ransomware attack, meaning the company’s systems won’t be back online until it pays the hackers a ransom. CDK’s software remains down as of this writing, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/cdk-dealer-software-unlikely-be-restored-before-june-end-memo-says-2024-06-25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Reuters reported</u></a> that it won’t be back online until the end of June. </p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-24/blacksuit-cybercrime-gang-blamed-in-major-cdk-ransomware-attack" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg reported</a> that a hacking group called BlackSuit is behind the cyberattack on CDK Global, demanding an extortion fee of tens of millions of dollars.</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>BMW sales car lot</span> <span>(Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson)</span></p></div></div></div><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/pharma-giants-data-breach-exposes-patients-sensitive-information/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong><u>PHARMA GIANT’S DATA BREACH EXPOSES PATIENTS’ SENSITIVE INFORMATION</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>How are dealerships responding?</strong></h2><p>Car dealerships across the U.S. are feeling the pinch from the CDK cyberattack. But some dealerships are showing their resourcefulness. Employees are taking to social media, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/1djl7iy/comment/l9blify/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">like Reddit</a>, to share how they're keeping things going with spreadsheets and sticky notes. This allows them to handle smaller sales and repairs, but for now, bigger transactions are on hold.</p><p>Big names like Honda, Toyota and Hyundai are closely monitoring the situation to see how badly the outage is hurting dealerships. Honda even went further, telling affected dealerships to use alternative tools and processes to keep business running smoothly while CDK gets its systems back online.</p><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/mobile/massive-free-vpn-data-breach-exposes-360-million-records/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong><u>MASSIVE FREE VPN DATA BREACH EXPOSES 360 MILLION RECORDS</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>How does the CDK cyberattack impact you?</strong></h2><p>Car dealerships rely on CDK's software to manage various aspects of their operations, including financing and inventory management. When these systems are down, it can delay the process of purchasing a car, affecting those who are in the market for a new vehicle.</p><p>If you’re seeking services from dealerships, such as maintenance or repairs, you may experience delays or disruptions because the dealership's management systems are offline. CDK's software also helps dealerships manage financing and leasing agreements. The cyberattack has disrupted these processes, leading to delays in securing loans or leases for customers.</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Toyota dealership</span> <span>(Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson)</span></p></div></div></div><p><a href="https://cyberguy.com/privacy/ticketmaster-data-breach-exposes-560-million-customers-data-says-it-group/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong><u>TICKETMASTER DATA BREACH EXPOSES 560 MILLION CUSTOMERS’ DATA SAYS IT GROUP</u></strong></a></p><h2><strong>Cybersecurity lessons you can learn from the CDK global attack</strong></h2><p>The CDK Global cyberattack serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in our digital world and the far-reaching consequences of such breaches. This incident underscores several key security considerations you should take into account:</p><h3><strong>1. Ransomware awareness and prevention</strong></h3><p>The revelation that the attack involved <a href="https://cyberguy.com/privacy/ransomware-reality-check-as-us-is-top-target-of-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ransomware</a> highlights the ongoing threat posed by this type of malware. It's a reminder that you need to be vigilant about the security of your personal devices. Here are some steps you can take:</p><p><strong>Regular backups:</strong> Ensure that you regularly back up important data to an <a href="https://cyberguy.com/kurts-picks/best-external-hard-drives/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>external hard drive</u></a> or a <a href="https://cyberguy.com/kurts-picks/space-running-low-securely-store-heavy-files-free-cloud-storage-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>secure cloud service</u></a>. This can help you recover your data without paying a ransom if your device is compromised.</p><p><strong>Update software:</strong> Keep your operating system, antivirus software and all applications <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/how-to-update-your-devices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>up to date</u></a> to protect against known vulnerabilities.</p><p><strong>Email caution:</strong> Be wary of <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/outsmart-spammers-to-finally-end-unsolicited-emails/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>unsolicited emails</u></a>, especially those with attachments or links. <a href="https://cyberguy.com/privacy/dont-fall-for-these-7-fake-phishing-emails/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Phishing emails</u></a> are a common method for delivering ransomware. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any phishing emails or ransomware scams. <a href="https://cyberguy.com/security/best-antivirus-protection/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices</u></a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE U.S. NEWS</strong></a></p><h3><strong>2. Strong authentication and access controls</strong></h3><p>While the CDK attack involved always-on VPN connections, the principle of strong authentication applies to you as well. Protect your accounts with:</p><p><strong>Two-factor authentication (2FA):</strong> Enable <a href="https://cyberguy.com/how-to/what-is-two-factor-authentication-and-why-should-i-enable-it/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>2FA</u></a> on all accounts that offer it. This adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password.</p><p><strong>Unique passwords:</strong> Use unique, complex passwords for different accounts. Consider using a <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/best-password-managers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>password manager</u></a> to keep track of them.</p><h3><strong>3. Incident response and personal data protection</strong></h3><p>The prolonged outage and its impact on dealership operations underscore the need for you to have your own incident response plan:</p><p><strong>Know your recovery steps:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the steps to take if your device is compromised, such as disconnecting from the internet, <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/how-to-install-antivirus-software-onto-your-devices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>running antivirus scans</u></a> and <a href="https://cyberguy.com/tech-tips-tricks/how-to-back-up-and-restore-your-mobile-device/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>restoring from backups</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Protect personal information:</strong> Be cautious about sharing personal information online. Use privacy settings on social media and be mindful of the data you share with various services.</p><h3><strong>4. Regular security audits</strong></h3><p>Just as businesses need to assess their security regularly, you should also:</p><p><strong>Review account activity:</strong> Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorized transactions.</p><p><strong>Security settings:</strong> Periodically review and update the security settings on your devices and online accounts.</p><p>By taking these proactive steps, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to cyberattacks. The CDK Global incident serves as a powerful reminder that cybersecurity is not just a concern for businesses but for you and everyone in our increasingly digital world.</p><h2><strong>Kurt’s key takeaways</strong></h2><p>When a company of CDK’s scale is affected by a ransomware attack, it disrupts the whole market, which is something we are witnessing right now. Many dealerships in the U.S. use CDK Global’s software, meaning their business is paralyzed unless they can find another alternative. The company should work on tightening its security systems and hurry to deal with cybercriminals to minimize the losses suffered by dealerships.</p><p><a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p><p>What role should government and regulatory bodies play in supporting businesses affected by ransomware attacks?

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nokia has agreed to acquire US optical networking gear maker Infinera in a $2.3 billion deal, which will help the company gain from the billions of dollars being invested in data centers to support the growth of artificial intelligence (AI).</li>
<li>The deal will make Nokia the second-largest vendor in the optical networking market, with a 20% share, behind Huawei, which has a significant presence in China.</li>
<li>The acquisition will allow Nokia to sell equipment to big tech companies such as Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft as they build new data centers to support the AI boom.</li>
<li>The deal is seen as a strategic move by Nokia to diversify its markets and move into growing areas such as AI, as the telecom equipment market is experiencing lower sales of 5G equipment.</li>
<li>Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark believes that the deal is well-timed, as the market is expected to start recovering, and AI is driving significant investments in data centers, making this acquisition a significant attraction for the company.</li>

<p><span>A month ago, <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/how-a-falling-yen-could-fuel-a-crypto-market-boom-per-arthur-hayes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Arthur Hayes</a>, founder of BitMEX exchange, expressed optimism about the weakening Japanese Yen (JPY), seeing it as a potential catalyst to inject liquidity and boost <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/bitcoin-price-prediction" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin [BTC]</a> and the broader crypto market. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Yen falls to historic low against USD</strong></h2>
<p><span>Fast forward, as of 26th June, the JPY reached its lowest point against the U.S. dollar, marking the lowest in nearly 38 years. This prompted speculation about potential interventions by authorities in the currency markets. </span></p>
<p><span>Many attribute this to the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain high interest rates, which has resulted in the JPY ranking among the world’s poorest-performing currencies.</span></p>
<p><span>Remarking on the same and echoing Hayes’ views, <a href="https://x.com/BTC_for_Freedom/status/1806246499002589653" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">The Bitcoin Therapist</a> said, </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“Is Japan printing Yen to secretly buy #bitcoin? If so it would be the smartest move in the history of Japan. If not they will become a third world country really soon.” </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>According to data from FactSet, the Yen weakened to 160.82 against the dollar, surpassing the previous record of 160.03 set on 29th April, and marking its weakest level since 1986.</span></p>
<p><span>Adding further to this data set, <a href="https://x.com/jsblokland/status/1806048628990988789" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Jeroen Blokland</a>, Founder &amp; manager of the Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund noted, </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“Over the last 12.5 years, the Japanese #Yen has lost a whopping 53% of its value against the US Dollar!” </span></p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>A good sign for Bitcoin?</strong></h2>
<p><span>But despite this Hayes sees that a weakening Yen might trigger competitive currency actions among major economies, such as Japan and China, potentially leading to currency devaluations and increased liquidity injections (printing money).</span></p>
<p><span>This implies that Bitcoin, which is perceived as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation, <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-amidst-japanese-yen-crisis-nothing-stops-this-train/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">could benefit</a> from these macroeconomic conditions. </span></p>
<p><span>Hayes anticipates that <a href="https://cryptohayes.substack.com/p/the-easy-button" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Bitcoin would perform well</a> in such a scenario, highlighting it as a resilient asset amidst global fiat currency instability. </span></p>
<p><span>Hence, Hayes best put it when he said, </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“Crypto booms, as there is more dollar and yuan liquidity floating in the system.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Meanwhile, as the Yen faced bearish pressure, BTC appreciated by 0.56%, reaching a trading price of $62,130.05. </span></p>
<p><span>However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), significantly below the neutral level, indicated a strong bearish sentiment. But, i</span><span>f Bitcoin manages to surpass the resistance level at $64,817, it could signal a potential shift into a bullish phase.</span></p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Electric vehicles (EVs) are often touted as requiring less maintenance than traditional gas-powered vehicles, with fewer moving parts and no oil changes. However, the article suggests that this may not be entirely accurate.</li>
<li>Despite being touted as low-maintenance, EVs are essentially "giant computers on wheels" that can still have problems.</li>
<li>A recent quality study by JD Power found that battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles performed worse than their gas equivalents in several repair categories.</li>
<li>According to the study, owners of internal combustion vehicles reported having 180 problems per 100 vehicles (PP100), while owners of EVs reported having 266 PP100.</li>
<li>The study's findings suggest that the increased complexity of EVs, along with the need for new technologies and software updates, may contribute to higher rates of problems and malfunctions.</li>

<p>On average, State Farm General is hoping to raise rates 30% for homeowners, 36% for condo owners and 52% for renters, according to the<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/state-farm-insurance-rates-19544180.php" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/state-farm-insurance-rates-19544180.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> San Francisco Chronicle.</a></p>





<p>“State Farm General’s latest rate filings raise serious questions about its financial condition,” Ricardo Lara, California’s insurance commissioner, told the<a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-06-28/state-farm-insurance-rate-increase" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-06-28/state-farm-insurance-rate-increase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Los Angeles Times</a> in a statement. “This has the potential to affect millions of California consumers and the integrity of our residential property insurance market.” </p>



<p>Lara also told the Times that his department would use all of its “investigatory tools to get to the bottom of State Farm’s financial situation.”</p>



<p>KTLA couldn’t access the documents due to website maintenance.</p>





<p>“State Farm General Insurance Company (‘State Farm General’) is working toward its long-term sustainability in California. Rate changes are driven by increased costs and risk and are necessary for State Farm General to deliver on the promises the company makes every day to its customers,” Gina Morss-Fischer, a company spokesperson, said in a statement.</p>



<p>“We continue to look for ways to maintain competitive rates and help our customers manage their risk. Rate filings are not final until approved by the California Department of Insurance. Customers with questions are encouraged to speak with their local State Farm agent.”</p>





<p>The potential rate increases from State Farm comes after the company <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/state-farm-to-non-renew-72000-policies-in-california-these-zip-codes-will-be-impacted-the-most/" data-type="link" data-id="https://ktla.com/news/california/state-farm-to-non-renew-72000-policies-in-california-these-zip-codes-will-be-impacted-the-most/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in March plans to non-renew 72,000 policies </a>in California. </p>



<p>Last year, the company announced it would <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/state-farm-to-stop-accepting-new-property-insurance-policies/" data-type="link" data-id="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/state-farm-to-stop-accepting-new-property-insurance-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stop accepting new insurance applications for all business and personal property in California.</a></p>





<p>Since then, other <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/allstate-quietly-stopped-accepting-new-insurance-applications-from-california-homeowners/" data-type="link" data-id="https://ktla.com/news/california/allstate-quietly-stopped-accepting-new-insurance-applications-from-california-homeowners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companies like Allstate</a> have announced similar moves.</p>

<li><strong>Nike's analysts' rating drops to a 6-year low</strong>: The consensus rating of Nike's stock has fallen to 3.8 out of 5, its lowest level since 2017, as analysts have become less bullish on the company's prospects.</li>

<li><strong>Nike's guidance has been lowered</strong>: The company's management has warned of a slower year ahead, which has led to a reduction in revenue and profit expectations. This has caused some analysts to become more cautious about the stock's prospects.</li>
<li><strong>Rivals like Adidas are gaining market share</strong>: Nike's competitors, such as Adidas and others, are gaining popularity among consumers, which is contributing to Nike's struggles. This has led some analysts to question whether Nike can regain its footing.</li>
<li><strong>Some analysts remain optimistic</strong>: Despite the negative sentiment, some analysts, such as Bank of America's Lorraine Hutchinson, remain bullish on Nike's prospects and believe the company can still deliver if it can successfully launch new products and navigate challenging macroeconomic conditions.</li>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street is the least bullish it’s been on Nike Inc. shares since 2017 after the sportswear firm’s warning of a slower year ahead spurred a flurry of analysts to remove their buy calls from the stock.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>The sneaker maker has been losing ground to competition from rivals like Adidas AG and its disappointing outlook led at least seven brokers, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Morgan Stanley and UBS Group AG, to drop their once bullish positions and move to the sidelines. Nike’s consensus rating — a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold and sell recommendations — fell to 3.8 out of five on Friday, a more than six-year low.</p><p>Fundamental trends at Nike are “much worse than we realized,” UBS analyst Jay Sole wrote in a note Friday as he downgraded his recommendation on the stock to neutral from buy. “Its lifestyle business needs a major reset.”</p><p>Nike was once a favorite among Wall Street analysts, but in recent months the world’s largest sportswear company has lost fans as competitors like On Holding AG, Deckers Outdoor Corp.’s Hoka and Adidas have taken market share by appealing to consumers with innovative new styles. Last week, Williams Trading’s Sam Poser put out an early warning, telling investors to “sell the stock,” with a turnaround unlikely before 2026, if at all.</p><p>Wall Street piled on the downgrades Friday with Morgan Stanley’s Alex Straton cutting Nike to equal-weight. A disappointing set of earnings and reduced outlook pushed her prior overweight thesis — reliant on revenue growth and profit-and-loss improvement in the second half of fiscal 2025 — “out of view.”</p><p>Shares plunged 20%, their biggest one-day drop on record, to close at $75.37. Nike now has 21 buy-equivalent recommendations, 20 holds and three sells among analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The average price target is $95.</p><p>With prospects for growth inflection pushed further out, investors are being asked to “both underwrite success of not yet proven styles and look across an uncertain consumer discretionary backdrop,” Stifel’s Jim Duffy wrote in his downgrade note cutting Nike to hold from buy.</p><p>Still, many are sticking to their buy calls. Bank of America Corp. analyst Lorraine Hutchinson, who upgraded her recommendation on the stock to buy in April, said the guidance reset was bigger than expected but she sees the new estimates as achievable and they “could prove conservative if the innovation ramps quickly to offset the lifestyle challenges.”</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="20"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>For now, a combination of increasingly difficult macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable channel mix, and volatility in China is weighing on the minds of many analysts, including Raymond James’ Rick Patel. He cut his rating to market perform from outperform, writing he did not have confidence in there being upside to revenue.</p><p>The update “raised more questions and more uncertainty about the long-term health of the Nike brand,” according to Barclays Plc analyst Adrienne Yih. She downgraded shares to equal weight from overweight and expects to stay on the sidelines until she sees greater evidence that the company’s strategic initiatives are driving renewed sales growth.</p><p>--With assistance from Katrina Compoli and Michael Msika.</p><p>(Updates stock move in sixth paragraph.)</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

    <div><div class="field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body"><p>A federal grand jury in the District of Maryland returned an indictment yesterday charging a Pennsylvania man for defrauding the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) of approximately $16 million in federal grant funds.</p>

<p>According to court documents, Hoau-Yan Wang, 67, was a tenured medical professor at a public university’s medical school, as well as a paid advisor and consultant to a publicly traded Texas biopharmaceutical company. From approximately May 2015 through approximately April 2023, Wang allegedly engaged in a scheme to fabricate and falsify scientific data in grant applications made to the NIH on behalf of himself and the biopharmaceutical company. As alleged, the fraudulent grant applications to the NIH sought funding for scientific research of a potential treatment and diagnostic test for Alzheimer’s disease and resulted in the award of approximately $16 million in grants from approximately 2017 to 2021, part of which funded Wang’s laboratory work and salary. </p>

<p>The indictment alleges that Wang’s work under these grants was related to the early developmental phases of the proposed drug and diagnostic test, typically referred to by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as Phase 1 and Phase 2. Wang’s alleged scientific data falsification in the NIH grant applications related to how the proposed drug and diagnostic test were intended to work and the improvement of certain indicators associated with Alzheimer’s disease after treatment with the proposed drug. </p>

<p>Wang is charged with one count of major fraud against the United States, two counts of wire fraud, and one count of false statements. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison for the count of major fraud, 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud, and five years in prison for the count of false statements.  </p>

<p>Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, and Assistant Director in Charge David Sundberg of the FBI Washington Field Office made the announcement.</p>

<p>The FBI Washington Field Office is investigating the case.</p>

<p>Trial Attorney Andrew Tyler, Deputy Chief Anna Kaminska, and Assistant Chief Leslie Garthwaite of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section are prosecuting the case.</p>
