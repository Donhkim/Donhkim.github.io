<p>Average salaries in Europe vary widely, significantly impacting hiring and job decisions. These differences can arise from country-specific regulations, labour laws, industry sectors, and economic development. Northern and western European countries have the highest average net earnings, while eastern and southern European countries report much lower figures.</p>
<h2>How do average earnings across Europe compare?</h2><p>Average annual net earnings are calculated by subtracting income taxes and social security contributions from gross annual earnings and then adding family allowances. Different family situations, such as being single or married and the number of dependent children, impact net earnings.</p>
                    
    




<p>Euronews Business examines the net earnings of a single person without children, but the chart below also provides options for different scenarios.</p>
<p>Switzerland tops the list with an impressive average annual net earning of €85,582, significantly higher than any other country in the region, according to Eurostat, the EU's official statistical office. </p>
<p>Following Switzerland, Iceland and Luxembourg reported average earnings of €53,885 and €49,035, respectively. Norway and the Netherlands also recorded net earnings over €45,000.</p>



<p>The average net earnings within the EU was €28,217, serving as a benchmark for comparison. Countries such as France (€31,481) and Sweden (€33,926) slightly surpass the EU average, while others, including Italy (€24,207) and Spain (€23,568), fall below it. </p>
<p>Among Europe's top economies, Germany had the highest net earnings at €38,086. The latest available figure for the UK is from 2019, making direct comparison difficult, but it was €35,783, indicating the UK's position.</p>
<p>All these figures highlight the substantial income differences that exist even among Europe's wealthiest nations.</p>           <p data-ad-id="adzone-outstream_1" data-ad-type="outstream" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label js-adzone outstream"></p>
  

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, countries like Turkey and Bulgaria report the lowest average annual net earnings, at €8,968 and €9,355, respectively. </p>
<p>Eastern European countries such as Romania (€11,105), Croatia (€12,330), and Hungary (€12,456) also fall towards the lower end of the earnings scale.</p>



<h2>PPS-adjusted salaries</h2><p>When adjusting for purchasing power standards (PPS), the landscape changes slightly. PPS is an artificial currency unit which adjusts for price level differences between countries.</p>
<p>Switzerland remains the highest at 47,403 PPS, but the gap with other countries narrows. This figure underscores Switzerland's strong economic position and high standard of living, substantially surpassing other nations in the region.</p>



<p>Following Switzerland, the Netherlands and Norway also showcase robust net earnings with 38,856 PPS and 36,288 PPS, respectively. Luxembourg and Austria round out the top five, reporting over 35,000 PPS.</p>         <p data-ad-id="adzone-native_1" data-ad-type="native" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label advertising--native js-adzone"></p>
  

<p>These countries, predominantly located in Northern and Western Europe, benefit from strong economies, advanced infrastructure, and favourable labour laws, contributing to their high earnings.</p>
<h2>Net earnings lower in Eastern and Southern Europe</h2><p>In contrast, countries in Eastern and Southern Europe generally report lower average net earnings in PPS terms.</p>
<p>Slovakia, for instance, has the lowest average annual net earnings at 14,758 PPS. Turkey (2022), Latvia, and Bulgaria also fall at the lower end of the spectrum, each with less than 16,000 PPS.</p>
<p>These figures highlight the economic disparities within the continent, influenced by various factors such as economic development, labour market conditions, and cost of living.</p>
<p>Among Europe's top economies, Germany stands out with net earnings of 34,914 PPS. Although the latest data for the UK is from 2019, it reported 29,757 PPS, indicating its competitive position within Europe. </p>
    <div class="c-ad c-ad-halfpage u-margin-bottom-3 u-show-for-small-only">
                             <p data-ad-id="adzone-halfpage_2" data-ad-type="halfpage" data-ad-position="2" class="c-ad__adzone advertising js-adzone"></p>
        
        <div class="c-ad__placeholder">
            <img class="c-ad__placeholder__logo" src="https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-180x22-grey-6.svg" alt="" loading="lazy">
            <span>ADVERTISEMENT</span>
        </div>
    </div>


<p>Countries such as Belgium, Ireland, and Sweden also perform well, with earnings exceeding 30,000 PPS. These statistics reflect the economic stability and higher living standards in these regions.</p>



<p>The chart above illustrates how the number of dependent children and marital status significantly impact net earnings across Europe. While the rankings of certain countries shift under these varying circumstances, the overall changes are generally not dramatic.</p>
<p>All these disparities in net earnings have significant implications for the quality of life, economic stability, and social equity within Europe. Policymakers and stakeholders consider these findings in their efforts to address income inequality and promote balanced economic growth across the continent.</p>
<h2>Pay transparency in the EU</h2><p>The EU promotes pay transparency with new rules adopted on 24 April, 2023. These rules require companies to share salary information and address any gender pay gap over 5%. Pay transparency helps workers enforce their right to equal pay and aims to close the gender pay gap.</p>

    <p>It looks like the provided text is an HTML code snippet and not a news article. However, since you've asked me to extract 5 key points, I'll assume you'd like me to find some meaningful information from the provided code.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the code appears to be a custom form or widget, and there isn't much text or relevant data to extract. However, I'll try to find some general information that might be of interest:</p>
<ol>
<li>The code is likely part of a password manager or other security-related system, as it includes a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) challenge to prevent automated bots from accessing the system.</li>
<li>The code includes a hidden form element with a reference ID (6a18468f-3d69-11ef-a6d4-dadfadbfbc13) that may be used to identify the form submission or track user behavior.</li>
<li>The code includes a copyable UUID ( Universally Unique Identifier) value, which is often used to identify unique records or transactions.</li>
<li>The code contains several SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) elements, which are used to create the custom form design and graphics.</li>
<li>The code includes a cancel button and a send button, suggesting that the form is designed for users to submit feedback or send some type of request.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that these points are purely speculative, and the actual purpose or functionality of the code may be entirely different.</p>

For more information about our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information when you visit our sites and apps, see our </p><a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy.</a>

<p>
Under certain state laws, including, but not limited to, the California Consumer Privacy Act, California Privacy Rights Act, and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (collectively, “State Privacy Laws”), this collection and use of our users’ information for interest-based advertising purposes may constitute a “sale” of personal information to other parties.  Certain State Privacy Laws require that we give you the ability to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information or data in connection with these targeting advertising activities. Although State Privacy Laws only extend their protections to residents of their particular states, we respect consumer choice when it comes to privacy rights.  Accordingly, we offer all of our users – regardless of whether you are a resident of a state that has adopted a State Privacy Law – the right to opt out of this type of sale or sharing of your personal information.  You can exercise this opt-out right by using the toggle switch below.  

</p><p>
Opting out will not disable cookies or other technologies that facilitate the proper functioning of our website or collect data for purposes that do not involve targeted advertising. Opting out will not mean that you will stop seeing interest-based ads or other ads online. Specifically, opting out will not prevent you from seeing interest-based ads based on information that, for purposes of State Privacy Laws, was not sold or shared by us, was sold before you opted out, or was sold by third parties outside of our control.

In addition, if you are a California resident and have enabled the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal on a supported web browser, we will treat this as a request to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information for targeted advertising purposes.

<p>Tesla shares (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASDAQ:TSLA</a>) saw some momentum last week following the release of its Q2 2024 vehicle delivery and production report, with the company gaining $150 billion worth of valuation in three days. Amidst this rise, Tesla shorts were stung, including hedge funds that bet against the EV maker in the lead up to the Q2 delivery report’s release. </p>



<p>As noted in a <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-07/hedge-funds-that-piled-into-big-tesla-short-stung-by-huge-rally?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg News</a></em> report, about 18% of the over 500 hedge funds being tracked by data provider Hazeltree held a short position in the electric vehicle maker at the end of Q2 2024, the highest percentage in over a year. In comparison, only 15% of the hedge funds tracked by the data provider had a short position against Tesla at the end of Q1 2024. </p>








<p>Tesla shares surged following the release of the company’s Q2 2024 vehicle delivery and production report, which beat Wall Street’s estimates. In the two trading days since the report’s release, <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-ytd-losses-recouped-150b-valuation-gain-three-days/">TSLA shares climbed 17%</a>, leading to short sellers losing an estimated $3.5 billion on a mark-to-market basis, as noted in a <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/04/tesla-short-sellers-lost-3point5-billion-in-two-days-after-q2-deliveries.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a></em> report. It should be noted that since the start of June 2024, Tesla shares have risen about 40%. </p>



<p>In a post on social media platform X, Elon Musk has responded to the news of the hedge funds’ losses with a crying face emoji. </p>



 



<p>Considering the past few months, it is no surprise that Tesla attracted substantial interest from short-sellers. Tesla’s Q1 2024 vehicle deliveries fell below expectations, and over Q2, the company initiated a major round of job cuts that saw the departure of some key executives. Tesla’s leadership also seemed to be in dire straits as rumors suggested that Elon Musk may leave the company if TSLA shareholders did not <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-2024-cyber-roundup-annual-stockholders-meeting-live-blog/">ratify this 2018 CEO Performance Award</a>. </p>



<p>Tesla is expected to hold its Q2 2024 earnings call on Tuesday, July 23, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. CT (5:30 p.m. ET).  Tesla is expected to release its Q2 2024 Update Letter, which will be available on the company’s Investors Relations website after the end of July 23’s trading day. The results of the Q2 2024 Update Letter, as well as other pertinent topics, are expected to be discussed in the earnings call. </p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Economic experts are criticizing the Biden administration's June jobs report, calling it "deceptively correct" because of revisions to previous reports and the fact that government jobs are a significant portion of the additions.</li>
<li>One-third of the 206,000 jobs added in June were in government, which is not generating GDP, says Bob Nardelli, former Home Depot CEO and former Chrysler Chairman.</li>
<li>Inflation is seen as a major issue, with Nardelli comparing it to "carbon monoxide" - a silent killer that is affecting the quality of life and causing problems in the economy.</li>
<li>FreedomWorks senior economist Steve Moore agrees with Nardelli, saying he doesn't "buy" the Biden administration's characterization of the job market as "hot". Moore notes that the economy is shifting into a lower gear.</li>
<li>Two-thirds of middle-income Americans say they are falling behind and struggling to make ends meet, according to a survey, which suggests that the economy is not as strong as reported.</li>

<li>Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.32% to close at 40,780.7, as real wages in the country fell for a 26th consecutive month, although nominal wages rose 1.9% to 297,151 yen.</li>

The transaction is subject to customary terms and conditions, including various purchase price adjustments, and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2024, with an effective date of June 1, 2024.</p>  <p>“The acquisition of Grayson Mill is an excellent strategic fit for Devon that allows us to efficiently expand our oil production and operating scale while capturing a meaningful runway of highly economic drilling inventory,” stated Rick Muncrief, Devon’s president and CEO. “This transaction also creates immediate value within our financial framework by delivering sustainable accretion to earnings and free cash flow that will result in higher distributions to shareholders over time.”</p>  <p><strong>TRANSACTION HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p>  <ul type="disc"><li><strong>Immediately accretive to financial metrics </strong>– The transaction is immediately accretive to Devon’s key per-share financial measures, including earnings, cash flow, free cash flow and net asset value.

Production from the acquired properties is expected to be maintained at approximately 100,000 Boe per day (55 percent oil) in 2025. With enhanced scale in the basin, Devon expects to realize up to $50 million in average annual cash flow savings from operating efficiencies and marketing synergies. The acquisition also adds 500 gross locations and 300 high-quality refrac candidates that effectively compete for capital in the company’s portfolio. On a pro forma basis, Devon will possess an inventory life of up to 10 years in the Williston Basin at a constant development pace of three operated rigs.</li><li><strong>Midstream ownership enhances margin </strong>– The acquired business generates peer-leading operating margins in the Williston Basin that benefit from midstream infrastructure ownership in 950 miles of gathering systems, an extensive network of disposal wells and crude storage terminals. This midstream ownership creates a margin uplift of more than $125 million of EBITDAX annually and provides marketing optionality to capture higher pricing through access points to multiple end use markets.</li><li><strong>Improves outlook for return of capital to shareholders </strong>– Due to the accretive nature of this transaction to free cash flow, Devon’s board of directors has expanded its share-repurchase authorization by 67 percent to $5 billion through mid-year 2026. The company also expects this acquisition to be accretive to the company’s dividend payout in 2025 and beyond.</li><li><strong>Maintains strong financial position </strong>– The transaction structure supports Devon retaining its strong investment-grade credit ratings with a projected net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of approximately 1.0 times upon closing. The company plans to improve its financial strength by allocating up to 30 percent of its annual free cash flow towards reducing $2.5 billion of debt over the next two years.</li></ul>  <p>(1) Pro forma production is a combination of Devon’s 2024 guidance and Grayson Mill’s 2025e volumes of ~100 MBOED (~55% oil). <br></p>  <p><strong>FINANCING DETAILS</strong></p>  <p>Devon will fund the $5 billion acquisition with $3.25 billion of cash and issue 37 million shares of common stock valued at $1.75 billion. The company plans to finance the cash portion of the purchase price through a combination of cash on hand and debt.</p>  <p><strong>2024 OUTLOOK</strong></p>  <p>Devon will provide updated forward-looking guidance for 2024 upon closing of the transaction.</p>  <p><strong>ADVISORS</strong></p>  <p>Citi is serving as financial advisor and Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP is serving as legal advisor to Devon.</p>  <p><strong>CONFERENCE CALL WEBCAST AND ADDITIONAL MATERIALS </strong></p>  <p>Devon will host a conference call and webcast today at 7:30 a.m. Central Time (8:30 a.m. Eastern Time) to discuss this announcement.

Due to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some of the information excluded from these projected measures, together with some of the components of the calculations being inherently unpredictable, Devon is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable GAAP measures is included and no reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.  Such non-GAAP measures are not alternatives to GAAP measures, and you should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP.  For additional disclosure regarding Devon’s historical non-GAAP measures, including how we define such measures, please refer to Devon’s first-quarter 2024 earnings materials and related Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.</em></p>  <p><strong>CAUTIONARY NOTE ON RESERVES AND RESOURCE ESTIMATES </strong>  </p>  <p><em>The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves.

<p>Tesla (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASDAQ:TSLA</a>) is among a group of stocks that Wall Street has dubbed the “Magnificent Seven.” These seven companies, comprised of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, are dubbed as such due to their high performance and influence in the tech sector. Earlier this year, however, it seemed like Tesla did not really belong to the list. </p>



<p>As noted in a <em><a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/04/elon-musk-tesla-stock-recoup-losses-q2-deliveries-wedbush-dan-ives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortune</a></em> report, Tesla practically became the butt of jokes on Wall Street because the stock trailed the rest of the Magnificent Seven by a substantial degree, and its growth seemed to have stopped. Following the release of the Q2 2024 vehicle delivery and production report, however, TSLA stock showed an incredible rise. </p>








<p>So notable was TSLA stock’s rise following the release of the company’s Q2 2024 vehicle delivery and production report that the electric vehicle maker was able to fully recoup its year-to-date losses after the company boosted its market cap by $150 billion in just three days. That’s a pretty insane amount considering that Ford currently has a market cap of $51.26 billion and GM has a market cap of $53.08 billion. </p>



<p>Tesla stock generally <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-stock-may-2024-most-shorted-large-cap-stock-hazeltree/">stayed in the $180 level for the better part of the last two months</a>, but with the electric vehicle maker’s recent momentum, TSLA bulls are hoping for even more gains in the coming months. Trading &amp; investing tool <em><a href="https://x.com/Barchart/status/1808575246867309015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barchart</a></em>, for one, observed last week that TSLA shares have broken their 2.5-year downward trend. And with the upcoming unveiling of the dedicated Robotaxi next month, Tesla’s momentum could continue in the latter half of the year. </p>



 



<p>Tesla will have a very busy Q3 and Q4, especially since CEO Elon Musk noted during the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call that he expects the company to see higher sales this year compared to the previous year. For context, Tesla has so far been able to deliver 830,776 vehicles over the first and second quarter of 2024. In comparison,  the company was able to <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-vehicle-production-deliveries-and-date-financial-results-webcast-fourth-quarter-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deliver a total of 1,808,581 vehicles in full year 2023</a>. If Tesla wishes to exceed its 2023 deliveries, the company would have to deliver more than 978,000 vehicles between Q3 and Q4 2024. </p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Investment banking fees are expected to rise significantly in the second quarter, with revenues at JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Citigroup expected to increase by over 30% compared to the same period last year.</li>
<li>The resurgence of dealmaking is expected to be a bright spot for Wall Street lenders, with large deals such as ExxonMobil's acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources and Aon's purchase of NFP contributing to the increase in investment banking fees.</li>
<li>Analysts predict that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which have the biggest exposure to investment banking, will benefit the most from the rebound in dealmaking activity.</li>
<li>Investment banking revenues have been stagnant for the past two years, falling from record highs in 2021 due to rising interest rates and subdued M&amp;A and IPO activity. However, some optimism is growing that the industry is finally showing signs of recovery.</li>
<li>The rebound in investment banking fees may be a silver lining for Wall Street lenders, which are also expected to be affected by rising defaults and muted earnings growth in the second quarter.</li>

Goldman publishes earnings on July 15, followed by Morgan Stanley and BofA a day later. Overall, rising defaults are expected to contribute to muted earnings growth for many of the largest <a href="https://www.ft.com/us-banks" data-trackable="link">US lenders</a> this quarter.</p><p>The resurgence of dealmaking, though, could be a bright spot. Analysts predict the bottom lines of Goldman and Morgan Stanley, whose businesses have the biggest exposure to investment banking, will benefit the most. Large deals that closed in the second quarter included ExxonMobil’s $60bn acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources in May, which was brokered by Citigroup, Goldman and Morgan Stanley, and Aon’s $13bn purchase of insurance broker NFP in April, which was guided by Citi and BofA, among others. </p><p>In what has been a brutal reminder of the industry’s feast-to-famine swings, investment banking revenues fell last year from record highs in 2021 to their lowest level in years. Rising interest rates by central banks around the world have damped activity for M&amp;A and new stock market listings. </p><p>Wall Street bosses have been talking up a recovery for more than a year — the heads of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley spoke about the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4256b07b-789f-4f87-a10e-db9db951c3c4" data-trackable="link">“green shoots”</a> of a recovery as far back as 12 months ago — but the business has taken longer to rebound than initially expected. </p><p>In a jolt of optimism, JPMorgan told investors last month that the increase in revenues from investment banking during the second quarter was set to rise by as much as 30 per cent, double what the bank had initially anticipated.</p><p>Smaller rival Jefferies last week reported that investment banking revenues in the three months to the end of May rose almost 60 per cent from a year earlier. Its top management said it was “increasingly optimistic” about the second half of 2024 and 2025. </p><figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"><picture><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7d1602cc-51de-4b0d-8615-5cc9c2587df3?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7d1602cc-51de-4b0d-8615-5cc9c2587df3?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7d1602cc-51de-4b0d-8615-5cc9c2587df3?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=3 3x"><source media="(max-width: 490px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A9e151593-afe0-4b3e-870a-be1771bd5e22?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=490&amp;dpr=1 1x"><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F10829c50-3965-11ef-82f4-9154095071af-standard.png?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1" alt="Line chart of Fees in $bn showing Wall Street banks seeing long-awaited rebound in investment banking activity" data-image-type="graphic" loading="lazy"></source></source></picture></figure><p>The rebound has been aided by debt offerings, as confidence in the economy has made investors more willing to jump into riskier deals. In one of the biggest deals of the quarter, struggling fitness company Peloton refinanced $1.35bn in debt in May in a deal that was led by JPMorgan and Goldman.</p><p>Bankers are not anticipating a return to investment banking activity levels seen in 2021 and 2022 when rock-bottom interest rates and government stimulus during the coronavirus pandemic led to a surge in M&amp;A and IPOs. </p><p>Bankers have pointed to a need for private equity firms to exit existing investments and deploy trillions of dollars in dry powder, as well as corporations reviewing their supply chains and coping with rapid advancements in technology such as artificial intelligence. </p><p>“We have capital markets activity still running below the normal trend line and it is in the process of ramping up,” said Betsy Graseck, a banking analyst at Morgan Stanley. “That tailwind, we think, will show up in the quarter and persist through the rest of this calendar year and into 2025.”</p><p>Investors have also been fretting that persistently higher interest rates could lead to more borrowers defaulting on their loans, with credit losses in recent years coming off of historically very low levels.</p><p>Analysts expect JPMorgan, BofA, Citi and Wells, the four largest US banks by deposits, to report more than $7bn in the second quarter of so-called charge-offs, which are losses on loans marked as unrecoverable. This would be up more than 50 per cent from a year earlier. </p><p>“We’re still in a phase where I would characterise things as normalising rather than deteriorating more visibly,” said Scott Siefers, banking analyst at Piper Sandler. “Virtually every bank investor on the planet is just acutely focused on commercial real estate in particular.”</p></article></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Federal court vacates non-compete ban</strong>: A federal judge, Ada Brown, issued an injunction against the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) ban on non-compete agreements, which was set to go into effect in September.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty for employers</strong>: The ruling creates uncertainty for employers, who are trying to navigate the legality of non-compete agreements. The ban was intended to prevent companies from restricting workers' ability to join rival firms.</li>
<li><strong>Two separate lawsuits</strong>: There are two separate lawsuits challenging the non-compete ban, one in Texas and one in Pennsylvania. A judge in Pennsylvania is set to rule by July 23 on a request for an injunction, while Judge Brown will issue a final decision by August 30.</li>
<li><strong>Potential legal knot</strong>: Employment lawyers say that the conflicting decisions from the two trial courts could lead to a legal knot that might take years to resolve.</li>
<li><strong>Employment lawyers skeptical</strong>: Some employment lawyers are skeptical that the ban will ultimately be effective, citing the challenges of enforcing a nationwide ban and the potential for conflicting court decisions.</li>

The Federal Trade Commission’s ban was set to go into effect in September.</p><h3>Most Read from The Wall Street Journal</h3><p>The judge, Ada Brown, said the plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the ban are likely to prevail in a final ruling based on their argument that the FTC lacks statutory authority to promulgate the ban, and that the rule is overly broad because it “imposes a one-size-fits-all approach with no end date.”</p><p>But her injunction last week applies only to the plaintiffs in the case—a tax-services firm based in Dallas, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a few other business groups—and it is likely to have little effect on them. The judge, who was appointed by Donald Trump in 2019, said she would issue a final decision on the merits of their lawsuit by Aug. 30, a few days before the rule’s Sept. 4 deadline.</p><p>Another complicating factor: A Biden-appointed judge in Pennsylvania will rule by July 23 on a request for an injunction in a separate lawsuit, brought by a tree-trimming business in Pennsylvania.</p><p>That decision, along with the final rulings in both cases, could set the stage for a legal knot that might take years to resolve, employment lawyers say.</p><p>“There could be a conflicting decision by these two trial courts,” said Julie Werner, a New York-based attorney and vice chair of the employment practice at Lowenstein Sandler. If that happens, “this is very likely to head to the Supreme Court” if the split decisions endure after appeals are exhausted.</p><p>Employers are now left waiting for definitive guidance. Werner said she is advising clients to do nothing, other than to make sure they satisfy any state laws that prohibit or limit noncompete clauses.</p><p>Companies impose noncompete clauses to prohibit departing workers from sharing trade secrets or proprietary information with new employers, or from taking proprietary information, such as customer lists, and using it to establish their own businesses. The clauses usually apply for a period of time, such as a year or two, or to a geographic area.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="20"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>According to the FTC, nearly one in five U.S. workers—about 30 million people—are subject to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/non-compete-agreements-clauses-explained-11673025017?mod=article_inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:noncompete clauses in their employment contracts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="21">noncompete clauses in their employment contracts</a>.</p><p>In issuing its rule to ban noncompete clauses in April, the agency said noncompetes suppress wages, stall new business formation and stifle companies from hiring the workers they need to grow.</p><p>“The FTC stands by our clear authority, supported by statute and precedent, to issue this rule,” spokesman Douglas Farrar said after Brown’s decision was released.</p><p>Noncompete clauses have commonly been included in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/non-compete-clause-legal-11632244492?mod=article_inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:employment contracts of executives;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="22">employment contracts of executives</a>, salespeople, scientists and others with access to confidential or proprietary information.

<li><strong>Citi Research expects a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve</strong>: The bank predicts that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points eight times, starting in September and extending to July 2025, to lower the benchmark rate from 5.25%-5.5% to 3.25%-3.5%.</li>

<li><strong>Unemployment rate is a key metric to watch</strong>: Citi notes that payroll data may be skewed to the upside, making the unemployment rate, which is derived from a separate survey, a more important metric to watch. The unemployment rate is expected to continue rising if the current pace is maintained.</li>
<li><strong>"Sahm Rule" recession indicator may be triggered in August</strong>: If unemployment continues to rise at its current pace, the "Sahm Rule" recession indicator, which signals a recession when the unemployment rate exceeds 10 basis points above the monthly average of unemployment claims, could be triggered in August.</li>
<li><strong>Citi's chief U.S. economist, Andrew Hollenhorst, has a bearish view on the economy</strong>: Hollenhorst has been a relative contrarian this year, maintaining a dimmer view on the economy even as the Wall Street consensus shifted to a soft landing.

    <div><p>Get ready for a bonanza of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve that starts in a few months and extends all the way into next summer, according to analysts at Citi Research.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>In a note on Friday, the bank cited fresh signs of a slowing economy for its view that the Fed will trim rates by 25 basis points eight times, starting in September and extending to July 2025.</p>



<p>That will lower the benchmark rate by a whopping 200 basis points, or from 5.25%-5.5% now to 3.25%-3.5%, where they will remain for the rest of 2025, the note said.</p>



<p>The economy has cooled off from its “heady” pace in 2023 with inflation resuming its slowdown after some unexpected stickiness, said Citi analysts led by chief U.S. economist Andrew Hollenhorst. </p>



<p>But the Institute for Supply Management’s service-sector gauge, which abruptly reversed into negative territory, and the monthly jobs report, which showed unemployment rising to 4.1%, have raised the risk of a sharper weakening of economic activity and a faster pace of rate cuts, they added.</p><p></p>



<p>The data along with dovish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday suggest the first rate cut will very likely come in September. </p>



<p>“A continued softening of activity will provoke cuts at each of the subsequent seven Fed meetings, in our base case,” Citi predicted.</p>



<p>The note also pointed to other signs of weakness in the jobs report. While the headline payroll gain of 206,000 appears solid, prior months were revised down. And June saw a decline of 49,000 temporary services jobs, with Citi calling it “the type of decline that is typically seen around recessions as employers begin reducing labor with the least strongly attached workers.”</p>



<p>Payroll data are also likely skewed to the upside, leaving the unemployment rate, which is derived from a separate survey, as the more important metric, it said. And on that front, Citi pointed to the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/recession-indicator-economic-outlook-sahm-rule-unemployment-rate-june-jobs-report/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/recession-indicator-economic-outlook-sahm-rule-unemployment-rate-june-jobs-report/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/recession-indicator-economic-outlook-sahm-rule-unemployment-rate-june-jobs-report/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">“Sahm Rule” recession indicator</a> and said it could be triggered in August if unemployment continues to rise at its current pace.</p>



<p>Hollenhorst has been a relative contrarian this year by maintaining a dimmer view on the economy, even as the Wall Street consensus shifted to a soft landing.</p><p></p>



<p>In May, he doubled down on his warning that the U.S. is <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/05/economic-outlook-hard-landing-recession-fed-rate-cuts-forecast-citi/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/05/economic-outlook-hard-landing-recession-fed-rate-cuts-forecast-citi/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/05/economic-outlook-hard-landing-recession-fed-rate-cuts-forecast-citi/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">headed for a hard landing</a> and that Fed rate cuts wouldn’t be enough to prevent it. That followed a similar forecast in February, even amid blowout jobs reports.</p>

But a more mild recession may not result in such a consensus, he added.</p>



<p>He also pointed out that just as Fed rate hikes slowed the economy less than anticipated, rate cuts have not stimulate as much. In addition, 10-year bond yields, which serve as benchmarks for a wide range of borrowing costs, are already below 2-year yields, leaving less room for further downside, especially as rising deficits and inflation add upward pressure. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“Most economic activity is going to be more responsive to a 5-year yield, the 10-year yield. It’s not really about the overnight policy rate,” Hollenhorst explained. “So there really are questions about how much can you transmit that stimulative effect of lower policy rates.” </p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get global CEO perspectives on the biggest stories in business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p>.</p></div></div>
