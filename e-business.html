<ol>
<li><strong>EU imposes new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles</strong>: The European Union has raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, with rates ranging from 17.4% to 37.6% in addition to the existing 10% duty on all electric car imports from China.</li>
<li><strong>Protectionist move to safeguard EU motor industry</strong>: The tariffs are aimed at protecting the European motor industry from cheap imports, which the EU claims are undermining domestic sales and production.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on consumers</strong>: The increased tariffs may lead to higher prices for electric vehicles in the EU, making them less affordable for consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Blow to China's economic plans</strong>: China's electric vehicle industry, which relies heavily on exports to the EU, is being hit hard by this move, which is a major blow to Beijing's economic plans, particularly in the context of ongoing trade tensions with the US.</li>
<li><strong>EU's largest market for Chinese EVs</strong>: The EU is China's largest overseas market for electric vehicles, with the country relying on high-tech products like EVs to help revive its slowing economy.</li>

The EU is the largest overseas market for China’s EV industry and the country is counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">EU officials say this rise in imports was boosted by "unfair subsidisation", which allowed China-made EVs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">China has denied this repeated allegation from the US and the EU: Beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The new charges come into effect on Friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into Chinese state support for the country's EV makers continues. They are not likely to be imposed until later this year.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">So who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute?</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It is not just Chinese brands that are affected by the move. Western firms that make cars in China have also come under scrutiny by Brussels.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">By imposing tariffs, Brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market. The EU’s decision may seem tame compared to a recent US move to raise its total tariffs to 100%, but it could be far more consequential. Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on US roads but much more common in the EU.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The number of EVs sold by Chinese brands across the EU rose from just 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to almost 8% last year, according to figures from the influential Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&amp;E).</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Patryk Krupcala, an architect from Poland, who expects to take delivery of a brand new China-made MG4 in two weeks told the BBC: "I have chosen an MG4 because it is quite cheap. It is a really fast car and it's a rear-wheel drive like my previous car which was BMW E46."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">T&amp;E projects firms like BYD and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the Chinese owner of the formerly British brand MG,<b id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"> </b>could reach a market share of 20% by 2027.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But not all Chinese-made EVs will be hit equally by the new tariffs.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dKljgB"><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">Winners and losers </h2></p><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">They were calculated based on estimates of how much state aid each firm received, while companies that cooperated with the probe saw the duties they were hit with cut. Based on these criteria, the European Commission has set individual duties on three Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">SAIC has been hit with the highest new tariff of<b id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"> </b>37.6%. State-owned SAIC is the Chinese partner of Volkswagen and General Motors. It also owns MG, which produces one of the top-selling EVs in Europe, the MG4.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"The price for not cooperating is a severe blow to SAIC, which gets 15.4% of its global revenues from EV sales in Europe," says Rhodium Group, an independent research firm.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">For Mr Krupcala, who bought his MG4 before the tariffs hit, the EU's move does not matter much: "I don't really care about the tariffs. I have a nice car with a seven-year warranty."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">For China's largest EV maker, BYD, it is a different story, as it faces an extra duty of 17.4% on the vehicles it ships from China to the EU. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">That is the lowest increase and one that, according to research by Dutch bank ING will "give the automaker an advantage in the European market".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Luís Filipe Costa, an insurance industry executive from Portugal, who has just bought a BYD Seal, says price was one of the deciding factors when he chose his new car.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But, he added that even if the European Commission's new tariffs had already been in place he would still have gone with BYD because "other brands would also be affected".</p></div><figure><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Portuguese executive Luís Filipe Costa chose a BYD Seal over Western brands</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Geely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, will see an additional tariff of 19.9%.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">According to Spanish bank BBVA, the company will "still export to the EU profitably" but "its profits will be significantly reduced."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Other firms, including European car makers operating factories in China or through joint ventures, will also have to pay more to bring electric cars into the EU.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Those deemed to have cooperated with the probe will face an extra duty of 20.8<b id="%" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf">%</b>, while those EU investigators see as non-cooperative will pay the higher tariff of 37.6%.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">US-based Tesla, which is the biggest exporter of electric vehicles from China to Europe, has asked  for an individually calculated rate which EU officials have said will be determined at the end of the investigation.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Still, the firm has posted a notice on some of its European websites, that prices for its Shanghai-made Model 3 could increase due to the new tariffs. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Last year, businessman Lars Koopmann, who lives in the motor industry powerhouse that is Germany, bought a China-made Tesla Model Y.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Koopmann says he particularly enjoyed the car's high-tech features, such as the large touch screen.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Price was also a big factor that set it apart from premium German brands," Mr Koopmann says. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"If the tariffs had been in place, they would have always affected my decision."</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dKljgB"><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">Localising production</h2></p><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">While some China-based exporters will be better off than others, it is clear from the European Commission's plans that all of them will be facing higher costs when shipping to Europe.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The hardest hit "will be SAIC brands like MG... as well as joint ventures between foreign and Chinese firms in China, which often have narrower profit margins on the cars they export to Europe," Rhodium says.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"The biggest beneficiaries of the duties are European-based producers with limited China exposure, such as Renault."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In other words, the duties are likely to do as the EU hopes they would - cut the number of Chinese-made EVs coming into the region, easing pressure on local manufacturers.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There is also another result of the move - some big Chinese EV firms are planning to build production capacity in the EU, which could help shield them from the new duties.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Work on BYD's first European factory is well under way in Hungary and production is expected to begin there by the end of next year.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Chinese car maker, Chery, has recently signed a joint-venture deal with a Spanish firm that will see the two companies making EVs and other types of cars in Barcelona.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And, SAIC is looking to secure a site for its first factory in Europe.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"It’s a well architected plan to encourage companies to shift their investments to the EU, instead of relying on exporting from China," said Bill Russo, from Shanghai-based consulting group Automobility.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"The fact that some companies are taxed higher than others is a signal that they will make the penalty higher or lower based on the degree the company is committed to investing in the EU."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"></p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Chinese government placed its bet on EVs early on.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, between 2009 and 2023 more than $230bn (£181bn) of state support was pumped into the industry.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">As a result its EV industry has become world leading.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The International Energy Agency says China accounted for more than 60% of the world's new electric car sales last year.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">While the vast majority of EVs produced in China are sold domestically, overseas markets, and particularly Europe, have become increasingly important.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Exports are the profitable segment," said Rhodium's senior analyst, Gregor Sebastian.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"The EU tariffs will hurt China’s EV industry because these exports help recover losses from China's domestic price war."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Meanwhile, the world's second largest economy is struggling to shake off an economic slowdown in the wake of the pandemic and an ongoing property crisis.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Faced with lower domestic consumption and investment levels, China is trying to "export its way out" of the slump, says Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at investment bank Natixis.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And Beijing is placing yet another large bet on EVs by making the industry one of its “New Three” growth drivers - a government blueprint for reviving the economy that also relies on exports of batteries and renewable energy.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">However, with major markets like the US, the EU and others imposing tariffs and other barriers, it looks like China's latest gamble could deepen trade tensions with some of its largest trading partners.</p></div></article></div>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) — The red-hot Washington debate over whether President Joe Biden will scrap his run for re-election is spilling into Wall Street, where traders are shifting money to and from the dollar (<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX=F" data-ylk="slk:DX=F;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="12">DX=F</a>), Treasurys and other assets that would be impacted by Donald Trump’s return to office.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>The recalibration of portfolios kicked off at the end of last week after Biden’s disastrous debate with Trump heightened concerns the 81-year-old Democrat is too old to serve another term. The trading action afterward was most acute in the bond market, where yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries jumped as much as 20 basis points across the following days.</p><p>With speculation now mounting rapidly that Biden could drop out of the race — betting markets see less than a 50% chance he remains a candidate — investors are hastily making contingency plans to react to such an announcement during Thursday’s Fourth of July holiday and the subsequent weekend.</p><p>One fund manager, speaking on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the topic, said he was heading into the vacation stretch biased toward the dollar and short-term debt as hedges against the spike in risk he reckoned would be sparked by a Biden withdrawal. No president has opted against seeking a second term since Lyndon Johnson in 1968 and the election is just four months away.</p><p>“Markets have already been repricing election odds since the debate, so the news over the past 24 hours has really only added fuel to the fire,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of US rates strategy at TD Securities in New York.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">President Joe Biden in the first presidential debate with former President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at CNN's studios on June 27. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)<span class="caption-credit"> (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></p></figure><p>The consensus among traders and strategists is a re-election of Trump, a 78-year-old Republican, would spur trades that benefit from an inflationary mix of looser fiscal policy and greater protectionism: A strong dollar, higher US bond yields and gains in bank, health and energy stocks.</p><p>Even some 10,000 miles away, in Sydney, they’re bracing. Rodrigo Catril, a strategist at National Australia Bank, said “everyone” is preparing trading plans in case Biden ends his campaign.</p><p>“Either way, the market is betting on Trump winning the election,” said Catril. “It seems Democrats are stuck with very difficult choices, none of them easy, and none of them likely to yield a better outcome.”</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="18"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Here’s how the so-called Trump trade is materializing across markets:</p><p><strong>Dollar’s signal</strong></p><p>The dollar (<a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/" data-ylk="slk:DXY;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="19">DXY</a>) gave one of the earliest signals as to how markets would adjust to a potential Trump victory, gaining in the hours after last week’s debate. While the greenback has gotten a boost this year from the Federal Reserve’s indications that it intends to keep interest rates for higher longer, the currency got a clear bump in real-time as Trump dominated the faceoff with Biden.</p><figure class="caas-figure"></figure><p>Trump has floated cutting taxes and slapping 60% tariffs on imports from China and 10% duties on those from the rest of the world. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s chief economist Jan Hatzius said this week that such levies could lift inflation and force the Fed to lift rates about five more times than otherwise.</p><p>“A Trump victory raises the prospect of higher inflation and a stronger dollar, given his promise of more tariffs, and a tougher stance on immigration,” said JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. strategists led by Joyce Chang.</p><p>Potential losers in the face of a rising dollar and Trump’s expected support for tariffs include the Mexican peso (<a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MXN=X/" data-ylk="slk:MXN=X;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="20">MXN=X</a>) and Chinese yuan (<a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNY=X/" data-ylk="slk:CNY=X;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="21">CNY=X</a>).</p><p><strong>Yield-curve trade</strong></p><p>In the aftermath of the debate, money managers in the $27 trillion Treasury market reacted by buying shorter-maturity notes and selling longer-term ones — a wager known as a steepener trade.</p><p>A slew of Wall Street strategists have touted the strategy, including Morgan Stanley and Barclays Plc, urging clients to prepare for sticky inflation and higher long-maturity yields in another Trump term.</p><figure class="caas-figure"></figure><p>In a two-day span starting late last week, 10-year yields rose by about 13 basis points relative to 2-year rates, in the sharpest curve steepening since October.</p><p>Signs of traders bracing for near-term volatility in the Treasury market emerged Wednesday, through a buyer of a so-called strangle structure, which benefits from a move higher or lower in futures through the strike prices. Along with potential risk over the holiday weekend around Biden’s candidacy, the expiry also incorporates Friday’s US jobs data and testimony next week from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.</p><p><strong>Stocks gain</strong></p><p>The prospect of a Trump victory has supported myriad stocks that stand to benefit from his perceived stances on the regulatory environment, mergers and trade relations. The broad market has powered higher in the wake of the debate.</p><p>The turn in the electoral tide since last week has “meant higher stocks as Republicans are generally viewed as more business friendly,” said Tom Essaye, president and founder of Sevens Report.</p><p>Health insurers UnitedHealth Group Inc. (<a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UNH" data-ylk="slk:UNH;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="22">UNH</a>) and Humana Inc.

Discover Financial Services (<a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DFS" data-ylk="slk:DFS;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="24">DFS</a>) and Capital One Financial Corp. (<a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COF" data-ylk="slk:COF;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="25">COF</a>) are among credit card companies that have risen on optimism over Trump, given that pair’s pending deal and speculation around possible changes to late fee rules.</p><p>Energy stocks like Occidental Petroleum Corp. (<a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OXY" data-ylk="slk:OXY;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="26">OXY</a>) rose after the debate, given the former president is seen as having a pro-oil stance. Private prison stocks like GEO Group Inc. (<a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GEO" data-ylk="slk:GEO;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="27">GEO</a>) have reacted to his perceived tough-on-immigration views.</p><p><strong>Financials ETFs</strong></p><p>The exchange-traded fund market has shown one clear investing strategy of late: Long banks on bets that Trump will spur deregulation and a steeper Treasury curve thanks to his potentially inflationary agenda.</p><p>The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (ticker XLF), a $40 billion fund, last week saw its largest inflow in more than two months, with investors adding roughly $540 million. So far this week, they’ve added $611 million amid the latest gyrations in the interest-rate market.</p><figure class="caas-figure"></figure><p>Meanwhile, a thematic-investing strategy designed to ride the Trump trade has struggled to gain traction. An ETF that sports the eye-catching ticker MAGA and invests in Republican-friendly stocks has been slow to garner assets and hasn’t seen any material inflows this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.</p><p><strong>Asian impact</strong></p><p>Asia’s markets aren’t immune to the speculation either, with US-China tensions simmering and tariffs in play.</p><p>“The re-election of Mr. Trump should be a negative factor for China equities as Mr. Trump supports the idea of imposing substantially higher tariffs on US imports from China,” said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management Japan. “In that regard, Japanese stocks with high exposure to Chinese market are likely to be hurt if Mr. Trump wins.”</p><p><strong>Crypto support</strong></p><p>Trump has shown support for the crypto industry in recent weeks by meeting with industry executives and promising he would ensure all future Bitcoin mining is done in the US.</p><p>That makes the Solana (<a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOL-USD" data-ylk="slk:SOL-USD;cpos:16;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="28">SOL-USD</a>) token — the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of about $67 billion, according to CoinMarketCap — one potential beneficiary of a Trump return to the White House. Asset managers VanEck and 21Shares have filed for ETFs that would directly invest in the digital currency.</p><p>While many consider approval a long shot, the thinking among some market participants is that a newly re-elected Trump would appoint a Securities and Exchange Commission chair who is more crypto-friendly than Gary Gensler has been under Biden. That’s an outcome that would make a Solana ETF — and a corresponding rally in the token — more likely.</p><p>The prospect of a shakeup to the Democratic ticket is also likely to boost Bitcoin, according to Stephane Ouellette, chief executive of FRNT Financial.</p><p>“The crazier that the US political system looks, the better that Bitcoin looks,” Ouellette said “This is the kind of vibe that Bitcoin would go for. Craziness in the US political system is a pro-Bitcoin factor.”</p><p>—With assistance from Emily Nicolle, Katie Greifeld, Edward Bolingbroke, Anya Andrianova, Jan-Patrick Barnert, Natalia Kniazhevich, Ruth Carson, Bre Bradham, Nazmul Ahasan, Winnie Hsu, Carter Johnson, Vildana Hajric, Liz Capo McCormick and Ye Xie.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Real estate investors are doing well, particularly landlords who own apartment buildings, due to soaring rents caused by housing shortages and inflation.</li>

<li>Some of these properties have stopped making mortgage payments, while analysts worry that up to 20% of all loans on apartment properties could be at risk of default.</li>
<li>The financial distress is not necessarily due to non-payment of rents by tenants, but rather the financial struggles of the property owners themselves.</li>

            In fact, the monthly payroll gains should remain strong and steady, but gradually cooling: Economists expect the US added 190,000 jobs last month, a pullback from the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/07/economy/may-jobs-report-final/index.html">stronger-than-expected 272,000 gain in May</a>, and for unemployment to hold steady at 4%, according to FactSet consensus estimates.

            Still, there’s a growing chorus of data that shows the economy is slowing, consumer spending is letting up and workers are feeling less secure. As such, Friday’s report could provide a crucial signal as to whether the jobs market is at a stable or even pre-pandemic state — or is perhaps weaker than advertised.

            “I think as long as the job gains continue to show a gradual cooling, this economy is in good shape,” said Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, during a call with reporters on Wednesday following the payroll processor’s latest report showing job and wage gains slowed in the private sector.

            In May, the two surveys that feed into the monthly jobs report appeared to be telling different stories: The business survey showed employers adding jobs at a still-robust pace, and the household survey showed a 408,000 drop in employment.

            While the establishment survey is considered the “gold standard” by economists, the household survey, which provides greater detail on demographics and feeds into the unemployment rate, is viewed as more volatile because of its smaller sample size and declining response rates.

            “On a three-month average basis, it’s up about 200,000 people from last year,” Tilley said. “And that metric of permanent job losers, year-over-year, is almost never positive in an expansion.

            Since August 2022, monthly payroll gains have averaged 250,000 per month, which is much faster than the 2019 average of 164,000, noted Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter.

            “In other words, we’re achieving much higher job growth with about the same unemployment rate, at a time when the native-born population is stagnant,” Pollak told CNN via email. “One key reason is immigration and its effect on labor supply.”

            Immigrants accounted for 43% of the labor force gain in 2024, Rachel Sederberg, senior economist at labor market research firm Lightcast, told CNN Business. In May, that share skyrocketed to 280%, as the immigrant gains more than made up for the native-born workers who left the labor force, she said.

            The job gains made by immigrants have become another flashpoint in an already heavily contentious presidential election.

            “Most research does not find that immigration harms employment outcomes for native-born Americans because immigrants are both consumers and producers of goods and services, so they may increase job competition in some areas but they also increase demand for goods and services, which creates jobs,” Pollak noted.

<li>Tesla's stock has seen a significant surge in value, with its market cap increasing by $150 billion over three days, fully recouping its year-to-date losses.</li>

    <div><p>Traveling for July 4? You’re hardly alone.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>AAA <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2024/06/july-4th/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://newsroom.aaa.com/2024/06/july-4th/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">estimates some 70.9 million people</a> will be on the road in some form or fashion this year, traveling 50 miles or more from their home. That’s a 5% increase over last year and 8% higher than pre-pandemic levels in 2019.</p>



<p>And no transportation method will be more popular than the car. AAA says a record 60.6 million people will be clogging the highways and side streets. That’s 2.8 million more than a year ago. <a href="https://fortune.com/company/hertz-global-holdings/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/hertz-global-holdings/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Hertz</a> tells AAA that it expects to see the biggest demand for rentals in Dallas, Denver, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.</p>



<p>Lower gas prices and increased wanderlust are behind the increased number of people on the road.</p>



<p>So, how can you avoid being stuck in traffic jams for the majority of your holiday? It’s going to be challenging—and you might want to consider leaving either a bit earlier or a lot later if you want to avoid the worst of it.</p><p></p>



<p>AAA says the worst travel times on July 3 will be between 2:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. Your best bet is/was before noon. Those same windows will apply on July 4 as well.</p>



<p>If you’re making a long weekend of things, and planning to drive back Sunday, an early departure is a wise idea, ideally before 11:00 a.m. Things will be especially sticky between 2:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., AAA says.</p>



<p>“Drivers in large metro areas can expect the worst traffic delays on Wednesday, July 3, as they leave town, and Sunday, July 7, as they return,” said Bob Pishue, transportation analyst at INRI, a provider of transportation data and insights. “Road trips over the holiday week could take up to 67% longer than normal. Travelers should monitor 511 services, local news stations, and traffic apps for up-to-the-minute road conditions.”</p>



<p>In Chicago, that could be a 61% increase to the typical travel time to Indianapolis via I-65. Drivers headed from Tampa to Orlando on Wednesday can expect to spend an extra 58% longer in the car. And if you’re planning to drive from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., on Monday July 8, in the afternoon, it will take 67% longer than usual, as some vacationers extend the weekend even longer.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Southwest Airlines adopts "poison pill"</strong>: To prevent activist investor Elliott Investment Management from gaining more influence, Southwest's board of directors has adopted a "limited-duration shareholder plan," a type of "poison pill" that makes it difficult for Elliott to increase its stake in the company.</li>
<li><strong>Elliott has a significant stake in Southwest</strong>: Elliott owns nearly 11% of Southwest shares, worth around $2 billion, and has been pressuring the company to make changes to its leadership and operations.</li>
<li><strong>The "poison pill" is a deterrent</strong>: The plan would dilute Elliott's stake in the company if it attempts to increase its ownership above a certain threshold, making it a costly and unattractive option for the activist investor.</li>
<li><strong>Elliott's goals may go beyond board influence</strong>: While Elliott may not be able to replace board members or oust leadership on its own, it may attempt to lobby other major institutional shareholders to support its plan and gain influence over the company's direction.</li>
<li><strong>Elliott claims its plan could boost Southwest stock</strong>: Elliott claims that its plan could increase Southwest's stock price by $49 per share within 12 months, a 77% return, which is likely to be a major motivation for the activist investor to continue pushing for change at the company.</li>

The shareholder plan, a form of a “poison pill” used when publicly traded companies are under fire from disgruntled investors, would make it much more difficult for Elliott to increase its stake that currently stands at about 11% of Southwest shares.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">The “poison pill” is a bold move often used to thwart activist investors that have targeted companies that they perceive are performing weakly and have financial upside.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">“If it’s not invalidated for some reason, there is really no way around a poison pill,” said Keith Gottfried, a Maryland-based shareholder activism defense advisor. “The punitive effect of going above the triggering threshold could cause the activist stake to be diluted by a very large amount.”</p><div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__YgCAW md_pb-9 md_mb-7 md_pt-9 md_mt-7 pb-6 mb-9 px-9 w-full h-64 bg-blue-light border-t border-b border-gray-light pt-6 mt-9"><div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__P1yIN inline-flex col-span-1 row-span-1 pb-4"><div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__vRSrF flex-auto w-full"><p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__3hNhh primaryBold primaryBold-50 mb-3">Aviation News</p><p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__zWZy- mb-4">Stay prepared.

If they can garner support from investors with a majority of shares, an activist such as Elliott could place its own nominees on Southwest’s board of directors.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">But sometimes board influence or an outright takeover isn’t the only goal.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Elliott says its plan could boost Southwest stock $49 per share within 12 months, a 77% return during the period, which would net the investors hundreds of millions of dollars in profit. Southwest’s stock prices have fallen about 50% in the last three years, similar to that of cross-town rival <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/topic/american-airlines/" target="_blank">American Airlines</a>. Southwest’s stock price jumped 7% on the day Elliott announced its stake and is still up 3.5% compared to before Elliott got involved.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">The limited-duration shareholder rights plan is effective immediately and applies equally to all current and future shareholders in Southwest. This particular plan is triggered when a shareholder acquires a certain amount of its common stock, which would let all other shareholders buy stock at a discount. It expires in a year.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Ariel Hernãndez, a corporate lawyer at NTT Data, said this mechanism makes the acquisition more difficult and costly for an acquirer, like Elliott.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">“If Elliott purchases 12.5% or more of Southwest Airlines’ shares, current shareholders gain the option to buy additional shares at a lower price,” he explained. “This action dilutes Elliott’s holdings, decreasing their value and making it more costly and difficult for them to gain control of the company.”</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">When shareholders buy additional shares at discounted prices, Hernãndez said, the total number of outstanding shares increases. As a result, Elliott’s shares represent a smaller portion of the company, decreasing their value. Elliott would have to buy additional shares at a higher cost in order to regain the same level of control in the company.</p><article id="related-story-embed-4WKTRLQ2O5BXXGS4YFVUEWGHNM" data-oembed-type="related-story" class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__8iRXq block w-full inline-block my-2 p-7 bg-gray-lighter border border-gray-light ignore-body-text secondaryBold secondaryBold-7"><label class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__dzAkK pr-3 text-blue-dark">Related:</label><a class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__82BFj" href="/business/airlines/2024/06/13/southwest-airlines-maverick-culture-under-fire-as-activist-investor-takes-aim/">What’s going on between Southwest Airlines and activist investor Elliott Management?</a></article><p class="body-text-paragraph">“In light of the potential for Elliott to significantly increase its position in Southwest Airlines, the board determined that adopting the Rights Plan is prudent to fulfill its fiduciary duties to all shareholders,” said Gary Kelly, executive chairman of the board. “Southwest Airlines has made a good faith effort to engage constructively with Elliott Investment Management since its initial investment and remains open to any ideas for lasting value creation.”</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Elliott declined to comment further on the matter.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Southwest has long been a maverick in an industry where competitors tend to mirror one another. The airline doesn’t charge for the first two bags for passengers and doesn’t assign seating, two lucrative revenue sources for U.S. airlines.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">“You’ve got to be very informed before you start proposing changes that could affect the business model of Southwest Airlines,” Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told reporters last month.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">The letter to Southwest’s board specifically called for the removal of Kelly and Jordan, who <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2024/06/12/southwest-airlines-ceo-bob-jordan-says-he-wont-resign-after-pressure-from-elliott/" target="_blank">publicly told reporters he has no plans to leave</a>.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Elliott’s letter, originally sent to Southwest’s board of directors in June, asked the company to take into account three recommendations: Enhance the board, upgrade leadership and undertake a business review.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">According to a release Wednesday, Southwest’s board and advisers considered Elliott’s stake, the fact that it had not reported its full purported position in Southwest on any filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and that Elliott has made regulatory filings with U.S. antitrust authorities that would provide it the flexibility to acquire a significantly greater percentage of Southwest Airlines’ voting power across two of its funds starting as early as July 11.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Other publicly traded companies have also adopted rights plans, designed to make it harder for outside investment groups to gain enough control of a company’s stock to prevent a board of directors takeover or other moves to control the firm.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">In 2022, Twitter Inc., now known as X, adopted a similar shareholder rights plan which became exercisable if a party acquired 15% of the stock without prior approval, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-15/twitter-adopts-poison-pill-to-ward-off-musk-takeover" target="_blank">according to Bloomberg.</a> At the time, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk was making large cash offers for the company, among other parties interested in buying twitter. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html" target="_blank">Later that year, Musk bought the social media platform for $44 billion.</a></p><p class="body-text-paragraph">To further break it down, Southwest will issue one right for each share of common stock, which will initially trade with Southwest common stock and will become exercisable only if any person or group acquires 12.5% or more, of the company’s outstanding common stock.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">If the rights become exercisable, all holders of rights will be entitled to acquire shares of common stock at a 50% discount to the then-current market price or the company may exchange each right held by such holders for one share of common stock, according to Southwest. Any shareholder that currently owns more than the triggering percentage may continue to own its shares of common stock, but the rights will become exercisable if a shareholder subsequently increases its ownership by one or more shares.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">From a messaging standpoint, Gottfried said, this announcement gives Elliott a “sound bite” that the company is taking steps to bolster its offenses.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">It could further escalate shareholder tensions when Southwest hasn’t been performing well financially. <a href="https://www.southwestairlinesinvestorrelations.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations" target="_blank">Southwest reports its second-quarter results on July 25</a>. <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2024/06/26/southwest-airlines-lowers-financial-expectations-as-activist-investor-pressure-intensifies/" target="_blank">Last week, Southwest lowered its financial expectations for the quarter,</a> “driven primarily by complexities in adapting its revenue management to current booking patterns in this dynamic environment.”</p><p data-oembed-type="raw-html" id="isolated-embed-R7KIHEY7QNDZZJ55JYWVQYICHY"></p><div class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__bZ-w3 py-5 px-7 border border-gray-light my-8 clear-both"><div class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__mrnG- w_full py-5 border-t border-gray-light flex"><a class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__P4zn3 inline-block w-1/3 md_w-1/4 lg_w-1/5 xl_w-1/6 flex flex-col" href="/business/airlines/2024/07/01/airfares-cheaper-for-4th-of-july-travelers-in-dallas-fort-worth-this-year/"><img loading="lazy" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain dmnc_images-modern-image-module__P3kZ4 w-full" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/VMXAVN3YJ5FFZN3WQAFI44NHZQ.jpg?auth=7d8f8314cc49bc5c440e487d916f3a371fe81148e0c8c75cb3155228d611efc2&amp;height=127&amp;width=190&amp;smart=true&amp;quality=40" alt="Travelers walk between the gates of Terminal E at DFW Airport on Monday, June 24, 2024." pinger-seen="true"></a><div class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__DfYNg pl-8 inline-block w-2/3 md_w-3/4 lg_w-4/5 xl_w-5/6"><a class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__1yqCm w-full primaryBold primaryBold-20 mb-3 align-center" href="/business/airlines/2024/07/01/airfares-cheaper-for-4th-of-july-travelers-in-dallas-fort-worth-this-year/"><span class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__HbkRM mr-4">Airfares cheaper for 4th of July travelers in Dallas-Fort Worth this year</span><span class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__27bGq relative inline-flex"></span></a><p class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__T453o w-full break-normal text-gray-dark secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-15">Domestic airfare for the holiday weekend is down 18% from last year, averaging $263 per ticket, according to travel site Hopper.
