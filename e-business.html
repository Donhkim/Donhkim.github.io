<p>At least 1,000 activists participated in the protests, according to police.</p>

<p>Their comments came as authorities readied for a repeat of <a class="internal-link" href="/en/protesters-attempt-to-storm-teslas-factory-near-berlin/a-69046103">violent clashes between police and demonstrators the previous day</a>.<br>

<p>A police spokesperson said that the march on Saturday largely proceeded peacefully.</p>

<p>Police said that there had been minor clashes with activists, but did not initially provide any information on injuries or arrests.</p>

<h2>What did the protesters say?</h2>

<p>The Disrupt Tesla group said the political and environmental problem went beyond the <a class="internal-link" href="/en/elon-musk/t-63587027">Elon Musk</a>-owned carmaker and extended to other auto manufacturers.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter if it's Tesla, VW or Mercedes — car companies and their political supporters are responsible for selling out our lifeblood," said Disrupt Tesla group spokeswoman Lucia Mende, ahead of a planned demonstration.</p>

<p>"We must prevent this and we will prevent it," she added.</p>

<p>Some residents in Grünheide, where <a class="internal-link" href="/en/germany-elon-musk-visits-tesla-factory-after-power-sabotage/a-68511988">billionaire Musk</a> has built his only European Tesla factory, say both the company and the Brandenburg state government have not paid attention to citizens' interests in pressing ahead with the expansion.</p>

<p>"They are going through with it, they are not listening to the sensitivities of the local people," said spokesman Steffen Schorcht, a spokesman for a citizens' initiative. "It only serves the interests of Tesla."</p><div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"><h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Taking on Tesla — Fight for the Forest" class="headline"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"><g fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"></path></g></svg>Taking on Tesla — Fight for the Forest</h2><div class="render-container"><div class="sc-djLfiL bWQlcR sc-gSYeb fALeZZ"><div class="bg-poster"><video id="video-68996009" dir="ltr" controls="" playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-duration="12:36" data-play-btn-title="Play video" class="dw-player video-js vjs-fluid"><source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/repoe/repoe20240504_gesamtHD_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"><track src="https://www.dw.com/media/subtitles/69045611" srclang="en" label="ENGLISH"><p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p></track></source></video></div></div></div></div>

<p>"If you're fighting and keep hitting a wall and don't know what else to do, then sometimes the only thing left is civil disobedience."</p>

<h2>Police prepared for further flare-ups</h2>

<p>Police said they were braced for more trouble after multiple people were arrested after activists attempted to break into the factory on Friday evening.  </p>

<p>Regional broadcaster RBB said several hundred people ran toward the Tesla facility, with many wearing masks and dressed in black.</p>

<p>Hundreds of demonstrators had gathered near the site on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>"We are aware," said a police spokesman adding that the situation had been calm in the night and the morning.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Activists set up a protest camp, including tree houses, near the factory in late February and have been there ever since. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tesla was forced to suspend production in March after an <a class="internal-link" href="/en/germany-tesla-plant-targeted-in-deliberate-arson-police/a-68455762">arson attack on an electricity pylon</a> compromised the factory's power supply.

<p>Opponents of the expansion, which would include a freight depot and requires forest to be cleared, say their concerns are chiefly environmental.</p>

<p>They criticize the production of electric cars in general and have cited fears about the possible pollution of local drinking water.</p>

<p>Activists also cite environmental destruction in countries like Argentina or <a class="internal-link" href="/en/russia-china-ahead-in-race-for-bolivias-lithium/a-67843534">Bolivia where the mineral lithium, needed for electric car batteries, is mined</a>.</p>

<li><strong>UK economy emerges from recession</strong>: The UK economy has emerged from recession, with GDP growing by 0.6% between January and March, exceeding analyst expectations of 0.4% growth.</li>
<li><strong>PM Rishi Sunak's comments</strong>: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said that it will "take time" for people to "really feel better" as the economy recovers from recession. He emphasized that the economy has "real momentum", but more work needs to be done.</li>

<li><strong>GDP growth</strong>: The 0.6% GDP growth is a significant improvement from the negative growth experienced in the second half of last year. This marks a turnaround for the UK economy, which had been in recession since 2022.</li>
<li><strong>More work to do</strong>: Despite the positive economic news, Sunak acknowledged that there is "more work to do" to ensure a sustainable and equitable economic recovery for all citizens.</li>

  <p>The regulations, adopted by the CFPB in March, seek to cap late fees for credit card payments at $8, compared with current late fees of $30 or more. Although a bane for consumers, the fees generate about $9 billion a year for card issuers, according to the agency.</p><p>After the CFPB on March 5 <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-bans-excessive-credit-card-late-fees-lowers-typical-fee-from-32-to-8/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> the ban on what it called "excessive" credit card late fees, the American Bankers Association (ABA) and U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a legal challenge. </p>

<p>The ABA, an industry trade group, applauded Pittman's decision.</p><p>"This injunction will spare banks from having to immediately comply with a rule that clearly exceeds the CFPB's statutory authority and will lead to more late payments, lower credit scores, increased debt, reduced credit access and higher APRs for all consumers — including the vast majority of card holders who pay on time each month," ABA CEO Rob Nichols said in a statement. </p><p>Consumer groups blasted the decision, saying it will hurt credit card users across the U.S.</p><p>"In their latest in a stack of lawsuits designed to pad record corporate profits at the expense of everyone else, the U.S. Chamber got its way for now, ensuring families get price-gouged a little longer with credit card late fees as high as $41," Liz Zelnick of Accountable.US, a nonpartisan advocacy group, said in a statement. "The U.S. Chamber and the big banks they represent have corrupted our judicial system by venue shopping in courtrooms of least resistance, going out of their way to avoid having their lawsuit heard by a fair and neutral federal judge."</p><figure class="embed embed--type-video embed--type-content_video is-video embed--float-none embed--size-medium ">

<p>Despite Pittman's stay on Friday, analysts said the legal fight over late fees is likely to continue, with the case possibly heading to the Supreme Court. </p><p>"We believe this opens the door for the CFPB to seek to lift the preliminary injunction if the Supreme Court rules in the coming weeks that Congress properly funded the agency," Jaret Seiberg of TD Cowen Washington Research Group said in a report following the decision.

<p><span>For six decades, Jim Simons was Stony Brook University’s most vocal champion. His teaching, research, academic and volunteer leadership, and philanthropy have forever transformed the university and his generosity of spirit was matched only by his probing intelligence and profound optimism for the future. Whether as chair of the Department of Mathematics or his leadership on the Stony Brook Foundation Board of Trustees, Jim always saw Stony Brook’s potential. He looked beyond what </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> and saw what </span><i><span>could</span></i><span> be — and he helped bring that future to life.  </span></p>
<p><span>“Jim was a remarkable friend and advocate, both to Stony Brook and to me personally. I am honored to have known him,” said Stony Brook University President Maurie McInnis. “Stony Brook is incredibly fortunate to have been a part of his life and to have shared in his generosity, brilliance, humor, and unending curiosity about the world around him. The University is infinitely better because of Jim, from the students he taught to the research he led, the faculty he supported, and the programs he helped build</span><i><span>.”</span></i></p>
<p><b>An Enduring Impact</b></p>
<p><span>When Stony Brook President John Toll hired Jim to lead the Department of Mathematics in 1968, he could not have foreseen the magnitude of his decision. As the youngest chair in the history of the university, Jim joked that he was given the opportunity because he was the only person who would accept the challenge. Jim’s stereotypical humor aside, he brought his curiosity and intellect to bear on the role and built one of the nation’s top math departments during his 10-year tenure as chair.</span></p>
<p><span> Jim unassumingly credited his success to the team he recruited: “I was able to hire some great people…and we really built up an outstanding department. And that was fun.” </span></p>

Yang.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>One of his most prized relationships was with his colleague in the Department of Physics, Nobel Prize winner C.N. Yang and founding director of the eponymous Institute for Theoretical Physics on Stony Brook’s campus. Their many conversations inspired Jim’s deep interest in the intersection of geometry and physics, ultimately leading to the establishment of the renowned Simons Center for Geometry and Physics (SCGP). </span></p>
<p><span>“From Archimedes to Newton to Einstein, much of the most profound work in physics has been deeply intertwined with the geometric side of mathematics,” said Jim upon the 2008 announcement of the gift that would fund the SCGP. “Since then, in particular with the advent of such areas as quantum field theory and string theory, developments in geometry and physics have become if anything more interrelated. The new Center will give many of the world’s best mathematicians and physicists the opportunity to work and interact in an environment and an architecture carefully designed to enhance progress. We believe there is a chance that work accomplished at the Center will significantly change and deepen our understanding of the physical universe and of its basic mathematical structure.”</span></p>
<p><span>Since then, the SCGP has evolved into an internationally renowned think tank whose permanent members have been elected as Fellows of the Royal Society, the American Mathematical Society, the Japanese National Academy of Sciences, as well as received the Fields Medal, Shaw Prize, Packard Fellowship, Clay Research Award and  Dannie Heineman Prize as well as many other awards. </span></p>

<p><span>Beyond his academic leadership, Jim helped inspire the next generation of volunteer leaders through his participation in and stewardship of the Stony Brook Foundation Board of Trustees. </span></p>
<p><span>“One of the great privileges of my life has been to know and work with Jim Simons for the past three decades,” said Richard Gelfond ’76, Stony Brook Foundation Board of Trustees Chair. “His service on the Board strengthened all of us. He had a way of immediately getting to the fundamental issues and asking the right questions. His unique wit, incredible intellect and philanthropy, particularly toward Stony Brook, will always be remembered. I will miss him mightily.”</span></p>
<p><b>Philanthropy on an Astonishing Scale</b></p>
<p><span>Jim’s influence at Stony Brook extends far beyond his intellectual contributions. He met his wife Marilyn through Stony Brook, and together they created an extraordinary legacy of impactful philanthropy for the university that has </span><span>surpassed $1 billion. As if their own remarkable contributions weren’t enough, the Simons directly inspired more than 2,100 people to contribute an additional $230 million in philanthropy for scholarships, faculty support, and the university’s endowment.</span></p>
<p><span>Through Jim and Marilyn’s foresight, strategic counsel, and investment, they have been instrumental in making Stony Brook a highly ranked national research university and an unmatched agent of progress and social mobility.</span></p>
<p><span>Examples of some of Jim and Marilyn’s substantial investments include:</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><b>Simons Center for Geometry and Physics (SCGP)</b>,<span> which opened at Stony Brook University in 2010 thanks to Jim and Marilyn’s philanthropic support and Jim’s belief that progress in mathematics and theoretical physics can be made when researchers come together in an environment that encourages the sharing of ideas, bridging divides and increasing innovation. </span></p>
<p><span>In addition to the center, the Simons established the </span><b>Simons Math and Physics Operating Funds</b><span> to ensure that Stony Brook’s Mathematics and Physics departments consistently rank among the top in the nation.</span></p>

<p><span>The Simons also played a significant role in elevating what is now the renowned</span><b> Renaissance School of Medicine</b>. <span>Through a matching challenge gift announced in 2011, Jim and Marilyn transformed research across several areas of the medical and life sciences. Ultimately, their matching gift and the philanthropy it inspired provided critical funding for research excellence in the School of Medicine as well as other parts of the university, faculty hires through new endowed professorships, and recruitment of top-level graduate and undergraduate students. As a result of this historic investment, Stony Brook was able to build the Center for Medical and Research Translation (MART). </span></p>
<p><span>Announced in late 2020, the </span><b>Presidential Innovation and Excellence Fund</b><span> has enabled Stony Brook to attract preeminent scholars, pursue cutting-edge research, and win leadership of the Center for Climate Solutions on Governors Island through the New York Climate Exchange.The Simons Foundation provided seed money for the fund, with a matching challenge that attracted additional philanthropy from other generous donors. This fund makes it possible for Stony Brook to invest in current strengths and pursue big and bold opportunities that address the world’s most critical challenges of the future.</span></p>

<p><span>Founded in 1984, the </span><b>Simons Summer Research Program</b><span> has helped more than a thousand high school students conduct innovative research alongside esteemed faculty mentors.  </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Through these initiatives and programs, Jim’s influence and impact spanned the tenure of former Stony Brook leaders John Toll, Jack Marburger, Shirley Strum Kenny, and Sam Stanley — and that impact lives on through the students, faculty, and research he enabled and through the relationships he made.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Jim was among the finest people I’ve ever known,” said Samuel L. Stanley, Jr., MD. “His magnificent mind was enhanced by his vision and optimism. The result was an incomparable leader and philanthropist who has helped provide Stony Brook with infinite possibilities and the capacity to reach unparalleled heights in the areas of research, education and discovery. ”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Jim was not only mathematically brilliant but also a visionary advisor about what Stony Brook could — and did — become,” Shirley Strum Kenny said. “Stony Brook would not be Stony Brook without Jim’s vision and commitment.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The satisfaction of seeing Stony Brook thrive fueled their generosity, as Jim reflected: “Stony Brook gave me a chance to lead —and so it has been deeply rewarding to watch the University grow and flourish even more.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Jim Simons leaves a tremendous and incomparable legacy at Stony Brook University,” reflected President McInnis. “His inquisitiveness, vision, caring, and extraordinary philanthropy have made an indelible and irreplaceable impact on every corner of the University. Through his generosity, his intellect, and his leadership he will continue to enrich lives and advance science and knowledge at Stony Brook for generations to come.”</p>

The surge in retirees is <a href="https://www.empower.com/the-currency/money/silver-wave-4-million-americans-will-turn-65-2024#:~:text=Turning%2065%20in%202024%20is,of%2010%2C000%20the%20decade%20before." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:expected to last through 2027;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="0">expected to last through 2027</a>.</p><p>While boomers have had decades to save, invest, and prepare for the next chapter, there are a few strategies they may have overlooked. For those nearing retirement, here are five tips from financial advisors to maximize money—and longevity—in the golden years.</p><h2>1. Consider a <strong>Roth conversion</strong></h2><p>Most people are familiar with 401(k)s and IRAs, but there are other retirement accounts that belong in your financial plan, like a Roth IRA. Though they are usually thought to be best for younger workers due to the <a href="https://www.schwab.com/ira/roth-ira/contribution-limits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:income cap on contributions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0">income cap on contributions</a>, you can still get the benefits of a Roth even if you make too much to contribute to one outright, via a Roth conversion.</p><p>As the name implies, the strategy involves converting your traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. When you make the conversion, you’re essentially moving funds from a pre-tax vehicle to a post-tax vehicle; you’ll pay taxes on the money now at your current rate, and then it will grow tax-free.</p><p>The benefits are plenty, advisors say. You’ll enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement (assuming you meet the other requirements) and no required-minimum distributions during your lifetime. This is a good way to add tax diversification to your financial plan and reduce your lifetime tax bill.</p><h2>2. Optimize your taxable account</h2><p>Speaking of which, tax diversification can go beyond 401(k)s and IRAs. Taxable accounts also play an important role, and it's important to know which to tap first.</p><p>"With a 401(k) or IRA, it is all pre-tax and subject to income tax, so the federal and state government may 'own' around 30% to 50% of those accounts," says Scott Bishop, a Texas-based certified financial planner (CFP). "If money is in a Roth IRA or taxable brokerage account, the results may be different."</p><p>A taxable account doesn't have the tax benefits of a retirement account, but it also doesn't have the restrictions they do. It allows you to invest for the future, but without the contribution limits, withdrawal penalties, required distributions, and so on.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>It is especially useful to have some funds in a brokerage account if you're not sure what tax bracket you'll be in in retirement; withdrawals from a taxable account are taxed at the <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/smart-money/capital-gains-tax-rates" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:capital gains rate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="0">capital gains rate</a>, whereas money taken out of a 401(k) is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate (which will likely be higher). And with a taxable account, only the gains are taxed, whereas the entire withdrawal from a 401(k) is. Having an array of accounts allows you to develop a strategic withdrawal strategy.</p><p>"Just as you diversify your investments to help tackle the uncertainty of the markets, diversifying the tax treatment of your accounts can help you weather the uncertainty of the tax landscape and manage your income in retirement," writes Judith Ward, a CFP, for <a href="https://www.troweprice.com/personal-investing/resources/insights/4-reasons-to-save-for-retirement-in-a-taxable-account.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:T. Rowe Price;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0">T. Rowe Price</a>.</p><p>And of course, you will want a chunk of money set aside in cash, in case of emergency. Wes Battle, a Maryland-based CFP, says the ideal amount is six months' worth of expenses.</p><h2>3. Delay Social Security</h2><p>Though some people are eligible to start taking Social Security benefits as early as 62, financial advisors say it's best to postpone doing so until age 70, or at least to when you reach the so-called full retirement age, if at all possible. That will increase the benefit amount and help you lower your taxable income, because you will have spent some of your savings from your other retirement accounts first. "This is one of the most overlooked opportunities in financial planning," says Andy Baxley, a CFP in Illinois.</p><p>The full retirement age depends on when you were born. For those born in 1960 or later, full retirement age is 67. For those born between 1955 through the end of 1959, it is between 66 and 2 months and 66 and 10 months. If you were born before 1955, it is 66 (and you've already reached it). Delaying until age 70 means you can earn a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/delayret.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"delayed retirement" credit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link " data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="0">"delayed retirement" credit</a>, which gets you a higher benefit.</p><p>Even if 70 isn't likely, delaying them even a few years or months can make a big difference in the size of the check you end up getting. You can view your projected benefit amount on your annual Social Security statement, which you can view on the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/statement.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Social Security Administration's website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="0">Social Security Administration's website</a>.</p><h2>4. Fine-tune your budget</h2><p>Many people (and <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/06/22/americans-save-millions-work-longer-to-retire-comfortably/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:financial media;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="0">financial media</a>) focus on reaching a <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/17/comfortable-retirement-requires-saving-more-than-one-million/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:magic retirement savings "number,";elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link " data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="0">magic retirement savings "number,"</a> be it $1 million or <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/10/magic-retirement-number-financial-advisors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$1.46 million or more;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="0">$1.46 million or more</a>. But the more important numbers for near-retirees to focus on are actually those in their retirement budget, says Bishop. They can be broken into the following categories:</p><ol class="caas-list"><li><p><strong>Fixed costs</strong>. That's your mortgage or rent, insurance, property taxes, food, healthcare, and so on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discretionary costs</strong>. That includes estimated expenses for the fun things you'll do in retirement, including traveling, dining out, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Planned future costs</strong>. Fixed and discretionary costs may make up most of your budget most of the time, but you can run into trouble if you're not anticipating other expenses, like home repair costs, new cars, long-term care, etc.</p></li></ol><p>The budget "needs to be thoughtful and conservative," Bishop says. An advisor can help you think through contingent costs and craft one that works for your family.</p><p>That said, your budget can always change. Sandi Weaver, a CFP in Kansas, suggests testing out a monthly withdrawal amount for around six months, and then readjusting as needed. Expenses change in retirement, and it's okay for your plan to change too.</p><p>"Don't sweat the small stuff," Weaver says. "The retirement phase is long, [potentially] 30-plus years, so if you get the finances wrong for one to two years, you can get it back on track."</p><h2>5. Make an 'unretirement plan'</h2><p>Finally, advisors say while getting the finances and tax strategies right is important, equally so is making the most of your days in retirement: You have a financial plan, but you'll want a holistic life plan as well. How will you keep your mind and body healthy? Are you interested in volunteering? Would part-time work be better? Do you want to help with your grandkids? Without some forethought, it might be more difficult than you think to easily fill your time.</p><p>One strategy is to <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/16/baby-boomers-unretirement-plans-not-your-grandparents-retirement/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:create a so-called unretirement plan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="0">create a so-called unretirement plan</a>. Outlined by Mark Walton, a Peabody award-winning journalist, in his book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unretired-Highly-Effective-People-Happily/dp/1736009400/ref=sr_1_1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Unretired: How Highly Effective People Live Happily Ever After;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="0">Unretired: How Highly Effective People Live Happily Ever After</a></em>, this involves thinking through what fascinates you and what you could dedicate your time to in retirement. It could be (full- or part-time) work, though it doesn't have to be.</p><p>"Soon-to-be retirees should keep in mind that those who are retiring to something are more successful than those that are retiring from something," says Howard Pressman, a Virginia-based CFP. "Twenty-four hours is a long time if you're just sitting on the porch yelling at the neighborhood kids to stay off your lawn."</p><p>He suggests asking yourself questions including, where will you live? How will you stay engaged? How will you stay active? How will you replace lost social connections from work?</p><p>"The clearer this vision is, the easier the transition will be," says Pressman. "There's a big difference between a financially secure retirement and a happy retirement."</p><p>This story was originally featured on <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/11/record-number-americans-retire-2024-financial-planners-advice/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="0">Fortune.com</a></p></div></div>

Cleveland debuted what is considered the first “municipal traffic control system” in 1914, historian Megan Kate Nelson <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/brief-history-stoplight-180968734/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote for Smithsonian Magazine</a></span>. Powered by the electricity from the city’s trolley line, engineer James Hodge’s invention featured two lights: red and green, the colors long used by railroads. A police officer sitting in a booth on the sidewalk had to flip a switch to change the signal.</p>
    

<p>A few years later, Detroit police officer William Potts is credited with adding the yellow light, though as a city employee he couldn’t patent it. By 1930, Nelson wrote, all major American cities and many smaller ones had at least one <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/blind-pedestrians-safer-crosswalks-signals-chicago-61d62685127d3e2228e91860e2c998b2">electrical traffic signal</a></span>.</p>



<p>The advent of connected and automated vehicles, though, has presented a world of new possibilities for traffic signals.</p>
    
<p>Among those reimagining traffic flows is a team at North Carolina State University led by Ali Hajbabaie, an associate engineering professor. Rather than doing away with today’s traffic signals, Hajbabaie suggests adding a fourth light, perhaps a white one, to indicate when there are enough autonomous vehicles on the road to take charge and lead the way.</p>
    

<p>“When we get to the intersection, we stop if it’s red and we go if it’s green,” said Hajbabaie, whose team used model cars small enough to hold. “But if the white light is active, you just follow the vehicle in front of you.”</p><p>Although Hajbabaie’s research refers to a “white phase” and possibly even a white light, the specific color isn’t important, he said. Current lights could even suffice, say, by modifying them to flash red and green simultaneously to signal that driverless cars are in charge. The key would be making sure that it’s universally adopted like the current signals are.</p><p>Using such an approach would be years away, as it would require 40% to 50% of vehicles on the road to be self-driving in order to work, Hajbabaie acknowledged.</p><p>Waymo spokesperson Sandy Karp pointed out that the self-driving car subsidiary of Google’s parent company launched a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/waymo-google-robotaxis-driverless-los-angeles-expansion-6f06b65b5ad14f3f19609190c64d131f">fully autonomous ride-sharing service</a></span> in Los Angeles and Austin, Texas, even without the addition of a fourth traffic light.</p><p>“While it is good at this early stage of AV development that people are thinking creatively about how to facilitate the safe deployment of safe AVs, policymakers and infrastructure owners should be careful about jumping too soon on AV-specific investments that may turn out to be premature or even unnecessary,” Karp said in an email to The Associated Press.</p>
    

<p>University of Michigan researchers have taken a different approach. They conducted a pilot program in the Detroit suburb of Birmingham using insights from the speed and location data found in General Motors vehicles to alter the timing of that city’s traffic lights. The researchers recently landed a U.S. Department of Transportation grant under the bipartisan infrastructure law to test how to make the changes in real time.</p><p>Because the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45427-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michigan research</a></span> deals with vehicles that have drivers, not fully autonomous ones, it could be much closer to wider implementation than what Hajbabaie is seeking.</p><p>Liu, who has been leading the Michigan research, said even with as little as 6% of the vehicles on Birmingham’s streets connected to the GM system, they provide enough data to adjust the timing of the traffic lights to smooth the flow.</p>
    

<p>The 34 traffic signals in Birmingham were chosen because, like more than half of the signals nationwide, they’re set to a fixed-time schedule without any cameras or sensors to monitor congestion. Liu said although there are higher-tech solutions to monitoring traffic, they require cities to make complex and expensive upgrades.</p><p>“The beauty of this is you don’t have to do anything to the infrastructure,” Liu said. “The data is not coming from the infrastructure. It’s coming from the car companies.”</p><p>Danielle Deneau, director of traffic safety at the Road Commission in Oakland County, Michigan, said the initial data in Birmingham only adjusted the timing of green lights by a few seconds, but it was still enough to reduce congestion. Even bigger changes could be in store under the new grant-funded research, which would automate the traffic lights in a yet-to-be announced location in the county.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">At the start of the year, Tesla’s Supercharger team was tasked with the impossible. “We were on an exponential path,” a former team member told TechCrunch, adding that the new targets were “super-duper crazy.” Despite the bottlenecks that such expectations can create, “every time they upped the metric, we met it.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Then, one day in April, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/30/elon-musk-tesla-charging-policy-layoffs-cuts/">CEO Elon Musk axed the entire division</a>, even though it was profitable last year. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">With more than<a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity-locations#/analyze?country=US&amp;fuel=ELEC&amp;ev_networks=Tesla" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 25,000 charging ports</a> in the U.S. and over 50,000 worldwide, the Supercharger network is the undisputed king of EV fast charging. Widespread, well-maintained and fast, the network has transformed the way people viewed EVs, assuaging concerns about range anxiety for wide swaths of the car-buying public. But with the recent layoffs, Musk cast a cloud over the private infrastructure project.</p>

	
	


	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While some people expected layoffs to hit the Supercharger division, few thought it would be eliminated. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“We built the best network in the world,” according to the former Tesla employee who spoke to TechCrunch. “We were minding the ship. Nothing was frivolous.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It wasn’t enough to save the team. Hundreds of people who were responsible for the construction of a linchpin for the company were suddenly gone. That wipeout has industry watchers, shareholders and former Tesla employees wondering how it will affect EV owners and the company. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The automaker has hit a rough patch lately, with sales not growing at their usual breakneck pace. Price cuts aimed at boosting sales have affected profits, which were<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/23/tesla-profits-drop-55-company-says-ev-sales-under-pressure-from-hybrids/"> down 55%</a> in the first quarter from the same year-ago period. With Tesla getting squeezed, Musk made cuts — not with a scalpel, but with a chainsaw.</p>

</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Tesla<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/16/tesla-layoffs-hit-high-performers-slashes-some-departments-sources-say/"> started cutting staff</a>, and the first round of layoffs wasn’t the last. The Supercharger division, around<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/musk-plans-more-layoffs-as-two-senior-tesla-executives-depart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 500 people</a> strong, were let go in a second wave that broke at the end of April.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">On Friday, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1788834859110002716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that Tesla will spend $500 million on expanding and upgrading the Supercharger network. But as insider knowledge shows, it will be hard to hit that target without a team to oversee the work.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Before the layoffs, the Supercharger network appeared poised to extend its lead over competitors. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">One source explained that Tesla had refined production and installation of Superchargers to the point where each post could cost as little as $20,000 to install, less than half the nearest competitor. A significantly more powerful version 4 of the Supercharger hardware, once poised for a broader rollout, now appears stalled.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At the time of the layoffs, dozens of Supercharger sites were in various stages of planning and construction, according to insider information shared with TechCrunch. Some sites that were almost ready to be opened are either in limbo or may not be opened at all, the source said.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Tesla was previously in a strong position to win awards through the federally funded National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which has $5 billion to disburse to build a robust nationwide network of fast chargers. </p>

	
	


	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company had also been focusing its expansion plans on places with high demand, they added. Where the federal government was interested in improving coverage on a certain route and demand hadn’t yet materialized, Tesla’s policy team would prioritize winning NEVI funding for the site, according to the source.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“Everything was purposeful. Everything had a target,” one source told TechCrunch..</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Often that meant building Superchargers at new sites, which are more straightforward to develop. Expanding existing ones is incredibly challenging, the source said, because leases often need to be renegotiated, utility upgrades coordinated and existing infrastructure worked around, all while continuing to serve existing customers. “Your cost per stall is exponentially higher than a fresh site.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Analysts have long speculated that the Supercharger network could easily become a<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/08/25/tesla-supercharger-network-billion-business-wedbush/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> profit center</a>, much like Amazon did when it opened its cloud services to other companies. But there, Tesla had Amazon beat: The Supercharger team was told that the network was profitable, the source said, even before other automakers gained access.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_92.jpg?w=680" alt="Tesla-supercharger" class="wp-image-2770286" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_92.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_92.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_92.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_92.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_92.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_92.jpg?resize=1200,801 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_92.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tesla</figcaption></figure>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Tesla opened the first Supercharger station in September 2012 as the first examples of the Model S prowled the streets. Early models could deliver 100 kW, which was a big number at the time: CHAdeMO, a competing standard used by the Nissan Leaf, maxed out at 62.5 kW at the time, and the Combined Charging System (CCS) was still in the prototype phase.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The first stations opened in California, and soon more started sprouting up along highways on the East Coast, then the Midwest and Texas. Within a year, the company upgraded the equipment, bumping maximum power to 120 kW. And within three years, Tesla had a network that<a href="https://supercharge.info/map" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> spanned the U.S.</a>, making coast-to-coast electric travel possible. As the company entered Europe, China and other countries, it added Superchargers there, too. Today, the network supports nearly 60,000 charging stalls on four continents.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_78.jpg?w=680" alt="" class="wp-image-2770310" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_78.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_78.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_78.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_78.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_78.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_78.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_78.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tesla</figcaption></figure>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In the early years, Tesla Model S and X owners enjoyed unlimited charging at the stations — an incentive aimed at winning over new customers. When the Model 3 rolled out, the company started billing new owners for charging sessions, though the process was far easier than what competitors offered. Drivers simply had to plug the car in, and Tesla would bill a credit card on file.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Today’s Supercharger posts support up to 250 kW charging speeds. Other networks top out at 350 kW, but they aren’t nearly as reliable. Tesla says its <a href="https://www.tesla.com/impact/product" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">network’s uptime is 99.95%</a>, far better than its competitors. Real-world usage suggests that’s not far from the truth: A University of California–Berkeley survey of EV drivers in the San Francisco Bay Area found that while 25% of non-Tesla drivers experienced major problems with public chargers, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16372#:~:text=For%20public%20EV%20charging%20stations,of%20the%20time%20based%20on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 4% of Tesla drivers did at Superchargers</a>.</p>

	
	


	
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-other-evs-use-superchargers"><strong>Can other EVs use Superchargers?</strong></h2>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_75.jpg?w=680" alt="" class="wp-image-2770292" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_75.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_75.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_75.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_75.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_75.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_75.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Supercharger_75.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tesla</figcaption></figure>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For over a decade, Superchargers were available only to Tesla owners. Because charge sessions had to be initiated by a handshake between the vehicle and the charger, and because billing happened behind the scenes, Tesla had tight control over who could use them. The company’s proprietary plug design didn’t hurt, either.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">That started to change in the fall of 2022, when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/11/tesla-opens-its-ev-connector-design-to-other-automakers/">made the details of its plug design available</a> to other automakers. (By that point, Tesla was already using the same communications protocol as CCS when charging.) Then, in May 2023, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/25/ford-to-bring-teslas-charging-tech-into-its-future-evs/">Ford announced</a> that it would adopt Tesla’s plug design, known as the North American Charging Standard, and that its customers would gain access to 12,000 Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada. Soon,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/30/electrify-america-nacs/"> the floodgates opened</a>, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/gm-follows-fords-lead-and-adopts-tesla-chargers/"> GM</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/25/rivian-adopts-tesla-charging-standard-cruise-adds-android-and-ford-lands-a-9-2b-loan/"> Rivian</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/27/volvo-becomes-latest-automaker-to-adopt-tesla-ev-charging-standard/"> Volvo</a> and others followed suit. Today, all major automakers selling in the U.S. have adopted the NACS.</p>

	
	


	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">These are all the major brands that have announced adoption of the NACS for future EVs:</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In February, Tesla started granting automakers access.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-the-supercharger-network"><strong>What’s next for the Supercharger network?</strong></h2>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">No one really knows. With future Supercharger sites in limbo, it’s possible that the network has reached its zenith, at least for the time being. Musk has said that expansion at new sites will continue “at a slower pace” and the focus will be on “100% uptime and expansion of existing locations.” Without a team in place, all of that will be challenging, especially work on existing locations, which are more complex endeavors.</p>

<p>Due to a recent multi-day computer system failure, doctors and nurses at Ascension hospitals are struggling to operate effectively. The Dean of UWM's College of Health Professions and Sciences, Kim Litwack, describes the situation as a major disruption to healthcare systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lack of functioning electronic health records is causing significant problems for medical professionals, including the inability to access patient phone numbers, order prescriptions, and view lab test results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Litwack suggests that the rising frequency of cyber-attacks on healthcare giants may necessitate incorporating crisis management into nursing education. She believes that healthcare professionals need to learn how to respond to such disruptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The duration of the outage at Ascension hospitals remains unknown; however, the situation highlights the importance of having a backup plan and disaster recovery strategies in place to minimize the impact of such disruptions on healthcare services.</p>

<p>The Dean told TMJ4 that the multi-day computer system failure has majorly impacted how doctors and nurses operate.</p><p>"It really has brought healthcare systems to a standstill. We don't have mechanisms in place to deal with this. We don't know how to contact patients if you can’t look up phone numbers, we can’t order prescriptions, we can’t look at lab tests."</p><p>Litwack explains the situation is the equivalent of having to re-learn your day-to-day operations.</p><p>And though schools don't teach students how to paper chart anymore, the rising frequency of cyber-attacks on healthcare giants means crisis management might make its way to the curriculum.</p><p>"I think we have to start bringing it up. We have to bring it up with our nursing staff, we bring it up with physical therapy," Litwack said.</p><p>There's no telling how long before this Ascension outage is fixed.</p><hr>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strong debut</strong>: Zeekr Intelligent Technology Holding Limited's (ZK) shares closed 35% higher than its initial public offering (IPO) price of $21 per share on its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).</li>
<li><strong>Valuation</strong>: Zeekr's fully diluted valuation is $6.8 billion, making it a sizable player in the electric vehicle (EV) market.</li>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: Zeekr is a Chinese automaker and a subsidiary of Geely Holding, which owns Volvo Cars and Lotus Cars. The company has delivered over 240,000 vehicles to date and plans to sell vehicles in European, Middle Eastern, and other Asian markets.</li>
<li><strong>Financials</strong>: Zeekr disclosed a surge in total revenue to 51.67 billion yuan ($7.15 billion) in 2023, but its net loss widened to 8.26 billion yuan. The company's net loss is a concern, but its growth potential is promising.</li>
<li><strong>Industry context</strong>: Zeekr's IPO comes as other US-based EV makers, such as Tesla (TSLA) and Rivian (RIVN), are facing a stock slump. Tesla's stock has fallen 32.2% year-to-date, while Rivian's stock has fallen nearly 52.7%.</li>

<p><strong>McDonald's introduces $5 Meal Deal</strong>: McDonald's is launching a new promotion to attract customers, the $5 Meal Deal, which includes a burger, fries, and a drink.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflation's impact on sales</strong>: McDonald's global sales have slowed down due to inflation-driven cost-of-living crisis, and more Americans are opting to eat at home due to high prices.</p>

<p><strong>McDonald's CEO's focus on affordability</strong>: McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski emphasizes the company's focus on affordability, saying they need to be "laser-focussed on affordability", with a mention that all income cohorts are seeking value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Franchisee concerns</strong>: The $5 Meal Deal faces significant challenges as franchise owners are concerned about further loss of earnings, with 95% of them rejecting the offer earlier in the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regional challenges</strong>: In California, the new law requiring fast-food workers to be paid at least $20 an hour has led to price hikes at fast-food outlets, which could affect the rollout of the $5 Meal Deal in the state.</p>

<p>The geopolitical landscape has certainly been ever-changing over the last several years. That has, in large part, been due to the rising prominence of the <a href="https://watcher.guru/news/brics-continues-stockpiling-gold-in-massive-numbers">BRICS economic alliance</a>. Subsequently, amid that shift, BRICS mainstay China has seen its economy experience major growth. </p>
<p>Indeed, China’s National Bureau of Statistics released the nation’s Q1 GDP figure in April. That showcased an impressive growth trajectory, with the future <a href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Chinas-Oil-Demand-Set-For-A-Major-Bounce-Back.html">up more than 5% year over year</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brics-bloc-to-benefit-from-china-s-surging-economic-growth-in-2024">BRICS Bloc to Benefit From China’s Surging Economic Growth in 2024 </h2>
<p>Throughout the last year, global economics has undergone the beginnings of notable transitions. Indeed, geopolitics has seen the BRICS alliance emerge in hopes of orchestrating a multipolar world. That has been driven by its de-dollarization efforts, as it seeks to lessen international dominance by Western finance. </p>


<p>That goal may well be accomplished by the BRICS bloc, as China has seen its economy experience major economic growth just a few months into the year. Its overall GDP has far outpaced forecasts, with a host of sectors leading its overall growth throughout 2023. </p>
<p>Conversely, one of the largest facets of the economic growth China has enjoyed is connected to its oil demand. The overall positive performance of its economy has driven oil demand up, although it has not yet impacted its price. Still, it could impact the overall oil sector in another massive way.</p>

<p>Specifically, China has purchased discounted oil from both Russia and Iran at discounted prices. However, this is important because it can feed into one of the alliance’s most important initiatives; de-dollarization. </p>
<p>This oil is being purchased primarily through the yuan. That is both good for Chian and the overall alliance. The consistent absence of the greenback is a notable facet of the BRICS continued plan. Alternatively, the promotion of the alliance’s local currency thus impacts its overall journey toward multipolarity. </p>


<p>Altogether, China’s economy could be a major driving force in these other facets. With so many experts concerned over the US dollar’s fate, it may not have come in a better year. The alliance is looking to surge in overall value through the continued growth of its most prominent participants. </p>

<p>When the EU Parliament approved the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act in early 2024, Deutsche Telekom, a leading German telecommunications provider, felt confident and prepared. Since establishing its <a href="https://www.telekom.com/en/company/digital-responsibility/details/artificial-intelligence-ai-guideline-524366">responsible AI principles</a> in 2018, the company had worked to embed these principles into the development cycle of its AI-based products and services. “We anticipated that AI regulations were on the horizon and encouraged our development teams to integrate the principles into their operations upfront to avoid disruptive adjustments later on. Responsible AI has now become part of our operations,” explained Maike Scholz, Group Compliance and Business Ethics at Deutsche Telekom.</p> 
<p>Regrettably, our research suggests that such proactive measures are the <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/DELCCT-5">exception rather than the rule.</a> While AI ethics is high on the agenda for many organizations, translating AI principles into practices and behaviors <a href="/2020/10/a-practical-guide-to-building-ethical-ai">is proving easier said than done</a>. However, with stiff financial penalties at stake for noncompliance, there’s little time to waste. What should leaders do to double-down on their responsible AI initiatives?</p> 
<p>To find answers, we engaged with organizations across a variety of industries, each at a different stage of implementing responsible AI. While data engineers and data scientists typically take on most responsibility from conception to production of AI development lifecycles, nontechnical leaders can play a key role in ensuring the integration of responsible AI. We identified four key moves — <strong>translate, integrate, calibrate</strong> and <strong>proliferate </strong>— that leaders can make to ensure that responsible AI practices are fully integrated into broader operational standards.</p> 
<h2>Move #1: Translate high-level principles into practical guidance</h2> 
<p>Many organizations craft an <a href="/2023/06/13-principles-for-using-ai-responsibly">AI ethics charter</a> but often struggle to implement AI principles into their daily operations. With <a href="https://doteveryone.org.uk/report/workersview/">79% of tech workers reporting a need for practical resources </a>to help them navigate ethical concerns, these principles need to be translated into practical guidance.</p> 
<p>It’s a process that takes time. Deutsche Telekom’s self-binding principles committed to the responsible, supportive, transparent, and trustworthy use of AI. Yet, the company soon realized that these principles were too abstract for their developers and they set about translating them into more actionable and operational terms. In 2021, the company unveiled the <a href="https://www.telekom.com/en/company/digital-responsibility/details/what-that-means-for-our-employees-637074">AI Engineering and Usage guidelines</a>, which documented best practices, methods and tips for embedding the principles into AI development processes. These guidelines provided specific actions to be taken before, during, and after the launch of an AI development project, highlighting essential considerations for business owners, project managers, product teams, and operational teams. Available in both German and English, each guideline was clearly documented and made accessible to all employees.</p> 
<p>Similarly, the process of integrating AI ethics at Thomson Reuters, a global content and technology company, was central to how it built and applied AI technology. A critical aspect of this journey involved effectively translating <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/artificial-intelligence/ai-principles.html#:~:text=Data%20and%20AI%20ethics%20principles&amp;text=That%20Thomson%20Reuters%20will%20prioritize,and%20AI%20products%20and%20services">data and AI ethics principles</a>, which emphasized trust, into a comprehensive <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/content/dam/ewp-m/documents/thomsonreuters/en/pdf/information-security/thomson-reuters-ai-security-governance-whitepaper.pdf">data and AI governance program.</a> The company emphasized the reflective nature of this process that involved asking questions such as, “What are the fundamental building blocks and processes?” and “What expectations should be set for every employee?”</p> 
<h3>Key Actions: Facilitating Alignment</h3> 
<p><strong>Keep teams together:</strong> Compliance and digital teams have often had a rocky relationship. Compliance is viewed as an impediment to digital innovation, while digital teams are seen as risk-seeking mavericks. Successful alignment between the two often rests on the governance structure. At Thomson Reuters, the ethics team worked closely with the data and model governance team. The two teams covered different aspects of the same topic, such as how to ensure that data was used responsibly and securely across the organization. Working closely together signaled the importance of digital ethics as a fundamental aspect of the AI development process.</p> 
<p><strong>Facilitate open dialogs: </strong>Creating open dialogs is as important as establishing a well-structured governance system.</p> 
<p>We found that organizations excelled when they actively engaged in discussions around the complexity of ethical AI deployment. Take Deutsche Telekom’s initiative to translate the principle of transparency into customer service announcements leveraging AI chatbots. Concerns were raised by the service department about the potential for customer disengagement if greeted with formal messages such as, “Hello, I am the digital service assistant at Deutsche Telekom.” This concern led to extensive deliberations amongst the compliance, ethics, and service departments, that eventually led to the development of a working group to devise a suitable solution.</p> 
<h2>Move #2: Integrate ethical considerations into AI design and development processes</h2> 
<p>The next step is to integrate ethical considerations into the AI development routine. For many AI projects, ethical issues unfortunately arise post-deployment.  To prevent such problems, many organizations have adopted a proactive approach, addressing ethical concerns during the development stage.</p> 
<p>We found that organizations, especially those with strong data governance, leveraged their existing privacy processes to incorporate additional AI ethics principles. This approach enabled them to build on proven internal procedures and adapt them in response to changing regulatory requirements and market expectations. Operating in a highly regulated sector, Spanish banking giant CaixaBank had established robust privacy procedures for any new technology development. In 2020, the Spanish regulator introduced new requirements for the responsible use of AI models that leverage personal data, including more than 100 controls related to transparency, explainability, fairness (bias control), and robustness (accuracy). To comply with this new regulation, CaixaBank adapted its existing privacy methodology and validation processes for the development of AI models. As internal sources described, “We follow our privacy processes for AI ethics to take advantage of everything the organization has built until now.”</p> 
<h3>Key Actions: Navigating and Supporting</h3> 
<p><strong>Adapt for Operational Relevance: </strong>Organizations are tasked with implementing frameworks that not only adhere to global standards but also resonate with their unique operational realities. A 2019 study identified <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h6nK9K7qspG74_HyVlT0Lx97URM0dRoGbJ3ivPxMhaE/edit">106 tools and methodologies</a>, and this number continues to grow. Leaders can help sift through this crowded landscape to ensure that AI tools and frameworks are both comprehensive and operationally relevant. For instance, when SwissPost, the national postal service of Switzerland, realized that a self-certification process they were piloting significantly overlapped with their pre-existing ISO certification requirements. They responded by developing a streamlined process incorporating only non-ISO questions. Sophia Ding, Digital Ethics &amp; AI Specialist explained, “We recognized the importance of customizing tools to fit specific organizational needs and contexts.”<br> <strong> </strong><br> <strong>Provide Ongoing Support: </strong>The journey does not end with the initial setup of ethical guardrails; it requires continuous support and oversight. Organizations can establish mechanisms for ongoing support to answer questions as they arise. By setting up a centralized email account, Deutsche Telekom invited individuals and teams to submit inquiries regarding AI ethics implementation. The compliance team also consulted on projects, provided advice and, in some instances, issued internal ethical certifications. These certifications helped product owners in assessing whether their AI projects adhered to ethical standards. To further ensure adherence, the team conducted random audits, selecting 10% of all AI projects each year to review for compliance with ethical guidelines. Such actions helped to ensure that AI ethics integration was not a one-off task but a continuous process.</p> 
<h2>Move #3: Calibrate AI solutions in response to local conditions and changing technologies.</h2> 
<p>In the testing and evaluation phases, the primary goal is to verify that the AI solution meets the original objectives and requirements. An essential aspect of the calibration phase is to ensure that the solution remains relevant to real-world applications. Over time, there can be a divergence between the scenarios for which the AI solution was created and evolving real-world situations.</p> 
<p>Continuous monitoring is necessary to detect and adapt to any changes. However, a significant challenge highlighted by many organizations was the limited bandwidth for continuous monitoring post-deployment. To address this issue, several tactics can be employed. First, the responsibility for active monitoring of AI ethics should be distributed across the organization to deployment teams and user communities. This approach facilitates ongoing dialogue and communication, ensuring that any issues are promptly identified and resolved. Second, prioritizing high-risk use cases for more focused attention is vital.</p> 
<h3>Key Actions: Sustaining Momentum</h3> 
<p>Monitoring and adjusting AI solutions in response to local conditions and changing technologies requires substantial investments in time and resources, particularly in staffing and implementing “red flag” procedures.</p> 
<p><strong>Position Responsible AI as a Value Driver: </strong>Leading organizations aligning ethical considerations with business objectives. Swiss insurance company Die Mobiliar exemplifies this approach. Rather than viewing AI ethics as a burdensome process filled with checklists, the company focused on finding an optimal balance between business strategy, data privacy and AI ethics. To achieve this, Die Mobiliar employed an interdisciplinary team, including representatives from compliance, security, data science and IT, who met regularly to explore this synergy.</p> 
<p><strong>Leverage External Partnerships: </strong>Engaging with external experts, academic institutions, and industry groups can provide fresh perspectives and insights that inform the adjustment of AI solutions. The Oregon Health and Science University was increasingly using AI tools to enhance health research, patient care, and hospital administration. Chief Information Officer Bridget Barnes emphasized the importance of taking a broad view of AI ethics: “We’re not only focusing internally but also partnering with other academic medical centers across the US. We’re also looking at the work of federal and state government efforts on AI standards to further enrich our learnings.”</p> 
<h2>Move #4: Proliferate practices and learnings to the rest of the organization.</h2> 
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, fostering an environment of learning and sharing can enhance awareness and empower employees to contribute to responsible AI development. However, organizations also face the short-term challenge of upskilling the workforce on AI developments that impact the business <em>today.</em> Pharmaceutical company Bristol-Meyers-Squibb (BMS) set up a self-organized community called the “AI Collective.” They met regularly in 4–6-week intervals to exchange insights and ideas on how to advance AI projects within the company, discuss the latest trends, benchmarks, best practices, and intriguing use cases. “The collective is a bottom-up initiative that fosters innovation through peer learning and expert-led conversations. We think this is more effective than a top-down approach. It gives the experts more autonomy and opportunity to grow,” said Miguel Crespo, the Digital and IT Risk Officer.</p> 
<h3>Key Actions: Prioritizing and Scaling</h3> 
<p>Conduct Stakeholder Analysis and Role Prioritization: When resources are limited and the need for immediate impact is high, focusing on key roles that most influence AI development becomes crucial. A practical first step is to conduct a stakeholder analysis to identify roles with the greatest impact on AI development and ethical application. By analyzing its stakeholder landscape, SwissPost identified project managers with analytics capabilities as pivotal to the success of their AI initiatives. Consequently, the organization made a strategic decision to prioritize AI ethics trainings for these key individuals, ensuring that those most involved in directing AI projects are equipped with the knowledge to navigate ethical considerations effectively.</p> 
<p><strong>Build a Scaling Toolkit: </strong>Providing practical resources to help share responsible AI practices can be achieved through the development of a responsible AI scaling toolkit. French industrial firm, Thales, created a set of searchable and adaptable tools that different divisions of the organization could use to implement responsible AI practices. This toolkit contained information about responsible AI practices, implementation advice, communication collateral, and case studies designed to assist local AI teams. It also offered advice on how to customize responsible AI practices to meet local needs. The toolkit defined a core set of practices that can be adapted to meet local needs.</p> 
<p>• • •</p> 
<p>While many organizations have made strides in developing AI principles, the real challenge lies in embedding these principles into the fabric of daily operations. Leaders, particularly those in nontechnical roles, are instrumental in this process, advocating for practical resources, fostering a culture that values ethical AI, and ensuring that responsible AI practices are a fundamental aspect of decision-making.</p></content>

<ol>
<li>Target has announced that it will not carry Pride Month merchandise at all of its stores in June, citing a backlash and lower sales from its previous LGBTQ+ collection.</li>
<li>The company will still offer its full assortment of Pride-themed products online, but decisions on where to stock the merchandise will be based on "guest insights and consumer research".</li>
<li>Target has faced backlash from LGBTQ+ advocates and customers in the past, including incidents where some customers confronted workers and tipped over displays of LGBTQ+ merchandise.</li>
<li>Human Rights Campaign president Kelley Robinson criticized Target's decision, saying it risks alienating LGBTQ+ individuals and allies and compromising the company's values.</li>
<li>This is not the first time Target has faced criticism for its handling of Pride Month merchandise - last year, the company removed some items from its stores and moved displays to the back of certain Southern locations due to protests from customers.</li>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Target confirmed Friday that it won’t carry Pride Month merchandise at all stores in June after the discount retailer <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/target-pride-collection-lgbtq-merchandise-backlash-cf4a19844579e6041c6938b13568e17c">experienced a backlash</a></span> and lower sales over its collection honoring LGBTQ+ communities.</p><p>Target, which operates roughly 2,000 stores, said decisions about where to stock Pride-themed products, including adult apparel, home goods, foods and beverages would be based on “guest insights and consumer research.”</p><p>A Target spokesperson declined to disclose the number of stores where the merchandise will not be available, but the company said its online shop would offer a full assortment. The moves were first reported by Bloomberg. </p><p>“Target is committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round,” Target said in an emailed statement. “Most importantly, we want to create a welcoming and supportive environment for our LGBTQIA+ team members, which reflects our culture of care for the over 400,000 people who work at Target.”</p>
    

<p>Kelley Robinson, president of the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, said Target’s decision was disappointing and risks alienating LGBTQ+ individuals and allies at the risk of not only profits, but also their values.</p>

Target also moved displays to the back of its stores in certain Southern locations last year.</p>
    
<p>But Target faced a second backlash <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/target-lgbtq-pride-month-bathing-suits-21393e91a8eb6110b46623d17a3bf507">from customers upset</a></span> by the discount retailer’s reaction to aggressive, anti-LGBTQ+ activism, which has also been sweeping through <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/transgender-health-care-republican-legislatures-5d98832c0234de079263672c738e0631">Republican state legislatures.</a></span> Civil rights groups scolded the company for caving to customers who expressed outrage over a selection of gender-fluid bathing suits it carried last year. The anti-LGBTQ+ customers also posted threatening videos on social media from inside the stores.</p>
    

<p>Target’s latest moves are just another example of how companies are struggling to cater to different groups of customers at a time of extreme cultural divisions, particularly around transgender rights.

<p>SAN DIEGO (FOX 5/KUSI) — California’s utility regulators approved a proposal on Thursday that will shift the way households pay for their electricity to a new flat rate system — a controversial change made in an effort to put the brakes on skyrocketing energy prices.</p>



<p>Under the new billing structure, most customers of investor-owned utility companies will be charged a fixed $24.15 rate per month, reducing the fee charged for how much electricity a household uses by five to seven cents per kilowatt-hour. </p>



<p>Low-income households could see a greater reduction with the new policy’s discounted flat rate of $6 or $12, depending on certain qualifications like participation in existing utility assistance programs or whether the ratepayer lives in a designated affordable housing unit.</p>





<p>These flat rates mark a departure from the from the structure of paying for the electricity a household uses that has guided Californian’s utility bills for the last five decades.</p>



<p>The new fees would be put towards a portion of utilities’ infrastructure costs, which have been the culprit of many of the recent upticks in rates over the last few years as the companies work to harden electrical grids for severe weather amid the state’s ambitious trek towards clean energy.</p>



<p>So, now that the proposal has become policy, what can ratepayers expect to happen next?</p>







<p>Californians likely will not see the change reflected in their electricity bills until the end of 2025 at the earliest, according to the state’s utility regulator, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). </p>



<p>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison are slated to be the first investor-owned utility companies to have the new fixed rate reflected in their billing, while Pacific Gas &amp; Electric customers likely will not see it implemented until early 2026.</p>



<p>In the meantime, a spokesperson for Predictable Power Coalition — made up of SDG&amp;E, SCE and PG&amp;E — says that utility companies will be collaborating with state regulators to educate customers on the new billing structure.</p>



<p>When it does go into effect, it is likely that households may only see a modest decrease on their bills, if there is any change at all. </p>





<p>Those who use a lot of electricity, such as large homes or those reliant on air conditioning, could see more savings than others. On the other hand, smaller households or higher-income customers who frequently conserve energy could be among those paying more under the fixed rate.</p>





<p>It is also likely that people with solar panels powering their home or business will see their energy costs rise, given that they too will now have a monthly fee on their bill.</p>



<p>However, it is unclear whether the proposal will circumvent any proposed changes to usage fees based on utilities’ general rate cases, which is the process for changing the state’s caps on revenue and operating costs every four years to modify rates for customers.</p>



<p>State regulators are still in the process of litigating these cases, with decisions expected later this year. When those wrap up, customers’ usage rates are likely to go up — something that could offset any savings under the new flat fee structure.</p>
