                                        <p>The man at the center of the pandemic meme stock craze appeared online for the first time in three years, sending the prices of the quirky and volatile shares sharply higher Monday. </p><p>Keith Gill, better known as “Roaring Kitty,” posted an image Sunday on the social platform X of a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1789807772542067105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">man sitting forward in his chair</a></span>, a meme used by gamers when things are getting serious. </p><p>He followed that tweet with a YouTube video from years before when he championed the beleaguered company GameStop saying, “That’s all for now cuz I’m out of breath. FYI here’s a quick 4min video I put together to summarize the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&amp;src=cashtag_click" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$GME</a></span> bull case.”</p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/business-bf7f6f6155a9ebf107430806d806330a">GameStop</a></span> in 2021 was a video game retailer that was struggling to survive as consumers switched rapidly from discs to digital downloads. Big Wall Street hedge funds and major investors were betting against it, or shorting its stock, believing that its shares would continue on a drastically downward trend. </p>
    

<p>Gill and those who agreed with him changed the trajectory of a company that appeared to headed for bankruptcy by buying up thousands of GameStop shares in the face of almost any accepted metrics that told investors that the company was in serious trouble. </p>

<p>That began what is known as a “short squeeze,” when those big investors that had bet against GameStop were forced to buy its rapidly rising stock to offset their massive losses. </p><p>At Monday’s opening bell it appeared that Gill had reignited the phenomenon as shares of GameStop more than doubled. They closed Monday up 74%. It’s the biggest intraday trading jump for GameStop since the meme craze of early 2021. Other meme stocks like the theater chain AMC were jolted higher as well. </p>
    
<p>Trading in GameStop was halted eight times before noon on Monday due to volatility. </p><p>Gill became a cause célèbre in 2021 after his posts on the Reddit subcategory Wallstreetbets ignited a David vs. Goliath battle with large hedge funds that were betting heavily against the survival of GameStop. </p>
    

<p>The small guys won, at least for a while, driving shares of GameStop up more than 1,000% in 2021 and other meme stocks as well. The struggling movie theater chain AMC jumped 2,300% in a very short span of time in the same year. </p><p>Some big traders posted colossal losses as GameStop raced from less than $20, to close to $400 each. Citron Research, Melvin Capital and other well-known hedge funds <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/business-97934416d32c66b0d8f958d13a75fb62">lost an estimated $5 billion</a></span>, according to analytics firm S3 Partners. </p><p>Some of those new and smaller investors believed, at least in part, that Ryan Cohen, co-founder of Chewy.com, could push the traditional retailer in a more online direction. Cohen built up a stake in GameStop before eventually joining the board and last year <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gamestop-cohen-ceo-meme-703d0652b751544d66e5fbe6cd2d7945">becoming its CEO</a></span>. </p><p>Joining the meme surge Monday was AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., which leapt 78%. Koss Corp. a headphone manufacturer, spiked 37% and BlackBerry, the one time dominant smartphone maker, rose 7%. The retailer Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, another meme stock, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bed-bath-beyond-bankruptcy-filing-a597c1013b2f641b7b32e87ad81be6d8">sought bankruptcy protection</a></span> last year. </p><p>Some meme stocks, including GameStop and AMC, had been climbing earlier this month, and rapidly.</p>
    

<p>Shares of GameStop Corp., which have faded steadily since 2021, had already risen 57% this month. In January, GameStop reported its first annual profit since 2018, although it’s still unclear if Cohen’s turnaround plan will succeed. </p><p>AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., had risen 10% over the past 30 days. </p><p>Those companies broke out Monday following Gill’s tweet. </p><p>The dynamics of the market as far as companies like GameStop are concerned have changed, however. </p><p>When Gill and an online army of retail investors began buying up shares of GameStop, more than 140% of the company’s tradeable shares were being shorted. You arrive at that distorted number because some traders were borrowing against already shorted stocks to build even bigger bets against the company, vastly increasing their losses when the stock began to climb. </p><p>The short positions against GameStop’s tradable shares now stand just over 24%, slightly more than the 22.5% recorded in January. </p>
    

<p>Gill reaped a big profit investing in a troubled video-game company, but denied when he <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/keith-gill-roaring-kitty-gamestop-fee89914ac530675c0017a485b6aa8ee">appeared virtually at a Congressional hearing</a></span> that he used social media to drive up GameStop’s stock price. </p><p>He told lawmakers at the time simply, “I like the stock.” </p><p>As Roaring Kitty, Gill had vanished from messaging boards after posting a video in June 2021 of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1406054126555967495" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kittens going to sleep</a></span>. </p><p>The story of Roaring Kitty and the meme stock craze was <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/dumb-money-gamestop-stock-meme-movie-70d3395c7069c4192f261b88ca476fca">turned into a movie</a></span> last year called “Dumb Money.” </p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Regulatory change</strong>: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has approved new rules to update and expand the US electric grid, aiming to increase the adoption of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power.</li>
<li><strong>Grid expansion</strong>: The new rule aims to stimulate the construction of thousands of miles of new high-voltage power lines to improve the country's creaking electricity network, reducing the risk of blackouts and enabling a smoother transition to renewable energy.</li>
<li><strong>Limited grid planning</strong>: The FERC commission highlighted that grid operators rarely plan for the long term, which contributes to the slow pace of grid expansion, putting the country at risk of blackouts and making it harder to shift to renewable energy sources.</li>
<li><strong>Need for grid upgrade</strong>: Experts warn that there aren't enough high-voltage power lines being built today, making it challenging to shift to renewable energy and cope with rising electricity demand, increasing the risk of blackouts during extreme weather events.</li>
<li><strong>Renewable energy integration</strong>: The new rule is expected to facilitate the integration of more wind and solar energy into the grid, a critical step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and meeting the country's climate goals.</li>

After a new CEO, Lidiane Jones, took over in January, the company recruited <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/barry-keoghan-bumble-valentines-campaign.html">Barry Keoghan</a> to thirst-trap potential swipers into submission and finally <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/new-bumble-feature-opening-moves.html">ditched its founding premise</a> of making women message men first. But the app’s rebrand appears to have hit a snag: An <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/celibacy-bumble-ad">anti-celibacy ad campaign</a> has ticked off a lot of potential customers.</p>

A lot of them said the billboards were a great reminder of why they chose celibacy in the first place — including <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/is-julia-fox-celibate.html">Julia Fox</a>, who commented on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ceciliaregina275/video/7367807990113652011">one post</a>, “2.5 years of celibacy and never been better tbh.”</p>

This was not our intention and we are in the process of removing it from our marketing campaign.”</p>

As part of our governance, we certainly look at membership, overall trends, we talk about membership proposals and new additions, but we don’t typically get into specifics around individual companies,” one of the board members said. </p><p>Two of the board members said they weren’t aware of any instances where the NRF denied a retailer membership. One noted the trade group is actually trying to grow its ranks and has worked to expand into nontraditional markets, including the tech sector. </p><p>“I don’t think they are in the business of turning anyone down,” one of the board members told CNBC. </p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline1"></a>On a charm offensive </h2><div class="group"><p>Every year, the NRF hosts a massive conference in New York City dubbed “Retail’s Big Show” that features the industry’s top companies. In recent years, Shein has been conspicuously absent from the event. </p><p>That’s not to say that Shein isn’t relevant to NRF’s attendees — the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/31/metas-continued-rally-could-hinge-on-fortunes-of-temu-and-shein.html">impact the company has had</a> on the fashion industry was widely discussed by conference goers and during official sessions — but the retailer wasn’t invited to talk about the strategies that drove its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/08/sheins-revenue-is-a-lot-more-than-30-billion-annually-exec.html">meteoric rise</a>. </p><p>At the NRF’s Big Show in January, there was a panel about Shein and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/09/temu-returns-to-super-bowl-58-with-new-commercial.html">Chinese retailer Temu</a> titled “Coming to America: What Can We Learn from Chinese Brands in the U.S.” that was led by retail experts from Publicis Groupe and Coresight Research. </p><p>During the panel, the two experts reflected on the strategies that have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/amazon-courts-sellers-at-china-summit-as-temu-and-shein-gain-momentum.html">fueled Shein’s growth</a> and outlined the “10 essential actions” retailers need to do “to rival Shein and Temu.” Throughout the event, attendees eagerly raised their phones in the air to snap photos of the slides. </p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107001411" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">Visitors enter the venue at The NRF 2020 Vision: Retail’s Big Show, held in New York, the United States, Jan. 12, 2020.</p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Wang Ying | Xinhua News Agency | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>Meanwhile, at retail conferences elsewhere in the world, Shein has been a constant. Over the last year, the company had a presence at a number of high-profile industry conferences, including the OMR Festival in Hamburg, Germany, the Global E-commerce Leaders Forum in Los Angeles, the World Retail Congress in Paris and even the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/world-economic-forum/" target="_blank">World Economic Forum</a>’s Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, according to LinkedIn posts and conference agendas. </p><p>In March, Shein presented at the annual Shoptalk conference in Las Vegas for the second year in a row and a company executive appeared on stage alongside counterparts from sustainable fashion brand Reformation and home goods retailer <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-28"><a href="/quotes/W/">Wayfair</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span>. </p><p>While Shein has been widely welcomed on stage at these events, which rely heavily on sponsors to drive revenue, the reception was a bit cooler behind closed doors. </p><p>At a cocktail party on the sidelines of Shoptalk, a young founder of a fashion sustainability startup quietly referred to Shein as their “mortal enemy” when they saw two of its staffers join the event. </p><p>The founder was referring to some of the sustainability concerns that Shein has faced, including accusations that its cheap clothing fuels overconsumption and that its clothes are made with materials sourced from regions that are hot spots for forced labor. </p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107343217" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">Shoppers Ashley Sanchez, center, of Fontana, poses for her friend Joscelin Flores, not pictured, who was taking photos with their bags of merchandise after being among the first group of shoppers taking the opportunity to shop on the opening day of fast fashion e-commerce giant Shein, which is hosting a brick-and-mortar pop up inside Forever 21 at the Ontario Mills Mall in Ontario Thursday, Oct. 19, 2023.  (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)</p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Allen J. Schaben | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>Dennis, the retail consultant, posited the NRF’s concerns about Shein, at least on their face, could be related to some of the ethical questions surrounding the company but said what angers the retail community the most is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/26/shein-rejects-amazon-clone-talk-as-it-prepares-for-us-listing.html">how Shein is competing</a> — and taking market share. </p><p>“Their growth is extraordinary, right? ... They’ve gone from zero to an enormous amount of market share in just a couple of years, so from that standpoint, if you’re a company that competes with them, you’re losing market share,” said Dennis. “Nobody likes that.” </p><p>Plus, he added, there is the perception that Shein is competing unfairly because of its use of a specific U.S. tariff law loophole called <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/nafta/guide-customs-procedures/other-instances-confer-origin/deminimis" target="_blank">the de minimis provision</a>. Under the provision, packages valued under $800 are not charged import duties and aren’t subject to the same level of screening as other packages. Shein’s success is routinely attributed to the claim that it benefits from not paying tariffs, a charge the retailer denies. </p><p>For example, in 2022, Gap, H&amp;M and David’s Bridal paid $700 million, $205 million and $19.5 million in import duties, respectively, while Shein and Temu paid nothing at all, according to the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. </p><p>The committee is investigating Shein over its use of the de minimis provision and concerns that the goods the company ships to the U.S. are made with forced labor. Shein has said that it’s committed to adhering to the laws and regulations of the respective markets that it operates in and is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/30/shein-faces-scrutiny-over-forced-labor-before-ipo.html">working to eradicate</a> its supply chain of raw materials sourced from banned regions.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline2"></a>Competing fairly</h2><div class="group"><p>Considering the ire the retail community has for Shein, the NRF is stuck between a rock and a hard place. If the trade group accepts Shein as a member, it could upset its influential member base, but it also needs a valid reason to deny the company access. </p><p>The NRF could lean on the serious ethical concerns surrounding Shein, but they’re not unique to the company. Last year when the committee on the CCP opened a probe into Shein about its use of forced labor, it sent similar letters to <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-32"><a href="/quotes/ADS-FF/">Adidas</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> and <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-33"><a href="/quotes/NKE/">Nike</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span>, whose vice president of global retail operations was on the board of the NRF’s foundation in 2022. </p><p>Plus, using raw materials from regions that are hot spots for forced labor or other human rights issues is a problem for the entire fashion industry. It’s also an issue that has mired other global corporate powers that are on the NRF board. </p><p>Rejecting Shein on the grounds that it unfairly uses the de minimis provision would also be a tough sell. While many NRF members are strongly against de minimis, or at least a competitor’s use of it, the NRF has yet to take a firm position on the matter, contrary to some other trade associations.</p><p>When asked for the NRF’s official position on de minimis, a spokesperson said it didn’t have one. </p><p>“We encourage the collection of more detailed information by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to improve enforcement and ensure that only legitimate products are entered under the program,” the spokesperson said. </p><p>Of course, Shein’s ties to China could be enough to exclude it from NRF membership, but the trade group is considering expanding internationally, according to one of the organization’s board members. If those plans come to fruition, the trade group will have to determine where to draw the line. </p><p>Absent a clear reason for excluding Shein from membership, the NRF’s decision could raise antitrust concerns, legal experts said. </p><p>While joining the NRF is unlikely to make or break a retailer’s business, it is seen as having a plus side. The benefits of NRF membership — advocacy, legislative lobbying and access to industry research, connections and events — could be seen as a competitive edge for its members.</p><p>Considering that argument, if Shein were to be excluded from an organization made up of its competitors, it could have an antitrust argument. </p><p>“If they are a unique competitor and the powerful people in the industry are controlling the NRF to keep them out, that could raise concerns,” said Steven Salop, professor emeritus of economics and law at Georgetown University’s Law Center. “The question is whether it’s enough to have a significant impact on competition.”</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Don’t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO</h2></div></div></div></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

Today, we enter a new and exciting chapter in the history of Novavax. This morning, we announced that we have signed a global co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Sanofi. This agreement is both material and strategically important for Novavax. It is a further validation of our technology platform and provides significant opportunity to drive value creation and benefit global public health. The agreement represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity over time for Novavax. Via this agreement, we generate significant near-term cash flow, a strengthened balance sheet as well as the opportunity to strategically pivot to a new lean operating model, focusing more on our strength in research and development and pipeline expansion to accelerate our growth and generate long-term value for our shareholders.</p><p>First, the upfront and near-term milestones associated with this agreement are anticipated to equate to approximately $1.3 billion in cash of which approximately half is expected within 10 days of signing. These cash payments provide us with a significant capital infusion to help us manage our business. And this in turn, also enables us to remove the going concern status for Novavax. Second, beginning in 2025, it allows us to leverage one of the largest proven global leaders in the vaccine business to commercialize Nuvaxovid in the U.S., U.K. and Europe initially and worldwide over time. Affording hundreds of millions of dollars in potential cost synergies, enabling us to drive toward a new, more lean operating model with total costs anticipated to be well below our prior stated cost reduction targets.</p><p>And we expect our royalties and milestones from Sanofi's efforts with Nuvaxovid to exceed the value of what our own efforts might have yielded, if we had kept the product ourselves exclusively. By licensing Sanofi to use our Nuvaxovid to develop their own combination Flu and COVID products, and to use Matrix-M as a component of other vaccines across their portfolio. We expect to realize substantial additional royalties and milestones valued potentially in the billions of dollars, driven by Sanofi's product development and commercialization efforts over the years and decades to come. The royalties and milestones associated with potential new vaccines, Sanofi may develop using Matrix-M as well as those royalties and milestones anticipated from sales of our COVID-19 vaccine and the development of Sanofi's combination flu COVID and other potential combination vaccines, should help us to sustain cash flow as we invest in our own R&amp;D in an efficient and thoughtful manner for years to come.</p><p>In fact, we have done all of this, while retaining the ability to broaden and accelerate development of our own wholly owned pipeline. This includes the modification of our planned 2024 pivotal trial for our combination flu and COVID vaccine to now also include the potential to yield pivot results -- for pivotal results for our stand-alone flu vaccine, and we now anticipate readouts for both the combination and our stand-alone flu vaccine in mid-2025. In addition to our late-stage CIC and flu stand-alone programs, we will now be able to assess and contemplate the addition of some new early-stage programs to our pipeline and do so within the cost structure of a new lean operating model. For both our late-stage CIC and stand-alone flu programs and any early-stage programs we may choose to add to our pipeline in the coming quarters, we will be pragmatic, shareholder-focused and market aware about how to bring these assets forward.</p><p>For example, through partnering, out-licensing co-development, co-commercialization or commercializing on our own. And we would consider commercializing on our own only for the right asset and with the benefit of our learnings from the COVID experience. The key here is that we intend to have multiple organic opportunities from our own pipeline, with optionality on how we decide to optimize value from them. We look forward to providing additional details and updates on our new pipeline and future growth strategy for Novavax in the coming months as we operationalize our partnership with Sanofi. And finally, this transaction further validates both Novavax's product development capability and the extraordinary value of our Matrix-M adjuvant technology, potentially enhancing our future licensing and business development opportunities across our tech platform.</p><p>In fact, we intend as part of our go-forward strategy to seek additional business development opportunities with our organic pipeline, new pipeline assets we intend to add and our Matrix-M and nanoparticle technology platforms. So in summary, this transaction capitalizes our current business, seeks to increase our future anticipated value from Nuvaxovid, while enabling us to significantly reduce our operating costs and complexity, creates a future stream of royalties and milestones from multiple potential new products to be developed by Sanofi, broadens and accelerates our own development pipeline and enhances our future deal-making capabilities, leveraging Matrix-M our late and early stage pipeline and our product development capabilities.</p><p>Jim Kelly will now walk you through the financial terms. Jim?</p><p><strong>James Kelly:</strong> Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide #5. This new agreement with Sanofi provides for a multibillion-dollar potential across upfronts, equity investment, milestone and royalties. The anticipated present value of the royalties on Sanofi's Nuvaxovid and CIC sales are expected to be the largest individual component of value in this transaction. The COVID-19-related terms include the potential for up to approximately $1.3 billion in cash payments and equity investments. Plus Novavax is eligible to receive two royalties on related product sales. In addition, were eligible to receive up to $200 million in milestones plus ongoing royalties for each new vaccine developed utilizing Novavax' Matrix-M adjuvant. For example, if Sanofi develops five products with our Matrix-M each with $1 billion in sales, this would represent hundreds of millions in royalties per year plus up to $1 billion in onetime milestones.</p><p>During the second quarter of 2024, the initial cash payments include the $500 million upfront and the approximately $70 million equity investment in Novavax stock. Near-term Nuvaxovid COVID-19 milestones of $350 million and CIC milestones of another $350 million should provide important future cash flow to the company. In addition, Novavax is eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales in each of the COVID-19 related product categories, that enable Novavax' meaningful participation and future economics from the current and future products under this agreement. Please turn to Slide #6. New vaccines developed with Matrix-M by Sanofi, create a broad opportunity to advance this technology and provide Novavax with multiple revenue generation sources.</p><p>Novavax will support Sanofi as it prepares to advance all programs associated with this agreement, and Novavax will be eligible for cost reimbursement across a host of spend categories. John will now walk you through the first quarter commentary. John?</p><p><strong>John Jacobs:</strong> Thank you, Jim. Please turn to Slide 7. It took a lot of hard work over the past 15 months to get here, and a determined focus on the strategic priorities we identified when I first joined the company. To better position Novavax to execute significant business development opportunities like this partnership with Sanofi. In fact, since early 2023, the management team and I have been making significant progress on our three priorities: Priority one, delivering an updated product for the fall vaccination season, priority two, reducing our rate of spend, managing our cash flow and evolving our scale and structure. And finally, priority three, leveraging our technology platform, our capabilities and our assets to drive additional value beyond Nuvaxovid alone.</p><p>Importantly, we had to make significant progress on the first two priorities in order to optimize the potential of our third priority. And over the last 15 months by strengthening our balance sheet, reducing significant onetime legacy liabilities, including Gavi, and proving that we could streamline our strain selection process and update our vaccine to align with regulatory requirements, we put Novavax in a position to be able to execute meaningful business development agreements. The Sanofi agreement is strategically important for our company, as it enables a pivot to a new growth strategy, a new lean operating model and a new chapter in the history of Novavax. With that in mind, we have made appropriate adjustments to our priorities for the remainder of 2024.</p><p>For the remainder of this year, we will be focusing on the following: #1, prioritizing the successful transition of our new partnership with Sanofi. #2, continuing to expand and diversify organic opportunities and create additional value from our technology platform. #3, preparing to initiate an additional cost reduction program to reduce 2025 R&amp;D plus SG&amp;A expenses, net of Sanofi cost reimbursement to below $500 million. And #4, delivering an updated product for the '24-'25 fall vaccination season. As our strategy, vision and new expanded pipeline for the company evolved, we intend to share more with you about the new path forward for Novavax. We will spend the next several months analyzing and crystallizing our future pipeline and our strategic focus with the goal of sharing our updated plans for Novavax in more detail towards the end of this year.</p><p>And now I would like to hand it over to the team to discuss our results from the quarter in more detail, beginning with John Trizzino for our commercial updates. John?</p><p><strong>John Trizzino:</strong> Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 8. We are very excited about the potential of the Sanofi agreement for our business. And as John mentioned, our first priority is operationalizing the agreement to enable Sanofi to commence co-commercialization activities starting January 1 of next year. This collaboration agreement with Sanofi is a validation of the significant investment made in the Novavax technology platform to date and of the dedicated and passionate effort of the many people that have contributed along the way. While we are steadfast in our belief that our COVID vaccine is the best one approved for use, it has been challenging to transition from being an innovator focused on developing vaccines for infectious diseases to being a commercial business focused on operational execution.</p><p>Now, partnered with Sanofi, we see very clearly the opportunity to leverage their brand and global infrastructure for the benefit of public health, revenue generation and increased return to our investors. The burden of disease for COVID remains clear and well documented. Vaccination continues to be recommended as the best defense for the prevention of severe disease, hospitalization and death. Advisory committees like the CDC ACIP and other health policy bodies around the globe continue to recognize this need. The COVID virus for now continues to circulate throughout the year, but with concentrated disease burden during the typical winter respiratory disease season from late Fall to early spring. The ongoing need for both a COVID and influenza annual seasonal vaccination leads to the public health benefit for a single combination vaccine.</p><p>A single visit and vaccination creates a convenience that we believe will translate into improved vaccination rates, especially in older adults who are most at risk. Sanofi is well recognized -- Sanofi is the well-recognized leader in influenza vaccines, and this collaboration agreement creates the opportunity for COVID-influenza combination vaccine with their existing licensed product. In parallel with preparing for Sanofi's '25 commercialization activities for the upcoming '24-'25 season, we intend to support our key markets of the U.S., Europe and U.K. but to do so in an increasingly streamlined, targeted and cost-efficient manner during our last season commercializing on our own. Recently, both WHO and EMA recommended the use of a monovalent JN1 lineage COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>Novavax plans to be ready to deliver our JN1 protein based vaccine globally this Fall, and we have been developing and manufacturing this vaccine candidate as we anticipate the VRBPAC meeting for U.S. strain selection on June 5. Please turn to Slide 9. In the U.S., we intend to build upon our efforts from the '23 season by offering our vaccine in a more competitive, single-dose prefilled syringe presentation and we intend to have product at distribution centers in the U.S. no later than mid-August, and ready for the season start in early September pending FDA release. We expect that the CDC and competitors will do preseason disease awareness campaigns to drive vaccination rates. And we will focus our efforts on building upon our increased healthcare provider awareness of Novavax, which we achieved last season, and we intend to focus our marketing efforts and investment on the retail and 60-plus age group, where we foresee the highest potential for conversion to Novavax's vaccine given their historically higher vaccination rates.</p><p>In retail, we are having encouraging discussions which increase our optimism that we will have improved retail access for the season. As John mentioned, we have completed the submission of our BLA. While we are pleased with this progress, we have decided in consultation with the FDA to seek emergency use authorization for our updated vaccine, targeting JN1 in order to be available by early September at the start of the season in a prefilled syringe. This pathway has been mapped out together with the FDA to enable an expedited review time frame, and a more straightforward review process. This effort will occur in parallel with the BLA review process, with the goal of having the potential for full BLA approval sometime this year. Though the BLA is indeed important, we intend to achieve BLA approval, the most important factors for a successful campaign are a timely launch at the beginning of the season, broad availability in retail, high levels of awareness, which we already have from last year and a competitive product presentation in a prefilled syringe.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">A closeup of a vial of the biotechnology company's vaccines.</figcaption></p></figure><p>We believe we can more effectively achieve these parameters this year by choosing the EUA option in parallel to the BLA pathway. Please turn to Slide 10. With our pandemic error APA complete in Europe, we are entering a commercial and tender market for the first time in the region and are prioritizing our goal of timely delivery of an updated COVID-19 vaccine in several key European countries. In our major APA markets in Australia, New Zealand and Canada we are seeing a more formal, non-pandemic consumer demand pattern, and we are seeking to optimize the value of these contracts, while doing what is in the best interest of public health for these customers. We are in discussions regarding potential adjustments to dose volumes, pricing per dose and timing of delivery schedules that should better reflect market demand.</p><p>And where we can, we are seeking cash prepayment in exchange for moving to future delivery of doses. Due to significant reductions in demand since the pandemic, awaiting regulatory approvals and ongoing contract renegotiations, we are lowering total revenue guidance for 2024. Jim will discuss guidance on revenue and expenses in more detail shortly. Though we have remaining value on our APAs and intend to optimize the value where we can. Over the next two to three years, we are moving from a pandemic-based APA period and toward a fully normalized vaccine market. We look forward to working with our new partner to optimize our commercial opportunity. Now to discuss our combination and influenza vaccines and other key R&amp;D updates, I want to hand the call to Filip.</p><p><strong>Filip Dubovsky:</strong> Thanks, John. Please turn to Slide 12. Today, I want to cover several topics. First, I want to share data on our JN1 candidate before I touch base on our revised CIC and influenza Phase 3 plans. Then I will show you some preclinical data on our optimized RSV vaccine candidate that we evaluate for future development. Finally, I want to introduce you to two innovative expansions of our technology, mucosal vaccination and the development of a novel nanoparticle format, which we are exploring is an avian H5N1 pandemic vaccine. As John mentioned, these innovations are examples of work we've been doing over the past year, to generate additional value from our technology platform. Please turn to Slide 13 and 14. The World Health Organization and EMA have recommended the JN1 line vaccines for the '24-'25 season.</p><p>This is a variant we've previously advanced in the commercial development. Here, I'm showing neutralizing responses in nonhuman primates that were vaccinated with XBB.1.5 vaccine and boosted with a single dose of JN1. On the left-hand side, you can see the responses to the JN1 variants were low prior to boosting. On the right-hand side, the responses to JN1 and JN1 drift variants are robust following a boost. These data provide us confidence our vaccine has utility against the currently circulating strains, such as KP2 as well as potentially future proofing our vaccine against other variants that evolve from JN-1. The strain selection will be confirmed by VRBPAC on June 5, and we plan on submitting our string change filing shortly after that.</p><p>Okay. Let's go to Slide 15 and 16. We've modified our plans for the upcoming Phase 3 study to include the valuation of a stand-alone seasonal influenza vaccine in addition to our COVID influenza combination vaccine in adults, greater than six years of age. As depicted on the right-hand side of the slide, this is planned to be an immunologic noninferiority superiority study with our vaccine compared to age recommended licensed comparators. Although we have previously received supportive regulatory guidance for the stand-alone influenza program, we will reconfirm the acceptability of this design for the flu influenza portion of the study. The study is still on track for the second half of this year and data for decision-making will be available in mid-'25.</p><p>Okay. Let's move to Slide 17 and 18. We have optimized our RSV F nanoparticle vaccine antigen with a specific goal of maximizing the breadth of neutralizing responses. Here, I'm showing the immune responses in mice, vaccinated with our RSV antigen with Matrix compared to the licensed GSK vaccine with the AS01E [ph] adjuvant. We used competitive bidding against a panel of monoclonal antibodies, known to bind neutralizing epitopes, including Side 0,2,4,5 and P27. On the left-hand side, our bidding results on our antigen. On the right-hand side are bidding results on the GSK antigen. In both cases, a favorable breadth of response is demonstrated for our vaccine. It's interesting to note, on the right-hand panel that the P27 neutralizing sequence is not present on the GSK antigen.</p><p>Okay. Let's go to Slide 19, and look at RSV neutralizing responses. Here, I'm showing new responses for our RSV A on the left and RSV B on the right. We have driven six fold increase for RSV A compared to the licensed GSK-vaccine, which represents the difference of titers from 3,700 to over 23,000. And for RSV B, a titer difference from 440 to over 1,500. This antigen can be used as a stand-alone vaccine or as part of a broader combination vaccine program. Based on our previous clinical experience with a related construct, we are evaluating whether additional preclinical or toxicology studies are required. Partnering discussions for this antigen are ongoing. Okay, please shift to Slide 20 and 21 to look at our early progress in expanding our core technology into mucosal vaccinations.</p><p>We've developed an intranasal formulation that includes our PS80 nanoparticle antigen with our Matrix in adjuvant. In this experiment, we explore this technology with our COVID antigen, we've primed these mice with bivalent vaccine containing prototype in BA 5 and boosted them with intramuscular or intranasal XBB.1.5 vaccine formulations. On the far left side, you can see the initial priming sequence induces no XBB.1.5 specific Mucosal IgA antibody. In the middle, after intramuscular boosting, eligible mucosal IgA was detected. However, when the mice were boosted with intranasal vaccine, there was a very large IgA signal. This is important because mucosal IgA is the first line of defense against respiratory viruses and has implications for prevention of infection and potentially impacting transmission.</p><p>Let's move to Slide 22 for additional characterization of immune response. Here we're displaying XBB.1.5 new responses in the blood on the left and mucosal neutralizing responses on the right. On the left-hand side, unsurprisingly, there was little evidence of SERUM XBB.1.5 neutralizing response after priming with bivalent BA5 vaccine. However, XBB.1.5 responses were increased 27-fold with intramuscular boosting, and surprisingly, intranasal vaccination boosted these central responses over 10x. When we looked at mucosal on the right-hand panel, once again, there was no response after priming, but a profound response was seen after intranasal boosting supporting the hypothesis, this approach may have utility and blocking infections. We believe the small rise in mucosal neutralizing responses following intramuscular boosting represents antibody transited from blood compartment.</p><p>These results are being prepared for publication, and we are evaluating this approach with different antigens in different preclinical models. If these findings are validated in the clinic, this opens the door for a needle-free vaccination, and the potential to block infection and potentially transmission, specifically for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections whose point of entry is through the mucosa. Please turn to Slide 23 and 24 to look at the development of Matrix as a core for a new class of nanoparticles. We've identified transmembrane domains in service in molecular anchors and can link antigens directly into the Matrix adjuvant. On the left-hand, image shows a model and an electronic photomicrograph of a classic PS80 nanoparticle.</p><p>You can see the antigens decorating the polysorbate core. On the right-hand side, we have the novel matrix antiparticle where the antigens shown in blue are anchored directly into the vertices of the matrix structure. This model is confirmed by the EM image on the right. This new format is larger than the PS80 nanoparticle, and we hypothesize to facilitate antigen recognition and phagocytosis. This also increases antigen density with up to 40 to 60 copies per nanoparticle, which may increase activation of antigen processing cells. And finally, linking to antigen at an adjuvant assures co-delivery into a single endosome in antigen processing cells and may increase T cell responses. And this format is amenable to intramuscular and intranasal administration.</p><p>Okay. Let's go to Slide 25 and with how this performs in nonhuman primates. In this experiment, we used a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 2344b antigen, specifically American wigeon as a model antigen. This is the influenza clade, the devastating wild in domestic birds globally and is spread into our mammalian food chain. Here we're prime resets with our quadrivalent seasonal vaccine to more closely mimic the immulogic background in humans. We then boosted them with a single dose of H5N1 matrix nanoparticle vaccine intramuscularly or intranasally in measured neutralizing responses. On the left-hand side, a single 60-microgram intramuscular dose boost H5N1 neutral responses to a very high level in all animals. And on the right, you can see a single intranasal dose results in a 100% seroconversion with a geometric mean titer of 263.</p><p>I have a marked level of 1 to 40, which has been used in the literature as a level relevant for protection. Single-dose pandemic influenza vaccination has been elusive. So certainly, these results caught our attention. If these results are validated in the clinic, it could lead to a game-changing approach because a single-dose vaccination in a pandemic setting would be much easier to deploy and could have a huge public health impact. We're in discussion with government agencies on the best way to advance these candidates into the clinic, so we can evaluate them and this approach can be validated. Okay. I covered a lot of territory today. As a summary, we're in commercial production of JN1 vaccine, which has shown good results in preclinical evaluation and our goal is to have this product available at the beginning of the vaccination season.</p><p>We've expanded our Phase 3 study to include stand-alone influenza, in addition to our combination vaccine and the study is on track to begin in the second half of this year, consistent with its original timeline. We've optimized our RSV construct and we're evaluating additional work needs to be done before we decide on advancing the candidate into future development. Finally, we developed two different derivatives of our core technology, the ability to vaccinate intranasally, with adjuvanted PS80 nanoparticles which in preclinical models induce mucosal immune response, while boosting serum-neutralizing responses. And finally, we've identified molecular anchors, which can attach Amgen directly on to Matrix, and in nonhuman primates, prior to the seasonal vaccine, this has resulted in unprecedented immune response with a single dose for H5 pandemic vaccine.</p><p>Okay, let me hand it over to Jim.</p><p><strong>James Kelly:</strong> All right. Thank you, Filip. Please turn to Slides 26 and 27. We're focused on improving the financial health and performance of Novavax to enable long-term value creation. Today, we announced the strategically important Sanofi agreement and have removed our going concern disclosure that evidence this progress. I will now share a few of the key themes for the first quarter of 2024, and a look towards full-year 2024 and beyond. For the first quarter of 2024, Novavax recorded total revenue of $94 million and significantly improved our balance sheet profile, by reducing current liabilities by $831 million. The Gavi and Fuji Film settlements continue our efforts to address legacy contractual matters. As we continue to transform Novavax into a more lean and agile organization, we reduced our Q1 2024 R&amp;D and SG&amp;A by 50% compared to prior year.</p><p>As we look to 2024, we are updating our targeted guidance for R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses of between $700 million and $750 million, as we continue to resize our organization. For 2025, Novavax is prepared to initiate an additional cost reduction program to reduce R&amp;D plus SG&amp;A expenses, to below $500 million. A portion of which we expect to be reimbursed by Sanofi under today's announced agreement. We ended the first quarter of 2024 with cash and accounts receivable of $570 million, and have over $600 million in potential dose deliveries under our APAs over the next three years. With the Sanofi agreement announced today, we have approximately $570 million in cash payments for the second quarter of 2024 that further improved our financial position.</p><p>Please turn to Slide 28. Turning to a more detailed view of our first quarter 2024 financial results, where I'll provide commentary with specific focus on revenue, COGS and combined R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. For the first quarter of 2024, we recorded total revenue of $94 million compared to $81 million in the same period of 2023. Our product sales of $82 million in the first quarter of 2024 were primarily related to the APA deliveries to Europe, and reflect the successful completion of the European APA agreement. Royalties and other of $12 million for the first quarter of 2024 include license fees and Matrix-M reimbursement under our agreements with Takeda and SK Biosciences. Our cost of sales for the first quarter of 2024 were $59 million as compared to $34 million in the same period of 2023, these periods include $15 million and $25 million, respectively, related to excess obsolete or expired inventory, losses on firm purchase commitments and unutilized manufacturing capacity.</p><p>As previously noted, for the first quarter of 2024, Novavax's R&amp;D plus SG&amp;A of $175 million reflects a 50% and $180 million reduction from the same period in 2023. Please turn to Slide 29. We're committed to creating a more lean and agile organization to align the company with our market opportunities. To advance that goal. Over the past year, we've reduced our workforce by over 30% compared to the first quarter of 2023. For 2024, we're updating our targeted combined R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expense guidance to $700 million to $750 million our prior stated target of $700 million to $800 million, as we continue to push to find savings in our cost structure. Novavax is prepared to initiate an additional cost reduction program to reduce 2025, R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses to below $500 million as noted, a portion of which is expected to be reimbursed by Sanofi under the agreement.</p><p>In addition, we're prioritizing improvements to long-term supply chain efficiency, including exploring the sale of our Czech Republic manufacturing facility. Please turn to Slide 30, where I'd like to discuss progress on our balance sheet and liability management. Since December 31, 2022, we have reduced the company's current liabilities by $1.7 billion, including an additional $831 million reduction in the first quarter of 2024, and primarily driven by the Gavi and Fuji settlements. Please turn to Slide 31. Now turning to financial guidance with an emphasis on our combined revenue and initial Sanofi payments that totaled $970 million to $1.170 billion. This reflects a material improvement to our sources of cash flow for 2024. Beginning with the $570 million of initial payments under the Sanofi agreement, they'll be received in the second quarter of 2024, and reflect just the beginning of a potential multibillion economics across upfront equity investments, milestones and royalties under this agreement.</p><p>For 2024, we are updating our total revenue and now expect to achieve total revenue of $400 million to $600 million. Our projected total revenue includes $150 million to $250 million of APA sales based on expected dose delivery schedules, and non-APA revenue of $250 million to $350 million from a combination of our commercial market product sales plus royalties and other revenues from our partner-related activities. The $400 million reduction to our full-year 2024 expected product sales guidance reflects the following: $100 million from the Canada APA as we await the Canadian order for 2024. It's our intent to add this back when we have clarity on this order. $250 million related to Australia, New Zealand and Israel APAs as we work with those country on revised dose delivery schedules for later periods, and where possible are seeking potential prepayments in 2024.</p><p>Importantly, these updates reflect our goal of working in partnership with these key customers to adjust dose delivery schedules and volumes to better meet current demand, while optimizing the remaining contract value through their completion. And finally, $50 million from EU commercial sales as we reduced commercial investments in select markets for the 2024-'25 vaccination season, post the Sanofi agreement. We look forward to sharing additional updates as we seek to improve Novavax's financial performance, cost structure and strength to deliver shareholder value. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to John for some closing remarks.</p><p><strong>John Jacobs:</strong> Thank you, Jim, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before we take your questions, I would like to reiterate our key priorities for the remainder of this year. Priority one, prioritizing the successful transition of our new partnership with Sanofi. Priority two, continuing to expand and diversify our organic opportunities and create additional value via our technology platform. Priority three, preparing to initiate an additional cost reduction program to reduce 2025 R&amp;D plus SG&amp;A expenses, net of Sanofi cost reimbursement to below $500 million and priority four, delivering our updated product for the '24-'25 Fall vaccination season. I would now like to turn the call over to our operator for Q&amp;A. Operator?</p><p><strong>Operator:</strong> Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].

That implies around a 10% decline from the benchmark index's current levels at around 5,222 on Monday.</p><p>Inflation will likely remain stubbornly high, the strategists predicted, as the economy is coming out of what they described as a "pseudo-recession" that took place from early 2022 and lasted through the middle of 2023. That accounted for the bulk of the disinflation seen to date, and economic activity has since revved up. </p><p>"We have been wary of a broad S&amp;P 500 correction in the middle quarters of 2024. While most strategists were expecting a recession last year or eagerly attempting to call the start of one in the next year, we have been of the view that the ~5 quarters 1Q22 to 2Q23 were a 'pseudo-recession' and the Fed has already harvested all the normal post-recession disinflation we would expect," the firm wrote.</p><p>Inflation still remains well above the Fed's 2% target. Consumer prices grew <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inflation-cpi-food-energy-gas-prices-consumer-price-index-2024-4?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="80">3.5% year-per-year in March</a>, the third straight month of hotter-than-expected inflation.</p><p>Elevated prices could be attributed to a still-hot economy, which is stoking price growth, strategists said. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/labor-market-april-unemployment-rate-job-growth-wages-2024-5?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="80">Hiring activity, for instance, remains robust</a>, which can stoke wage growth and therefore raise inflation.</p><p>"As a result, the sustained 2% Core PCE inflation the Feed seeks is a pipe dream. With rates normalized and the mid-2024 pop in Core PCE to just over 3% that our models indicate we expect Fed rate cuts to be pushed back further, causing a middle quarters correction for equities," strategists added. </p><p>Markets have already dialed back their <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/when-will-fed-cut-interest-rates-powell-fomc-inflation-relief-2024-4?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">outlook for Fed rate cuts</a> this year, which drove a sell-of in stocks in April. Fed officials have said they're looking for more evidence that inflation is falling back to its 2% price target, and investors are now just expecting one or two rate cuts by the end of the year, according to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/when-will-fed-cut-interest-rates-powell-fomc-inflation-relief-2024-4?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">CME FedWatch tool</a>, compared to six at the start of 2024. </p><p>Traders are waiting for April inflation data to roll out this week, but central bankers are largely expected to keep interest rates at their current levels.

<p>Vogt declined a request for comment, while Spark and Friedman had not responded at the time of publication.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p>
<p>The startup is making a play at building hardware and software for at-home robots that can do things like housekeeping and laundry, six sources said. The company is considering human-shaped robots, as well as other form factors, according to a source with direct knowledge. The business idea involves selling the robots directly to consumers, and giving users the ability to shape the robot’s functionalities and features by submitting requests through a Discord-like chat server, according to three people. That could be subject to change, per two sources, as the months-old company pitched investors primarily on a conceptual vision and is not yet generating revenue. But the founders’ pedigree working on self-driving vehicles at Cruise and Tesla has direct applicability to the technical challenge behind standalone robots, industry observers said.</p>
<p>In tackling robotics, Vogt is entering a field which has benefitted from a dramatic investment boom in recent months. Venture capitalists are increasingly betting that the performance improvements AI has seen in the last two years for generating text, image, videos and audio will also carry over to the physical world in the shape of robots.</p>

<p class="article_paragraph_7"></p><p>Perhaps the biggest beneficiary so far is Figure AI, which in January announced a collaboration with BMW and the following month landed a $2.6 billion valuation from the likes of Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI and Jeff Bezos. Though none of its humanoid robots have been deployed and <em>Forbes</em> observed during a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2024/04/15/meet-the-new-ai-robot-billionaire/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2024/04/15/meet-the-new-ai-robot-billionaire/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2024/04/15/meet-the-new-ai-robot-billionaire/" aria-label="recent interview">recent interview</a> at company offices that they still struggle to walk reliably, cofounder Brett Adcock said he expected his robots to be on the production line at a BMW auto factory in 12 to 18 months.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-1"><p id="article-0-topx-1"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>While the robotics sector is still in its infancy, a growing number of companies are tackling different parts of the technology, with venture capitalists taking bets on what part of the robot tech stack will be most valuable. Companies like Figure and 1X, which raised $100 million in January, are attempting to build general purpose hardware and software. Some like Physical Intelligence (raised $70 million in March) and Skild (in talks for $300 million, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/venture-fomo-hits-robotics-as-young-startup-gets-1-5-billion-valuation?rc=viwsit" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/venture-fomo-hits-robotics-as-young-startup-gets-1-5-billion-valuation?rc=viwsit" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.theinformation.com/articles/venture-fomo-hits-robotics-as-young-startup-gets-1-5-billion-valuation?rc=viwsit" aria-label="per The Information">per The Information</a>) are focusing on just the software. Others are building smaller, non-humanoid robots, like Collaborative Robotics, which raised $100 million last month. Like Vogt’s consumer-oriented venture, others are making vertical plays, as with Agility Robotics, though it’s focusing on industrial use cases.</p>
<p>The company is a fresh start for Vogt, who’s long been interested in robotics. As a grade schooler in Kansas, he competed on the robot combat TV show BattleBots. While at MIT, he interned at iRobot, creator of the Roomba. He came aboard at Twitch after pitching the other cofounders on a live-streaming camera, Vox <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/3/11/11586898/meet-kyle-vogt-the-robot-guru-who-just-sold-his-second-billion-dollar" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.vox.com/2016/3/11/11586898/meet-kyle-vogt-the-robot-guru-who-just-sold-his-second-billion-dollar" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.vox.com/2016/3/11/11586898/meet-kyle-vogt-the-robot-guru-who-just-sold-his-second-billion-dollar" aria-label="reported">reported</a>. He left to start Cruise in 2013, spending two stints as CEO — first pre-acquisition, then again in 2021.</p>
<p>Under Vogt’s stewardship, Cruise moved fast to scale up its self-driving operations as it raced against rivals like Alphabet subsidiary Waymo. That drew ire over safety concerns from critics until matters bubbled over in October 2023 when a Cruise vehicle “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2023/10/06/cruise-robotaxi-dragged-woman-20-feet-in-recent-accident-local-politician-says/?sh=48690570466b" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2023/10/06/cruise-robotaxi-dragged-woman-20-feet-in-recent-accident-local-politician-says/?sh=48690570466b" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2023/10/06/cruise-robotaxi-dragged-woman-20-feet-in-recent-accident-local-politician-says/?sh=48690570466b" aria-label="dragged">dragged</a>” a pedestrian for 20 feet, sending her to the emergency room in critical condition.

<p>Vogt resigned his post in November. Since then, a California judge said Cruise had “misled” a state regulatory agency about the October incident.

                    <p>LIVONIA, Mich. (AP) — A tiny, low-priced electric car called the Seagull has American automakers and politicians trembling.</p>
<p>The car, launched last year by Chinese automaker BYD, sells for around $12,000 in China, but drives well and is put together with craftsmanship that rivals U.S.-made electric vehicles that cost three times as much. A shorter-range version costs under $10,000.</p>
<p>Tariffs on imported Chinese vehicles probably will keep the Seagull away from America’s shores for now, and it likely would sell for more than 12 grand if imported.</p>
<p>But the rapid emergence of low-priced EVs from China could shake up the global auto industry in ways not seen since Japanese makers exploded on the scene during the oil crises of the 1970s. BYD, which stands for “Build Your Dreams,” could be a nightmare for the U.S. auto industry.</p>
<p>“Any car company that’s not paying attention to them as a competitor is going to be lost when they hit their market,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions near Philadelphia. “BYD’s entry into the U.S. market isn’t an if. It’s a when.”</p>
<p>U.S. politicians and manufacturers already see Chinese EVs as a serious threat. The Biden administration on Tuesday is expected to announce 100 percent tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, saying they pose a threat to U.S. jobs and national security.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/china-to-challenge-bidens-electric-vehicle-plans-at-the-world-trade-organization"><strong>READ MORE:</strong> China to challenge Biden’s electric vehicle plans at the World Trade Organization</a></p>
<p>The Alliance for American Manufacturing says in a paper that government subsidized Chinese EVs “could end up being an extinction-level event for the U.S. auto sector.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk told industry analysts Chinese EVs are so good that without trade barriers, “they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.”</p>
<p>Outside of China, EVs are often pricey, aimed at a higher-income niche market. But Chinese brands that are not yet global household names are offering affordable options that will appeal to the masses — just as the U.S., European and many other governments are encouraging a shift away from gasoline-powered vehicles to fight climate change.</p>
<p>“The Western markets did not democratize EVs. They gentrified EVs,” said Bill Russo, the founder of the Automobility Ltd. consultancy in Shanghai. “And when you gentrify, you limit the size of the market. China is all about democratizing EVs, and that’s what will ultimately lead Chinese companies to be successful as they go global.”</p>
<p>Inside a huge garage in an industrial area west of Detroit, a company called Caresoft Global tore apart a Seagull that its China office purchased and shipped to the U.S.</p>
<p>Company President Terry Woychowski, a former chief engineer on General Motors’ big pickup trucks, said the car is a “clarion call” for the U.S. auto industry, which is years behind China in designing low-cost EVs.</p>
<p>After the teardown, Woychowski, who has been in the auto business for 45 years, said he was left wondering if U.S. automakers can adjust. “Things will have to change in some radical ways in order to be able to compete,” he said.</p>
<p>There’s no single miracle that explains how BYD can manufacture the Seagull for so little. Instead, Woychowski said the entire car, which can go 252 miles (405 kilometers) per charge, is “an exercise in efficiency.”</p>
<p>Higher U.S. labor costs are a part of the equation. BYD can keep costs down because of its expertise in making batteries — largely for consumer products — that use lithium iron phosphate chemistry. They cost less but have lower range than most current lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>Americans are still learning how to make cheaper batteries, Woychowski said. Ford is building a lithium iron phosphate battery factory, using technology from China’s CATL.</p>
<p>BYD makes many of its own parts, including electric motors, dashboards, bodies and even headlights. It also has the advantage of its huge scale — 3 million vehicles sold worldwide last year.</p>
<p>“By having that all in-house and vertically integrated, there’s an incredible advantage that they have,” Woychowski said.</p>
<p>BYD designs all aspects of its vehicles with cost and efficiency in mind. For instance, the Seagull has only one windshield wiper, eliminating one motor and one arm, saving on weight, cost and labor to install.</p>
<p>U.S. automakers don’t often design vehicles this way and incur excess engineering costs, Woychowski said. Hoses, for instance, have to meet longstanding requirements in combustion engines for strength and ability to carry fluid under high pressure, many of which aren’t needed for electric vehicles, he added.</p>
<p>The weight savings add up, allowing the Seagull to travel farther per charge on a smaller battery. For example, the Seagull that Caresoft tested weighs 2,734 pounds (1,240 kilograms), about 900 pounds less than a Chevrolet Bolt, a slightly larger electric vehicle made by GM.</p>
<p>So Detroit needs to quickly re-learn a lot of design and engineering to keep up while shedding practices from a century of building vehicles. The trick will be determining which procedures to keep for safety and quality, and which to jettison because they aren’t needed, he said.</p>
<p>“You’re going to have to come and be extremely serious about this, and you better park your paradigms at the door,” Woychowski said. “Because you’re going to have to do things differently.”</p>
<p>Even with its minimalist design, the Seagull still has a quality feel. The doors close solidly. The gray synthetic leather seats have stitching that matches the bright green body color, a feature usually found in more expensive cars. The Seagull “Flying Edition” tested by Caresoft has six air bags, rear disc brakes and electronic stability control.</p>
<p>A brief drive through some connected parking lots by a reporter showed that it runs quietly and handles curves and bumps as well as more costly electric vehicles.</p>
<p>While the acceleration isn’t head-snapping like other EVs, the Seagull is peppy and would have no problems entering a freeway in heavy traffic. Woychowski says its top speed is limited to 81 mph, (130 kilometers per hour).</p>
<p>BYD would have to modify its cars to meet U.S. safety standards, which are more stringent than in China. Woychowski says Caresoft hasn’t done crash tests, but he estimated that would add a couple thousand dollars to the cost.</p>
<p>BYD sells the Seagull, rebranded as the Dolphin Mini in some overseas markets, in four Latin American countries for about $21,000, twice what it costs at home. The higher price includes transportation costs, but also reflects the higher profits possible in less cutthroat markets than China.</p>
<p>In Europe, BYD offers larger models such as the Seal, which starts at 46,990 euros ($50,000), in France. The Chinese maker’s top two overseas markets were Thailand and Brazil in the first two months of this year, according to the China Passenger Car Association.</p>
<p>BYD builds electric buses in California and told the AP last year that it is “still in the process” of deciding whether to sell autos in the U.S. It is weighing sites for a factory in Mexico, but that would be for the Mexican market, two company executives said in media interviews earlier this year.</p>
<p>The company isn’t selling cars in the U.S., largely due to 27.5 percent tariffs on the sale price of Chinese vehicles when they arrive at ports. Donald Trump slapped on the bulk of the tariff, 25 percent, when he was president, and it was kept in place under Joe Biden. Trump contends that the rise of EVs backed by Biden will cost U.S. factory jobs, sending the work to China.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has backed legislation and policies to build a U.S. EV manufacturing base. The administration also is investigating cars made in China that can gather sensitive information.</p>
<p>Some members of Congress are urging Biden to ban imports of Chinese vehicles, while others have proposed even steeper tariffs. This includes vehicles made in Mexico by Chinese companies that now would come in largely without tariffs.</p>
<p>Ford CEO Jim Farley has seen Caresoft’s work on the Seagull and observed BYD’s rapid growth across the globe, especially in Europe, where he used to run Ford’s operations. He’s moving to change his company. A small “skunkworks” team is designing a new, small EV from the ground up to keep costs down and quality high, he told analysts earlier this year.</p>
<p>Chinese makers, Farley said, sold almost no EVs in Europe two years ago, but now they have 10 percent of the electric vehicle market. It’s likely they’ll export around the globe and possibly sell in the U.S.</p>
<p>Ford is preparing to counter that. “Don’t take anything for granted,” Farley said. “This CEO doesn’t.”</p>

The unionization effort comes amid a <a href="https://uaw.org/uaw-announces-40-million-commitment-to-organizing-auto-and-battery-workers-over-next-two-years/" target="_blank">$40 million campaign by the UAW to organize</a> foreign-owned assembly plants across the South.

<p>The blight of homeless encampments in Hollywood has prompted some businesses to try a new tactic.</p>



<p>Large planters, most containing cacti and other succulents, have begun <a href="https://ktla.com/news/hollywood-businesses-install-planters-on-sidewalk-to-deter-homeless-encampments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sprouting up</a> in front of storefronts and offices along Hollywood and Sunset boulevards.</p>



<p>Businesses hope the new makeshift landscaping will deter people experiencing homelessness from setting up tents  – or at least make it more difficult for the encampments to grow and overtake entire sidewalks.</p>







<p>“It keeps things cleaner and gives [the homeless] less space to move them around,” local resident Bensher Leandre told KTLA 5’s Chip Yost.</p>



<p>“I think it’s a good idea,” said Pear Parsons.</p>



<p>Some of the planters can be found in front of The Assistance League of Los Angeles, a nonprofit that helps homeless and low-income children, the Sunset Sound music studio and Harbor Freight.</p>





<p>It is too early to know if the experiment will work. The Assistance League says around five planters have already been stolen.</p>

Naming it G580 makes it clear that this is still just a G-Class at the end of the day, and Mercedes’ engineers, marketers and executives have agreed that no one will refer to this car by its full name anyway — everyone will just call it “the electric G” or something similar. It’s a G-wagen, end of story.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">But under the skin the electric G-Class is a radical departure from every G that came before it, the most thorough reworking of the model since the 2018 redesign (and probably even more so, honestly). The electric model had to retain the same ladder frame as the standard G, which was a challenge for packaging the batteries and other powertrain components as you can only fit so much within the existing platform. The G580 has a two-tiered 116-kWh lithium-ion battery pack that’s similar to the one found in <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 kdASgk js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","https://jalopnik.com/the-mercedes-eqs-suv-proves-that-luxury-cars-should-go-1850895215",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://jalopnik.com/the-mercedes-eqs-suv-proves-that-luxury-cars-should-go-1850895215">the EQS</a></span>, with all of the 216 cells contained within the ladder frame’s structure.

Each of the G580’s 145-hp motors has its own centrally shifted two-speed transmission and the front and rear motors are each built into a shared housing that contains two motors, transmissions, and a double inverter. Total output is 579 horsepower and 859 pound-feet of torque, 2 hp and 232 lb-ft more than the new mild-hybrid G63 AMG and 136 hp and 446 lb-ft more than the new mild-hybrid six-cylinder G550. The motors are mounted directly to the ladder frame, with dual-joint driveshafts that have slip joints connecting them to the wheels. While the G580 has an independent double-wishbone front suspension like other G-wagens, the rear axle uses a newly developed De Dion setup, which Mercedes says means camber doesn’t change with compression.</p><figure class="sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure" id="" data-id="d3e0e20063c513ffe1118d61338312d2" data-recommend-id="image://d3e0e20063c513ffe1118d61338312d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="4048" data-height="2277" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cutaway of the electric motor housing of a Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div class="sc-1eow4w5-2 fDJNBs has-data img-wrapper" contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cutaway of the electric motor housing of a Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><span class="sc-1eow4w5-0 knmQPh js_lightbox-wrapper"></span><p class="sc-1xgz690-0 hvSdOV image-meta"><figcaption class="sc-1ptbguh-0 aUlrP caption">This cutaway shows how the motors are integrated</figcaption><figcaption class="sc-7s1ndr-0 joTjeT has-caption">Photo: Daniel Golson/Jalopnik</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d3e0e20063c513ffe1118d61338312d2" data-recommend-id="image://d3e0e20063c513ffe1118d61338312d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="4048" data-height="2277" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cutaway of the electric motor housing of a Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" class="js_recommend"></span></figure><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">The EV needed to look like a G-wagen, so there are only a couple of tells that you’re looking at an electric one. As standard it has the same four-bar grille and front air intakes as the G550, which also eschews exposed exhaust tips. The electric G has a slightly taller hood bulge and air curtains ahead of the rear wheels, plus EQ badges on the fenders, but otherwise it looks identical to the gas-powered G’s. Add the available AMG Line package and you get wider fender flares, and of course the G580 can be had with a few different Night Packages that black out much of the trim, as well as some other design packages and exterior trim options.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">If you want to make sure people know your G-wagen is electric, there are a few options you can choose. The first is the black panel grille treatment, which gives the G580 a mostly blocked-off grille with four thin horizontal slats and a chrome grille border that illuminates with the headlights, plus a glossy black surround that extends to surround the headlights. I think this setup looks extremely cool, especially if you go for the optional black fender flares and bumpers, and it’s a nice retro nod to the original G-wagen’s front end.</p><figure class="sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure" id="" data-id="eaf0274d9990b512474aca1849395ec4" data-recommend-id="image://eaf0274d9990b512474aca1849395ec4" data-format="jpg" data-width="3560" data-height="2004" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Front 3/4 view of a white Mercedes-Benz G580 EV next to a beige G580" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div class="sc-1eow4w5-2 fDJNBs has-data img-wrapper" contenteditable="false" data-alt="Front 3/4 view of a white Mercedes-Benz G580 EV next to a beige G580" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><span class="sc-1eow4w5-0 knmQPh js_lightbox-wrapper"></span><p class="sc-1xgz690-0 hvSdOV image-meta"><figcaption class="sc-1ptbguh-0 aUlrP caption">Both of these are the electric one</figcaption><figcaption class="sc-7s1ndr-0 joTjeT has-caption">Photo: Daniel Golson/Jalopnik</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eaf0274d9990b512474aca1849395ec4" data-recommend-id="image://eaf0274d9990b512474aca1849395ec4" data-format="jpg" data-width="3560" data-height="2004" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Front 3/4 view of a white Mercedes-Benz G580 EV next to a beige G580" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" class="js_recommend"></span></figure><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">The other option is the Design Box at the rear that replaces the traditional spare tire. This rounded rectangle is hinged on the same side as the tailgate itself, opening up to reveal a surprisingly large storage compartment that has a dedicated space for the charging cable, plus cubbies and nets for other items. At least on the Edition One models, the exterior of the box has a split color setup, with the upper section being black to blend in with the lines of the rear window. I really like the Design Box, and I think most owners would get more use out of it than the spare tire, though it’s great that both are available. Monster 4x4 Squared models aside, the G580 is also the first G-Class to offer a spare tire delete from the factory, putting the Mercedes star low down on the tailgate and adding a subtle blank panel where the spare tire mount would be.<br></p><figure class="sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure" id="" data-id="9645126dc3b133dea38fa3685688e642" data-recommend-id="image://9645126dc3b133dea38fa3685688e642" data-format="jpg" data-width="5384" data-height="3213" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div class="sc-1eow4w5-2 fDJNBs has-data img-wrapper" contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><span class="sc-1eow4w5-0 knmQPh js_lightbox-wrapper"></span><p class="sc-1xgz690-0 hvSdOV image-meta"><figcaption class="sc-7s1ndr-0 joTjeT no-caption">Photo: Daniel Golson/Jalopnik</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9645126dc3b133dea38fa3685688e642" data-recommend-id="image://9645126dc3b133dea38fa3685688e642" data-format="jpg" data-width="5384" data-height="3213" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" class="js_recommend"></span></figure><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">Almost nothing about the cabin lets you know this G-wagen is electric, either. There are some EV-specific information menus and gauge cluster designs… and that’s basically it. Finally the G-Class gets a central touchscreen running the MBUX infotainment system, a huge upgrade over the old Comand setup, and it has Mercedes’ excellent voice assistant. The dashboard climate controls have been streamlined, and there’s a new steering wheel. Visually zhuzhing up the interior are additional ambient lighting strips, climate-controlled cupholders and new trim elements. Probably the biggest deal for existing owners is the addition of keyless entry for the first time on a G-wagen, including for the swing-out tailgate, without losing the bolt-action rifle locks or the heft of the doors and the tactile experience you get with the latches.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">From the moment I set off, the G580 feels just like any other G-wagen in terms of overall character, but it’s improved in some important ways. The steering feels heftier than the G550’s, which I think is a positive, and it’s still easy to drive with just a few fingers or a light touch. Though it has regular steel springs with adaptive dampers, the ride quality is much better than on a G550 or standard G63, it soaks up more road imperfections, and the suspension has pitch and roll stabilization but still allows enough of the classic G-wagen lean in corners. I wish the G580 was available with the G63’s new Active Ride hydraulic suspension, which massively changes the G’s dynamics, but the G580 is still a better experience than the G63 without it.<br></p><figure class="sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure" id="" data-id="d4c2f73d5c9e40a0a03ce2f7d78482db" data-recommend-id="image://d4c2f73d5c9e40a0a03ce2f7d78482db" data-format="jpg" data-width="5712" data-height="4284" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Interior of a Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div class="sc-1eow4w5-2 fDJNBs has-data img-wrapper" contenteditable="false" data-alt="Interior of a Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><span class="sc-1eow4w5-0 knmQPh js_lightbox-wrapper"></span><p class="sc-1xgz690-0 hvSdOV image-meta"><figcaption class="sc-7s1ndr-0 joTjeT no-caption">Photo: Daniel Golson/Jalopnik</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4c2f73d5c9e40a0a03ce2f7d78482db" data-recommend-id="image://d4c2f73d5c9e40a0a03ce2f7d78482db" data-format="jpg" data-width="5712" data-height="4284" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Interior of a Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" class="js_recommend"></span></figure><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">Despite being about half a second slower to 60 mph than the V8-powered G63 — Mercedes quotes a 4.6-second 0-to-60-mph time, versus 4.2 seconds for the G63 and 5.3 seconds in the six-cylinder G550 — the G580 feels much quicker in real life. As you can see from my video below, it doesn’t lose steam as the speed rises, surging forwards towards a 112-mph top speed. Flooring it is giggle-inducing; like with other G-wagens the whole front end rises up like a boat under acceleration – it’s fun, it still feels controlled. The powertrain is so much more responsive than even the G63’s V8, and the torque vectoring capabilities mean I can carry more speed into a corner and accelerate harder coming out of one without worrying about whether this big tank can handle it. Every G-wagen is giggle-inducing to drive, and the G580 is no exception.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">Every 2025 G-Class is much quieter than last year’s model thanks to a bunch of small aerodynamic tweaks, like a smoother A-pillar and a new spoiler at the leading edge of the roof, that were mainly implemented to improve the EV’s range. The electric G also has more sound insulation, and it’s easily the quietest G-wagen ever, with acoustic comfort worthy of the vault feeling you get from slamming the door. At higher speeds some wind noise still penetrates — there’s no getting around how upright and flat the greenhouse is — but it’s much more luxurious overall.<br></p><p type="Instagram" class="sc-ooo3c9-0 dtMGpw embed-frame"><span class="non-flex-video"></span></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">Other than how it looks, potentially the most crucial thing about the G580 is how it sounds, doubly so with the interior being such a calm environment. For decades now G-wagens have been known for their side-exit exhaust tips and signature rumbling engine note and both are absent on the EV. Instead, Mercedes developed what it calls G-Roar, described as a “an impressive acoustic accompaniment to the acceleration with deep bass and sonorous tones.” The sounds aren’t very intense when tootling around in Comfort, but in Sport mode the G-Roar really comes alive. It doesn’t sound like an engine, per se, but it offers many of the same auditory sensations that the G63’s V8 does. It burbles at low speeds, with an intense waffling sound getting louder under acceleration. The sounds are audible from outside the car too. Like other EV sounds it certainly won’t be for everyone, but I absolutely love it.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">There are five different levels of regenerative braking in the G580, including a no-regen mode and an auto mode that adjusts the recuperation according to your driving and the traffic ahead. The most intense of the five settings doesn’t quite give the G580 one-pedal driving, which is a shame, but with 217 kW of recuperation capability the regen is strong enough to get almost all of the work done, and it even takes me a bit to get used to how aggressive the initial deceleration is. Luckily the G580 isn’t plagued with the moving-pedal feature that Mercedes’ early EQ models had. Regenerative braking is one of the most transformative additions to the G-wagen’s driving experience, and it’s one of the things I miss the most when I jump back into a G550 after driving the EV.<br></p><figure class="sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure" id="" data-id="ee6c1b10b99d98b757e1a241d998d4c0" data-recommend-id="image://ee6c1b10b99d98b757e1a241d998d4c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="4032" data-height="3024" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Front 3/4 view of a blue Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div class="sc-1eow4w5-2 fDJNBs has-data img-wrapper" contenteditable="false" data-alt="Front 3/4 view of a blue Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><span class="sc-1eow4w5-0 knmQPh js_lightbox-wrapper"></span><p class="sc-1xgz690-0 hvSdOV image-meta"><figcaption class="sc-7s1ndr-0 joTjeT no-caption">Photo: Daniel Golson/Jalopnik</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ee6c1b10b99d98b757e1a241d998d4c0" data-recommend-id="image://ee6c1b10b99d98b757e1a241d998d4c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="4032" data-height="3024" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Front 3/4 view of a blue Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" class="js_recommend"></span></figure><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">I don’t have enough time in the G580 to get a sense of its real-world range, but it will be more than enough for the average G-wagen owner. In Europe the G580 has a maximum range of 295 miles on the WLTP cycle, which will likely work out to around 250 to 275 miles in the U.S. EPA cycle. Sure, in the grand scheme of EVs that’s not a lot, but the gas-powered G-wagens get such shitty gas mileage that most owners will probably find it to be an improvement. I mean, the current G63 is rated at 13 mpg in the city, and in the real world it’s much worse than that — the 2025 G63’s mild-hybrid setup will help, but not by a significant amount.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">The G580 supports DC fast-charging of speeds up to 200 kW, good enough to go from 10 to 80 percent charge in 32 minutes. Mercedes says basically all owners will charge at home anyway, and G-Class owners would typically take one of their other cars if they need to do a road trip. But if the range is really a concern, like for those that want to do longer-distance off-roading or overlanding, Mercedes says that in a few years the G580 will become available with new silicon-anode batteries that will boost energy density by 40 percent and increase range by around 100 miles.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">So, the electric G-wagen is fantastic on road, where commenters will say that most of them will spend all their time anyway, but a G-Class still needs to be the best off-roader possible no matter the powertrain — and the EV is. The G580’s 9.8 inches of ground clearance is 0.3 inches greater than a G550, and its approach and departure angles are slightly better as well, though the breakover angle is 5.7 degrees worse. It can climb a 100-percent grade just like other G-wagens, and it is stable on sideways slopes of up to 35 degrees.<br></p><figure class="sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure" id="" data-id="b502c622e7f3683162827ce5897a2b14" data-recommend-id="image://b502c622e7f3683162827ce5897a2b14" data-format="jpg" data-width="4969" data-height="3420" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div class="sc-1eow4w5-2 fDJNBs has-data img-wrapper" contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><span class="sc-1eow4w5-0 knmQPh js_lightbox-wrapper"></span><p class="sc-1xgz690-0 hvSdOV image-meta"><figcaption class="sc-7s1ndr-0 joTjeT no-caption">Photo: Daniel Golson/Jalopnik</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b502c622e7f3683162827ce5897a2b14" data-recommend-id="image://b502c622e7f3683162827ce5897a2b14" data-format="jpg" data-width="4969" data-height="3420" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" class="js_recommend"></span></figure><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">Mercedes has set up an hour-long off-road course that snakes around the winery’s hills, for which I swap into a different G580, this one painted Sand Beige with the available 18-inch wheels wearing Falken Wildpeak A/T all-terrain tires. (If you want this setup, you sadly can’t choose the AMG Line that adds wider rear fenders.) This is no beginner’s course, either. It’s been raining all day, so there are more mud puddles and washed-out sections than Mercedes anticipated, and the course is full of deep ruts, challenging rock-crawling sections and other hazards.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">One of the G-wagen’s longtime signature features are its lockable differentials, of which modern models have three, but the electric G580 doesn’t have any diff lockers — at least, not “real” ones. Thanks to the quad-motor setup, the G580 uses torque vectoring to create virtual differential locks that work automatically, controlling the torque at each wheel within fractions of a second. Whether you’re sliding around like a rally driver or slowly climbing a rocky hill, the G580 is always getting the optimum amount of power and traction to each wheel.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">What’s not virtual is the G580’s Low Range, an actual off-road 2:1 gear reduction that’s available in the Rock drive mode, which is what I stay in for the whole drive. Low Range works at up to 53 mph, and Mercedes says the car’s handling and response characteristics change when it’s activated. In Low Range the motors are putting out 3,319 lb-ft of torque; Mercedes’ engineers say that figure could be much higher but that would be unnecessary.<br></p><figure class="sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure" id="" data-id="344a6e44052024aaf64eda2d36727b59" data-recommend-id="image://344a6e44052024aaf64eda2d36727b59" data-format="jpg" data-width="4028" data-height="2727" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div class="sc-1eow4w5-2 fDJNBs has-data img-wrapper" contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><span class="sc-1eow4w5-0 knmQPh js_lightbox-wrapper"></span><p class="sc-1xgz690-0 hvSdOV image-meta"><figcaption class="sc-7s1ndr-0 joTjeT no-caption">Photo: Daniel Golson/Jalopnik</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="344a6e44052024aaf64eda2d36727b59" data-recommend-id="image://344a6e44052024aaf64eda2d36727b59" data-format="jpg" data-width="4028" data-height="2727" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" class="js_recommend"></span></figure><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">When Low Range is activated, using a button in the center of the dash where the diff lockers normally would be, the G580’s crawl control function is immediately turned on as well. It basically works like an off-road cruise control, controlled by the same steering wheel paddles that normally control regen braking. In the slowest setting the car maintains a speed of just 1 mph, while in the fastest setting the G580 goes 5 mph on level or uphill terrain and has no set speed while going downhill, instead using the recuperation to slow the vehicle depending on how steep the grade is. The middle setting is called “variable crawl,” and it keeps the car at a walking pace.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">In any of the three settings the driver is still able to accelerate or brake if needed, and the car will return to the crawl speed after or maintain the speed you’ve adjusted to. The crawl control works in reverse too, as the G580 in front of me demonstrates by backing up a very steep, rocky hill. It looks like footage being played in reverse, like it shouldn’t be possible to do in real life. Not needing to do any acceleration or braking inputs makes off-roading much less stressful, especially when going up a steep grade or through a particularly tricky section, and the overall quietness of the cabin adds to the calmness. I can hear the motors whirring as rocks ping against the underbody, and it’s easy to hold a conversation with my passenger and enjoy the sounds of nature while still focusing on the trail. The G-Class also has a new transparent hood feature that uses the surround-view cameras to show a virtual view of what’s underneath the front end.<br></p><figure class="sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure" id="" data-id="5051b56500847b54dda24d92d1fcdfd6" data-recommend-id="image://5051b56500847b54dda24d92d1fcdfd6" data-format="jpg" data-width="5706" data-height="3213" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div class="sc-1eow4w5-2 fDJNBs has-data img-wrapper" contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><span class="sc-1eow4w5-0 knmQPh js_lightbox-wrapper"></span><p class="sc-1xgz690-0 hvSdOV image-meta"><figcaption class="sc-7s1ndr-0 joTjeT no-caption">Photo: Daniel Golson/Jalopnik</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5051b56500847b54dda24d92d1fcdfd6" data-recommend-id="image://5051b56500847b54dda24d92d1fcdfd6" data-format="jpg" data-width="5706" data-height="3213" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" class="js_recommend"></span></figure><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">One of the most common concerns with electric off-roaders is protecting the battery pack, and Mercedes has that taken care of. Covering nearly the entire underbody is a one-inch-thick shield panel that’s two thin pieces of carbon sandwiching a special composite that Mercedes won’t talk about yet, with a layer of stone-chip protection added on. The panel weighs just 127 pounds, one-third of what a steel panel would be, it’s bolted onto the frame with 50 steel fasteners so it can easily be replaced if needed. The battery, motor housings, suspension components and other important parts are also designed to withstand dust, water, and other extreme conditions and wear.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">The G580 can also ford water up to 33.5 inches deep, 5.9 inches greater than the gas-powered G’s, which I get to experience by driving through an opaque muddy river. My Mercedes engineer co-pilot remarks that because of the rain this water crossing is more like 35.5 inches deep, but the G580 makes it through no problem, using crawl control to wade through at a higher set speed. The EV’s silence definitely makes water coming up to the top of the hood even more nerve-wracking, though.<br></p><figure class="sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure" id="" data-id="16164bde190ad76f9049eb3820de2289" data-recommend-id="image://16164bde190ad76f9049eb3820de2289" data-format="jpg" data-width="4032" data-height="3024" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rear 3/4 of a beige Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div class="sc-1eow4w5-2 fDJNBs has-data img-wrapper" contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rear 3/4 of a beige Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><span class="sc-1eow4w5-0 knmQPh js_lightbox-wrapper"></span><p class="sc-1xgz690-0 hvSdOV image-meta"><figcaption class="sc-7s1ndr-0 joTjeT no-caption">Photo: Daniel Golson/Jalopnik</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="16164bde190ad76f9049eb3820de2289" data-recommend-id="image://16164bde190ad76f9049eb3820de2289" data-format="jpg" data-width="4032" data-height="3024" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rear 3/4 of a beige Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" class="js_recommend"></span></figure><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">We come to a stop in a muddy parking lot to try out <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 kdASgk js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","https://jalopnik.com/mercedes-says-not-to-use-the-g-class-evs-tank-turn-on-p-1851156326",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://jalopnik.com/mercedes-says-not-to-use-the-g-class-evs-tank-turn-on-p-1851156326">G-Turn</a></span>, the electric G-wagen’s biggest party trick. It’s easy to activate, though it does take a few steps. With one foot on the brake, first you press the G-Turn button on the dash next to Low Range, and then you hold down the steering wheel paddle that’s in the direction you want the car to spin. While holding the paddle and keeping the steering wheel perfectly straight — even a slight turn will cancel the motion — put your right foot on the accelerator, release the brake, and the car starts spinning perfectly in place. Most people will probably use G-Turn to make bystanders stare in awe and laugh (and Mercedes says it should not be used on pavement), but it will be a genuine help if you need to turn around on a trail or get around an obstacle.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">If it looks hilarious from outside the car, it’s even funnier when you’re inside the car experiencing it. There are no strange noises or unsettling vibrations, there’s no body roll or suspension flex. The G-wagen stays totally flat and stable as it spins around — at quite a high speed, I might add. It’ll do just over two full rotations before coming to a stop, though the driver can immediately cancel the spin at any time by letting go of the paddle, taking their foot off the accelerator or turning the steering wheel. You can keep activating the G-Turn over and over again, too.<br></p><p type="Instagram" class="sc-ooo3c9-0 dtMGpw embed-frame"><span class="non-flex-video"></span></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">Not as impressive visually but useful in even more situations is the G-Steering function, which is toggled by the third locker-replacing button on the dash. By controlling the torque being sent to each wheel and locking one or both of the inner wheels if needed, G-Steering greatly reduces the G580’s turning radius. The course has a bunch of corners that would be far too tight for a G to get around normally without making a three-point turn, but with G-Steering active I’m able to drive around them with ease. It works at up to 15 mph, and the function will stay on for a long time if you don’t turn it off.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">It’s a bit of a weird sensation, kind of like drifting but without the rear end being actually kicked out. The action is extremely linear; the amount that I think I need to turn the steering wheel to get around the corner is the exact right amount, I don’t need to make any little corrections or adjustments partway through. Mercedes also has us do a slalom course through the mud, with the cones placed so close together that basically no car could do it, let alone a G-wagen. But with G-Steering turned on, the G580 easily rotates around each cone. Combined with the G-Class’ relatively small footprint, the G-Steering will open up a lot more trail possibilities that previous models couldn’t navigate. I only scratch the surface of the G580’s capabilities, so I can’t wait to take one on some long off-roading trips in California.<br></p><figure class="sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure" id="" data-id="808a84fef428e422c93c288937b3f7b8" data-recommend-id="image://808a84fef428e422c93c288937b3f7b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="5712" data-height="4284" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Under the hood of a Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div class="sc-1eow4w5-2 fDJNBs has-data img-wrapper" contenteditable="false" data-alt="Under the hood of a Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><span class="sc-1eow4w5-0 knmQPh js_lightbox-wrapper"></span><p class="sc-1xgz690-0 hvSdOV image-meta"><figcaption class="sc-7s1ndr-0 joTjeT no-caption">Photo: Daniel Golson/Jalopnik</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="808a84fef428e422c93c288937b3f7b8" data-recommend-id="image://808a84fef428e422c93c288937b3f7b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="5712" data-height="4284" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Under the hood of a Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" class="js_recommend"></span></figure><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">Mercedes hasn’t announced pricing for the U.S. market yet, but if it’s anything like the German pricing, the G580 EV might be the best deal in the G-Class lineup. With the mandatory 19-percent VAT tax included, the G580 starts at just under €143,000, the equivalent of about $154,000. That’s only €11,000 (about $12,000) more than the new G500 (sold as the G550 in America). In the U.S. the current V8 G550 starts at $144,150 including destination, and the refreshed inline-6 model might be closer to $150,000. If the electric G-wagen comes in at around $170,000 — fifteen grand less than the G63 — I think that’ll be a hell of a deal.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">When the G580 hits U.S. dealer lots in the second half of this year, it’ll only come in Edition One form. Basically the launch edition, this model is restricted to just five colors and will come fully loaded, with special badges, blue accents on the exterior trim strips and interior carbon fiber, and some other unique styling bits. Expect Edition Ones to cost at least $200,000, before you add any markups (and there will be markups). If you want to spec your electric G-wagen yourself — and you should — the 2026 model will probably become available in early spring.

No, the G-wagen will stay a purposefully limited commodity, even though Mercedes is making more than ever. In 2023 more than 10,000 G’s were sold in the U.S. alone, almost beating the S-Class, and here the G63 vastly outsells the G550 — I’ve heard the sales split currently sits at around 80 percent for the AMG. G-Class production is flexible, so Mercedes is prepared for any level of EV demand and can adjust output accordingly.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">In a roundtable at the launch, Michael Schiebe, AMG CEO and head of the G-Class division, said he thinks the EV could become the most popular G-wagen model by the end of the decade, especially in countries like China, and he expects the EV will both bring in new customers and conquests to the brand and hold major appeal to existing G-wagen owners. The G-Class has the second-wealthiest owners in the Mercedes brand, second only to Maybach, and its average customer is getting younger and more accepting of electrification. As for the potential of an electric AMG variant, Schiebe wouldn’t talk about any official plans, but the glint in his eye and the smile on his face basically confirmed it’ll happen eventually.<br></p><p class="sc-166b7vj-0 eEDRKr js_ymal-below-post" data-vtas-click="inner:Recommendation:ymal-below-post"></p><p class="sc-7pt2sm-0 kGSzqB js_more-below-post" data-vtas-click="inner:Recommendation:more-below-post"></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">The G-wagen seemed like it would be one of the last vehicles to convincingly go electric, and one of the most difficult customer bases to convert, but the G580 with EQ Technology proves it’s actually the ideal candidate. The electric G-Class is just as lovable as its gas-powered siblings, with its own unique character and unmatched off-road performance. I think it’s a home run, a smash hit, a tour de force, whatever other turn of phrase you can think of. I badly want one, no, I <em>need</em> one, and that’s exactly how a G-wagen should make you feel.</p><figure class="sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure" id="" data-id="ea6b8c05e142bc9009842c964ad13a3c" data-recommend-id="image://ea6b8c05e142bc9009842c964ad13a3c" data-format="jpg" data-width="5712" data-height="4284" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div class="sc-1eow4w5-2 fDJNBs has-data img-wrapper" contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><span class="sc-1eow4w5-0 knmQPh js_lightbox-wrapper"></span><p class="sc-1xgz690-0 hvSdOV image-meta"><figcaption class="sc-7s1ndr-0 joTjeT no-caption">Photo: Daniel Golson/Jalopnik</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea6b8c05e142bc9009842c964ad13a3c" data-recommend-id="image://ea6b8c05e142bc9009842c964ad13a3c" data-format="jpg" data-width="5712" data-height="4284" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" class="js_recommend"></span></figure><figure class="sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure" id="" data-id="6c427ee6ca47f4f26f3a393a461054f4" data-recommend-id="image://6c427ee6ca47f4f26f3a393a461054f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="5712" data-height="4284" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rear underbody of a Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div class="sc-1eow4w5-2 fDJNBs has-data img-wrapper" contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rear underbody of a Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><span class="sc-1eow4w5-0 knmQPh js_lightbox-wrapper"></span><p class="sc-1xgz690-0 hvSdOV image-meta"><figcaption class="sc-7s1ndr-0 joTjeT no-caption">Photo: Daniel Golson/Jalopnik</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6c427ee6ca47f4f26f3a393a461054f4" data-recommend-id="image://6c427ee6ca47f4f26f3a393a461054f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="5712" data-height="4284" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rear underbody of a Mercedes-Benz G580 EV" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" class="js_recommend"></span></figure></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Texas federal judge, Mark Pittman, appointed by former President Donald Trump, has blocked a Biden administration order to cap credit card fees at $8 per transaction.</li>
<li>The order, issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), was set to go into effect on May 14 and would have saved Americans about $12 billion a year.</li>
<li>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, joined by Judge Pittman, obtained a temporary injunction to block the ruling, arguing that it would harm the banking industry.</li>
<li>Critics have accused the Chamber of Commerce of "judge shopping" by seeking the injunction in Texas rather than another state due to the predominantly Republican-appointed judges on the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.</li>
<li>Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, has spoken out against the injunction, saying that banks make billions of dollars in profits from excessive late fees and that the move is a favor to big banks over consumers.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Indeed is laying off about 1,000 employees</strong>: The company, which is the largest job search website, plans to let go of around 8% of its workforce to simplify its organization.</p>

<p><strong>Social responsibility</strong>: The company worked with HR, legal, and diversity teams to ensure that underrepresented groups are not disproportionately affected by the layoffs.</p>

They happened during daytime hours, and the agency confirmed that each of the Amazon vehicles was operating in autonomous mode leading up to the crashes. In one crash a motorcyclist suffered minor injuries, and a Zoox driver reported minor injuries in the other, according to reports. Both happened last month, one in San Francisco and the other in Spring Valley, Nevada.</p><p>The agency said the probe will focus on the performance of the company’s automated driving system during the crashes, as well as how it behaves in crosswalks around pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p>
    

<p>In a statement, Zoox said it is committed to working with NHTSA to answer its questions. “Transparency and collaboration with regulators is of utmost importance,” the company said. Zoox said the vehicles had human safety drivers on board. </p>



<p>Zoox reported the crashes under an order to automated vehicle companies issued in 2021.</p><p>Amazon <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/2203a719d6e4bd2d439acda51449c625">acquired Zoox in June of 2020</a></span> for a price that analysts pegged at over $1 billion.

<p>The company has launched a shuttle service exclusively for its employees. Analysts say they expect Amazon to use the Zoox system for autonomous deliveries. </p><p>Zoox shuttles don’t have a steering wheel or pedals. The carriage-style interior of the vehicle has two benches that face each other. It measures just under 12 feet (3.7 meters) long, about a foot (a third of a meter) shorter than a standard Mini Cooper. It is capable of going up to 75 mph (121 kilometers per hour), although it started running on public roads at up to 35 mph, the company said. </p>

In March of 2022 the agency began looking into the company’s certification that its vehicle met federal safety standards for motor vehicles.</p><p>The agency said at the time that it would look into whether Zoox used its own test procedures to determine that certain federal standards weren’t applicable because of the robotaxi’s unique configuration.</p>
