	<a href="https://variety.com/t/warner-bros-discovery/" id="auto-tag_warner-bros-discovery" data-tag="warner-bros-discovery">Warner Bros. Discovery</a> has indicated early interest in exploring a partnership with <a href="https://variety.com/t/paramount-global/" id="auto-tag_paramount-global" data-tag="paramount-global">Paramount Global</a> to combine WBD’s Max and Paramount+, according to sources.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Paramount Global, after its controlling shareholder <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-skydance-ends-talks-shari-redstone-1236027264/">Shari Redstone scrapped merger talks with Skydance Media last month</a>, is proceeding under a new <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-shareholders-meeting-2024-skydance-deal-1236023661/">strategic plan under three co-CEOs</a> to slash costs, explore the sale of certain assets and accelerate the profitability of Paramount+ via a possible joint venture with another player.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	One potential streaming dance partner for Paramount is Warner Bros. Discovery. A source confirmed WBD’s preliminary interest in evaluating a streaming JV with Paramount Global, as first <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/paramount-streaming-merger-talks.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported by CNBC</a>. 

	</p>




<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Of course, it’s not a surprise that Warner Bros. Discovery would at least look into the feasibility of a streaming JV with Paramount, given how public Paramount Global’s leadership team has been about their desire to land a partner. At this point, the situation more or less involves each company kicking the tires on what such a partnership could look like.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Reps for Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global declined to comment.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	At Paramount Global’s <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-ceos-town-hall-layoffs-bankers-asset-sales-1236047993/">June 25 employee town hall meeting</a>, Chris McCarthy, one of the members of the three-headed Office of the CEO (and CEO of Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks), discussed two potential streaming partnerships.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The first option “is to enter a deep, long-term relationship with a leading technology platform, which already has the full scale that we are trying to obtain. But what they don’t have is our scale of content and together we will make for a very powerful combination to drive more minutes and greater profits,” McCarthy told employees at the town hall. “And this would allow us to focus a greater percent of our budget on the things we do best — that’s making hit content.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The second type of partnership Paramount Global is exploring “involves us joining forces with one or more other SVOD players,” McCarthy said. “The sheer volume of hit content that we could offer together would be tremendous across TV, film and sports and would attract millions of viewers. Plus, we would share in all other non-content expenses.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	McCarthy said, “The great news is there is tremendous interest in partnering with us across both of these strategic options, given the strength of our content, the volume of our hits, and our industry-leading track record.”

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Separately, at a recent investment conference, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said the company will be “opportunistic” in seeking M&amp;A deals in the next two or three years. “There are a lot of players that are losing a lot of money,” <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-zaslav-merger-acqisition-opportunities-1236019750/">Zaslav said May 30</a> at the Bernstein 40th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference. “There’ll be some players that want to get out of the business, that will look to consolidate their streaming businesses with others,” he said, adding that he believes there will be four or five dominant global streaming platforms as things shake out.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Paramount earlier this year discussed merging <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/peacock-paramount-plus-comcast-talks-1235913900/">Paramount+ with NBCUniversal’s Peacock</a> in the past, but so far nothing has transpired on that front. Meanwhile, late last year, Zaslav and Bob Bakish (then CEO of Paramount) briefly <a href="https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/warner-bros-discovery-paramount-merger-talks-1235847958/">discussed the idea of merging WBD and Paramount Global</a> but those talks did not go anywhere.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	<a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/paramount-plus-price-streaming-increase-1236046774/">Both Paramount+</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/max-price-increase-hike-1236024561/">Max have announced price hikes in the last few weeks</a> as both companies are keen on proving to Wall Street that their streaming businesses can be profitable growth engines.</p>

<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Forbes Valuation</h2>
<p>Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk is the richest person in the world with an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/" aria-label="estimated">estimated</a> net worth of $228. billion. Musk, who owns roughly 12% of Tesla, added about $7 billion to his net worth Monday.</p>

<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Key Background</h2>
<p>Tesla reported a 48% decline in first-quarter profits year-over-year, in addition to a 9% drop in revenue and roughly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/04/02/tesla-reports-first-negative-quarterly-delivery-growth-since-2020/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/04/02/tesla-reports-first-negative-quarterly-delivery-growth-since-2020/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/04/02/tesla-reports-first-negative-quarterly-delivery-growth-since-2020/" aria-label="70,000">70,000</a> fewer vehicles delivered than expected. That was Tesla’s first negative quarterly delivery growth since 2020. A decline in deliveries was “partially” caused by supply chain issues, Tesla said at the time, including an arson attack at its Berlin factory in February. Tesla also faces increased competition for electric vehicle sales in China, where several automakers reported significant increases in sales and deliveries, including <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/01/why-tesla-stock-popped-ahead-of-quarter-deliveries/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/01/why-tesla-stock-popped-ahead-of-quarter-deliveries/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/01/why-tesla-stock-popped-ahead-of-quarter-deliveries/" aria-label="BYD">BYD</a>, which reported a 21% increase in sales through its second quarter.</p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"><p id="article-0-inread"></p></fbs-ad>

<li><strong>S&amp;P 500 could drop 30%</strong>: If Berezin's prediction comes true, the S&amp;P 500 could tumble to 3,750, which marks a 30% drop from current levels.</li>
<li><strong>Labor market slowdown</strong>: Berezin's prediction hinges on the belief that the labor market will slow notably in coming months, which will weigh heavily on consumer spending and drive the economy into recession.</li>
<li><strong>Phillips curve plays a role</strong>: Berezin believes that the relationship between inflation and unemployment (measured by the Phillips curve) will determine the direction of the economy. If the economy operates on the steep side of the curve, it will lead to "immaculate disinflation" and weaker labor demand.</li>
<li><strong>Global growth could suffer</strong>: Berezin also foresees widespread economic pain, with growth slowing sharply in Europe and China, which could further weaken global growth and weigh heavily on international stocks.</li>

  <p>The publicly traded company, which is based in Cos Cob, Conn., also runs Redbox Free Live TV, a free ad-supported streaming service, and operates thousands of DVD rental kiosks. </p><p>Chicken Soup for the Soul owes money to more than 500 creditors, including entertainment companies such as Sony Pictures and Warner Bros. Discovery and retailers Walgreens and Walmart. As of March, the company had debts of $970 million and assets of $414, its bankruptcy filing shows.  In court documents, the company said its lenders were unwilling to cooperate with refinancing.</p>

    </p>
<p>A spokesperson for Chicken Soup for the Soul declined to comment.</p><p>Chicken Soup for the Soul saw rapid growth after going public in 2017, when its investors included Ashton Kutcher, with its annual revenues soaring from less than $10 million to more than $294 million in 2023. The company in 2022 bought Redbox, a dotcom-era survivor best known for its self-serve kiosks outside of pharmacies or groceries stores that let customers rent or sell DVDs.</p><p>At the time, Chicken Soup for the Soul touted the deal as a way to reach consumers across mediums and boost revenue, but the merged business failed to turn a profit while its losses piled up. The company reported 2023 revenue of roughly $110 million, and in March disclosed in a regulatory filing that it might not be able to continue as a going concern. </p><p>The company's stock price, which approached $50 in 2021, had tumbled more than 90% over the last year and was priced at 11 cents shortly before the close of trade on Monday.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Boeing buys Spirit AeroSystems</strong>: Boeing has agreed to acquire Spirit AeroSystems, one of its major suppliers and manufacturing partners, in a deal valued at $4.7 billion or $37.25 per share.</li>
<li><strong>Redemption of a past mistake</strong>: Boeing's current executives have acknowledged that the 2005 sale of Spirit to private equity buyers for $900 million was a mistake, which hurt the reliability of its supply chain.</li>
<li><strong>Boosting safety</strong>: Boeing believes that recombining with Spirit will improve safety by allowing for better coordination and control of its supply chain.</li>
<li><strong>Total transaction value</strong>: The total transaction value is approximately $8.3 billion, including Spirit's last reported net debt.</li>
<li><strong>All-stock deal</strong>: The acquisition is an all-stock deal, meaning that Boeing will issue its own shares to Spirit's shareholders rather than paying cash.</li>

            Boeing has agreed to buy Spirit AeroSystems, one of its major suppliers and manufacturing partners, as part of its plan to overhaul the aircraft maker’s badly damaged safety reputation.

Boeing’s current executives have admitted that the 2005 sale of Spirit to private equity buyers, which fetched only $900 million at that time, had proved to be a mistake for Boeing, hurting the reliability of its supply chain.

            “We believe this deal is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, the employees of Spirit and Boeing, our shareholders and the country more broadly,” said Boeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun in a statement.

            Spirit AeroSystems makes major parts of several Boeing models, including the fuselages for the 737 Max. The parts are then shipped to Boeing’s factories for assembly. The company also makes parts for Boeing’s rival Airbus, although Boeing is Spirit’s largest customer.

            The Boeing acquisition will mean breaking up Spirit. The supplier’s “major activities” related to Airbus will be bought by the European planemaker for a nominal $1, Airbus said in a statement Monday.

            Those activities include production of A350 fuselage sections in Kinston, North Carolina, and St. Nazaire, France, and A220 wings and mid-fuselage in Belfast, United Kingdom, Airbus said in its <a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-07-airbus-enters-agreement-with-spirit-aerosystems" target="_blank">statement</a>. It will receive $559 million from Spirit as compensation.

            Boeing had sought to get more money from rival Airbus for its part of Spirit, said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace industry consultant. Airbus’ business with Spirit accounted for $1.1 billion, 19% of its revenue in 2023, according to company filings, while $3.9 billion, or 64% came from business with Boeing. But Spirit was unwilling to contribute to the deal that Boeing was desperate to complete.
    </p>

            Spirit has had its own series of quality control issues in recent years, and Boeing had agreed to pay the company more money to try to improve Spirit’s quality and reliability issues, which had damaged Boeing’s output and reputation.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly2ur1e000053b6j14prflzg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The payments came to an extra $60 million in revenue last year and $395 million in 2024 and 2025.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly2ur2cx00073b6jlqt0gob0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Those payments are an indication of Boeing’s motivation for a deal for Spirit. It can’t return to profitability itself, or fix its own quality issues needed to assure regulators, airlines and the flying public about the safety of its aircraft, unless problems at Spirit are also fixed. And it’s going to cost Boeing money to fix those problems, whether it is the largest customer, or the owner, of those operations.

            Spirit was involved in the January <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/08/us/alaska-airlines-plug-door-found-investigation-monday/index.html">door plug blowout</a> on an Alaska Airways 737 Max shortly after takeoff that left a gaping hole in the side of the aircraft.

            Boeing said last week two different groups of employees were charged with doing work to the door plug, which is a part that is used in place of an emergency exit door. The first group of employees removed the door plug to address problems with rivets that were made by Spirit AeroSystems. But the Boeing staff <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/business/boeing-cause-alaska-air-door-plug/index.html">didn’t generate the paperwork</a> indicating they had removed the door plug, along with the four bolts necessary to hold it in place, in order to do that work. So the second group of employees replaced it, unaware the bolts were missing.

            Since the Alaska Air incident, Boeing has placed a number of employees in Spirit’s factories to insure that its products were being made according to specifications.

            Several whistleblowers have come forward since that incident, including some employees and contractors for Spirit. Last week, for example, a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/26/business/boeing-whistleblower-787/index.html">whistleblower</a> from a contractor for Spirit AeroSystems said he notified the company of wide gaps in a key part of 787 Dreamliner planes that posed “catastrophic” danger to passengers.

            Spirit has been involved in other safety problems for Boeing. In 2023 it used a “non-standard manufacturing process” when joining parts of the fuselages of 737 Max jets, leading Boeing to halt deliveries of the planes. Earlier this year, a Spirit employee notified Boeing that two holes may not have been drilled exactly to Boeing’s requirements, which required Boeing to rework about 50 planes that had not yet been delivered.

            The US Justice Department is <a href="https://cnn.com/2024/06/30/business/boeing-plea-deal/index.html">nearing an agreement </a>with Boeing that would include a corporate monitor and a fine in exchange for a guilty plea to criminal charges, according to lawyers representing the families of victims of two fatal 737 Max crashes, who harshly rebuked the offer as a “sweetheart deal.”

            Shares of Boeing (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/BA">BA</a>), which had already fallen 30% so far this year in the wake of the Alaska Air incident, fell another 1% in premarket trading on news of the deal. Shares of Spirit (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/SPR">SPR</a>) rose 5%, but to less than the $37.25 a share stated value of the deal, reflecting doubts about the future value of Boeing shares to be used in the purchase.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hidden fees are now illegal in California</strong>: A new state law, SB 478, makes it illegal for businesses to advertise a price for an item and then add hidden fees at the time of purchase. This law requires businesses to display the true cost of an item or service, excluding taxes and shipping costs.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Repair Act</strong>: SB 244 enables consumers and repair shops to access the parts, tools, and documentation needed to repair or service devices such as iPhones, televisions, and appliances without breaking the bank or going to the manufacturer.</li>
<li><strong>Short-term rentals must disclose total price</strong>: AB 537 requires hotels, motels, and short-term rentals on Airbnb and Vrbo to disclose the total price of a rental, including cleaning fees and other charges, in their advertised rate. Failure to do so will result in a $10,000 penalty.</li>
<li><strong>Rental deposits reduced to one month</strong>: AB 12 reduces the security deposit required for new rental contracts to one month's rent. Existing contracts with larger deposits are not affected, but landlords can still seek additional fees for damages exceeding one month's deposit.</li>
<li><strong>No Roofies Law</strong>: AB 1013 requires businesses that sell alcohol for consumption on their premises to provide clear warnings about the risks associated with date-rape drugs, such as rohypnol. This law aims to protect consumers from sexual assault.</li>

    <div><div class="body-copy"><p>DUBLIN — Half a million people on Monday were still locked out of their Patelco Credit Union accounts after a security breach on Saturday shut down bank operations with no clear resolution in sight.</p><p>Patelco’s President and CEO Erin Mendez on Saturday sent a systemwide email telling customers a “serious security “ breach “required us to shut down some of our day-to-day banking systems so that we can remediate the issue and contain the impact, including our online banking, our mobile App, and our call center.”</p><p>“We deeply apologize for the inconvenience and frustration caused by this incident. Our branches, call center and chat will be ready to assist as much as possible during regular business hours July 1,” the Dublin-based credit union’s website read Monday. “We’ll answer your questions as best we can, but we’re unable to provide specific account details at this time.”</p><p>Members of the credit union, which the company estimates at 500,000, were simultaneously locked out of their online accounts, barring them from checking their statement balances, sending or receiving money or changing passwords.</p><p>Patelco said on their social media pages that customers could access “over 30,000 shared branch ATMs in the U.S.” for cash withdrawal and deposits. But residents were unhappy with the limited access to their money.</p><p>“It shouldn’t have taken your team 36 hours to respond with an official statement. Also — no mention of the safety of our assets? Ridiculous,” Michele Milz posted on X.</p><cnx class="cnx-main-container cnx-in-desktop cnx-ps cnx-main-container-flex" id="e007211355684fb09a04cf5fd837c701"><cnx class="cnx-player-wrapper cnx-size-responsive cnx-in-ad-container cnx-hide-pinned-title-in-ad"><cnx class="cnx-ratio"></cnx><cnx class="cnx-playspace-container cnx-in-ps-landscape cnx-bp-md-st cnx-close-hover cnx-close-float-off cnx-bp-xl-v cnx-in-ad-full cnx-in-ad"><cnx class="cnx-ui cnx-ui-ad cnx-ad-duration cnx-is-playing"><cnx class="cnx-ui-ad-content "><cnx class="cnx-ad-marker" role="img" aria-label="Ad"><cnx class="cnx-marker-cnt-first"><cnx class="cnx-marker-cnt-second"><cnx class="cnx-ad-marker-svg"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 32 22"><path d="M26,22H0V0H31.93L32,16A6,6,0,0,1,26,22Z"></path><path d="M12,5.29h0L16.45,16.7H14.83l-1.06-2.85H8.86l-1,2.85H6.21L10.6,5.31h0Zm5.89,11.42V5.29h3.63A5.52,5.52,0,0,1,26.65,11a5.33,5.33,0,0,1-4.93,5.7H17.89Zm1.46-1.36h2.17c1.77,0,3.7-1.49,3.7-4.35s-1.93-4.28-3.7-4.28H19.35Zm-8-8.16-2,5.24h3.86Z"></path></svg>

While we might not have all the answers now, your security and peace of mind is our top priority. Please stay tuned for additional updates via social media.”</p><p>Julie Brusca, a San Jose resident, said she first noticed she couldn’t access her Patelco bank account beginning about 7 a.m. Saturday morning. She continued to try checking her balances, but got nothing. On Sunday, she said she went to a local Patelco ATM but was again unable to access her accounts. Then came the company-wide notice from the bank’s CEO at 1:53 p.m., she said.</p><p>“They were maddeningly vague about what this was,” Brusca said in an interview with this newspaper.</p><p>Patelco did not immediately offer additional information about the severity or causes of the security breach by early afternoon Monday. The credit union’s press office did not immediately return a request for comment Monday, nor did Mendez.</p><p>An updated statement came later in the afternoon Monday from the press office confirming the breach as a “ransomware attack.”</p><p>The statement also said the bank “engaged a leading third-party cybersecurity forensic firm to help us to investigate and recover as soon as possible” and they are working “around the clock” on the issue.</p><p>Brusca called the situation “really bad timing,” especially it happening at the end of the month and just before a bank holiday on July 4th. She expected a retirement payment to drop into her account over the weekend and has no idea whether the payment bounced or got deposited.</p><p>“Is my money safe?” questioned Brusca, a member since 1995. “If you’ve got direct debit for your rent or something, you’re screwed.”</p><p>She added, “If they don’t fix this by the end of the week their reputation is just going to go down the tube because you can’t just keep people from their money for a whole week.”</p><p>Patelco, the third-largest credit union the Bay Area, has multiple branches throughout the South Bay, such as in San Jose, Campbell, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale and Milpitas. Other locations are in Fremont, Redwood City, Hayward, Castro Valley, San Leandro, San Mateo, Dublin, Livermore, San Bruno, Oakland, Berkeley, San Ramon and Danville.</p><p></p>

<ol>
<li>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is set to ban noncompete agreements on September 4, 2024, which will significantly impact companies that rely on these agreements to protect their business information and relationships.</li>
<li>Even if the FTC's ban is challenged and ultimately survives, companies will still face a patchwork of state and local laws that limit the use of restrictive covenants, making a one-size-fits-all approach no longer tenable.</li>

<p>Companies seeking to protect their business with post-employment restrictions—in particular, noncompetes and non-solicitation agreements—face ever-increasing regulatory and legislative challenges. The Federal Trade Commission’s broad ban on noncompetes, slated to take effect on September 4, 2024, is surely the most dramatic and headline-grabbing of recent developments. However, even if the predictions that the rule won’t survive legal challenges are true, companies will still face a patchwork of state and local laws that significantly limit the use of restrictive covenants. With a one-size-fits-all approach no longer tenable, how can companies pursue the most effective strategy for protecting business information and relationships?</p>
<p><strong>Topics include:</strong></p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	The new Six Flags boasts an impressive portfolio of 42 parks stretching across the United States, Canada and Mexico, including <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/magic-mountain/" id="auto-tag_magic-mountain" data-tag="magic-mountain">Magic Mountain</a> and Knott’s Berry Farm in Southern California.</p>

	<strong>PREVIOUSLY, November 2</strong>: In what is described as a “merger of equals,” theme park operators Cedar Fair and Six Flags, are joining forces in an $8 billion deal, the companies announced Thursday.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	The combined company, which will be operated under the Six Flags name, will be headquartered in North Carolina and will feature a combined 27 amusement parks, 15 water parks and nine resorts across 17 states, Canada and Mexico.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto     ">
	“Our merger with Six Flags will bring together two of North America’s iconic amusement park companies to establish a highly diversified footprint and a more robust operating model to enhance park offerings and performance,” said Richard Zimmerman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cedar Fair. “Together, we will have an expanded and complementary portfolio of attractive assets and intellectual property to deliver engaging entertainment experiences for guests. The combination also creates an enhanced financial profile with strong cash flow generation to accelerate investments in our parks to delight our guests, driving increased levels of demand and in-park value and spending. I have great respect for the Six Flags team and look forward to joining forces as we embark on this next chapter together.”

<p><b>New Orders and Backlogs Contracting; Production and Employment Contracting; Supplier Deliveries Faster; Raw Materials Inventories Contracting; Customers' Inventories Too Low; Prices Increasing; Exports and Imports Contracting</b></p>
<p><span class="legendSpanClass"><span class="xn-location">TEMPE, Ariz.</span></span>, <span class="legendSpanClass"><span class="xn-chron">July 1, 2024</span></span> /PRNewswire/ -- Economic activity in the <b>manufacturing sector contracted in </b><b>June</b><b> for the third consecutive month and the 19th time in the last 20 months</b>, say the nation's supply executives in the latest <b>Manufacturing ISM</b><sup>®</sup><b> <i>Report On Business</i></b><sup>®</sup>.</p>
<p>The report was issued today by <span class="xn-person">Timothy R. Fiore</span>, CPSM, C.P.M., Chair of the Institute for Supply Management<sup>® </sup>(ISM<sup>®</sup>) Manufacturing Business Survey Committee:</p>
<p>"The Manufacturing PMI<sup>®</sup> registered 48.5 percent in June, down 0.2 percentage point from the 48.7 percent recorded in May. The overall economy continued in expansion for the 50th month after one month of contraction in <span class="xn-chron">April 2020</span>. (A Manufacturing PMI<sup>®</sup> above 42.5 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy.) The New Orders Index remained in contraction territory, registering 49.3 percent, 3.9 percentage points higher than the 45.4 percent recorded in May. The June reading of the Production Index (48.5 percent) is 1.7 percentage points lower than May's figure of 50.2 percent. The Prices Index registered 52.1 percent, down 4.9 percentage points compared to the reading of 57 percent in May. The Backlog of Orders Index registered 41.7 percent, down 0.7 percentage point compared to the 42.4 percent recorded in May. The Employment Index registered 49.3 percent, down 1.8 percentage points from May's figure of 51.1 percent.</p>
<p>"The Supplier Deliveries Index remained in 'faster' territory, registering 49.8 percent, 0.9 percentage point higher than the 48.9 percent recorded in May. (Supplier Deliveries is the only ISM<sup>®</sup> <i>Report On Business</i><sup>®</sup> index that is inversed; a reading of above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries, which is typical as the economy improves and customer demand increases.) The Inventories Index registered 45.4 percent, down 2.5 percentage points compared to May's reading of 47.9 percent.</p>
<p>"The New Export Orders Index reading of 48.8 percent is 1.8 percentage points lower than the 50.6 percent registered in May. The Imports Index dropped into contraction territory, registering 48.5 percent, 2.6 percentage point lower than the 51.1 percent reported in May."</p>
<p>Fiore continues, "U.S. manufacturing activity continued in contraction at the close of the second quarter. Demand was weak again, output declined, and inputs stayed accommodative. <b>Demand</b> slowing was reflected by the (1) New Orders Index improving to marginal contraction, (2) New Export Orders Index returning to contraction, (3) Backlog of Orders Index dropping into stronger contraction territory, and (4) Customers' Inventories Index moving into the low side of the 'just right' range, neutral for future production. <b>Output</b> (measured by the Production and Employment indexes) declined compared to May, with a combined 3.5-percentage point downward impact on the Manufacturing PMI<sup>® </sup>calculation. Panelists' companies reduced production levels month over month as head count reductions continued in June. <b>Inputs</b> — defined as supplier deliveries, inventories, prices and imports — continued to accommodate future demand growth. The Prices Index eased but remained in expansion (or 'increasing') territory; the index registered its second month of cooling increases.</p>
<p>"Demand remains subdued, as companies demonstrate an unwillingness to invest in capital and inventory due to current monetary policy and other conditions. Production execution was down compared to the previous month, likely causing revenue declines, putting pressure on profitability. Suppliers continue to have capacity, with lead times improving and shortages not as severe. Sixty-two percent of manufacturing gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in June, up from 55 percent in May. More concerning is the share of sector GDP registering a composite PMI<sup>®</sup> calculation at or below 45 percent — a good barometer of overall manufacturing weakness — was 14 percent in June, 10 percentage points higher than the 4 percent reported in May," says Fiore.</p>
<p>The eight manufacturing industries reporting growth in June — in order — are: Printing &amp; Related Support Activities; Petroleum &amp; Coal Products; Primary Metals; Furniture &amp; Related Products; Paper Products; Chemical Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; and Nonmetallic Mineral Products. The nine industries reporting contraction in June — in the following order — are: Textile Mills; Machinery; Fabricated Metal Products; Wood Products; Transportation Equipment; Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; and Computer &amp; Electronic Products.</p>
<p><b>WHAT RESPONDENTS ARE SAYING</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>"High volume of customer orders." [Chemical Products]</li>
<li>"Customers continue to cut orders with short notice, causing a ripple effect throughout lower-tier suppliers." [Transportation Equipment]</li>
<li>"Consumer demand and inventories are no longer stable at retail and food service establishments." [Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products]</li>
<li>"While orders are still steady, inventory from the previous month is enough to satisfy current- and near-term commitments." [Computer &amp; Electronic Products]</li>
<li>"Customers ordering more to create buffer stocks (in case of) future shortages." [Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components]</li>
<li>"Order levels in two of our main divisions are indicating weak demand, and now we must work to reduce inventory levels." [Fabricated Metal Products]</li>
<li>"Sales backlog is decreasing. We have furloughed a portion of our workforce as a result." [Machinery]</li>
<li>"The level of production is lower due to decreased demand for products." [Miscellaneous Manufacturing]</li>
<li>"Elevated financing costs have dampened demand for residential investment. We have reduced inventories of production components." [Wood Products]</li>
<li>"Orders have increased slightly due to seasonal restocking." [Plastics &amp; Rubber Products]</li>

<p><b><u>Manufacturing PMI</u><sup>®<br class="dnr"></sup></b>The U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the third consecutive month in June, as the Manufacturing PMI<sup>®</sup> registered 48.5 percent, down 0.2 percentage point compared to May's reading of 48.7 percent. "After breaking a 16-month streak of contraction by expanding in March, the manufacturing sector has contracted the last three months, and at a faster rate in June. None of five subindexes that directly factor into the Manufacturing PMI<sup>®</sup> were in expansion territory, down from two in May. The New Orders Index remained in contraction but moved upward in June. Of the six biggest manufacturing industries, only one (Chemical Products) registered growth in June," says Fiore. A reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing sector is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally contracting.</p>
<p>A Manufacturing PMI<sup>®</sup> above 42.5 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy. Therefore, the June Manufacturing PMI<sup>®</sup> indicates the overall economy grew for the 50th straight month after one month of contraction (<span class="xn-chron">April 2020</span>). "The past relationship between the Manufacturing PMI<sup>®</sup> and the overall economy indicates that the June reading (48.5 percent) corresponds to a change of plus-1.7 percent in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis," says Fiore.</p>

Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, only one (Chemical Products) reported increased production. "Panelists' companies marginally reduced output levels compared to May. New order rates remain weak and backlog levels continue to decline, as production output enters contraction territory and companies are hesitant to invest in intermediate goods and finished goods inventory due to economic uncertainty," says Fiore.

<p><b><u>Supplier Deliveries</u><sup>†<br class="dnr"></sup></b>Delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations was faster in June, with the Supplier Deliveries Index registering 49.8 percent, a 0.9-percentage point gain compared to the reading of 48.9 percent reported in May. This is the fourth consecutive month of faster deliveries after one month of slower performance preceded by 16 straight months in "faster" territory. After a reading of 52.4 percent in <span class="xn-chron">September 2022</span>, the index went into contraction territory in October and remained there until February. Of the six big industries, two (Chemical Products; and Machinery) reported slower supplier deliveries in June. "On a consistent basis in 2024, suppliers have supported customers adequately by delivering faster, making more reliable promises and slowly reducing lead times. Panelists continue to predict faster supplier deliveries for the rest of the year," says Fiore. A reading below 50 percent indicates faster deliveries, while a reading above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries.</p>
<p>The four manufacturing industries reporting slower supplier deliveries in June are: Petroleum &amp; Coal Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Chemical Products; and Machinery. The eight industries reporting faster supplier deliveries in June — in the following order — are: Wood Products; Paper Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; Fabricated Metal Products; Primary Metals; Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; and Transportation Equipment. Six industries reported no change in supplier deliveries in June as compared to May.</p>

<p><b><u>Inventories<br class="dnr"></u></b>The Inventories Index registered 45.4 percent in June, down 2.5 percentage points compared to the reading of 47.9 percent reported in May. "Manufacturing inventories contracted at a faster rate compared to the previous month. None of the six big industries reported increased manufacturing inventories in June. Demand uncertainty is causing panelists' companies to reduce investment in inventory and remain reliant on suppliers to carry 'on-demand' inventory," says Fiore. An Inventories Index greater than 44.4 percent, over time, is generally consistent with expansion in the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) figures on overall manufacturing inventories (in chained <span class="xn-money">2000 dollars</span>).</p>
<p>Of 18 manufacturing industries, four reported higher inventories in June: Petroleum &amp; Coal Products; Textile Mills; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; and Primary Metals. The 10 industries reporting lower inventories in June — in the following order — are: Wood Products; Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Machinery; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Furniture &amp; Related Products; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; Transportation Equipment; Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products; and Chemical Products.</p>

"The Prices Index indicated expansion in June, but at slower rate compared to the previous month. Commodity prices continue to be volatile, especially fuel, natural gas, aluminum and plastics. Steel prices are approaching long-term historical lows. Twenty percent of companies reported higher prices in June, compared to 26 percent in May, a clear improvement," says Fiore. A Prices Index above 52.8 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Producer Price Index for Intermediate Materials.</p>
<p>In June, the eight industries that reported paying increased prices for raw materials, in order, are: Wood Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; Textile Mills; Paper Products; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; and Chemical Products.

New export levels remain sluggish as international trading partners continue to struggle with slow moving economies," says Fiore.</p>
<p>The four industries reporting growth in new export orders in June are: Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Paper Products; Chemical Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing. The eight industries reporting a decrease in new export orders in June — in the following order — are: Fabricated Metal Products; Transportation Equipment; Primary Metals; Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Machinery; Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; and Computer &amp; Electronic Products.</p>

<p><b><u>Imports</u><sup>†<br class="dnr"></sup></b>ISM<sup>®</sup>'s Imports Index cooled in June with a reading of 48.5 percent, a decrease of 2.6 percentage points compared to May's figure of 51.1 percent. "Imports contracted after five consecutive months of expansion preceded by 14 consecutive months of contraction. Respondents' companies continue to limit investment in inventory, as future growth prospects remain cloudy. Ocean freight costs continue to rise and access to equipment remains restricted as a result of extended transit times, reducing available container and ship availability," says Fiore.</p>
<p>The five industries reporting an increase in import volumes in June are: Primary Metals; Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; and Chemical Products. The six industries that reported lower volumes of imports in June, in order, are: Wood Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Transportation Equipment; Machinery; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; and Fabricated Metal Products. Seven industries reported no change in imports in June as compared to May.</p>

<p><b><u>About </u></b><b><u>This Report<br class="dnr"></u></b>DO NOT CONFUSE THIS NATIONAL REPORT with the various regional purchasing reports released across the country. The national report's information reflects the entire U.S., while the regional reports contain primarily regional data from their local vicinities. Also, the information in the regional reports is not used in calculating the results of the national report. The information compiled in this report is for the month of <span class="xn-chron">June 2024</span>.</p>
<p>The data presented herein is obtained from a survey of manufacturing supply executives based on information they have collected within their respective organizations. ISM<sup>®</sup> makes no representation, other than that stated within this release, regarding the individual company data collection procedures. The data should be compared to all other economic data sources when used in decision-making.</p>
<p><b><u>Data and Method of Presentation<br class="dnr"></u></b>The <b>Manufacturing ISM<sup>®</sup> <i>Report On Business</i><sup>®</sup></b> is based on data compiled from purchasing and supply executives nationwide. The composition of the Manufacturing Business Survey Committee is stratified according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and each of the following NAICS-based industries' contribution to gross domestic product (GDP): Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products; Textile Mills; Apparel, Leather &amp; Allied Products; Wood Products; Paper Products; Printing &amp; Related Support Activities; Petroleum &amp; Coal Products; Chemical Products; Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Fabricated Metal Products; Machinery; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; Transportation Equipment; Furniture &amp; Related Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing (products such as medical equipment and supplies, jewelry, sporting goods, toys and office supplies). The data are weighted based on each industry's contribution to GDP. According to BEA estimates (the average of the fourth quarter 2022 GDP estimate and the GDP estimates for first, second, and third quarter 2023, as released on <span class="xn-chron">December 21, 2023</span>), the six largest manufacturing industries are: Chemical Products; Transportation Equipment; Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; Machinery; and Fabricated Metal Products.</p>
<p>Survey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month. For each of the indicators measured (New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Imports, Production, Supplier Deliveries, Inventories, Customers' Inventories, Employment and Prices), this report shows the percentage reporting each response, the net difference between the number of responses in the positive economic direction (higher, better and slower for Supplier Deliveries) and the negative economic direction (lower, worse and faster for Supplier Deliveries), and the diffusion index. Responses are raw data and are never changed. The diffusion index includes the percent of positive responses plus one-half of those responding the same (considered positive).</p>
<p>The resulting single index number for those meeting the criteria for seasonal adjustments (Manufacturing PMI<sup>®</sup>, New Orders, Production, Employment and Inventories) is then seasonally adjusted to allow for the effects of repetitive intra-year variations resulting primarily from normal differences in weather conditions, various institutional arrangements, and differences attributable to non-moveable holidays. All seasonal adjustment factors are subject annually to relatively minor changes when conditions warrant them. The Manufacturing PMI<sup>®</sup> is a composite index based on the diffusion indexes of five of the indexes with equal weights: New Orders (seasonally adjusted), Production (seasonally adjusted), Employment (seasonally adjusted), Supplier Deliveries, and Inventories (seasonally adjusted).</p>
<p>Diffusion indexes have the properties of leading indicators and are convenient summary measures showing the prevailing direction of change and the scope of change. A Manufacturing PMI<sup>®</sup> reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally declining. A Manufacturing PMI<sup>®</sup> above 42.5 percent, over a period of time, indicates that the overall economy, or gross domestic product (GDP), is generally expanding; below 42.5 percent, it is generally declining. The distance from 50 percent or 42.5 percent is indicative of the extent of the expansion or decline. With some of the indicators within this report, ISM<sup>®</sup> has indicated the departure point between expansion and decline of comparable government series, as determined by regression analysis. The <b>Manufacturing ISM<sup>®</sup><i> Report On Business<sup>®</sup></i></b> survey is sent out to Manufacturing Business Survey Committee respondents the first part of each month. Respondents are asked to report on information for the current month for U.S. operations only. ISM<sup>®</sup> receives survey responses throughout most of any given month, with the majority of respondents generally waiting until late in the month to submit responses to give the most accurate picture of current business activity. ISM<sup>®</sup> then compiles the report for release on the first business day of the following month.</p>
<p>The industries reporting growth, as indicated in the <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>ISM<sup>®</sup><i> Report On Business<sup>®</sup></i></b> monthly report, are listed in the order of most growth to least growth. For the industries reporting contraction or decreases, those are listed in the order of the highest level of contraction/decrease to the least level of contraction/decrease.</p>
<p>Responses to Buying Policy reflect the percent reporting the current month's lead time, the approximate weighted number of days ahead for which commitments are made for Capital Expenditures; Production Materials; and Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO) Supplies, expressed as hand-to-mouth (five days), 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, six months (180 days), a year or more (360 days), and the weighted average number of days. These responses are raw data, never revised, and not seasonally adjusted.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Silvergate Bank's alleged fraud</strong>: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sued Silvergate Bank, accusing the bank of defrauding its investors by lying about its anti-money laundering controls and misleading them about how the FTX collapse would affect the bank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Settlement reached</strong>: Silvergate Bank has agreed to pay $50 million to settle the charges, without admitting or denying the allegations. The bank's CEO and other executives have also settled for smaller penalties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alleged anti-money laundering failures</strong>: The SEC alleges that Silvergate Bank had an ineffective anti-money laundering program, failing to adequately monitor over $1 trillion in transactions and missing nearly $9 billion in suspicious transfers by FTX entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FTX connection</strong>: FTX was one of Silvergate Bank's largest customers, and the SEC alleges that the bank failed to notice the suspicious activity by FTX entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulatory action</strong>: The SEC's lawsuit and settlement with Silvergate Bank are another regulatory blow to the company, which collapsed in early 2023 due to financial issues related to its exposure to the crypto market. This latest development illustrates the ongoing efforts of regulators to hold accountable companies that engage in misconduct in the crypto space.</p>

Silvergate also didn’t notice “nearly $9 billion in suspicious transfers” by FTX entities.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">FTX was among Silvergate’s largest customers, the SEC says. Days after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/30/23484331/ftx-explained-cryptocurrency-sbf-sam-bankman-fried">the crypto exchange declared bankruptcy</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/4/23623964/crypto-silvergate-bank-run-stablecoins-dollars">bank run that would ultimately kill Silvergate</a> had begun. Lane, aware of social media chatter about Silvergate, asked the bank to review its relationship with FTX. That review found more than 300 suspicious transactions in 2022. Those suspicious transfers totaled almost $9 billion, the SEC complaint says.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">At that point, Silvergate’s chief financial officer Antonio Martino “engaged in a fraudulent scheme to mislead investors about the Bank’s dire financial condition,” the SEC alleges. Martino knew the bank had borrowed billions, which it would have to repay in January and February 2023. The only way that could happen would be by selling securities, but Martino approved an earnings release that “falsely stated the Bank expected to sell only $1.7 billion in securities during the First Quarter of 2023, of which it had already sold $1.5 billion.”</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">That earnings release understated Silvergate’s losses from its securities sales, the SEC complaint alleges.

This was used by, among others, stablecoin issuers such as Circle, Paxos, and Gemini. Though Silvergate said SEN was safe, the SEC says the network wasn’t being automatically monitored for suspicious transactions for “at least 15 months prior to November 2022.”</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">What’s more, on several occasions in 2022, the bank’s government examiners made it clear to the C-suite that Silvergate’s program for compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act was inadequate.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">The earnings statement for the first quarter of 2023 wasn’t the only one alleged to contain fraud. In November 2022, the company suggested to investors that it had a “state-of-the-art” compliance program. In reality, the SEC says there was no automatic monitoring for several months before that earnings statement was released.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white"><em><strong>Update, July 1st:</strong> Added Linklater’s statement, SEC press release, and settlement details.</em></p></div></div></div>

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">An investigation conducted by the European Commission has found that Meta’s “pay or consent” offer to Facebook and Instagram users in Europe does not comply with the bloc’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/europes-dma-rules-for-big-tech-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Markets Act </a>(DMA), according to preliminary findings reported by the regulator on Monday.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Commission wrote in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_3582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> that the binary choice Meta offers “forces users to consent to the combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalised but equivalent version of Meta’s social networks.”</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Failure to abide by the ex-ante market contestability regulation, which applied on Meta and other so called “gatekeepers” since March 7, could be extremely costly for the adtech giant. Penalties for confirmed breaches can reach up to 10% of global annual turnover, and even 20% for repeat offences.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">More saliently, Meta could finally be forced to abandon a business model that demands users agree to surveillance advertising as the entry “price” for using its social networks.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The EU <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/">in March opened a formal DMA investigation</a> into Meta’s “pay or consent” offer, following months of lobbying from privacy advocacy and consumer protection groups. The groups also argued that a subscription to not see ads does not comply with the bloc’s data protection or consumer protection rules either.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Back in March, the Commission said it was concerned Meta’s binary choice may not provide “a real alternative” for users who do not consent to its tracking. Meta was essentially asking users to either agree to being tracked so it could continue serving targeted advertising, or fork out almost €13 per month (per account) to access ad-free versions of the services.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The EU’s goal with the DMA is to level the playing field by targeting various advantages that gatekeepers can exploit using their dominance.</p>
<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">
</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In Meta’s case, the Commission thinks the company’s dominant position in social networking lets it extract more data from users to profile them, which gives its ad business an unfair advantage versus its competitors. To reset the dynamic, the EC introduced a requirement in the DMA that gatekeepers must obtain people’s permission before they can be tracked for ads. </p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The regulator’s case against Meta contends the adtech giant is failing to provide people with a free and fair choice to deny tracking.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In a briefing with journalists ahead of the announcement, senior Commission officials emphasized that as long as Meta’s social networking services are free, the equivalent versions it offers to users who do not wish to consent to tracking must also be free.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The relevant DMA article here is Article 5(2), which requires gatekeepers to seek users’ consent for combining their personal data between designated core platform services (CPS) and other services. Facebook, Instagram and Meta’s ads business have been designated as CPS since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/06/dma-gatekeepers-named/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 2023</a>, so the company needs users’ permission to track and profile their activity and run “personalized” ads.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Users who refuse Meta’s tracking have the right to access a less-personalized but equivalent alternative, and the Commission’s preliminary view after around three months of investigations is that Meta is breaching this requirement, as a paid subscription is not a valid equivalent to free access.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The regulation also stipulates gatekeepers cannot make use of a service or certain functionalities conditional on users’ consent. </p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Meta spokesman Matthew Pollard responded to the EU’s findings by sending a statement attributed to a company spokesperson. Meta repeated a defense of the approach by citing an earlier EU court judgment, writing: “Subscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA. We look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">When asked about this defense, senior Commission officials pointed out that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/04/cjeu-meta-superprofiling-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">judgement</a> Meta is referring to involved the Court of Justice caveating the suggestion that a paid version of a service may be offered as an alternative to tracking ads, saying that only “if necessary” could an “appropriate fee” be charged.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In the DMA context, the bloc’s enforcers say a gatekeeper would therefore have to argue why a fee is necessary. The EU pointed out that Meta <em>could</em> offer an alternative service with ads that do not rely on any personal data for targeting — such as contextual advertising. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Meta has never explained why it has not offered users a free, contextual ads option.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The EU looks to be on a road to forcing Meta to provide a non-binary, privacy-safe choice in the coming months.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“To ensure compliance with the DMA, users who do not consent should still get access to an equivalent service which uses less of their personal data, in this case for the personalisation of advertising,” the Commission noted in the press release. </p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Commission officials noted that Meta could still offer a subscription option, but any paid choice would need to be an additional offer (i.e. a third choice) on top of a free equivalent that does not demand users consent to being tracked.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The EU’s investigation isn’t over yet, and Meta will have a chance to respond formally to the preliminary findings. But there’s a limited window for things to play out here: The bloc has set itself a 12-month timeline to complete the probe, which suggests it needs to finish the job by or before March 2025.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">BEUC, the European consumer organization, welcomed the preliminary findings, urging the EU to push through to speedy enforcement.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“It’s good news that the Commission is taking enforcement action based on the Digital Markets Act against Meta’s pay-or-consent model. It comes on top of the complaints against Meta’s model for breaches of consumer law and data protection law, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/28/meta-consent-or-pay-consumer-gdpr-complaints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consumer organisations have raised in the last few months</a>. We now urge Meta to comply with laws meant to protect consumers,” said Agustin Reyna, BEUC’s director general, in a statement.</p>
