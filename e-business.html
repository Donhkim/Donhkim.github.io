    <div><p>Get ready for a bonanza of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve that starts in a few months and extends all the way into next summer, according to analysts at Citi Research.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>In a note on Friday, the bank cited fresh signs of a slowing economy for its view that the Fed will trim rates by 25 basis points eight times, starting in September and extending to July 2025.</p>



<p>That will lower the benchmark rate by a whopping 200 basis points, or from 5.25%-5.5% now to 3.25%-3.5%, where they will remain for the rest of 2025, the note said.</p>



<p>The economy has cooled off from its “heady” pace in 2023 with inflation resuming its slowdown after some unexpected stickiness, said Citi analysts led by chief U.S. economist Andrew Hollenhorst. </p>



<p>But the Institute for Supply Management’s service-sector gauge, which abruptly reversed into negative territory, and the monthly jobs report, which showed unemployment rising to 4.1%, have raised the risk of a sharper weakening of economic activity and a faster pace of rate cuts, they added.</p><p></p>



<p>The data along with dovish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday suggest the first rate cut will very likely come in September. </p>



<p>“A continued softening of activity will provoke cuts at each of the subsequent seven Fed meetings, in our base case,” Citi predicted.</p>



<p>The note also pointed to other signs of weakness in the jobs report. While the headline payroll gain of 206,000 appears solid, prior months were revised down. And June saw a decline of 49,000 temporary services jobs, with Citi calling it “the type of decline that is typically seen around recessions as employers begin reducing labor with the least strongly attached workers.”</p>



<p>Payroll data are also likely skewed to the upside, leaving the unemployment rate, which is derived from a separate survey, as the more important metric, it said. And on that front, Citi pointed to the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/recession-indicator-economic-outlook-sahm-rule-unemployment-rate-june-jobs-report/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/recession-indicator-economic-outlook-sahm-rule-unemployment-rate-june-jobs-report/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/recession-indicator-economic-outlook-sahm-rule-unemployment-rate-june-jobs-report/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">“Sahm Rule” recession indicator</a> and said it could be triggered in August if unemployment continues to rise at its current pace.</p>



<p>Hollenhorst has been a relative contrarian this year by maintaining a dimmer view on the economy, even as the Wall Street consensus shifted to a soft landing.</p><p></p>



<p>In May, he doubled down on his warning that the U.S. is <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/05/economic-outlook-hard-landing-recession-fed-rate-cuts-forecast-citi/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/05/economic-outlook-hard-landing-recession-fed-rate-cuts-forecast-citi/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/05/economic-outlook-hard-landing-recession-fed-rate-cuts-forecast-citi/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">headed for a hard landing</a> and that Fed rate cuts wouldn’t be enough to prevent it. That followed a similar forecast in February, even amid blowout jobs reports.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-07-03/bloomberg-surveillance-07-04-2024&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCxOzGspWHAxWgmI4IHd3VC4YQtwJ6BAgOEAI&amp;usg=AOvVaw3vANgZLjaSZwx1yIMvCBjw" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-07-03/bloomberg-surveillance-07-04-2024&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCxOzGspWHAxWgmI4IHd3VC4YQtwJ6BAgOEAI&amp;usg=AOvVaw3vANgZLjaSZwx1yIMvCBjw" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-07-03/bloomberg-surveillance-07-04-2024&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCxOzGspWHAxWgmI4IHd3VC4YQtwJ6BAgOEAI&amp;usg=AOvVaw3vANgZLjaSZwx1yIMvCBjw" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Bloomberg TV on Wednesday</a>, Hollenhorst noted that a sharp recession would likely produce enough political consensus for more government spending to stimulate the economy, overcoming concerns about the massive deficit. But a more mild recession may not result in such a consensus, he added.</p>



<p>He also pointed out that just as Fed rate hikes slowed the economy less than anticipated, rate cuts have not stimulate as much. In addition, 10-year bond yields, which serve as benchmarks for a wide range of borrowing costs, are already below 2-year yields, leaving less room for further downside, especially as rising deficits and inflation add upward pressure. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“Most economic activity is going to be more responsive to a 5-year yield, the 10-year yield. It’s not really about the overnight policy rate,” Hollenhorst explained. “So there really are questions about how much can you transmit that stimulative effect of lower policy rates.” </p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get global CEO perspectives on the biggest stories in business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p>.</p></div></div>

However, after the results, IV crashed, and the stock returned to around $285 over the next couple of weeks.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/5/26750043-17202215501308005_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="1008" data-height="509" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="true" data-og-image-msn="true" data-og-image-facebook="true" data-og-image-google_news="true" data-og-image-google_plus="true" data-og-image-linkedin="true"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/5/26750043-17202215501308005.png" alt="IV" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"></a></span><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This pattern repeats about every quarter, starting one month before the earnings season begins and ending once earnings are reported.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/5/26750043-17202218569602892_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="958" data-height="509" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="true" data-og-image-msn="true" data-og-image-facebook="true" data-og-image-google_news="true" data-og-image-google_plus="true" data-og-image-linkedin="true"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/5/26750043-17202218569602892.png" alt="IV" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"></a></span><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Correlations At All-Time Lows</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This is why the 1-month implied correlation index has pushed on to new lows, falling below 4, and is now trading nearly three handles below its previous all-time lows set in 2017/18.

Using our filtering criteria, the initial list is quickly narrowed to roughly 700 stocks, mostly dividend-paying and dividend-growing. From thereon, by using various data elements, including dividend history, payout ratios, revenue growth, debt ratios, EPS growth, etc., we calculate a "Dividend Quality Score" for each stock that measures the relative safety and sustainability of the dividend. In addition to dividend safety, we also seek cheaper valuations. We also demand that the selected companies have an established business model, solid dividend history, manageable debt, and an investment-grade credit rating.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This month, we highlight three groups with five stocks each that have an average dividend yield (as a group) of 3.61%, 5.30%, and 7.78%, respectively. The first list is for conservative and risk-averse investors, while the second is for investors seeking higher yields but still wanting relatively safe dividends. The third group is for yield-hungry investors but comes with an elevated risk, and we urge investors to exercise caution.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><em>Notes: 1) Please note that when we use the term "safe" in relation to stocks and investments, it should be interpreted as</em> <em>"relatively safe" because nothing is absolutely safe in investing. Even though we present only 5 to 10 stocks in our final list, one should have 15-20 stocks at a minimum in a well-diversified portfolio.</em></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><em>2) All tables in this article are created by the author unless explicitly specified. The stock data have been sourced from various sources such as Seeking Alpha, Yahoo Finance, GuruFocus, Morningstar, and CCC-List (Dividend Radar).</em></p> <h4 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><em>The Selection Process</em></strong></h4> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><em>Note: Regular readers of this series could skip this section to avoid repetitiveness. We include this section (in part) for new readers to provide the necessary background and perspective. Readers can also read a more detailed explanation of the goals and the selection process in our blog post <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/434815-financially-free-investor/6024782-selection-process-outline-5-relatively-secure-and-cheap-dgis-monthly-series">here</a>. </em></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><em>Criteria to Shortlist:</em></strong></p> <ul class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"> <li><em>Market cap &gt; $10 billion ($8 billion in a down market)</em></li> <li><em>Dividend yield &gt; 1.0% (some exceptions are made to include high quality but lower yielding companies)</em></li> <li><em>Daily average volume &gt; 100,000</em></li> <li><em>Dividend growth past five years &gt;= 0.</em></li> </ul> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">By applying the above criteria, we got around 600 companies.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><em>Narrowing Down the List</em></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><em>As a first step, we would like to eliminate stocks that have less than five years of dividend growth history. We cross-check our current list of over 600 stocks against the list of so-called Dividend Champions, Contenders, and Challengers originally defined and created by David Fish. Generally, the stocks with more than 25 years of dividend increases are called dividend Champions, while stocks with more than ten but less than 25 years of dividend increases are termed Contenders. Further, stocks with more than five but less than ten years of dividend increases are called Challengers. Also, since we want a lot of flexibility and wider choice at this initial stage, we include some companies that pay dividends lower than 1.40% but otherwise have a stellar dividend record and growing dividends at a fast pace.</em></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><em>After we apply all the above criteria, we're left with 364 companies on our list. However, so far in this list, we have demanded five or more years of consistent dividend growth. But what if a company had a very stable record of dividend payments but did not increase the dividends from one year to another? At times, some of these companies are foreign-based companies, and due to currency fluctuations, their dividends may appear to have been cut in US dollars, but in reality, that may not be true at all when looked at in the actual currency of reporting. At times, we may provide some exceptions when a company may have cut the dividend in the past, but otherwise, it looks compelling. So, by relaxing some of the conditions, a total of 70 additional companies were considered to be on our list. We call them category 'B' companies. After including them, we had a total of 434 (364 + 70) companies that made our first list.</em></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><em>We then imported the various data elements from many sources and assigned weights based on different criteria as listed below:</em></p> <ul class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"> <li><em>Current yield: Indicates the yield based on the current price.</em></li> <li><em>Dividend growth history (number of years of dividend growth): This provides information on how many years a company has paid and increased dividends on a consistent basis. For stocks under the category 'B' (defined above), we consider the total number of consecutive years of dividends paid rather than the number of years of dividend growth.</em></li> <li><em>Payout ratio: This indicates how comfortably the company can pay the dividend from its earnings. We prefer this ratio to be as low as possible, which would indicate the company's ability to grow the dividend in the future. This ratio is calculated by dividing the dividend amount per share by the EPS (earnings per share). The cash-flow payout ratio is calculated by dividing the dividend amount paid per share by the cash flow generated per share.</em></li> <li><em>Past five-year and 10-year dividend growth: Even though it's the dividend growth rate from the past, this does indicate how fast the company has been able to grow its earnings and dividends in the recent past. The recent past is the best indicator that we have to know what to expect in the next few years.</em></li> <li><em>EPS growth (average of previous five years of growth and expected next five years' growth): As the earnings of a company grow, more than likely, dividends will grow accordingly. We will take into account the actual EPS growth of the previous five years and the estimated EPS growth for the next five years. We will add the two numbers and assign weights.</em></li> <li><em>Chowder number: So, what's the Chowder number? This number has been named after well-known SA author Chowder, who first coined and popularized this factor. This number is derived by adding the current yield and the past five years' dividend growth rate. A Chowder number of "12" or more ("8" for utilities) is considered good.</em></li> <li><em>Debt/equity ratio: This ratio will tell us about the company's debt load in relation to its equity. We all know that too much debt can lead to major problems, even for well-known companies. The lower this ratio, the better it is. Sometimes, we find this ratio to be negative or unavailable, even for well-known companies. This can happen for a myriad of reasons and is not always a reason for concern. This is why we use this ratio in combination with the debt/asset ratio (covered next).</em></li> <li><em>Debt/asset ratio: This ratio will tell us about the debt load in relation to the company's total assets. In almost all cases, this ratio would be lower than the debt/equity ratio. Also, this ratio is important because, for some companies, the debt/equity ratio is not a reliable indicator.</em></li> <li><em>S&amp;P's credit rating: This is the credit rating assigned by the rating agency S&amp;P Global and is indicative of the company's ability to service its debt. This rating can be obtained from the S&amp;P website.</em></li> <li><em>PEG ratio: This is also called the price/earnings-to-growth ratio. The PEG ratio is considered to be an indicator if the stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly priced. A lower PEG may indicate that a stock is undervalued. However, PEG for a company may differ significantly from one reported source to another, depending on which growth estimate is used in the calculation. Some use past growth, while others may use future expected growth.</em></li> <li><em>Distance from 52-week high: We want to select companies that are good, solid companies but also are trading at cheaper valuations currently. They may be cheaper due to some temporary down cycle or some combination of bad news or simply having a bad quarter. This criterion will help bring such companies (with a cheaper valuation) near the top as long as they excel in other criteria as well. This factor is calculated as (current price - 52-week high) / 52-week high.</em></li> <li><em>Sales or Revenue growth: This is the average growth rate in annual sales or revenue of the company over the last five years. A company can only grow its earnings power as long as it can grow its revenue. Sure, it can grow the earnings by cutting costs, but that can't go on forever.</em></li> </ul> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Downloadable Dataset:</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Below, we provide a link to the table with relevant data on nearly 400 stocks. Readers can download this table for further analysis. Please note that the table is sorted by "Total Weight" or "Initial Quality Score."</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/attachments/download/36949" class="sa-attachment" data-id="36949">File-for-export-5_Secure_DGI_-_July_2024.xlsx</a></p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Selection Of The Top 50</strong></h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We will first bring down the list (of about 400) to roughly 50 names by automated criteria, as listed below. In the second step, which is mostly manual and subjective, we will bring the list down to about 15.</p> <ul class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"> <li>Step 1: First, take the top 20 names from the above table (based on total weight or quality score). At times, some industry segments tend to get overcrowded at the top, so we take the top two (or three) and ignore the rest.</li> <li>Step 2: As a second step, we will take the top 10 names based on the highest dividend yield. When it comes to dividend yield, some of the industry segments tend to be overcrowded. So, we will take the top two (or a maximum of three) names from any single industry segment. We take the top 10 stocks after the sort to the final list.</li> <li>Step 3: Now, we will sort our list based on five-year dividend growth (highest at the top) and select the top 10 names.</li> <li>Step 4: Not all companies have a 10-year streak of dividend growth, but many do. We will sort our list based on 10-year dividend growth (highest at the top) and select the top 10 names.</li> <li>Step 5: We also want to give priority to stocks that are rated highest in terms of credit rating. So, we will sort the list based on the numerical weight of the credit rating and select the top 10 stocks with the best credit rating. Again, we are careful not to have too many names from the same sector.</li> <li>Step 6: Lastly, as the name of the series suggests, we want to have some names that may be trading cheaper in comparison to their historical valuation. So, we select the top ten names with the highest discount. However, they could be trading cheap for just the wrong reasons, so we need to be careful that they meet our other quality criteria.</li> </ul> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">From the above steps, we now have a total of 70 names in our final consideration. However, the following stocks appeared more than once:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Stocks that appeared two times: ADP, CI, DHI, GFI, MSFT, TSM, V, VOYA (8 duplicates)</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Stock that appeared 3 times: NKE (2 duplicates).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">After removing ten duplicates, we are left with 60 (70-10) names.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Since there are multiple names in each industry segment, we will keep a maximum of two or three names (from the top) from any one segment. Also, if the dividend yield was too low (&lt; 0.75%), we would rather remove them at this stage unless the growth potential is extraordinary. After some pruning, we are left with 50 names.

So, while most of the filtering until now was based on automated criteria, the last step is pretty much subjective. We try to make each of the three lists highly diversified among various sectors and industry segments and try to ensure that the safety of dividends matches the overall risk profile of the group. We certainly encourage readers to do further research on the highlighted names.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Nonetheless, here are our three final lists for this month:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Final A-List (Relatively Safe Income):</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Average yield: 3.61%</strong></p>  <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><em>Table-1A: A-LIST (Conservative Income)</em></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/2/434815-17199320606812081_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="1431" data-height="187" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="false" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="false" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="false" data-og-image-msn="false" data-og-image-facebook="false" data-og-image-google_news="false" data-og-image-google_plus="false" data-og-image-linkedin="false"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/7/2/434815-17199320606812081.png" alt="T1A" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"></a></span><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We think this set of five companies (in the A-List) would form a solid, diversified group of dividend companies that would be appealing to income-seeking and conservative investors, including retirees and near-retirees. The average yield is 3.61%, which is nearly 2.75x of what the S&amp;P 500 pays. The average dividend history is nearly 34 years. Also, all five companies have an investment grade credit rating, and four out of five have an excellent rating of AA- or higher. If you must need higher dividends, consider B-List or C-List, presented later.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>MSFT (Microsoft):</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">MSFT is a technology behemoth that needs no introduction. It is part of the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' in the S&amp;P500. It has paid and raised dividend payouts for the last 22 years and is only a few years away from being a dividend aristocrat. It has had tremendous growth in its share price since 2014, and there seems to be no let-up in its upward trajectory. Most recently, in 2023, it has led the AI wave from a position of strength, as it owns a major stake in ChatGPT maker OpenAI (thanks to its $10 billion investment in OpenAI). In fact, its AI Services are expected to contribute significantly to its Azure cloud growth in the future. Microsoft is likely to continue leading in the Cloud and AI space. All that said, the stock price is not cheap, and the dividend yield is quite low despite 10% plus growth in payouts for the last ten years. We are including it in the A-List for its growth prospects, stellar credit rating, and stable and growing dividends.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>ADP (Automatic Data Processing):</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">ADP has paid and grown its dividend payout for the last 49 years and is known for the reliability and growth of its dividends at a steady pace. It is only a year away from becoming a Dividend-King. Even though its current yield is mediocre, relatively high growth should compensate in the long run. Currently, the shares are not particularly cheap and are hovering near their 52-week high. We are still including it in the A-list for its exceptional record of growing dividends and growth and excellent credit rating.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>PEP (PepsiCo):</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">PepsiCo is an iconic American company that operates around the globe. It owns well-known household brands, including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lay's, Cheetos, and Doritos, among others. The company is the second-largest beverage company behind Coca-Cola, and beverages account for nearly 45% of its revenues. The rest of the revenue is generated by Snacks and Convenience foods. The company generates nearly 40% of total sales and nearly a third of its profits outside the US.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Besides, last year, PepsiCo became a Dividend-King, meaning it has increased its dividends consistently for the last 50-plus years. For dividend investors, it is quite a milestone. PepsiCo is a must-have in every DGI portfolio; however, it should be added at the right price. In our view, currently, it is trading close to its fair price, though not cheap by any means. It is yielding roughly 3.29% against a 5-year average of 2.75%. Morningstar puts the fair value close to $176 a share, which is nearly 8% above the current price. Also, it is 14% cheaper than its 52-week highs achieved in July 2023.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">There are short-term headwinds for the company, which have impacted the market sentiment and drove the share price down from its recent highs in May 2024. The main reason appears to be that the consumer is maxed out due to persistent inflation and high interest rates, from car loans to credit card rates. The consumer is in no position to take any more price increases for consumer and food products. PepsiCo was able to push price increases in 2023 without impacting the volumes, but that changed in 2024. All that said, these things are cyclical and are not going to impact the company in the long term. The share price can still go down from the current levels, so it should be added in multiple lots.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>SNY (Sanofi):</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Sanofi is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, based in France. It is also the largest French pharma company. Morningstar puts the fair value at $61 a share, which is nearly 19% above the current price. The company enjoys a strong balance sheet due to a rich pipeline of approved and experimental drugs. The company announced a new strategic policy in 2023, under which it would increase R&amp;D spending and also spin-off or separate the consumer healthcare business unit. Apparently, the market and the dividend-seeking shareholders did not like the idea of increased spending, even though the proposals should benefit the long-term shareholders if the management can bring some faster growth. The company has relatively low debt (roughly $8.5 billion), a strong balance sheet, and a healthy pipeline of current and future drugs, especially in the immunology segment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The current share price offers a good entry point and a very attractive dividend yield.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>ENB (Enbridge):</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Enbridge is a midstream energy company based in Canada and serves markets both in Canada and the United States. They operate one of the longest and most complex liquids transportation networks, with over 17,000 miles of pipelines. Enbridge's natural gas pipelines connect supplies to major North American cities and population centers, as well as LNG export facilities. Another subsidiary of Enbridge, Enbridge Gas, will become one of the largest natural gas utilities in North America (after their September 2023 acquisition of Dominion’s assets close in 2024). So far this year, the company has closed on two of three utility purchases/ acquisitions from Dominion Energy, while the third should be completed before the end of 2024. However, the results from these acquisitions have yet to show up in the profitability of the company. ENB's focus on utility-like businesses will likely de-risk ENB's profile. The current debt to EBITDA ratio stands at 4.7x, which is right in the middle of ENB's target of maintaining the debt to EBITDA in the range between 4.5x and 5x.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The company has paid and grown the dividend at a very respectable pace for 28 years (in Canadian dollars). The dividend payout is fully covered by the DCF (distributable cash flow). In fact, the ratio of dividends to DCF (distributable cash flow) is below 60%, thus quite conservative. Moreover, the current dividend yield, roughly 7.5%, is very attractive. All this bodes well for the investors in terms of the company's ability to continue growing its dividend for the foreseeable future, albeit at a slower pace.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Final B-List (High Yield, Moderately Safe):</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Average yield: 5.30%</strong></p> <ul class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"> <li><strong>(<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT" title="Microsoft Corporation">MSFT</a>)</strong></li> <li><strong>(<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP" title="PepsiCo, Inc.">PEP</a>)</strong></li> <li> <strong>(</strong>BMY<strong>)</strong> </li> <li> <strong>(</strong>ARCC<strong>)</strong> </li> <li><strong>(<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENB" title="Enbridge Inc.">ENB</a>)</strong></li> </ul> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><em>Note 1: Very often, we include a few low-risk stocks in the B-list and C-list.

That said, the group (as a whole) will likely provide safe dividends for many years. This list offers an average yield for the group of nearly 5.30%, an average of 27 years of dividend history, and an average discount of -12% (from 52-week highs).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>BMY (Bristol Myers Squibb Co):</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Bristol's share price has lost nearly 50% since its peak in Dec. 2022, and currently, it appears to be undervalued. It also offers a very nice dividend yield of 5.75% at current prices. Only Pfizer is another major pharma company that offers a higher dividend yield at this time, but it also comes with higher risks. The company is facing several headwinds that include patent expirations, generic threats, decreasing pricing power owing to managed-care constraints, and product liability cases. The Celgene acquisition in 2019 added a large amount of debt to the company’s balance sheet, which continues to be a financial risk. That said, the company has reduced its long-term debt by nearly 1/3<sup>rd</sup> from $48 billion in 2020 to $32 Billion in 2023.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">BMY is quite adept at making partnerships, deals, and acquisitions. In the process, Bristol has created a strong pipeline and has partnered with other companies to lower the development costs of the new drugs as well as diversify the risks of regulatory failure. They also have a cardiovascular partnership with Pfizer, managing the blockbuster potential of the Eliquis drug. Another recent deal is a licensing deal with SystImmune to bolster BMY's oncology pipeline, which could turn out to be worth multi-billion dollars. BMY increased its quarterly dividend payout early this year from $0.57 a share to $0.60 (a 5.26% increase). In balance, BMY is an attractive buy at the current price and, to some extent, a contrarian turn-around candidate.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>ARCC (Ares Capital):</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Ares Capital is one of the largest BDCs (Business Development Companies) in terms of market capitalization and net asset values. ARCC offers a very high yield of roughly 9.2%. Being a BDC, it invests in small and medium-sized companies, some of which may be distressed. ARCC has investments in nearly 500 companies, making it a very diversified portfolio. It has a record of generating a high NII (net Investment income), which currently exceeds $1 billion on an annual basis. Based on core-EPS, its payout ratio is under 81% for the last 12 months, which is respectable for a BDC. Based on the Net Investment Income, it comes out to be 85.7%. The dividend coverage stands at 1.15%. The market for BDCs is getting competitive, and the uncertainty about the interest rates makes their business more challenging, but ARCC is well-positioned to continue performing well.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With over 9% dividend yield, there is not much scope left for capital appreciation, but we must remember that this is an investment for income. That said, if someone reinvests all the dividends, the total returns may still be attractive.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Final C-LIST (Yield-Hungry, Less Safe):</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Average yield: 7.78%</strong></p>  <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><em>Notes:</em></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><em>Note 1: Oftentimes, a stock can appear in multiple lists.

Please use due diligence.</em></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>BTI (British American Tobacco)</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Some investors may not like Tobacco stocks, and that is understandable. But if you are fine with investing in Tobacco stocks, it probably can't get better than this. The current yield is quite high at 9.5%. The company has excelled in growing the new categories of products. However, this is purely an income investment, and we should not expect any significant growth. That said, for income investors, the dividend appears to be reasonably safe. The share price has recovered somewhat from the lows earlier this year. It may be much safer to buy this stock in multiple lots using the dollar-cost-averaging. You may like to read our previous article <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4679365-earn-8-percent-and-growing-income-from-2-dividend-stocks-one-undervalued">here</a>, which covered BTI in more detail.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>BCE (BCE Inc):</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">BCE is the largest communications company in Canada. In many ways, its positives and challenges are similar to those of Verizon (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ" title="Verizon Communications Inc.">VZ</a>) in the US; however, currently, it is providing a much higher dividend yield than Verizon. BCE is currently paying a very attractive dividend yield of 8.75%. It has paid and raised the dividend payouts consecutively for 15 years (in Canadian dollar terms). It offers a wide range of telecommunications products and services, including wireless, wireline, Broadband, and TV services, to approximately 22 million subscribers in Canada. However, there are some risks that investors should be aware of. It operates in a very competitive environment, and just like other telecom companies in the industry, it carries a large debt burden of nearly $25 billion. We should not expect much growth in the share price, but with over 9% dividend, even a marginal capital appreciation would make it a reasonably good investment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>MPLX (MPLX LP):</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We included ENB from the energy sector in the A-List and B-List. However, to enhance the yield slightly, we are replacing ENB with MPLX in the C-List. First of all, it is a Partnership and issues a K-1 tax form (partnership income) instead of the usual 1099 in case of regular dividends.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">MPLX is a diversified midstream energy company structured as a master limited partnership. It was formed in 2012 by Marathon Petroleum Corporation (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPC" title="Marathon Petroleum Corporation">MPC</a>) for the purpose of owning, operating, acquiring, and developing midstream energy infrastructure assets. To date, MPC remains the largest unitholder of MPLX.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">MPLX maintains a solid balance sheet with investor-grade BBB credit rating and pays a very attractive yield, currently at 8%. It has paid and raised the dividend payout since its inception in 2012 and most recently raised the payout by 9.65% in Nov. 2023. Its dividend is well covered, and dividend coverage stands at 1.6x. Even though, in the last five years, the price appreciation has been significant, we expect limited price appreciation going forward. However, we can expect a very stable and near 8% dividend payout for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">===</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Apparently, this list (C-List) is for yield-hungry DGI investors. The yield goes up as much as 7.78%. However, this list is not for conservative investors. As you can see, the average credit rating of this set of companies is much lower than the A-List or even B-List. Dividends are moderately safe in this list, but the yields are very attractive. At least a couple of companies in this list come with an elevated level of risk. We urge due diligence to determine if it would suit your personal situation. Nothing comes for free, so there will be more risk involved with this group. That said, it's a highly diversified group spread among five different industry segments.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We would like to caution that each company comes with certain risks and concerns. Sometimes, these risks are real, but other times, they may be a bit overblown and temporary. So, it's always recommended to do further research and due diligence.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>What If We Were to Combine the Three Lists?</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">If we combine the three lists and remove the duplicates (because of combining), we would be left with eleven names.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Two-time duplicates: ARCC, ENB, MSFT (3 duplicates).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Three-time duplicates: PEP (2 duplicates).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">After removing these five duplicates, we are left with 10 names.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">From the energy sector, we have two similar names (ENB and MPLX).

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Overbooked flight</strong>: A Delta flight from Boston to Rome in September was severely overbooked, with a flight attendant offering passengers up to $3,500 to surrender their seats in exchange for a voucher and a later flight.</li>
<li><strong>Compensation</strong>: According to Department of Transportation rules, airlines must compensate passengers 200% of the one-way ticket cost for a flight delayed up to two hours, and 400% for a flight delayed more than that.</li>
<li><strong>Post-pandemic travel</strong>: The overbooking and compensation offers are a result of post-pandemic "revenge travel" and labor shortages, which have led to delays and cancellations of record numbers of flights.</li>
<li><strong>Voucher options</strong>: From January to March 2024, 23,699 Delta passengers have voluntarily surrendered their seats to receive vouchers and travel perks, a common practice used by airlines to ensure full flights.</li>
<li><strong>Airlines' approach</strong>: With more passengers willing to take up the offer, airlines are willing to shell out more perks to bump travelers from oversold flights, going beyond the standard compensation amounts to accommodate passengers' needs.</li>

<p>“Come on guys, $3,500, can somebody take one for the team?” the flight attendant said in a video captured on TikTok. “We’ll get you a hotel if you guys show up for us.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure>



<p>According to the account that posted the video, 13 passengers received between $2,000 and $4,000 to voluntarily surrender their tickets and end up in Rome on a later flight hours later.</p>



<p>It’s not just a lucky few who get to take advantage of the airline’s overbooked flight vouchers. From January to March 2024, 23,699 Delta passengers have volunteered to “take one for the team” in exchange for vouchers and travel perks. A common practice to ensure full flights, airlines often overbook passengers at the risk of shuffling them around and managing inconveniences. Per rules from <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/fly-rights#Overbooking" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/fly-rights#Overbooking" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">the Department of Transportation</a> (DOT), airlines must compensate passengers 200% of the one-way ticket cost for a flight delayed up to two hours, and 400% for a flight delayed more than that—a sum that can amount to up to $1,550. Airlines must give passengers compensation on the same day as the bumping incident.</p><p></p>

<p>“My job as a content creator is to share hacks that people really like,” full-time finance content creator Sam Jarman told <em>Fortune</em>. “I need to listen to my audience and my audience loves anything related to flight, tips, hacks.”</p>



<p>Getting booted from flights was a boon to Jarman in his years before having kids. Getting paid to wait a couple hours was a no-brainer for him, and he believes the next generation of Gen Z and millennial travelers—who are <a href="https://skift.com/2024/05/24/ask-skift-what-are-gen-zs-travel-habits/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%202023%20Global,acquiring%20a%20new%20luxury%20item." target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://skift.com/2024/05/24/ask-skift-what-are-gen-zs-travel-habits/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%202023%20Global,acquiring%20a%20new%20luxury%20item." rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">seeking experiences over luxury goods</a>—are good candidates for taking advantage of the travel perks that booking an oversold flight can offer.</p>



<p>“Getting a flight voucher is almost like getting cash compensation, in my mind,” Jarman said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Airlines are booked, busy, and bruised</strong></h2>



<p>Getting bumped off a flight wasn’t always considered an airline perk. Before social media became an accepted educational tool for financial literacy, it was a means of documenting airline nightmares. In 2017, a <a href="https://fortune.com/company/united-continental-holdings/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/united-continental-holdings/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">United Airlines</a> passenger was dragged off an overbooked flight from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky. Multiple passengers captured the scene of a security officer grappling the passenger—who had a tangled shirt and askew glasses as he was dragged down the plane aisle—on cellphone cameras and posted videos on <a href="https://fortune.com/company/twitter/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/twitter/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Twitter</a>. </p><p></p>



<p>“It felt like something the world needed to see,” Tyler Bridges, one of the passengers who documented the scene on camera, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/business/united-flight-passenger-dragged.html?_r=0" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/business/united-flight-passenger-dragged.html?_r=0" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">told the <em>New York Times</em></a>.</p>



<p>When airlines can’t sweeten the pot enough with vouchers and perks to lure passengers off overbooked flights voluntarily, they <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/2023/05/10/airline-overbooking-bumped-flight-cruising-altitude/70199667007/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/2023/05/10/airline-overbooking-bumped-flight-cruising-altitude/70199667007/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">rarely</a> have to resort to booting passengers off full flights involuntarily, a move that was even more controversial for this particular flight because United was looking for extra seats for its employees, Bridges said. United spokesperson Charlie Hobart responded at the time that the airline had asked the passenger several times to politely leave the plane, but he refused.</p>



<p>The incident was a turning point for not just United—which apologized for the “upsetting event” and for overbooking the flight—but the whole industry, according to Clint Henderson, managing editor of travel blog and news outlet <em>The Points Guy</em>.</p>



<p>“The airlines dramatically escalated the amount they were willing to pay passengers to volunteer to take a later flight,” Henderson told <em>Fortune</em>. “You sort of had this arms race because the airlines didn’t want to get in a situation where they had to force people off the plane.”</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>Indeed, airlines made <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/04/17/after-united-dragging-incident3-major-airlines-change-policies-affecting-bumped-passengers/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/04/17/after-united-dragging-incident3-major-airlines-change-policies-affecting-bumped-passengers/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">near-immediate changes</a>, with Delta increasing their compensation for overbooked flights to up to almost $10,000. <a href="https://fortune.com/company/american-airlines-group/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/american-airlines-group/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">American Airlines</a> updated its <a href="https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/support/conditions-of-carriage.jsp" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/support/conditions-of-carriage.jsp" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Condition of Carriage</a> to prohibit the airline from removing a paying passenger who has already boarded an oversold flight. United implemented a policy requiring flight crew to check in an hour before flights to avoid having to displace passengers in events of oversold flights.</p><p></p>



<p>Even the DOT intervened, bolstering its denied boarding compensation rule in 2021 to prohibit airlines from denying boarding to a passenger or involuntarily bumping them if they checked into a flight before the check-in deadline, as well as clarifying that its listed requirements for financial compensation are a minimum, not a maximum. </p>



<p>As a result of the changes, United “substantially lowered the number of yearly [involuntary denied boardings] since 2017,” Hobart told <em>Fortune</em>.</p>

<p>United’s 2017 incident may be a distant memory for the aviation industry that’s continued to <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/29/american-airlines-ceo-fired-top-exec-modern-retailing-direct-consumer/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/29/american-airlines-ceo-fired-top-exec-modern-retailing-direct-consumer/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">weather controversy</a>, but how airlines navigate compensation for overbooked flights is a microcosm of the often tenuous relationship between passengers and industry giants.</p>



<p>“It’s always been a push and pull between airlines and consumers,” Henderson said. “I think this is a continuation of that.”</p>



<p>Between <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/2023/03/17/economy-class-summer-small-seats/11477150002/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/2023/03/17/economy-class-summer-small-seats/11477150002/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">shrinking seat sizes</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/05/delta-air-lines-spoiled-food-poisoning-flight-record-air-travel-pasta-only-meals/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/07/05/delta-air-lines-spoiled-food-poisoning-flight-record-air-travel-pasta-only-meals/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">spoiled food</a>, commercial flights have lost their luster in the eyes of travelers. While airlines try to sweeten the pot for travelers with more generous vouchers and perks like <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/27/deltas-ultra-luxe-first-class-lounge-attempts-to-win-back-its-highest-paying-customers-who-can-take-a-shower-have-a-massage-or-get-clothes-steamed/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/27/deltas-ultra-luxe-first-class-lounge-attempts-to-win-back-its-highest-paying-customers-who-can-take-a-shower-have-a-massage-or-get-clothes-steamed/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">ritzy lounges</a> with massages and steak tartare, resentful customers will still do what they can to get a leg up on airlines they feel are ripping them off, Henderson argued. It’s an understandable sentiment from passengers, but it’s also not good news for the industry as whole.</p><p></p>



<p>“The airlines are not always the good guys, so I don’t want to make it sound like that,” he said. “But at the same time, it’s not the most profitable business in the world.”</p>



<p>Despite record travel numbers, airlines have yet to see more travelers translate to more profit. <a href="https://fortune.com/company/boeing/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/boeing/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Boeing</a> aircraft delivery delays, inflation, labor shortages, and poor expansion strategies <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-airlines-are-struggling-despite-record-travel-demand-profits-revenue-2024-6" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.businessinsider.com/why-airlines-are-struggling-despite-record-travel-demand-profits-revenue-2024-6" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">have all dented</a> the industry’s bottom line. The bleak outlook of the industry has Henderson concerned about TikTok trends and sharing hacks that may lead too many travelers to take advantage of overbooking rules.</p>



<p>But airlines haven’t found that problem. The number of passengers denied boarding because of oversold flights has actually decreased, with 0.27 passengers per 10,000 from January to March being denied boarding because of an overbooked flight on the 10 largest commercial U.S. airlines. That’s compared to 0.29 passengers per 10,000 in the same period in 2023 and 0.32 passengers per 10,000 in 2022, according to the DOT’s <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/air-travel-consumer-reports" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/air-travel-consumer-reports" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Air Travel Consumer Reports</a>.</p>



<p>Moreover, the number of bumped passengers doesn’t fluctuate based on consumer demand or passengers hoping to cash in by intentionally booking an oversold flight. The amount of tickets an airline offers for an overbooked flight is based on its own predictions of how many people may no-show for a flight—and its own need to turn a profit.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Henderson believes compensation for overbooked flights, regardless of their frequency, is just another way for airline passengers to try to tip the scales of airline economics in their favor, especially when they’re feeling short-changed by the industry giants.</p><p></p>



<p>“It’s getting harder to maximize your battle against the airline,” he said.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The "Sahm Rule", an unemployment predictor measure, suggests that a recession may have started because the three-month moving average of the jobless rate has risen by at least a half-percentage point from its low over the previous 12 months.</li>
<li>The gap between the new and previous low unemployment rate has expanded to 0.43 in June, the highest level since March 2021, indicating a deterioration in economic conditions.</li>
<li>Claudia Sahm, the creator of the Sahm Rule, explains that even from low levels, a rising unemployment rate can set off a negative feedback loop that leads to a recession, where workers lose paychecks, cut back on spending, and businesses need fewer workers.</li>
<li>However, Sahm also cautions that the pandemic may have disrupted the economy and labor market so much that traditional indicators like the Sahm Rule may not be as accurate at predicting recessions right now.</li>
<li>Despite this, the Sahm Rule has accurately predicted every recession since 1970, and Sahm believes that once the feedback loop starts, it is usually self-reinforcing and accelerates, suggesting that a recession could be imminent.</li>

<p>While unemployment is still historically low, its rate of increase could be a sign of deteriorating economic conditions. That’s where the so-called <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/what-is-sahm-rule-unemployment-predictor-recession/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/what-is-sahm-rule-unemployment-predictor-recession/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/what-is-sahm-rule-unemployment-predictor-recession/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sahm Rule</a> comes in.</p>



<p>It says that when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate rises by at least a half-percentage point from its low during the previous 12 months, then a recession has started. This rule would have signaled every recession since 1970.</p>



<p>Based on the latest unemployment figures from the Labor Department’s monthly report on Friday, the gap between the two has <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmacro&amp;stream=business" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmacro&amp;stream=business" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmacro&amp;stream=business" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">expanded to 0.43</a> in June from 0.37 in May.</p>



<p>It’s now at the highest level since March 2021, when the economy was still recovering from the pandemic-induced crash. </p><p></p>



<p>The creator of the rule, Claudia Sahm, was an economist at the Federal Reserve and is now chief economist at New Century Advisors. She has previously explained that even from low levels a rising unemployment rate can set off a negative feedback loop that leads to a recession. </p>



<p>“When workers lose paychecks, they cut back on spending, and as businesses lose customers, they need fewer workers, and so on,” she wrote in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-07/one-highly-accurate-recession-indicator-could-be-wrong-this-time" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-07/one-highly-accurate-recession-indicator-could-be-wrong-this-time" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-07/one-highly-accurate-recession-indicator-could-be-wrong-this-time" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Bloomberg opinion column</a> in November, adding that once this feedback loop starts, it is usually self-reinforcing and accelerates.</p>



<p>But she also said the pandemic may have caused so many disruptions in the economy and the labor market that indicators like the Sahm Rule that are based on unemployment may not be as accurate right now.</p>



<p>A few weeks ago, however, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/economist-sahm-who-devised-recession-rule-says-the-fed-is-playing-with-fire-.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/economist-sahm-who-devised-recession-rule-says-the-fed-is-playing-with-fire-.html" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/economist-sahm-who-devised-recession-rule-says-the-fed-is-playing-with-fire-.html" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sahm told CNBC</a> that the Federal Reserve risks sending the economy into a recession by continuing to hold off on rate cuts.</p>



<p>“My baseline is not recession,” she said on June 18. “But it’s a real risk, and I do not understand why the Fed is pushing that risk. I’m not sure what they’re waiting for.”</p><p></p>



<p>That came days after the Fed’s June policy meeting when central bankers kept rates steady after holding them at 5.25%-5.5%—the highest since 2001—since July 2023. </p>



<p>The Fed meets again at the end of this month and is expected to remain on hold, but odds are rising that a cut could happen in September.</p>



<p>Sahm also said last month that the Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s stated preference to wait for a deterioration in job gains is a mistake and that policymakers should instead focus on the rate of change in the labor market.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“We’ve gone into recession with all different levels of unemployment,” she explained. “These dynamics feed on themselves. If people lose their jobs, they stop spending, [and] more people lose jobs.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Wall Street has had a more sanguine view of the economy, citing last year’s widespread recession predictions that proved wrong as well as the AI boom that’s helping to fuel a wave of investment and earnings growth.</p><p></p>



<p>Last month, Neuberger Berman senior portfolio manager Steve Eisman also pointed to the boost in infrastructure spending.</p>



<p>“We’re just powering through, and I think the only conclusion you can reach is that the U.S. economy is more dynamic than it’s ever been in its history,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/13/big-short-investor-steve-eisman-the-u-s-economy-is-more-dynamic-than-its-ever-been.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/13/big-short-investor-steve-eisman-the-u-s-economy-is-more-dynamic-than-its-ever-been.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">he told CNBC</a>.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get global CEO perspectives on the biggest stories in business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p>.</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li>A gas station in Oakland, California was robbed by dozens of criminals during a flash mob, with the owner, Sam Mardaie, estimating that around $100,000 worth of damage was done.</li>
<li>The robbery occurred on Friday and was allegedly exacerbated by the fact that police took hours to respond to the 911 call.</li>
<li>According to Mardaie, the thieves were upset that the 24/7 store was only offering window service during the overnight hours, which may have contributed to the brazen nature of the robbery.</li>
<li>The entire incident was captured on camera, showing the thieves ransacking the store, taking items from refrigerators, and grabbing things from behind the counter and shelves.</li>
<li>The store owner, Sam Mardaie, who is a Yemeni immigrant, expressed shock and dismay at the incident, saying it was "unbelievable" and "scary", and that it has made him question whether the US is still a safe place to do business.</li>

<li>The Federal Reserve's semi-annual report to Congress states that the US labor market is back to a "tight but not overheated" situation, similar to before the COVID pandemic.</li>
<li>The report notes that job openings have declined in many sectors, and labor supply has increased, supported by a strong pace of immigration. This has led to a slowing in the labor market.</li>

            The US Chamber of Commerce, in a statement, characterized the limited preliminary injunction as a win. “The FTC’s blanket ban on noncompetes is an unlawful power grab that defies the agency’s constitutional and statutory authority and sets a dangerous precedent where the government knows better than the markets. The U.S. Chamber will continue to hold the FTC accountable in court,” said the group’s chief counsel Daryl Joseffer.

            In response to the order, FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar said, “The FTC stands by our clear authority, supported by statute and precedent, to issue this rule.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Marko Kolanovic, a market strategist at JP Morgan, was the only bearish strategist at a major Wall Street bank, predicting a 24% decline in the S&amp;P 500 by the end of the year, while all others predicted continued gains.</li>
<li>Despite being wrong in his previous forecast in 2022, Kolanovic's analysis of the market's fundamentals remains unchanged, suggesting that the current high stock prices are unsustainable.</li>
<li>Kolanovic's most recent report highlights that stock prices are incorporating much higher earnings growth than he deems reasonable, with S&amp;P 500 net profits standing at $192, 38% higher than the pre-pandemic record.</li>
<li>The Shiller CAPE model, developed by Yale economist Robert Shiller, suggests that the $192 number is unsustainable and that a "baseline" for earnings is more like $155, implying that the current PE ratio of 28.9 is high.</li>
<li>The article concludes that the market's current price levels are likely to lead to a decline in the future, citing the historical high PE ratios and the Shiller model's warnings, but emphasizes that the timing of such a decline is uncertain and could take years to materialize.</li>

    </div><div class="content article-descr news-text">
    <div><p>In late May, JP Morgan’s Marko Kolanovic defended his stubborn, negative stance on the U.S. stocks, asserting that the S&amp;P 500 was substantially overvalued, and predicted that the big cap index would end the year at 4200, down 24% from its level at the time. By then, Kolanovic was the last bearish market strategist at a major Wall Street bank; all the others, even the previously dour ones, were predicting more gains by year end on the view that the fabulous resurgence that started in early 2023 would just keep rolling.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>Kolanovic had also been wrong in 2022 when he foresaw great things for equities, and the markets tanked. It appears that missing by a wide margin on back-to-back forecasts, over two-and-a-half years, cost him his job. But does his analysis of the market’s fundamentals was wrong? Not at all.</p>



<p>In fact, the circumstances surrounding his departure carry two lessons. First, extremely short-term calls on the direction of equities are worthless. Second, history shows that episodes of inflated prices can go on a long time—but that the gravitational forces that govern earnings growth and PE multiples over extended periods always eventually take hold, and carry the day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Despite the great bull run and the exit of skeptics like Kolanovic who so far got it wrong, equities do look dangerously pricey</strong></h2>



<p>In his most recent report, Kolanovic stated that stock prices were simply incorporating much higher earnings growth than he deemed reasonable. It’s a good argument. For Q1 of this year, S&amp;P 500 net profits, based on the last four quarters, stood at $192. That’s 38% higher than the pre-pandemic record of $140 set at the close of 2019. The famous CAPE model developed by Yale economist and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller strongly implies that the $192 number is unsustainable, and that a “baseline” for earnings is more like $155.</p>



<p>The rub: Even though profits hover at extremely lofty levels, what investors are paying for each dollar of those possible unrepeatable earnings is also immense. The S&amp;P’s current multiple stands at 28.9. Except during the Great Financial Crisis when profits collapsed, that’s the highest PE for any quarter since the tech bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. And over the past 36 years, the S&amp;P’s PE has only been that high for just five months, all during this century’s most notorious craze.</p><p></p>



<p>That episode is a reminder that prices can break free of anything justified by the basics for years, so while that’s happening, predictions of an imminent fall are always wrong—until they’re finally and inevitably right. Put simply, though the outcome’s predictable, the timing is anything but. By June of 2017, the Shiller model was flashing red, indicating that that the S&amp;P had swung into the super-rich zone. Yet through August of 2000, a stretch of over three years, the index gained another 79%, rising from 847 to 1517. By February of 2003, the S&amp;P made a virtual round trip to 841, and didn’t breach 1500 once again until a decade later.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Adjust the numbers according to basic market math, and they’re at least as scary as those the JP Morgan bear advanced</h2>



<p>Let’s say that the market PE trends downward from its current level of nearly 29, to 22, still elevated by historical standards. That shift would lower the index 25% from where it stands now, about the correction Kolanovic predicted. Or, it’s highly possible that EPS will trend downwards and settle at the $155, adjusted for inflation, that looks justifiable from the Shiller data. It already appears that the gigantic profits booked in the post-COVID recovery aren’t durable; the 500’s EPS has gone flat, and dropped in real terms, since Q4 of 2021. If profits drop to the $150-160 range, after accounting for inflation, even at a big PE of 27, the S&amp;P’s 25% too pricey at its record of 5567 at the close on July 5th.</p>



<p>Keep mind that low interest rates should be great for stocks because they raise the present value of future earnings, and higher real yields are a downer since they reduce what that stream’s worth today. Well, “real yields” have jumped from negative to over 2% while the S&amp;P’s soared. The combination of historically high PEs, probably inflated earnings, and real rates that just went from extremely favorable to normal, aren’t a  combination that should breed confidence that stocks will keep climbing. They’re more like the cocktail for a tough hangover.</p>



<p>Once again, the bulls could be right for awhile. But for a much longer period, the science tells us that when you’re starting at these big prices, you’ll get pocket poor returns over the next seven or even five years. A bet for where we’ll be this time next year is no better than a guess. But the more the market booms, the more it sows the seeds of its own demise.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get global CEO perspectives on the biggest stories in business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p>.</p></div></div>
