    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The largest pension fund in the US will vote against Elon Musk's $56 billion compensation package, which is the largest ever granted to an executive at a US-listed company.</li>
<li>The package was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier this year and is now being voted on by Tesla shareholders.</li>
<li>The pension fund manager has described the package as "ridiculous" and has stated that they will vote against it.</li>
<li>The package is a payment of stock options to Musk, which will vest over a 10-year period, and is seen as an attempt by Tesla to re-establish Musk as the company's highest-paid executive.</li>
<li>Tesla is campaigning for the package to be reinstated, despite criticism from investors and financial analysts who argue that it is excessive and could compromise the company's financial stability.</li>

class="dcr-iy9ec7">Ahead of Tesla’s annual shareholders meeting Thursday, Chris Ailman, chief investment officer of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, known as CalSTRS, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/10/california-pension-fund-opposes-teslas-ridiculous-elon-musk-pay-package.html" data-link-name="in body link">told CNBC</a> that he would cast a “no” vote.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Even if these cars had AI in them, they are not worth 60-times earnings,” Ailman said Monday. “That is absurd.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The California pension fund has about 4.7m shares of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tesla" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Tesla</a> and manages a total of $333bn in assets.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The shareholder vote is over Musk’s $56bn compensation package that was established by the company’s board, and backed by shareholders, in 2018. CalSTRS voted against the deal then, too.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">At the time, the board said Musk would get the payout if Tesla met revenue, profit and share price targets. The company would ultimately meet all targets in 2022.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">But back in January, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/30/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package-too-much-judge-rules" data-link-name="in body link">ruled</a> in favor of a Tesla shareholder who argued that the company’s board inappropriately set the pay package. The judge agreed Musk’s pay package was unnecessary in keeping Musk dedicated to Tesla, an argument that company officers made during the trial.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Swept up by the rhetoric of ‘all upside’, or perhaps starry-eyed by Musk’s superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8bn question: was the plan ever necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals,” McCormick wrote in her decision.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">While the shareholder vote is over the compensation package, it’s also largely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/08/tesla-leads-charge-to-defend-elon-musks-56bn-pay-package" data-link-name="in body link">being seen</a> as a referendum on Musk’s leadership of the company.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Some<strong> </strong>shareholders have thrown their weight behind Musk. “Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla,” the billionaire investor Ron Baron <a href="https://www.baronfunds.com/sites/default/files/baron-capital-tesla-elon-musk-compensation-6.5.2024.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">said</a> last week.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">But others argue that Musk’s sights have turned elsewhere. Musk stirred controversy in 2022 when he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal" data-link-name="in body link">purchased</a> Twitter for $44bn and renamed it X. He sold $22.9bn of his Tesla shares to finance the purchase. Musk is also leading SpaceX, which is trying to achieve his goal of getting humans to Mars.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“He needs to focus in on, either on cars, either on X, or on going to Mars,” Ailman said. “And I think his heart really is in going to Mars.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">CalSTRs joins Norway’s $1.7tn sovereign wealth <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/norway-wealth-fund-vote-against-musks-56-bln-tesla-pay-package-2024-06-08/" data-link-name="in body link">fund</a>, Tesla’s eighth-largest shareholder, in its plan to vote against the pay package.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The Norwegian fund said that, while Musk’s leadership has generated “significant value”, the fund is still “concerned about the total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution and lack of mitigation of key person risk”.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">On Thursday, as Tesla worked to shore up support, Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1800537041022898430" data-link-name="in body link">retweeted</a> a message from the company<strong> </strong>urging shareholders to vote in favor of his pay deal. “Please take a moment to vote,” he said.</p></div></div>

<li><strong>Raspberry Pi goes public</strong>: The company has completed its initial public offering (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange, raising approximately £166 million ($211.6 million) or 30.7% of its ordinary shares.</li>
<li><strong>Market capitalization</strong>: The company's market capitalization is now approximately £541.6 million ($690.2 million), with an over-allotment option that could increase the total offer size to £178.9 million ($228 million) or 33% of ordinary shares.</li>
<li><strong>Financial growth</strong>: The company has come a long way from its hobbyist beginnings in 2012, with top-of-the-range products now costing around £80 ($102) compared to the initial £30 ($38) price tag.</li>
<li><strong>Customer base</strong>: Raspberry Pi has a diverse customer base, with 72% of its sales going to industrial and embedded customers, while 28% goes to enthusiasts and educational users. Europe is the largest market, accounting for 38% of units sold.</li>
<li><strong>Company goals</strong>: Raspberry Pi's CEO, Eben Upton, expressed gratitude for the warm reception and emphasized the company's commitment to making high-performance, low-cost computing accessible to everyone, with the influx of new capital aimed at supporting research and development and new projects.</li>

<p>Raspberry Pi's IPO took place this morning on the London Stock Exchange. Shares were initially priced at £2.80 ($3.57), but they surged to £3.90 ($4.97) during early trading.</p>
<p>The £2.80 ($3.57) offer price gave the company a market capitalization of approximately £541.6 million ($690.2 million) as conditional trading got underway. The offer size came to £166 million ($211.6 million), representing 30.7 percent of the corp's ordinary shares.</p>
<p>Should an over-allotment option be excised – as seems likely – that final offer size would be £178.9 million ($228 million), or 33 percent of Raspberry Pi's ordinary shares.</p>

    

<p>Unconditional trading is set to start on June 14.</p>

        


        

<p>It is all heady stuff and a far cry from the hobbyist beginnings of the first Raspberry Pi computer, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/04/16/raspberry_pi/">released in 2012</a>. The credit card-sized Arm-powered device could be bought for £30 ($38) once VAT and shipping were included. Today, a top-of-the-range 8GB Raspberry Pi 5 will cost a customer approximately £80 ($102), although a Raspberry Pi 3 can be picked up for around £35 ($44).</p>
<p>The final edition of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-b-plus/">Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+</a> is still in production and will remain so until at least January 2030. Introduced in 2014, the Pi gained the familiar 40-pin GPIO header and 512MB of RAM, yet it can hardly be called a ball of fire when compared to more modern hardware from the company.</p>

        

<p>While initially focused on education and hobbyists, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://investors.raspberrypi.com/">according to Raspberry Pi</a>, 72 percent of its SBC and Compute Module sales went to industrial and embedded customers, with enthusiasts and educational users snapping up the remainder.</p>
<p>Europe is still the Raspberry Pi's largest market, accounting for 38 percent of units sold. Buyers in the US and Asia account for 29 percent and 26 percent of shipments, respectively.</p>
<p>Pi supremo Eben Upton was delighted with how things have gone so far and said in a statement: "The reaction that we have received is a reflection of the world-class team that we have assembled and the strength of the loyal community with whom we have grown.</p>

        

<p>"Welcoming new shareholders alongside our existing ones brings with it a great responsibility, and one that we accept willingly, as we continue on our mission to make high-performance, low-cost computing accessible to everyone."</p>
<p>Some users have <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1csgclg/comment/l45q9gw/">expressed</a> mixed feelings about the IPO, noting that the money would be helpful for R&amp;D and new projects, however, the flotation underlines the fact that the company is a business.</p>

<p>That said, the Pi charitable foundation is a major shareholder and stands to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/07/raspberry_pi_ipo_is_oversubscribed/">receive a cash boost</a> thanks to the IPO.</p>
<p>As for the future, Upton told <i>The Register</i> earlier this year that while he remains at the helm of the organization, it would continue to do interesting work and try to keep making money.</p>
<p><em>The Reg</em> hopes this is the case, but think it's fair to say that pleasing both the corporation's customers and shareholders might end up being more challenging than obtaining a Raspberry Pi 5 at launch. ®</p>

            A class action lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/RTX">RTX Corporation</a>, the multinational aerospace and defense systems giant formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, has been discriminating against job seekers who are 40 years or older.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxahzqs300063b6jegx3s7kx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The complaint, filed by the AARP Foundation and two law firms at the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, asserts that the language used in certain Raytheon job ads indicates a preference for younger workers in violation of the federal <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/oasam/centers-offices/civil-rights-center/internal/policies/age-discrimination" target="_blank">Age Discrimination in Employment Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/fair-employment-law-poster/download" target="_blank">Massachusetts Fair Employment Practices Act</a> and the <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-human-rights-act/" target="_blank">Virginia Human Rights Act</a>. The company had been headquartered in Massachusetts and recently relocated to Virginia.

            “The language and content of these job advertisements discourages and deters many older workers from even applying for the Recent Graduate Positions and prevents older workers who do apply from advancing in the hiring process because too much time has passed since they graduated …  and/or entered the workforce,” the complaint said.
    </p>

  


    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxahxota00033b6jqpapv6a1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The ads that refer to “Recent Graduate Positions” indicate that applicants should either have graduated from college or graduate school very recently or have no more than 12 or 24 months of related work experience. While the positions may be lower level, they are not necessarily low paying, with salary ranges that can run north of $100,000.
    </p>

            In response, RTX rejected the premise of the allegations.
    </p>

            “RTX complies with all relevant age discrimination laws and we’re committed to maintaining a diverse workforce. We believe these claims are entirely without merit and we will actively defend our hiring practices,” company spokesman Chris Johnson told CNN.
    </p>

            The suit currently has just one named plaintiff — Mark H. Goldstein — but is brought on behalf of “all others similarly situated.” More named individuals may join the suit later, said Peter Romer-Friedman, one of the lead lawyers on the case.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxai1nke000a3b6jku4bbj11@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Goldstein, 67, has roughly four decades of experience in “project management, cybersecurity, technology, risk management, security engineering, sales, marketing, engineering, business, and consulting,” according to the complaint. In addition, it said, Goldstein has experience as a contractor for the US Department of Homeland Security, has held a federal government security clearance and has two key information security and privacy certifications.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxai1nke000b3b6jbybgtjx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Between 2019 and 2023, Goldstein applied to at least seven of Raytheon’s recent graduate positions for which he met all the qualifications save those requiring the newness of his degrees or the short duration of work experience.
    </p>

  


    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxai1nke000c3b6jtfooe2a2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “Despite the fact that Mr. Goldstein has been genuinely interested in a position with Raytheon, committed to relocating, if necessary, and has skills that Raytheon needs to address a years’ long labor shortage, Raytheon has not hired Mr. Goldstein for any of the positions to which he applied, has never offered him an interview, and has failed to seriously consider Mr. Goldstein’s applications based on his age,” the complaint said.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxai1nke000d3b6jjk28aqs8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Goldstein had filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2019. In 2021, the EEOC declared in a letter that its “investigation revealed that [Mr. Goldstein] was denied the opportunity to be considered for the [Recent Graduate Positions] he had applied for because of his age, and not because he did not meet the minimum qualifications required for the jobs,” according to the complaint. “It also found that Raytheon’s discriminatory advertisements had violated the ADEA, explaining that: ‘EEOC believes [Raytheon’s] job advertisements included language that violates the ADEA in that it indicated a hiring preference for applicants who are not in the protected age group.’”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxai1nke000e3b6jt55q8peu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            In response to the EEOC’s 2021 determination, Raytheon tweaked some language in job ads, but in ways that still discriminate against older job seekers, the complaint alleges.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxai1nke000f3b6jaf29pn5m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Goldstein filed a second charge of discrimination with the EEOC in July 2023. The agency is still investigating that matter, Romer-Friedman noted.<strong> </strong>

2022."></p></aside><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">General Motors is pulling back its electric vehicle production target this year and adjusting the timing on its profit targets because demand for EVs is not growing at the pace initially expected.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">GM CFO Paul Jacobson said Tuesday that GM would trim its targeted production of its new EVs in 2024 from between 200,000 and 300,000 to between 200,000 and 250,000.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Jacobson said GM still believes it can be "variable profit positive" on its EVs at the "low 200,000" production range. GM promised investors earlier this year that it would show variable profit in EVs by the second half of the year. Variable profit is when the revenue GM earns from selling the vehicle exceeds the direct cost of producing it. The calculation excludes corporate or “fixed” costs, measuring only the costs that go into the car and the revenue earned from the car directly.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2023/10/26/PDTF/71332611007-img-fzhummerev-045-1-1-tk-13-c.JPG?width=660&amp;height=441&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2023/10/26/PDTF/71332611007-img-fzhummerev-045-1-1-tk-13-c.JPG?width=1320&amp;height=882&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="GM builds a GMC Hummer EV on Wednesday, Nov. 17, 2021, at its all-electric assembly plant in Detroit and Hamtramck, Michigan."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="GM builds a GMC Hummer EV on Wednesday, Nov. 17, 2021, at its all-electric assembly plant in Detroit and Hamtramck, Michigan." data-c-credit="Provided By General Motors"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We think we can still do that in, probably Q4 more than the second half," Jacobson said of achieving variable profit positive. "But we still think that’s an achievable goal going forward.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Jacobson, who spoke Tuesday during the Deutsche Bank Global Automotive Industry Conference, also said that GM will invest $850 million in its self-driving car subsidiary, Cruise, starting this month to help relaunch it.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">GM EV sales so far</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Despite the slower-than-expected demand growth for EVs across the industry, Jacobson said GM had strong EV sales in May, selling about 9,500 EVs in the month. The adjustment to production and profit-time targets is "100% demand-driven" based on the broader industry, he said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He said most industry analysts predict the EV market will be up to about 10% of total auto sales this year, but GM expects it to come in around 8%.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“On the supply side, we’ve overcome the (battery) module issues. We were on track to produce 300,000 vehicles this year," Jacobson said. “We’ve been very consistent about building a platform and growing EVs off that and doing it in a way that meets customer expectations. We don’t want to give out a production range and blindly produce ... and end up with a lot of inventory because the market's just not there yet … then do deep discounting."</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/presto/2020/10/30/PDTF/6178e360-7b34-4d76-84c6-7d0c73951eda-Jacobson_Paul_old_headshot.jpg?width=300&amp;height=420&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/presto/2020/10/30/PDTF/6178e360-7b34-4d76-84c6-7d0c73951eda-Jacobson_Paul_old_headshot.jpg?width=600&amp;height=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="GM's CFO Paul Jacobson.

"Volume targets for me are something I’d rather not hear about anymore as they are constantly getting amended while EVs are a small part of industry new auto sales each year."</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">GM continues to watch costs</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">GM's adjustment to its EV production was welcome news to Wall Street analyst Dan Ives, who was expecting far more negative news around the slowing EV demand at the moment.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Given the headwinds in the auto sector and overall EVs, the Street was bracing for worse," Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in an email. "So far, 2024 has been a very stable year for (CEO Mary) Barra &amp; Co. in a turbulent backdrop."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">GM has built into its financial planning the possibility that its vehicle prices could decline by 2% to 2.5% this year, Jacobson said. But it has not seen any erosion in pricing yet. In fact, second-quarter average transaction prices are slightly higher than those in the first quarter, he said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Jacobson said that while GM has taken $2 billion out of its costs, it continues to “strive for efficiency” to not only get EVs to profits, but also in running the core business.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Jacobson said GM ended the first quarter with 63 days of inventory, which is a healthy supply. At the end of May, GM had 59 days of inventory. He said the automaker is having a strong second quarter, which is on track to outperform <a href="/story/money/cars/general-motors/2024/04/23/gm-first-quarter-profit-boosts-full-year-outlook/73409559007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">GM's first-quarter adjusted pretax profit of nearly $4 billion</a>.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“As we are marching toward profitability in our EV portfolio, that’s got a short-term mixed impact," Jacobson said. "So as we continue to ramp up EVs, despite the fact that they’re improving in their variable profits, it’s still a drag on the mixed side of the equation. But we’re going to continue to work at it and that’s what we’re focused on doing, just executing every corner.”</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Flexibility and consistency</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Jacobson said GM's stock remains undervalued largely because the market doesn't understand the flexibility the automaker has across its vehicle portfolio. He said with demand softening for EVs, GM leans on its internal combustion engine, or gasoline-powered, vehicle portfolio for profit support.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“If EVs pivot, then ICE may come down, but at the same time EV profitability is going up," Jacobson said. "That’s why it is so singularly important that we get to variable profit positive and we get EBIT margin positive (on EVs) because once we do that, then we’ve got the ultimate flexibility in our levers where we’re not really hurt if at the end of the day EVs go up and we see that growth, because we can make those profits.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">GM aims to get to parity in profits between EV and gasoline vehicles by the end of the decade because it will give consumers more options. He said in the meantime, federal tax credits are helping in EV adoption.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"In the short run, EVs are more expensive," Jacobson said. "They are more expensive to build than ICE vehicles, they've got lower ownership costs overall in terms of what your monthly spend is, but you've got to help get consumers over that hump. That's where the ... tax credits are helpful for consumers in the short run, but it's not like we can build an industry that's dependent on it."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">GM will bring plug-in hybrid technology to its lineup in 2027. Jacobson said if the automaker invests in that technology, which will help it meet federal emissions regulations, and finds out it's not needed because EVs take off, that's OK.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"But we can't end up in a position where we're fully dependent on credits at the end of the decade that might not be there if EV adoption isn't there," Jacobson said. "So we see plug-in hybrids as a really good tool for us to help bridge to that compliance path depending on where you see demand taking shape."</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Cruise expansion on GM's dime</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">On Tuesday, GM's Cruise said it will expand its on-road testing of self-driving cars, taking it to Houston in the coming weeks. A safety driver will be present there to take over if needed, similar to the testing it is doing with its <a href="/story/money/cars/general-motors/2024/05/13/gm-cruise-robotaxis/73673908007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">vehicles in Phoenix</a> and Dallas.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"This is critical work in informing where we ultimately will resume driverless operations," said GM spokesman Pat Morrissey.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/11/PDTF/74060279007-cruise-houston.png?width=660&amp;height=372&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/11/PDTF/74060279007-cruise-houston.png?width=1320&amp;height=744&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="General Motors self-driving subsidiary Cruise expands its on-road testing of self-driving cars to Houston in the coming weeks.

"But this buys us time as we continue to pursue our strategic review going through how we’re going to think about Cruise’s future as they continue to make good progress getting back to autonomous and full autonomous driving."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Cruise, headquartered in San Francisco, had stopped operations about seven months ago after an incident in October. A vehicle hit a pedestrian in San Francisco, pushing her into an oncoming Cruise self-driving car, which then dragged her several feet, leaving the woman critically injured.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The fallout from that Oct. 2 accident resulted in regulators <a href="/story/money/cars/general-motors/2023/10/24/california-suspends-gms-cruise-from-deploying-driverless-cars/71303386007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">suspending Cruise</a> from further operations in San Francisco. That was followed by Cruise opting to suspend<a href="/story/money/cars/general-motors/2023/10/27/cruise-gm-suspends-driverless-operations/71345159007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"> all its operations</a> nationwide. Cruise has since fired nine executives and cut<a href="/story/money/cars/general-motors/2023/12/14/gm-cruise-cuts-layoffs-pedestrian-accident/71919096007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"> about 24% or 900 full-time employees</a> from its workforce.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Cruise <a href="/story/money/cars/general-motors/2023/11/20/general-motors-cruise-ceo-kyle-vogt-resigns/71651643007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">CEO Kyle Vogt</a> and co-founder and Chief Product Officer Dan Kan resigned. GM hired a third party to conduct a study on Cruise operations to make further tweaks. Barra said in November that <a href="/story/money/cars/general-motors/2023/11/29/gm-delivers-higher-2023-earnings-estimate-ups-dividend-after-uaw-deal/71731219007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">GM will be making "substantially lower spending"</a> on Cruise in 2024 than it did in 2023.

<ol>
<li>Elon Musk has withdrawn his lawsuit against OpenAI, the company behind the AI chatbot ChatGPT, just a day before a state judge in San Francisco was set to consider dismissing the suit.</li>
<li>Musk had filed the lawsuit in February alleging that OpenAI and its co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman had breached their contract by prioritizing commercial interests over the public good.</li>
<li>The lawsuit claimed that OpenAI's partnership with Microsoft represented an abandonment of the company's commitment to developing AI responsibly and making it publicly available.</li>
<li>The lawsuit was seen as a rare public spat between Musk, a well-known advocate for responsible AI development, and OpenAI, which has received significant funding from Microsoft and other investors.</li>
<li>The withdrawal of the lawsuit means that the dispute between Musk and OpenAI will not be taken to court, although the underlying tensions and disagreements between the two parties remain unresolved.</li>

                <p data-block-key="naos7"><b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) today proposed a rule that would remove medical bills from most credit reports, increase privacy protections, help to increase credit scores and loan approvals, and prevent debt collectors from using the credit reporting system to coerce people to pay. The proposal would stop credit reporting companies from sharing medical debts with lenders and prohibit lenders from making lending decisions based on medical information. The proposed rule is part of the CFPB’s efforts to address the burden of medical debt and coercive credit reporting practices.</p><p data-block-key="20thg">"The CFPB is seeking to end the senseless practice of weaponizing the credit reporting system to coerce patients into paying medical bills that they do not owe,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. "Medical bills on credit reports too often are inaccurate and have little to no predictive value when it comes to repaying other loans."</p><p data-block-key="fa1us">In 2003, Congress restricted lenders from obtaining or using medical information, including information about debts, through the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. However, federal agencies subsequently issued a special regulatory exception to allow creditors to use medical debts in their credit decisions.</p><p data-block-key="d4u32">The CFPB is proposing to close the regulatory loophole that has kept vast amounts of medical debt information in the credit reporting system. The proposed rule would help ensure that medical information does not unjustly damage credit scores, and would help keep debt collectors from coercing payments for inaccurate or false medical bills.</p><p data-block-key="fj1mn">The CFPB’s research reveals that a medical bill on a person’s credit report is not a good predicter of whether they will repay a loan. In fact, the CFPB’s analysis shows that medical debts penalize consumers by making underwriting decisions less accurate and leading to thousands of denied applications on mortgages that consumers would repay. Since these are loans people will repay, the CFPB expects lenders will also benefit from improved underwriting and increased volume of safe loan approvals. In terms of mortgages, the CFPB expects the proposed rule would lead to the approval of approximately 22,000 additional, safe mortgages every year.</p><p data-block-key="4h3jo">In December 2014, the CFPB released a <a class="a-link" href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201412_cfpb_reports_consumer-credit-medical-and-non-medical-collections.pdf"><span class="a-link__text">report</span> <svg class="cf-icon-svg cf-icon-svg--download" viewbox="0 0 12 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M11.16 16.153a.477.477 0 0 1-.476.475H1.316a.476.476 0 0 1-.475-.475V3.046a.476.476 0 0 1 .475-.475h6.95l2.893 2.893zm-1.11-9.925H8.059a.575.575 0 0 1-.574-.573V3.679H1.95v11.84h8.102zm-1.234 5.604L6.388 14.26a.554.554 0 0 1-.784 0l-2.428-2.428a.554.554 0 1 1 .783-.784l1.483 1.482V7.41a.554.554 0 1 1 1.108 0v5.12l1.482-1.482a.554.554 0 0 1 .784.783z"></path></svg></a> showing that medical debts provide less predictive value to lenders than other debts on credit reports. Then in March 2022, the CFPB released a <a href="/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-estimates-88-billion-in-medical-bills-on-credit-reports/">report</a> estimating that medical bills made up $88 billion of reported debts on credit reports. In that report, the CFPB announced that it would assess whether credit reports should include data on unpaid medical bills.</p><p data-block-key="35th1">Since the March 2022 report, the three nationwide credit reporting conglomerates – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – <a href="/about-us/blog/medical-debt-anything-already-paid-or-under-500-should-no-longer-be-on-your-credit-report/">announced</a> that they would take many of those bills off credit reports, and FICO and VantageScore, the two major credit scoring companies, have decreased the degree to which medical bills impact a consumer’s score.</p><p data-block-key="vs0i">Despite these voluntary industry changes, <a href="/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-finds-15-million-americans-have-medical-bills-on-their-credit-reports/">15 million Americans</a> still have $49 billion in outstanding medical bills in collections appearing in the credit reporting system. The complex nature of medical billing, insurance coverage and reimbursement, and collections means that medical debts that continue to be reported are often inaccurate or inflated. Additionally, the changes by FICO and VantageScore have not eliminated the credit score difference between people with and without medical debt on their credit reports. We expect that Americans with medical debt on their credit reports will see their credit scores rise by 20 points, on average, if today’s proposed rule is finalized.</p><p data-block-key="5qk2k">Under the current system, debt collectors improperly use the credit reporting system to coerce people to pay debts they may not owe. Many debt collectors engage in a practice known as “debt parking,” where they purchase medical debt then place it on credit reports, often without the consumer’s knowledge. When consumers apply for credit, they may discover that a medical bill is hindering their ability to get a loan. Consumers may then feel forced to pay the medical bill in order to improve their credit score and be approved for a loan, regardless of the debt’s validity.</p><p data-block-key="eg9nh">Specifically, the proposed rule, if finalized would:</p><ul><li data-block-key="7g30b"><b>Eliminate the special medical debt exception:</b> The proposed rule would remove the exception that broadly permits lenders to obtain and use information about medical debt to make credit eligibility determinations. Lenders would continue to be able to consider medical information related to disability income and similar benefits, as well as medical information relevant to the purpose of the loan, so long as certain conditions are met.</li><li data-block-key="98u30"><b>Establish guardrails for credit reporting companies:</b> The proposed rule would prohibit credit reporting companies from including medical debt on credit reports sent to creditors when creditors are prohibited from considering it.</li><li data-block-key="a6nmk"><b>Ban repossession of medical devices:</b> The proposed rule would prohibit lenders from taking medical devices as collateral for a loan, and bans lenders from repossessing medical devices, like wheelchairs or prosthetic limbs, if people are unable to repay the loan.</li></ul><p data-block-key="bjs35">The CFPB began today’s <a href="/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-kicks-off-rulemaking-to-remove-medical-bills-from-credit-reports/">rulemaking</a> in September 2023 with the goals of ending coercive debt collection practices and limiting the role of medical debt in the credit reporting system. The CFPB additionally published in 2022 a <a href="/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-estimates-88-billion-in-medical-bills-on-credit-reports/">report</a> describing the extensive and debilitating effects of medical debt along with a <a href="/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-issues-bulletin-to-prevent-unlawful-medical-debt-collection-and-credit-reporting/">bulletin</a> on the No Surprises Act to remind credit reporting companies and debt collectors of their legal responsibilities under that legislation.</p><p data-block-key="fpcad"><a href="/rules-policy/rules-under-development/prohibition-on-creditors-and-consumer-reporting-agencies-concerning-medical-information-regulation-v/">Read today’s proposed rule, <i>Prohibition on Creditors and Consumer Reporting Agencies Concerning Medical Information (Regulation V)</i></a>.</p><p data-block-key="floob"><a class="a-link" href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_med-debt-nprm-coverpage-and-redline-of-rule_2024-06.pdf"><span class="a-link__text">Read the <i>Unofficial Redline of the Prohibition on Creditors and Consumer Reporting Agencies Concerning Medical Information (Regulation V)</i></span> <svg class="cf-icon-svg cf-icon-svg--download" viewbox="0 0 12 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M11.16 16.153a.477.477 0 0 1-.476.475H1.316a.476.476 0 0 1-.475-.475V3.046a.476.476 0 0 1 .475-.475h6.95l2.893 2.893zm-1.11-9.925H8.059a.575.575 0 0 1-.574-.573V3.679H1.95v11.84h8.102zm-1.234 5.604L6.388 14.26a.554.554 0 0 1-.784 0l-2.428-2.428a.554.554 0 1 1 .783-.784l1.483 1.482V7.41a.554.554 0 1 1 1.108 0v5.12l1.482-1.482a.554.554 0 0 1 .784.783z"></path></svg></a><i>.</i></p><p data-block-key="fo9dt">Comments must be received on or before August 12, 2024.</p><p data-block-key="7rgge"><a href="/compliance/compliance-resources/other-applicable-requirements/fair-credit-reporting-act/">Learn more about Credit Reporting Requirements</a> and the CFPB’s work on <a href="/rules-policy/medical-debt/">medical debt</a>.</p><p data-block-key="epcaa">Consumers can submit credit reporting complaints, or complaints about financial products or services, by visiting the <a href="/complaint/">CFPB’s website</a> or by calling <a href="tel:(855)411-2372">(855) 411-CFPB (2372</a>).</p><p data-block-key="qnee">Employees who believe their company has violated federal consumer financial protection laws are encouraged to send information about what they know to <a href="mailto:whistleblower@cfpb.gov">whistleblower@cfpb.gov</a>.</p>

<p>(WXIN/WTTV) — The FDA is warning about “microdose chocolate” bars and candy that cause people, including two Hoosiers, to fall ill after eating them.</p>



<p>In a Tuesday news release, the Food and Drug Administration warned consumers about Diamond Shruumz-brand chocolate bars, cones and gummies. The FDA is encouraging people to “not eat, sell or serve” any of the brand’s products as they investigate.</p>



<p>“Diamond Shruumz-brand products can be purchased online and in person at a variety of retail locations nationwide including smoke/vape shops, and at retailers that sell hemp-derived products,” the FDA said. “The full list of retailers is currently unknown.”</p>



<p>What is known is that the drug-infused candies have already caused some Indiana residents to get sick.</p>



<p>As of Tuesday, June 11, two Hoosiers had reported to the FDA that Diamond Shruumz products had caused an illness. Reports had also been made by 10 residents in Alabama, Arizona, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.</p>



<p>Photos of some of the products involved, provided by the FDA, can be seen below:</p>

Faraday cages are enclosures that shield anything placed inside them from electromagnetic fields.</p><p>What he didn't offer was any evidence to back up his speculation about potential security risks. Instead, Musk, in a followup post on Monday, belittled Apple for inking a deal with an outside maker of a large language model (LLM), which is what enables gen AI functionality. He also said he might make his own phone to "combat this," again without detailing what "this" is.</p><p>"It's patently absurd that Apple isn't smart enough to make their own AI, yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAI will protect your security &amp; privacy," Musk wrote.

That's because Nvidia, in the past, depended heavily on the video-gaming sector.</p><p class="block core-block">Undoubtedly, the<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268954/revenues-of-global-video-games-industry/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> gaming industry</a> is massive. According to Statista, the sector expanded from total revenue of $7.98 billion in 2000 to $19.7 billion in 2009, translating to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.56%.

However, the AI sector appears to be in a different league.</p><p class="block core-block">Per Grand View Research, the AI ecosystem<a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/artificial-intelligence-ai-market" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> could generate revenue of $279.22 billion</a> by the end of this year. By 2030, the industry could generate sales of over $1.81 trillion, implying a CAGR of 36.6%. That's really the mainline narrative that undergirds NVDA stock.</p><p class="block core-block"><strong>The Nvidia Chart:</strong> Overall, the technical picture of Nvidia stock is resolutely bullish. Since the beginning of the year, the security has gained just under 153%. Over the past 52 weeks, the performance metric has jumped to more than 208%. Still, there are some nuances to consider.</p><ul class="block core-block">
<li>Following the close of the May 22 session (when Nvidia disclosed its blockbuster Q1 earnings report), NVDA stock predictably gapped up to start the next session. This move was met by a pronounced spike in acquisition volume.</li>



<li>As Nvidia stock began marching higher to its present post-split-adjusted price of $121.65 per share, the acceleration of the price action conspicuously faded. At the same time, acquisition volume declined, implying the beginning of a consolidation phase.</li>



<li>Optimistic investors shouldn't necessarily be worried about the consolidation in the absence of an overtly bearish signal. It's not unusual for high-flying securities to enter a sideways trading range following a big move higher.</li>



<li>Indeed, the three-phase pattern of spike-consolidation-spike is one of the key tenets of technical analysis, forming the foundation for commonly cited chart patterns such as the bullish flag or bullish pennant.</li>

<li><strong>Goldman Sachs predicts rising oil prices</strong>: According to a report by Goldman Sachs analysts, oil prices are expected to rise to around $86 per barrel in the third quarter of the year, due to "solid summer demand".</li>
<li><strong>Increased demand driving prices up</strong>: The forecast is based on a healthy consumption of oil for transportation and cooling during the summer months, which will lead to a "sizable Q3 deficit" in the market.</li>
<li><strong>Forecast stable</strong>: Goldman Sachs' analysis kept the firm's price range forecast for Brent crude oil at $75 to $90 per barrel.</li>
<li><strong>Oil prices recently fell from highs</strong>: Brent prices dropped from their 2024 highs of $91 per barrel in early April, but have remained above $80 in recent months.</li>
<li><strong>OPEC production cuts to continue</strong>: The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and OPEC+ nations will continue to keep overall cuts to oil production in place through 2025, with additional voluntary cuts unwound starting in October.</li>

    <p>Here are five key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Rare Earths Norway has discovered Europe's largest proven deposit of rare earth elements</strong>: The company has found a 8.8 million metric tons of total rare earth oxides (TREOs) in the Fen Carbonatite Complex in southern Norway, which is estimated to have 1.5 million metric tons of magnet-related rare earths suitable for electric vehicles and wind turbines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The discovery can help reduce reliance on China for rare earth elements</strong>: China dominates the rare earths market, but this discovery in Europe could provide an alternative source and help the region reduce its dependence on Chinese supplies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Demand for rare earths is expected to grow exponentially</strong>: The clean energy transition and growing demand for electric vehicles and wind turbines will create a significant increase in demand for rare earth elements, making this discovery an important step in meeting that demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The deposit eclipses a recent find in neighboring Sweden</strong>: A rare earths deposit was discovered in Sweden last year, but this new discovery in Norway is larger and considered a significant milestone for the company and the region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The discovery marks a "great milestone" for Rare Earths Norway</strong>: CEO Alf Reistad called the discovery a significant step forward for the company and emphasized that there is currently no extraction of rare earth elements in Europe today, making this discovery a major step towards meeting Europe's growing demand for these critical minerals.</p>

<p>The $28,790 price tag is a 32% increase from 2020, mainly due to rising home prices, inflation and <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/2-more-insurance-companies-announce-plans-to-leave-california/" data-type="link" data-id="https://ktla.com/news/california/2-more-insurance-companies-announce-plans-to-leave-california/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">costly insurance premiums.</a></p>



<p>To estimate the average home maintenance price for each state, Bankrate calculated 2% of the home’s value. The upkeep costs were adjusted for inflation.</p>



<p>For a typical single-family home, the maintenance costs $18,118 on average annually, an increase from 2020 when those same expenses were $14,428 annually.</p>





<p>Homeownership is a cornerstone of the American Dream but not a reality for many Californians. Only 17% of households can afford a median-priced home in the first quarter of 2024, according to the most recent data from the <a href="https://www.car.org/aboutus/mediacenter/newsreleases/2024-News-Releases/1qtr2024hai" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.car.org/aboutus/mediacenter/newsreleases/2024-News-Releases/1qtr2024hai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Association of Realtors</a>.</p>





<p>Those looking to purchase a home in Los Angeles County would need to make at least $210,400 annually to afford a $822,950 home, the median price for homes in the county.</p>



<p>Only Hawaii beat out California in homeownership costs, with an average of $29,016 annually.</p>



<p>Kentucky, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Indiana had the least expensive homeownership costs, tallying between $10,455 and $12,259.</p>

<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (<a href="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/columbus/camera-catches-porch-pirate-steal-package-seconds-after-drop-off-at-columbus-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WCMH</a>) – A security camera at an Ohio home captured the moment a bold suspect grabbed an expensive package and took off, right in front of a FedEx driver who had dropped it off seconds before.</p>



<p>The theft took place on June 3, when 33-year-old Kyle Dorsch of Columbus was expecting his new <a href="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/business/ap-business/ap-apple-to-stop-some-watch-sales-in-us-over-patent-dispute/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/business/ap-business/ap-apple-to-stop-some-watch-sales-in-us-over-patent-dispute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple smartwatch</a> to be delivered, he said. Shipping was being handled through FedEx.</p>





<p>“The website kind of gave me an estimated delivery time of when it would be here and right as the truck pulled up, I saw him pull up,” Dorsch said.</p>



<p>Dorsch’s doorbell security camera was rolling when he walked toward his front door to get his delivery. But as the delivery driver walked up the driveway, the camera also captured a blue car stopping by the house.</p>



<p>“We did notice that car down the street, probably 20 to 30 minutes before the truck came through the neighborhood, so they were aware the package was coming somehow,” Dorsch said.</p>

<p>The FedEx driver made his way to Dorsch’s porch. By the time he dropped the package off and knocked on the front door, the camera caught the suspect already running up the driveway. The thief jumped up the stairs — startling the FedEx worker — before quickly snatching the package and running away. The camera caught a glimpse of the blue car speeding off moments later.</p>





<p>The entire exchange happened before Dorsch even opened his front door. </p>



<p>“Before I could even get to the door, it was gone,” he said. “I only saw the back of him as he was popping back into his car. I spoke with the FedEx station that the package came from and they said that it’s been happening quite a bit around Columbus. They’re not sure how tracking numbers are getting leaked or addresses.”</p>



<p>FedEx Communications Specialist Francesca Sacco did not answer questions about the specific theft affecting Dorsch, nor regarding tracking numbers potentially being leaked to thieves in Columbus. Instead, she commented on technology for customers that the company added to ensure “reliable delivery of their packages.”</p>



<p>“These tools have proven very helpful in combating <a href="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/columbus/how-to-keep-packages-safe-from-porch-pirates-during-the-holiday-season/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/columbus/how-to-keep-packages-safe-from-porch-pirates-during-the-holiday-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">porch piracy</a> and improving the overall customer experience,” Sacco said. “Our flexible solutions like picture proof of delivery, FedEx Delivery Manager, and the FedEx mobile app offer customers a convenient experience, with more control over the timing and location of their deliveries.”</p>





<p>Since these technologies didn’t stop the porch pirate in Dorsch’s case, he turned to police and then took matters into his own hands.</p>



<p>“Filing the police report, they said it was going to take five to seven days for somebody to get back to me,” Dorsch said. “I didn’t want to just sit here, so I started looking around, seeing if somebody posted it for sale online.”</p>









<p>He found the watch on Facebook Marketplace within hours of it being taken. Dorsch said that a listing had photos of the box taken on someone’s lap in a car, and they were wearing khaki shorts matching the ones on the suspect who stole it. He noted that the Facebook profile hosting the sale had “FedEx package handler” listed as their job description.</p>



<p>“There’s just too many coincidences for it to not be who we think it is,” Dorsch said. “We had somebody else try to reach out to them and they seemed very paranoid about it, so we stopped getting responses. … We just checked on it again yesterday and they did mark the item sold, but we don’t know whether it was truly sold or if they marked it because they had no takers on it.”</p>





<p>The Apple watch was part of an upgrade through Dorsch’s cell service provider, AT&amp;T. Thankfully, Dorsch wasn’t left empty-handed. He reported the profile to FedEx, and provided AT&amp;T case numbers from the delivery company as well as Columbus police. The cell carrier also took action on the stolen watch, using the IMEI number it had on record.</p>



<p>“So they got everything reversed, they got the upgrade reversed, so I’m able to purchase another one, likely directly from the store this time,” Dorsch said. “And the watch that was stolen, they had to blacklist, so it can’t be activated by anybody.”</p>



<p>Still, that means whoever potentially bought the stolen watch received a broken product.</p>



<p>“They listed it for $600 and it retails new for $799,” Dorsch said. “I feel bad if they sold it, that person’s out hundreds of dollars and they might not be as lucky as I am as far as getting it recovered somehow.”</p>







<p>A Columbus police spokeswoman told Nexstar’s WCMH that investigators were still working on the case, but they had no additional information to share as of Tuesday. Dorsch said since filing the report, he has not been contacted by a detective either.</p>



<p>“If it’s somebody inside at FedEx, I hope they’re found,” Dorsch said. “You know in my case, it looks like everything worked out to where I can order a new one. But I do feel bad for the people that are working hard to afford these things and they’re being taken.”</p>
