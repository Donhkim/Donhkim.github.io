            Police officials said in a press release Friday that, “people from the previous protest march ran through the forest towards the Tesla company premises.

<li><strong>Planet Fitness is increasing its monthly membership fee</strong>: The chain is raising its basic "classic" membership from $10 to $15 per month for new members starting in the summer, a 50% increase.</li>
<li><strong>Reasons for the increase are unclear</strong>: Planet Fitness executives didn't specify why they're increasing the fee, but it may be related to higher interest rates and construction costs, which have slowed down new gym openings.</li>
<li><strong>Historic significance of the $10 fee</strong>: The $10 monthly fee was a key part of Planet Fitness' marketing strategy and branding, making it an affordable option for those who have never joined a gym before.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on business model</strong>: The increase may threaten Planet Fitness' business model, which relies on a high volume of low-price memberships, also known as a "high volume, low price" (HVLP) model.</li>
<li><strong>Effects on new members</strong>: The increased fee may affect the chain's ability to attract new members, particularly those who are looking for an affordable gym option. The company's goal is to recruit people who are interested in exercising but may not have joined a gym before.</li>

But the largest gym chain in the United States is hiking that monthly fee for the first time in more than two decades.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Planet Fitness will raise the price of its "classic" membership from $10 a month to $15 for new members beginning in the summer. The "classic" membership gives people access to one location. (Planet Fitness' $25 monthly "Black Club" membership offers more location access and perks. Planet Fitness is not hiking this fee, although executives said they may begin testing higher prices for the plan.)</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Planet Fitness executives did not specify why the chain is raising the basic plan by 50% for the first time since 1998, but the move comes as higher interest rates and construction costs have slowed down new gym openings. Planet Fitness has no-frills gyms, with a basic selection of machines, no steam rooms or towels in the locker room to hold down costs. Higher costs threaten its business model - known in the fitness industry as high volume, low price, or "HVLP" - more so than luxury gyms.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Businesses around the country have raised prices since the pandemic began in 2020, but Planet Fitness' $10 fee was one of the few things that had not changed because it was synonymous with the brand.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"It's a 'get you off the couch' price," Planet Fitness' former CEO told CNN in 2022.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Planet Fitness has long used the $10 basic membership to recruit people who are interested in exercising but have never joined a gym before, are intimidated by fitness fanatics at other gyms or can't afford pricier clubs. (A gym membership in the United States typically costs around $50 a month, and boutique gyms and high-intensity classes run double and triple that.)</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Planet Fitness blared out the $10 gym plan, which includes annual fees and free training, in commercials. The company has sponsored the New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square for years to get people thinking about signing up for memberships as their resolution. Forty percent of new Planet Fitness members have never belonged to a gym prior to signing up, according to the company.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The $10 price was right in the sweet spot: cheap enough to draw people to Planet Fitness who want to get in shape and, equally as important, not so expensive that they will cancel if they don't go often, say analysts.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Planet Fitness then tries to upsell these members by pushing them to its Black Card membership. The higher-priced monthly plan offers access to all of Planet Fitness' gyms and perks like water massage beds, massage chairs and tanning equipment, and Black Card members can also bring a visitor.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">On a conference call Thursday, one analyst, Sharon Zackfia from William Blair, said, "it does seem like an odd time to take a 50% price increase on the classic card," given that consumers have been strained by inflation and are searching for deals.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">But Planet Fitness executives said consumers have grown accustomed to price hikes and the move will not hurt business.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"We've seen in every industry people move in price," Planet Fitness interim CEO Craig Benson said. "So, it is not going to come as a shock to anybody that we are moving a price that's been in effect for a long, long time."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN"><i>The-CNN-Wire<br>&amp;  2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    <div><div class="relative text-base article-alias_articleBodyStyles__zkPMo article-alias_articleWrapper__atgO6" id="articleBody"><p>(Kitco News) - <a href="https://www.kitco.com/charts/gold">Gold</a> and <a href="https://www.kitco.com/charts/silver">silver</a> prices are posting good gains and hit three-week highs in early U.S. trading Friday. The two precious metals late this week have shot sharply higher on notions of central banks easing their monetary policies sooner rather than later. The safe-haven metals traders are on this day apparently focusing more on the better consumer and commercial demand prospects for metals. June gold was last up $38.40 at $2,378.70. July silver was last up $0.45 at $28.82.</p><p>Risk sentiment is more upbeat to end the trading week, following recent data that indicates the U.S. economy is cooling just a bit, which would allow the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner. Thursday morning’s U.S. jobless claims report came in higher than expected, and that follows last week’s monthly jobs report that showed less non-farm jobs gains than expected. Both of these reports were preceded by the FOMC meeting that was not deemed as hawkish as the marketplace had feared. The Bank of England on Thursday also somewhat surprised the marketplace by leaning a bit easier on its rhetoric, even though it did not change monetary policy. And geopolitics, while still near the front burner of the marketplace, is not at a nearly full boil that was the case a few months ago. All of the above are making for better risk appetite among traders and investors.</p><p>Asian and European stock indexes were mostly firmer overnight. U.S. stock indexes are pointed to toward higher openings when the New York day session begins.</p><p>The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index slightly firmer. Nymex crude oil prices are higher trading around $80.00 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is fetching 4.45%.  </p><p>U.S. economic data due for release Friday includes the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, the monthly Treasury budget statement and the monthly USDA supply and demand report. A couple of Federal Reserve officials speak today in Minneapolis.</p><p></p><p>Technically, the gold futures bulls have the solid overall near-term technical advantage. A price downtrend on the daily bar chart has been negated and prices have just seen a bullish upside “breakout” from the recent trading range. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close in June futures above solid resistance at $2,400.00. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at $2,300.00. First resistance is seen at today’s high of $2,385.30 and then at $2,400.00. First support is seen at $2,365.00 and then at today’s low of $2,352.00. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 7.5.</p><p></p><p>The silver bulls have the firm overall near-term technical advantage and have gained good power this week. Silver bulls' next upside price objective is closing July futures prices above solid technical resistance at $30.00. The next downside price objective for the bears is closing prices below solid support at $27.00. First resistance is seen at today’s high of $29.00 and then at $29.37. Next support is seen at the overnight low of $28.47 and then at $28.00. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 7.0</p><p>(Hey!

The term is used to describe the turning point when a piece of technology sees a steep rise in popularity and widespread adoption — like when Apple's iPhone took off with consumers.</p>
                        <p>For Microsoft, Copilot might be the driver. The analysts said they'd observed "major momentum" in the use of AI that stands to benefit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/satya-nadella-life-career-microsoft-ceo-computer-science-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">CEO Satya Nadella</a> and his company even more than it already has.</p><p>AI is on track to change the tech industry forever, and they predict it will continue to push Microsoft's cloud <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-plans-spend-more-ai-infrastructure-capex-earnings-azure-chips-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">products, such as Azure,</a> forward.</p><p>"We estimate for every $100 of cloud Azure spend with MSFT the last few years there is an incremental $35-$40 of AI spend for Nadella &amp; Co. looking ahead," the Wedbush analysts, led by Dan Ives, wrote.</p><p>And if <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-is-paying-off-for-some-major-cloud-providers-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">Microsoft's first-quarter report</a> is any indication, AI is already paying off. Microsoft Cloud generated $35.1 billion in revenue in the first quarter — up 23% year over year — and Nadella said investing in Copilot was part of the reason.</p><p>Copilot is "orchestrating a new era of AI transformation," Nadella said in the earnings release.</p>

<ol>
<li>Target has relaunched its Pride collection, but this time it will be available in only "select stores" instead of all of its 2,000 US locations as it had previously done.</li>
<li>The collection includes products such as adult apparel, home goods, and food and beverage items, and is aimed at consumers who have given feedback on what they would like to see in a Pride collection.</li>
<li>Target's decision comes after the company faced backlash in 2023 over its previous Pride collection, which included swimsuits designed for men to "tuck" their genitalia, leading to complaints from some consumers.</li>
<li>The backlash was so severe that some Target stores were told to relocate their Pride Month displays to avoid sparking a "Bud Light situation", according to Fox News.</li>
<li>Target will stock the Pride products in about half of its US locations, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg, a significant reduction from its usual practice of selling the Pride assortment in all of its stores.</li>

            A major US health care system said Thursday that it is diverting ambulances from “several” of its hospitals following a cyberattack this week.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvzzn9x500043b6jxh3jkptg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The cyberattack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals in 19 states, is also disrupting access to electronic health records, some phone systems and “various systems utilized to order certain tests, procedures and medications,” Ascension said in a <a href="https://about.ascension.org/cybersecurity-event" target="_blank">statement</a> distributed Thursday evening.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvzzn9x500053b6jknvbcpkn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The sprawling health care network, which also owns 40 senior living facilities, said that it would be using “downtime procedure for some time,” because of the cyberattack. Downtime procedures are typically when health providers revert to backup processes, including paper records, that allow them to care for patients when computers are down.
    </p>

            Four sources briefed on the investigation told CNN that Ascension suffered a ransomware attack, in which cybercriminals typically try to lock computers and steal data for extortion. Those sources said that the type of ransomware used in the hack is known as Black Basta, which hackers have used repeatedly to attack health care organizations in recent years. Black Basta, also the name of a broad criminal group that uses the ransomware, includes Russian-speakers, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/black-basta-threat-profile.pdf" target="_blank">according</a> to the Department of Health and Human Services.

            On Friday, the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a cyber threat sharing group for big health care providers worldwide, published an <a href="https://h-isac.org/black-basta-threat-actor-emerges-as-a-major-threat-to-the-healthcare-industry/" target="_blank">advisory</a> warning that hackers using Black Basta ransomware have “recently accelerated attacks against the healthcare sector.”

            That includes at least two health care organizations in Europe and the US that in the last month<strong> </strong>have “suffered severe operational disruptions” because of Black Basta ransomware,” the advisory said, without naming the health care organizations.

            <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/08/tech/cyberattack-disrupts-healthcare-network/index.html">News of the hack of Ascension broke</a> on Wednesday, and Ascension has in the last 24 hours followed a familiar playbook for many American organizations that have been assaulted by cybercriminals. Ascension has notified federal authorities of the incident, hired prominent US cybersecurity firm Mandiant to recover from the incident and shut down systems to try to keep the incident under control.
    </p>

            Senior US officials have been in repeated contact with Ascension CEO Joseph Impicciche since the ransomware attack to understand how the hack might impact patient care, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    </p>

            “We are actively supporting our ministries as they continue to provide safe, patient care with established downtime protocols and procedures, in which our workforce is well trained,” Ascension said in its statement Thursday evening.

            It was not clear how many Ascension hospitals were sending ambulances to other locations because of the cyberattack. Ascension spokesperson Gene Ford did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.

            A February ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of health care giant UnitedHealth Group, caused billing disruptions at pharmacies across the US and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/09/tech/medical-supply-chain-cybersecurity/index.html">threatened to put</a> some health providers out of business. A third of Americans may have had their personal data swept up in the hack, UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/politics/data-stolen-healthcare-hack/index.html">estimated</a> in testimony to Congress this month. UnitedHealth paid a $22 million ransom to the cybercriminals to try to protect patient data, Witty said.

            That Change Healthcare hack incensed US lawmakers and prompted questions across the federal government about the vulnerability of America’s health care system to disruptive cyberattacks with cascading impacts — questions that the cyberattack on Ascension will do nothing to assuage.

<p>The Department of Transportation and the Consumer Financial Projection Bureau are turning their attention to airline and credit card reward programs — you know, when you get points for miles.</p>



<p>On Thursday, the two government agencies <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/frequent-flyer-program-hearing-dot-cfpb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">held a hearing aimed at increasing transparency about these programs</a>, such as how much points are worth. To learn more about these efforts and how they could help consumers, “Marketplace Morning Report” host David Brancaccio spoke with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation.</p>



<p><strong>David Brancaccio: </strong>I know it can be annoying when an airline frequent flyer or a credit card changes the rules for a loyalty program. But aren’t these just perks easy come, easy go?</p>



<p><strong>Pete Buttigieg:</strong> Well, I think they’re not just perks; they’re increasingly something we think of as part of our savings. When you’re getting ready for a vacation, you save up your money for that, and you may also save up your miles or save up your points for that. So, the difference — of course — is unlike the money in your bank account, there’s a company that can unilaterally decide to change what those points or miles are worth. And we want to make sure that like anything else of value in our economy, any transactions and any advertising about this is fair, truthful and transparent. You know, we have a responsibility as a department to look out for any unfair and deceptive practices in terms of how airlines market their flights. We’re increasingly realizing that part of that means making sure we understand what’s going on with these points and miles programs.</p>



<p><strong>Brancaccio:</strong> I want to get back to the transparency, but what are some of the complaints your team and the team over at the CFPB are looking into?</p> 
		



<p><strong>Buttigieg:</strong> Well, one issue we’re concerned about is these devaluations. You think the points are worth a certain amount, and then that changes. And that’s especially important if you make a decision, like a decision to book a ticket with a higher airfare or to sign up for a credit card with a high annual fee or a higher APR because you think in return you’re getting a certain value in terms of points. If they change that on you, it’s something that we need to look at. </p>



<p>Another issue that we’re seeing is a confusion over what the points are actually worth. It’s pretty rare for an airline to publish what they say the sort of dollar valuation of a mile or point is, but in some cases, we see that they have a certain implied value in terms of the flights you can get — or you can even use it to buy a sandwich on board — but then a completely different value if they’re offering to sell those points back to you. We even see transaction fees when you’re trying to transfer points that are sometimes more than the total value of the points you’re transferring. Those are the kinds of things we want to have a clearer look at and get a real understanding of to make sure that customers and passengers are being treated fairly.</p>



<p><strong>Brancaccio: </strong>It’s interesting, because you can almost figure out what the currency is worth, right? And then if it’s variable, depending on the situation, it will be at least nice to know that it’s variable …</p>



<p><strong>Buttigieg:</strong> Yeah, think of it this way: You know, you go through the in-flight magazine, it says you can buy a thing of chips for $5 or 500 miles. That’s telling you they think a mile is worth a cent. But later on when they offer to sell you 3,000 miles so you can go over the top and get that ticket you’re hoping to get, they’re offering it for five or 10 times that. Those are the kinds of things we want to run down, make sure we have an understanding of and discuss whether that’s fair.</p>



<p><strong>Brancaccio: </strong>So, transparency — rules should be clear. I mean, some worry that that could be lost in fine print only a lawyer could love but OK, our duty would be to read through. You said equitable, I think. What did you have in mind?</p>



<p><strong>Buttigieg:</strong> We need to make sure that you know what you’re paying for and that customers are treated fairly. Again, this is especially important because often the design of these points programs mean that you’re not picking the product with the lowest price, whether we’re talking about a credit card fee or an airfare. You will consciously choose something that costs more because of the value you feel like you’re getting with the points that come along with that. That means these points are something of real economic value and, like anything with real economic value, we need to make sure that any transactions around that are fair and aboveboard.</p>



<p><strong>Brancaccio: </strong>Absent legislation, I guess, do you and/or the CFPB have power beyond holding hearings to force transparency and fairness?</p>



<p><strong>Buttigieg:</strong> We do have a lot of authority here and responsibility to address unfair or deceptive practices in airlines. And we’re teaming up with CFPB because of course, they have a lot of authority as it relates to financial firms and credit card companies. Now, we’re not coming into this with any preconceived conclusions. We haven’t decided on a rule or anything like that. But we do hear enough from passengers and customers about this that we’ve come to realize that in the same way that we have rules around refunds or other parts of the passenger experience, we need to be taking a look at this too.</p>



<p><strong>Brancaccio: </strong>Let me ask you about Baltimore in these last two minutes here. Secretary Buttigieg, your department <a href="https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/biden-harris-administration-announces-60-million-emergency-work-wake-collapse-francis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came up with $60 million in emergency highway funds</a> to deal with <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/collection/baltimore-bridge-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the bridge collapse in Baltimore</a>. But it could cost not millions, <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2024/04/02/how-much-will-the-baltimore-bridge-reconstruction-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but billions</a>. <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2024/04/02/who-will-pay-for-the-key-bridge-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Who’s going to pay to right that mess</a>?</p>



<p><strong>Buttigieg:</strong> President Biden committed that the federal government will be there to cover the cost that the people of Maryland and Baltimore need to get a new bridge and to get back to normal. But to be clear, there have been many cases where our emergency relief account has been replenished with recoveries from insurance or litigation. Obviously, if any private party is held liable, that could come back to the taxpayer. It’s just that we can’t wait for that because the people of Baltimore need help getting back to normal now. The Army Corps of Engineering is doing an extraordinary job getting that channel back open. We expect to have that port back up and running and <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2024/04/01/maryland-legislators-hope-to-help-port-workers-and-others-affected-by-the-bridge-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all of those port workers back on the job</a> by the end of May. But simultaneously, there’s the bigger, longer and more expensive project of getting a new bridge. That’s already underway too, and we’re going to be there as the president promised, every step of the way.</p>



<p><strong>Brancaccio: </strong>And you’re OK with the pace of coming up with the funding? I think you’ve mentioned before when the I-35 Bridge fell down in Minnesota those years ago, Congress moved pretty quickly. I think it was days.</p>



<p><strong>Buttigieg:</strong> That’s right. Congress acted within about a week in the Minnesota case. We’d love to see quick action here too to top up our emergency relief funds, but we are nowhere near running out of cash in that account to take care of the immediate needs.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company will spend over $500 million on expanding its Supercharger network this year.</li>
<li>This investment is despite Musk recently firing the entire team of Tesla's Supercharger team, which had been responsible for deploying new charging stations.</li>
<li>The CEO had previously mentioned that Tesla would still deploy Superchargers, but at a slower rate and with a focus on adding chargers to existing stations.</li>
<li>The cost of deploying a single Supercharger is estimated to be between $45,000 to $50,000, which would mean that Tesla plans to deploy around the same number of chargers as in the previous quarter.</li>
<li>The firing of the Supercharger team, reportedly led by Rebecca Tinucci, who pushed back against Musk's requested layoffs, has caused confusion amongst partners and suppliers working with Tesla on ongoing projects.</li>

<p>Elon Musk says Tesla is going to spend over $500 million on expanding the Supercharger network this year after firing the entire charging team.</p>



<p>It says a lot about the reason behind the firing.</p>



<span id="more-362837"></span>



<p>Last week, <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/01/elon-musk-throwing-weight-tesla-wrecking-ball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon Musk fired Tesla’s entire charging team</a> amid broader layoffs at the company.</p>



<p>We reported that the move resulted in <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/30/tesla-pulling-back-supercharger-plans-firing-team/">Tesla backing out of leases on planned Supercharger stations</a> and <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/03/read-the-wild-email-tesla-is-sending-to-suppliers-amid-supercharger-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of confusion amongst its partners in ongoing projects</a>.</p>



<p>This undoubtedly will result in Tesla’s slowing down its charging station deployment.</p>



<p>Musk previously said that Tesla still plans to deploy Superchargers, but at a slower rate and with a focus on adding chargers to existing stations.</p>



<p>Now, the CEO says that Tesla will spend more than $500 million on expanding the Supercharger network this year:</p>







<p>Tesla has never released its cost of Supercharger deployment, but some data points point toward $45,000 to $50,000 per charger, which would mean a $500 million spent this year would require roughly the same deployment as in Q1 – the last quarter when Tesla had a full Supercharger team.</p>



<p>We previously reported that <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/01/elon-musk-throwing-weight-tesla-wrecking-ball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Musk fired the Supercharger team after the head of the team Rebecca Tinucci, pushed back against the level of layoffs</a> that the CEO requested.</p>



<p>Musk responded by firing her and her entire team of roughly 500 people and then sent an email to other executives warning them that he will ask for their resignation if they don’t fire the number of people he is requesting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>This pretty much confirmed what I have been talking about regarding Elon’s decision to fire the entire charging team.</p>



<p>It had nothing to do with any change of plan regarding charging.</p>




	<p>The head of charging pushed back against layoffs and Elon made an example of her and her entire team was collateral damage. It was a rash and impulsive move, which he is known to do.</p>



<p>It was not based on any mission-driven initiative or change of plan regarding Superchargers.</p>



<p>Yet, you have Elon’s suckophants claiming this is a genius move for x, y or z reasons. </p>



<p>There will undoubtedly be a slowdown in Supercharger deployment in the coming months after contractors go through everything in the pipeline. Customers will be affected, especially if other automakers continue to get onboarded into the network. That’s inevitable.</p>

<ol>
<li>Pasco Shikishima Corporation, a well-known Japanese bread brand, is recalling around 104,000 packs of sliced white bread after the remains of a rat were found in at least two packets.</li>
<li>The affected bread was produced at a factory in Tokyo, and a form is available on the company's website for customers to apply for refunds.</li>
<li>Pasco Corporation has apologized for the incident and pledged to strengthen its quality controls to prevent such incidents in the future.</li>
<li>The bread is a staple in many Japanese households and is also exported to countries such as the US, China, Australia, and Singapore.</li>
<li>This recall is rare in Japan, a country known for its high standards of sanitation, but follows other recent food-related health scares in the country, including a milk scandal and a recall of dietary supplements.</li>

<li>Electric vehicle (EV) startups, such as Rivian Automotive, Lucid Group, and Nikola Corp., are having to scramble to prove they can survive in a tougher market environment where EV adoption is taking off slower than expected.</li>
<li>One of the key concerns for these startups is having enough cash to survive the challenging conditions, with many having already gone bankrupt.</li>
<li>To address this issue, several electric vehicle startups have announced plans to reduce costs, including job cuts, production changes, supplier rearrangements, and shifting priorities.</li>
<li>The slowdown in EV adoption and the increased competition in the market have forced these startups to re-evaluate their strategies and prioritize cost reduction to ensure their survival.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Hy-Vee is closing multiple stores</strong>: The grocery store chain announced that it's closing several locations in Cedar Rapids, Waterloo, and Davenport, including the 1st Avenue location in Cedar Rapids, which is set to close on June 23rd, 2024.</li>
<li><strong>Residents are concerned about access to fresh food and prescriptions</strong>: The closure will leave a nearly 2-mile gap in grocery stores for residents who rely on Hy-Vee for fresh food and prescriptions, which can be problematic for those with mobility issues or no access to a car.</li>
<li><strong>City officials were "blindsided" by the announcement</strong>: The City of Cedar Rapids was not informed about the store's closure until the day before the public announcement, and Mayor O'Donnell felt that the company did not provide adequate notice.</li>
<li><strong>The city had previously incentivized the store's construction</strong>: The City of Cedar Rapids had given Hy-Vee incentives, including a 20-year tax increment financing, to build the First Avenue store in 2001 and keep a grocery store in the area.</li>
<li><strong>The city is working on finding new solutions</strong>: City officials are working on finding new solutions to support the community and find alternative solutions to replace the closed Hy-Vee store.</li>

Residents in Cedar Rapids say they rely on the Hy-Vee for fresh food and prescriptions, and worry they’ll have to travel approximately 2 miles now to get them. This can be <a href="https://www.kcrg.com/2024/05/10/1st-avenue-hy-vee-closing-creates-food-desert/" target="_blank">problematic for residents with mobility issues and no access to a car.</a></p><p class="text | article-text">The City of Cedar Rapids has said that it was ‘blindsided’ by the company’s decisions to close the location on 1st Avenue.</p><p class="text | article-text">Mayor O’Donnell says that the company came to them last year and discussed the financial difficulty the store was facing. The City said they held open talks with Hy-Vee about what it would take to keep the store open. Those discussions reportedly did not go anywhere. Then, in November 2023, the landlord of the building reached out to City officials saying that a 5-year agreement between the landlord and Hy-Vee was achieved.</p><p class="w-100"></p><p class="text | article-text">Then, On May 9th, 2024, the company let city officials know they were closing the store less than an hour before making the announcement public. The Mayor says there was no indication from the company that the store was closing between last November’s 5-year agreement and Thursday’s announcement.</p><p class="text | article-text">The City of Cedar Rapids <a href="https://www.thegazette.com/state-government/city-council-heads-to-first-avenue-hy-vee-a-testament-to-risk-takers-who-came-before/">had given Hy-Vee incentives to build the First Avenue store in 2001</a> and keep a grocery store in the area, including a 20-year tax increment financing.</p><p class="text | article-text">Officials say they are working on finding new solutions to supporting people in that community.</p><p class="copyright |"><i>Copyright 2024 KCRG.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>$10.22 million settlement</strong>: Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile agreed to pay a combined $10.22 million to settle claims that they misled customers about their "unlimited" plans and "free" phone offers.</li>
