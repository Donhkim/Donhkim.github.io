<ol>
<li>American Airlines' (AAL) stock is declining after the company announced the departure of its Chief Commercial Officer, Vasu Raja, and issued revised guidance that disappointed investors.</li>
<li>The airline's revised guidance for the second quarter includes adjusted EPS of $1.00 to $1.15, down from its prior forecast of $1.15-$1.45. It also expects TRASM (Total Revenue per Available Seat Mile) to be down 5-6% compared to its prior forecast of a 1-2% decline.</li>
<li>Operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be down 1%, in a range of 8.5-9.5%. American Airlines also expects a decline in demand, which could impact its revenue.</li>
<li>The airline's rival, United Airlines, reiterated its profit guidance for the second quarter, projecting EPS of $3.75 to $4.25, indicating a strong summer travel season ahead.</li>
<li>The decline in American Airlines' stock could be attributed to too much capacity in the industry, which has been a concern for the airline sector. The company's CFO, Savi Syth, noted that there is more price sensitivity in the travel sector due to increased demand during peak periods such as Memorial Day and Labor Day.</li>

American’s TRASM guidance for Q2 is now expected to be down approximately 5% to 6%, compared to its prior forecast of down 1% to 2%. Operating margin was also seen down 1%, in a range of approximately 8.5% to 9.5%.</p><p>Shares of American are having their worst day since June 2020, during the throes of the pandemic.</p><p>“We were surprised by the level of the guidance cut, but the factors behind it are probably not surprising to us,” Raymond James managing director Savi Syth told Yahoo Finance. "And we've called this out before, too much capacity, American-inclusive and in the industry [is a problem]."</p><p>The revisions come ahead of the busy summer season for leisure travelers, which has grown busier as pandemic conditions eased. <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TSA checkpoint travel numbers;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="0">TSA checkpoint travel numbers</a> hit a new high for the year on May 24, with over 2.9 million travelers flying ahead of Memorial Day weekend and numbers across the board increasing every day through the weekend compared to a year ago.</p><p>American Airlines rival United Airlines <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://ir.united.com/node/31526/html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reiterated its profit guidance;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0">reiterated its profit guidance</a> for the second quarter.

Syth noted that American’s excess capacity during off-peak “shoulder” travel season was another issue, but the airline said it was addressing overcapacity during its Q1 earnings call last month.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">An American Airlines jetliner rumbles down a runway at Denver International Airport, Jan. 16, 2024, in Denver.

Though she is confident CEO Robert Isom is up to the task of reversing some operational mistakes, it won't happen overnight.</p><p>“I really think it comes back down to their large corporate strategy, [and] I think execution was not good,” Syth said in regard to American’s focus on leisure travel. “They're hurting from that now, and it is reversible, but it will take time.”</p><p><em>Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The security and valuation of the company were especially important, according to Toner, because OpenAI employees would make a lot of money from their equity in the $86 billion company via a tender offer a few months later.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">“The second thing that is really important to know, that has really gone underreported, is how scared people are to go against Sam,” Toner said. “They experienced him retaliating against people, retaliating against them, for past instances of being critical. They were really afraid of what might happen to them.”</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">Lastly, Toner noted that this is not the first company where Altman has run into this problem. The former OpenAI board member brought up that Altman was fired from Y Combinator in 2019, which the <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 jCErAQ js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/22/sam-altman-fired-y-combinator-paul-graham/",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/22/sam-altman-fired-y-combinator-paul-graham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a></span> reported in the wake of his firing from OpenAI. Toner also said the management team at Loopt, Altman’s first startup, went to the company’s board twice and asked them to fire Altman for “deceptive and chaotic behavior.”</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">Toner, Tasha McCauley, Ilya Sutskever, and Adam D’Angelo were the board members responsible for firing Sam Altman last November. Toner and McCauley immediately left the OpenAI board when Altman returned to power later that month. Sutskever just announced <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 jCErAQ js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","https://gizmodo.com/ilya-sutskever-leaves-openai-1851477658",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://gizmodo.com/ilya-sutskever-leaves-openai-1851477658">his departure this month</a></span>, after reportedly being absent from OpenAI’s office for about six months.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">In response to this flurry of allegations, the podcast included a response from OpenAI’s board chair Bret Taylor. “We are disappointed that Ms. Toner continues to revisit these issues,” Taylor said, then citing the law firm Wilmer Hale’s independent investigation into these issues. “The review concluded that the prior board’s decision was not based on concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of development, OpenAI’s finances, or its statements to investors, customers, or business partners.”</p><p class="sc-166b7vj-0 eEDRKr js_ymal-below-post" data-vtas-click="inner:Recommendation:ymal-below-post"></p><p class="sc-7pt2sm-0 kGSzqB js_more-below-post" data-vtas-click="inner:Recommendation:more-below-post"></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv">This interview comes after weeks of turmoil for OpenAI, where the company’s trustworthiness is increasingly coming into public light.

<li><strong>Copper assets were a key attraction</strong>: BHP was particularly interested in Anglo's copper assets, which have become more valuable due to the green energy transition.</li>
<li><strong>Deal collapse follows months of negotiations</strong>: The deal collapsed after a month of wrangling between the two companies, with BHP making three separate offers to Anglo American.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>

																										<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk roasted a shareholder group that is opposing his $56 billion pay package yet multiplied their investment due to his leadership.</p>
<p>The California Public Employees’ Retirement System, otherwise known as CalPERS, owned 183,343 shares of Tesla stock in 2018, according to filings. At the time of the 2018-2019 CalPERS Annual Investment Report, Tesla shares traded at just $14.90.</p>
<p>However, Tesla stock has increased in price exponentially since then — by more than 11x. Therefore, CalPERS’ Tesla stake in that investment alone has gone from $40 million to roughly $500 million, and they’re still voting <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-pay-package-glass-lewis/">against Musk’s $56 billion pay package</a>.</p>

<p>Musk replied to the fact that CalPERS does not support his pay:</p>
<p><em>“CalPERS broke the deal. Shame on them, they have no honor.”</em></p>

<p></p>
<p>CalPERS now owns 6,738,863 shares of Tesla stock, worth roughly $1.7 billion.</p>
<p>Musk’s compensation is among the largest issues on the sheet for the upcoming Tesla Shareholder Meeting. Firms, shareholders, and investment groups alike are all deciding on what they believe is right, with many retail investors hellbent on getting the CEO paid.</p>
<p>This is mostly because the $56 billion pay package was approved by shareholders in 2018.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the pay package was denied and rejected by a Delaware Chancery Court judge. The move has also encouraged Tesla to leave the State of Delaware completely, with its most likely move to be an incorporation into Texas.</p>
<p>With the vote coming soon, there are so many different points of view on this issue.</p>
<p>We reported this morning <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-pay-package-glass-lewis/">that firm Glass Lewis</a> also planned to vote ‘No’ on Musk’s pay package. Other firms are more likely to keep Musk in his position as CEO and leader of Tesla.</p>
<p>Many shareholders believe that because the pay package was already approved once, it should be approved again.</p>
<p>In an attempt to ensure Musk is paid his $56 billion, Tesla is <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-pulling-out-stops-elon-musk-56-billion-pay-package-approved/">pulling out all the stops</a> to get things moving so that Musk gets paid to avoid his potential departure. It has already used potential factory tours with him and Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen and other strategies to convince shareholders to vote for the approval.</p>

the world’s biggest producer of memory chips, have been locked in negotiations with the union over wages since January, but the two sides have failed to narrow their differences.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“We are declaring a strike in the face of the company’s neglect of labourers,” a spokesperson for the National <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/samsung" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Samsung</a> Electronics Union said at a livestreamed news conference. “We have tried to solve the issue through dialogue.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The union president, Son Woo-mok, said the union had accepted the pay raise proposed by the company but was asking for one additional holiday plus “a transparent system to measure the performance bonus based on the sales profit”.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“The company is not hearing us and they are not communicating from our last negotiation session,” he said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">A Samsung official said: “Samsung will keep in dialogue with the labour union going forward as it has been.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“It could lead to a general strike,” the union spokesperson said of the one-day strike, confirming that the action was the company’s “first strike, [and] we believe it is meaningful”.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Responsibility for all collective action from now lies squarely on the company. We are declaring our stance in the face of the company’s neglect and interference in our peaceful struggle so far.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Samsung Electronics is one of the world’s largest smartphone makers and one of the only companies globally to produce high-end memory chips used for generative AI, including top-of-the-line AI hardware from industry leaders such as Nvidia. It is the flagship subsidiary of the South Korean giant Samsung Group, by far the largest of the family-controlled conglomerates that dominate business in Asia’s fourth-largest economy.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">For almost 50 years, Samsung Electronics avoided unionisation of its employees – sometimes adopting ferocious tactics, according to critics – while rising to become the world’s largest smartphone and semiconductor manufacturer.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul, who died in 1987, was adamantly opposed to unions, saying he would never allow them “until I have dirt over my eyes”.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Internal documents from 2012 obtained by a South Korean MP instructed managers to control “problematic personnel” seeking to establish unions.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“To avoid claims of unfair labour practices, dismiss key organisers before the launch of a union,” it read, among other recommendations.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">But in 2019, organisers seized the opportunity presented by the left-leaning government of President Moon Jae-in – a former rights lawyer who represented trade unions – and controversy around the bribery trial of the company’s then vice-chair, Lee Jae-yong, the founder’s grandson, to set up a union.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Having 20% of its workforce on strike will significantly impact the company as a whole, especially at a time when it needs to act quickly in the ever-evolving semiconductor industry,” said Kim Dae-jong, professor of business at Sejong University.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Unlike Hyundai Motor, which has dealt with strikes almost annually, Samsung management will struggle to control this situation because it has never dealt with a strike before.”</p></div></div>

just planning its business very well and it's not overstocking items.</p><p>It's putting new merchandise on the floor and the stuff is selling out.</p><p>Well, one area of the business that really caught me by surprise guys on the conference call moments ago was the wedding.</p><p>Business is the business.</p><p>They recently launched Abercrombie and Fitch.</p><p>And it's, uh, the Fran Hoitz CEO will talk to a little bit later on, uh, this afternoon saying it's one of the hottest businesses they have right now, can't keep the stuff in stock.</p><p>And it's not only that they're coming in and buying wedding dresses, uh, from Abercrombie and Fitch or various wedding styles.</p><p>These are new customers in many cases to the Abercrombie brand and that is having that is sending customers to other areas of the store.</p><p>You know what?</p><p>That's so interesting because it makes sense when you take a step back and think about it because it was really the millennial shopper who knew Abercrombie so well, decades ago.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Right.</p><p>And so now many of those people are in the age of they're getting married, they're having weddings.</p><p>So why not buy at Abercrombie?</p><p>I didn't even know.</p><p>I just pulled it up.</p><p>I pulled it up on my, on my computer right now.</p><p>I had no idea that they even had this business until you just said it.</p><p>But it makes sense because it also re the remaining committed to their loyal customers and they're playing into that base that has worked well for them.</p><p>You see the film, you see the fitness?</p><p>Well, look, I saw, I saw the fit and I was upset because you were teasing this to us before.</p><p>And yeah, I didn't see this coming at all.</p><p>They don't have tuxes there though.</p><p>I was just there.</p><p>No tuxedos.</p><p>They're not gonna compete with the men's warehouse.</p><p>But also interesting to uh Abercrombie noting on the conference call that they are now going to, I think now that their US business is solid.</p><p>Abercrombie's working Hollister businesses finally start to turn, they're shifting their or shifting their sites to uh Europe, notably uh Germany and the UK.</p><p>In fact, Fran Horowitz, uh saying she was just in the UK for and had their first annual board meeting there uh in, in quite some time.</p><p>So look for the company now to expand overseas a little more aggressively and thoughtfully and then also open up a good number of stores here in the US in the back half of the year.</p><p>We should clarify.</p><p>This is like wedding.</p><p>I'm still hung up on this wedding guest attire is what?</p><p>But they have stuff that you could wear for your wedding.</p><p>It walking down the aisle, rehearsal dinner, there's a lot of stuff you could wear that.</p><p>Yeah, get you geared up for your back.</p><p>I'm here to bring you this like hashtag breaking news.</p><p>This one you can wear down the aisle.</p><p>It's not me but it is here.</p><p>But if you wear head to toe Abercrombie and Fitch, why not just live that wedding lifestyle and go out and buy one of these dresses?</p><p>Are you?</p><p>So you do, would you buy, would you get someone from there?</p><p>Of course, why not?</p><p>I mean, it's not bad.</p><p>Yeah, it's not bad.</p><p>And it's also a very affordable price point, especially when you compare it to some of the other.</p><p>I'm gonna put this to, uh, Ceo Fran Horace because I walk, walk by my latest, uh, my recent, my Abercrombie Fitch store, uh, Roosevelt Mall and I didn't see any of this stuff.</p><p>So I gotta ask her where, where is this?</p><p>And why is not my store one?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Maybe we should be buying more of these dresses.</p><p>I have no weddings to go to.</p><p>Nor am I getting married.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Nor do you need a dress any time any of that stuff on the wedding site?</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://electrek.co/guides/cadillac/">Cadillac</a> unveiled its most affordable luxury EV so far, the 2025 Optiq, on Wednesday. Cadillac’s new Optiq is the “new luxury entry point” for EV buyers, but can it keep up with Tesla’s Model Y?</p>



<span id="more-365253"></span>



<p>The new 2025 Optiq will join Cadillac’s growing lineup of electric cars. Cadillac’s EV portfolio includes <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/cadillac-lyriq/">the Lyriq</a>, Escalade IQ, Celestiq, and Vistiq launching next year.</p>



<p>Cadillac has been teasing a cheaper electric SUV to sit below the Lyriq as the brand’s entry-level EV. </p>



<p>Compared to other Cadillac electric cars, like the $340K Celestiq or $130K Escalade IQ, the Optiq is aimed at a new segment of buyers.</p>



<p>With a growing number of younger buyers in the US, Cadillac’s <a href="https://media.cadillac.com/media/us/en/cadillac/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2024/may/0529-optiq.html">new Optiq</a> “will be an important gateway to attract luxury EV intenders” to the brand. Cadillac confirmed its goal of offering a fully electric portfolio by 2030.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Optiq will be sold in 10 regions, including Europe, as Cadillac looks to revamp overseas sales.</p>



<p>Cadillac promises its new entry-level EV will feature “several segment-leading features” and remain true to the Cadillac brand as it looks to stand out in a sea of luxury SUV rivals.</p>

<p>With a 6″ shorter wheelbase, the Optiq is more agile and fun to drive than the Lyriq. “The Ultium Platform allows us to fit enough muscle into a smaller package to provide a thrilling performance, delivering a sensation of isolated precision,” chief engineer John Cockburn explained.</p>



<p>Powered by an 85 kWh battery pack with standard dual-motor AWD, the Optiq offers up to 300 miles Cadillac-estimated miles of range. It can also add up to 79 miles of range in 10 minutes with DC fast charging.</p>

<p>Cadillac’s new Optiq EV features a vented rear spoiler, diffuser, and other elements to boost aerodynamics (without compromising the SUV’s design).</p>



<p>Other exterior elements add to the Optiq’s sporty design, such as a fixed-glass roof, signature black crystal grille, and upgraded rear quarter panels. The Optiq also features signature lighting, so you are met with a light show when you walk up to or exit the vehicle.</p>

<p>The high-tech interior includes a 33″ diagonal advanced LED display with 9K resolution, Super Cruise driver assist as standard, advanced radar, camera, ultrasonic sensor tech, and Google built-in. It also comes loaded with segment-leading cargo space and second-row space.</p>

<p>Can Cadillac’s new Optiq EV compete with top-selling luxury rivals like Tesla, BMW, or Mercedes-Benz?</p>



<p>GM hopes Cadillac’s most affordable EV can help spark sales growth. Between the Optiq, Chevy Blazer EV, Equinox EV, and Silverado EV, GM has a strong slate of electric cars rolling out.</p>




	<p>CEO Mary Barra calls 2024 the “year of execution” after battery production hurdles led to missed sales targets last year.</p>



<p>Barra believes the battery issues are “behind us now” as it looks to ramp EV sales this year. With production of the current Chevy Bolt EV/EUV ending last December, GM is looking to fill the massive hole.</p>



<p>GM aims to build 200,000 to 300,000 Ultium-based EVs this year, about 20 times more than last year. The company sold less than 14,000 Ultium models last year, with the other +62,000 being the Bolt.</p>



<p>Can Cadillac’s new Optiq help revamp the brand and compete with luxury EV rivals? Drop us a comment below to let us know your thoughts.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>U.S. consumer confidence rose in May</strong>: The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index increased from 97.5 in April to 102 in May, contrary to economists' expectations of a decline.</li>
<li><strong>Optimism about the labor market drove the uptick</strong>: Consumers are becoming more optimistic about the labor market, which is contributing to the increase in confidence.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation expectations remained steady</strong>: Despite the rise in confidence, Americans' expectations about average inflation over the next 12 months remained steady, increasing from 5.3% to 5.4%.</li>
<li><strong>High income earners showed the largest rise in confidence</strong>: Those making over $100,000 expressed the largest rise in confidence, while younger consumers (under 35) and those with higher incomes (making over $100,000) continue to be more confident.</li>
<li><strong>Consumers remain concerned about prices</strong>: Food and groceries were cited as having the greatest impact on consumers' views of the economy, and expectations about interest rates over the next year increased.</li>
