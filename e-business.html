                                        <p>TORONTO (AP) — A strike by plane mechanics forced Canada’s second largest airline, WestJet, to cancel hundreds more flights Sunday, upending plans of roughly 110,000 travelers over the Canada Day long weekend and prompting the carrier to demand action from the federal government.</p><p>Some 680 workers, whose daily inspections and repairs are essential to airline operations, walked off the job Friday evening despite a directive for binding arbitration from the labor minister.</p><p>“WestJet is in receipt of a binding arbitration order and awaits urgent clarity from the government that a strike and arbitration cannot exist simultaneously; this is something they have committed to address and like all Canadians we are waiting,” WestJet Airlines President Diederik Pen said in a statement Sunday.</p><p>Since Thursday, WestJet has cancelled 829 flights scheduled to fly between then and Monday — the busiest travel weekend of the season.</p>
    

<p>The vast majority of Sunday’s trips were called off as WestJet pared down its 180-plane fleet to 32 active aircraft and topped the global list for cancellations among major airlines over the weekend.</p>



<p>Trevor Temple-Murray was one of thousands of customers scrambling to rebook after their trips were scrapped less than a day in advance.</p><p>“We’ll just have to wait it out,” said Temple-Murray, a resident of Lethbridge, Alberta, who waited in a car with his wife and 2-year-old son in the parking lot of the Victoria, British Columbia, airport. They were trying to get a plane to Calgary.</p>
    
<p>Their 6:05 p.m. flight had been cancelled, and they wouldn’t know until the evening whether a scheduled 7 a.m. flight the next day would go ahead.</p><p>“There are a lot of angry people in there,” Temple-Murray said, pointing at the terminal.</p><p>Nearby, Grade 10 exchange student Marina Cebrian said she was supposed to be back home in Spain early Sunday, but now won’t return to her family until Tuesday after enduring three flight cancellations.</p>
    

<p>“It’s distressing,” she said. “I was supposed to be at home today, like seven hours ago, but I’m not.”</p><p>Both WestJet and the Airplane Mechanics Fraternal Association have accused the other side of refusing to negotiate in good faith.</p><p>The union’s goal remains a deal hammered out through bargaining rather than by an arbitrator — a route it opposed from the start.</p><p>The union says its demands around wages would cost WestJet less than $8 million Canadian (US$5.6 million) beyond what the company has offered for the first year of the collective agreement — the first contract between the two sides. It has acknowledged the gains would surpass compensation for industry colleagues across Canada and sit more on par with U.S. counterparts.</p><p>WestJet says it has offered a 12.5% wage hike in the first year of the contract, and a compounded wage increase of 23.5% over the rest of the 5 1/2-year term.</p>

<p>Since the mid-1980s, new homes typically commanded a price premium over existing homes, Howard Hughes Holdings CEO David O’Reilly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/26/howard-hughes-holdings-ceo-on-new-home-sales-trends.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/26/howard-hughes-holdings-ceo-on-new-home-sales-trends.html" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/26/howard-hughes-holdings-ceo-on-new-home-sales-trends.html" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">told CNBC on Wednesday</a>, adding that it has been shrinking over the past several months. Now it’s gone.</p>



<p>“Today’s result said that that’s actually flipped on its head,” he said. </p>



<p>For the month of May, the median sales for a new home price fell 0.9% from a year earlier to $417,400, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.</p>



<p>By contrast, the median sales price for an existing home jumped 5.8% from a year ago to a fresh record-high of $419,300 in May, the National Association of Realtors said earlier this month. The NAR said that reflected more sales of high-priced properties as well as multiple offers.</p><p></p>



<p>And since the start of the year, the price of existing homes has been even steeper, jumping 10.8% from $378,600 in January. For new homes, it was $430,400 in January.</p>



<p>That’s as the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/29/housing-market-outlook-lock-in-effect-next-decade-mortgage-rates-fed-cuts/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/29/housing-market-outlook-lock-in-effect-next-decade-mortgage-rates-fed-cuts/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/06/29/housing-market-outlook-lock-in-effect-next-decade-mortgage-rates-fed-cuts/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">housing market’s lock-in effect</a> has kept the supply of existing homes tight because homeowners with low mortgage rates are reluctant to give them up and are not selling. But demand has stayed elevated, adding upward pressure on prices.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the latest quarterly reports from homebuilders showed that average selling prices are coming down, O’Reilly said, citing a shift in the product mix.</p>



<p>“That shows the consumer adjusting to a smaller home, taking less space and trying to get back into that range of affordability,” he said.  </p>



<p>O’Reilly, whose heads real estate development and management company also works with builders, has been bullish on the sector, declaring in April that this is the “<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/26/housing-market-golden-age-homebuilding-mortgage-rates-new-homes/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/26/housing-market-golden-age-homebuilding-mortgage-rates-new-homes/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/04/26/housing-market-golden-age-homebuilding-mortgage-rates-new-homes/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">golden age of homebuilding</a>.”</p><p></p>



<p>The reversal in home prices for new homes versus existing homes also comes as <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/housing-market-starter-home-going-extinct-affordability-havens/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/housing-market-starter-home-going-extinct-affordability-havens/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/housing-market-starter-home-going-extinct-affordability-havens/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">the $200,000 starter home is going extinct</a>, making it tougher for first-time buyers to get into the housing market. </p>

    <p>Here are five key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The story of GameStop's (GME) sudden return to the spotlight, led by activist investor Roaring Kitty (Keith Gill), may be playing out like a disappointing sequel, lacking the original drama and heroism that drove the stock's earlier surge.</li>
<li>The valuation of GameStop at $9 billion seems unsustainable, and Roaring Kitty has not provided a compelling narrative to justify it. As a result, the stock has relinquished most of its gains and is now trading around $25 per share.</li>
<li>Roaring Kitty's investment approach is seen as lackluster, with some analysts calling it "financial nihilism" - a "get rich big or die trying" mentality that lacks rhyme or reason.</li>
<li>The catalyst for GameStop's earlier viral phenomenon was a mixture of low interest rates, quantitative easing, and pandemic-era stimulus checks, which artificially inflated asset prices and created a sense of euphoria among investors.</li>
<li>Roaring Kitty's character, which was portrayed as a YOLO (you only live once) trader, may have been a creature of the lockdown-era zeitgeist, but now appears to be lost without a compelling narrative to drive the stock's value.</li>

<p>Eight months after his story was immortalized on the silver screen, his sudden return now threatens to play out like a bad Hollywood sequel—banking on nostalgia while lacking any of the original drama and heroism the second time around. Worse, there’s no real villain to fill the shoes of Citadel’s Ken Griffin—and now the main protagonist has gone missing. </p>



<p>Without a narrative compelling enough to go viral, the chances that Gill can marshal his scattered forces and send GameStop shares to the moon again appear to be between slim and none. </p>



<p>“I don’t know what the new story is for this company that would in any way justify the $9 billion valuation,” argues Derek Horstmeyer, a professor of finance at George Mason University’s School of Business in Virginia. “And Gill didn’t seem to be able to articulate what that would be either.”</p>







<p>Since euphoria upon Roaring Kitty’s reappearance propelled the stock as high as $48 earlier this month, it has relinquished almost all of its gains. Now it’s trading around the $25 mark, only slightly above the $23.14 close before Gill <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d6r5vp/gme_yolo_update_june_2_2024/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1d6r5vp/gme_yolo_update_june_2_2024/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">first revealed</a> on June 2 that he owned 5 million shares.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roaring Kitty a creature of the lockdown-era zeitgeist</h2>



<p>At the time GameStop first became a viral phenomenon, the 38-year-old portrayed it as nothing more than a YOLO trade—a kind of “get rich big or die trying” mentality that analyst and podcaster <a href="https://hiddenforces.io/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://hiddenforces.io/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Demetri Kofinas</a> has taken to calling “financial nihilism”. </p>



<p>Gill even claimed his investment decisions can lack any rhyme or reason and simply result from drawing random cards out of an Uno deck he keeps handy while consulting his Magic Eight Ball.</p><p></p>



<p>In that sense, Roaring Kitty was truly a creature of the zeitgeist. At the time, asset prices across the board were artificially inflated by a mixture of zero interest rates and quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve. Pandemic-era stimulus checks put found money in the pockets of everyday Americans at a time when gambling on sports was impossible after COVID eliminated spectator events. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe class="" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQBubLv49fk?feature=oembed" title="Selecting Stocks Based on Feel" id="youtube-2776370">VIDEO</iframe></p></figure>



<p>Many discovered they could find all sorts of long shot bets offering a big payout with relatively little money in the options market, which enjoyed one crucial advantage over wagering on the ponies or a heavyweight title fight. </p>



<p>“In sports betting, the more people pile in, the more the odds begin to even up without any effect on the likelihood of the outcome,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told <em>Fortune</em>. But, “if enough speculators buy a particular option at the same time, the greater the chances are that it pays off.” </p>



<p>Trapped at home and seeking community online, a number of small shareholders discovered wealthy hedge funds like Steve Cohen’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/30/gamestop-point72-founder-steve-cohen-leaves-twitter-after-family-receives-threats.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/30/gamestop-point72-founder-steve-cohen-leaves-twitter-after-family-receives-threats.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Point72</a> were all heavily short GameStop. Were Gill and his allies to gang together and buy short-dated call options from the likes of Citadel, it would send Ken Griffin’s industry leading market maker and others like it scrambling to secure the underlying shares in order to cover their exposure. The Cohens and Griffins of the world would be tripping over each other bidding up the stock no matter the price.  </p>



<p>The time was ripe for a GameStop run, too, since the retailer expected to profit from a lockdown-induced boom in video gaming matched with the launch of a new generation of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/sony-2/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/sony-2/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sony</a> PlayStation and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Microsoft</a> Xbox consoles.</p><p></p>



<p>Along with other social media users on the WallStreetBets subbredit, Gill helped catapult the stock to a split-adjusted intraday record of $120.75 in January 2021. The short squeeze that saw its market cap soar to $50 billion was so epic it caught the attention of the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-white-house-idUSKBN29W2I1/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-white-house-idUSKBN29W2I1/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">White House</a>. A month later Congress held a hearing over it with Gill providing testimony.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Meme stock craze gives way to return to normalcy </h2>



<p>Four years later, the story is completely different. The pandemic is over, people are gradually returning to the office and policy tightening by an inflation-fighting Fed means savers are no longer penalized for socking their cash away in money market accounts.</p>



<p>The games industry is in an outright crisis with Sony, the dominant console manufacturer, admitting sales of its PS5 have <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/05/14/sony-says-ps5-sales-have-peaked-after-29-decline/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/05/14/sony-says-ps5-sales-have-peaked-after-29-decline/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">peaked</a>. Games publishers are <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157264/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-studio-closure" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.polygon.com/24157264/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-studio-closure" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">shutting down</a> even successful studios and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-ubisoft-and-getting-gamers-comfortable-with-not-owning-their-games" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-ubisoft-and-getting-gamers-comfortable-with-not-owning-their-games" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">moving away</a> from physical discs that cost money to manufacture and distribute in favor of remote downloads that leave GameStop one business model shy of a future. </p>



<p>The shared sense of community among fellow “apes”, a self-deprecating term used by meme stock traders, is no longer as potent either. All that is left is a residual anger at a system rigged against them. </p>







<p>Whether it’s Nancy Pelosi’s mysterious luck at stock picking that prompted calls to <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/07/opinion/nancy-pelosis-huge-portfolio-gains-are-an-obscene-case-for-banning-trading-in-congress/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://nypost.com/2024/01/07/opinion/nancy-pelosis-huge-portfolio-gains-are-an-obscene-case-for-banning-trading-in-congress/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">ban Congress members trading</a>, the SEC granting Warren Buffett <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/15/business/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-chubb-stake/index.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/15/business/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-chubb-stake/index.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">exemption</a> from disclosing his near $7 billion investment in a rival, or hedge funds simply being invited by the media to talk their book all the time, it often feels like the elites can get away with everything. </p><p></p>



<p>But it’s hard to crystallize the kind of support needed for a pile-on against bystanders not directly involved in GameStop. Neither Pelosi or Buffett make for convincing enough substitutes for billionaires like Cohen and Griffin, who many believe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR5ver9VTuk" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR5ver9VTuk" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">pulled strings</a> to get stock trading app Robinhood to pause activity when the market moved against them. (Citadel argues the allegations of collusion were thoroughly debunked and a U.S. district judge threw out a class action lawsuit citing <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2021/11/19/robinhood_class_action_dismissal.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://regmedia.co.uk/2021/11/19/robinhood_class_action_dismissal.pdf" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">lack of evidence</a>). </p>



<p>“Ken Griffin made for a really great villain. GameStop traders really wanted to stick it to Citadel,” Horstmeyer says. </p>



<p>The vitriol was so intense Steve Cohen <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/31/gamestop-hedgefund-losses-steve-cohen-twitter-wallstreetbets-stock/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2021/01/31/gamestop-hedgefund-losses-steve-cohen-twitter-wallstreetbets-stock/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">left Twitter</a> due to threats he claimed were made against his family. This time around there’s no prized scalp worthy of claiming, and latent anti-establishment sentiment is far more amorphous. “There isn’t one concrete face to it,” Horstmeyer adds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s his strategy?</h2>



<p>If Gill had any ideas how GameStop should reorganize, he hasn’t expressed them since his return. He mainly communicates via guerilla-style memes (merely posting a <a href="https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1806371920495186041" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1806371920495186041" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">cartoon dog</a> on social media sent shares in pet supplies retailer Chewy <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chewy-stock-spikes-then-retreats-after-roaring-kitty-posts-cryptic-picture-of-dog-on-x-173633372.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chewy-stock-spikes-then-retreats-after-roaring-kitty-posts-cryptic-picture-of-dog-on-x-173633372.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">soaring</a> on Thursday). </p>



<p>The one time he actually spoke to his fans, he hosted a rambling hour-long livestream on <a href="https://fortune.com/company/youtube/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/youtube/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">YouTube</a> where he merely aimed to “reiterate a lot my viewpoints I had previously” rather than update his thesis in light of recent events.</p><p></p>



<p>For now, Gill is keeping everyone guessing about his ultimate intentions. At one point he teased viewers on his sole livestream by pulling out his old trusty Magic Eight Ball to ask what the plan is for GameStop—only to shelve it before the round plastic oracle could reply.</p>



<p>“Either he really does believe in this company, or he’s totally nihilistic and just wants to be internet famous,” Horstmeyer continued. “It’s a toss-up at this point.”</p>



<p>There is one new possible twist in the story no one had seen coming: as the company’s second largest individual shareholder, Gill could demand a seat on the board. He seemed to send a <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/14/gamestop-roaring-kitty-keith-gill-meme-stock-ryan-cohen-board-seat/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/14/gamestop-roaring-kitty-keith-gill-meme-stock-ryan-cohen-board-seat/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">hidden message</a> by raising his holding to the exact same number chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen had when he made a play.</p>







<p>Gill’s last E*Trade post showed he’s up $50 million, but that’s small fry after <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/gamestop-roaring-kitty-billionaire-stock-share-sale/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/gamestop-roaring-kitty-billionaire-stock-share-sale/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">briefly being within reach</a> of becoming a billionaire hours before he turned 38 this month. Still—unless he gambles everything away—he looks to be set for life even with ‘just’ $270 million in his E*Trade account. Can Gill, who spent much of the 2010s between jobs, credibly embody the same underdog in GameStop’s ‘us versus them’ narrative?</p><p></p>



<p>“My question is who is now the ‘them’?” asks Sosnick. “If you’re not sure who ‘them’ is, ‘them’ is probably you.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile the protagonist himself seems to have gone missing in his own story. WallStreetBets, the social media account that elevated the concept of meme stocks, YOLO trades and loss porn, sounded like a jilted lover this past week. After preaching to its followers that GameStop’s ‘mother of all short squeezes’ was coming any day now, WallStreetBets turned to obsessively posting about Gill.</p>



<p>“Waiting for Roaring Kitty to post a GameStop PnL screenshot,<strong> </strong>it<strong> </strong><a href="https://x.com/wallstreetbets/status/1803880423241498907" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/wallstreetbets/status/1803880423241498907" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">posted</a> last Thursday, using the sad Pablo Escobar meme from <em>Narcos</em>. 24 hours later it <a href="https://x.com/wallstreetbets/status/1804170124292698552" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/wallstreetbets/status/1804170124292698552" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">followed</a> with another appeal: “Need Roaring Kitty to give us a sign right now.” On Monday it pleaded for Gill to “drop a banger tweet” before finally <a href="https://x.com/wallstreetbets/status/1805692443180126440" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/wallstreetbets/status/1805692443180126440" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">complaining</a> that a fortnight had passed without word from the totemic leader.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">GameStop has more money than it knows what to do with</h2>



<p>Right now the only one truly sitting pretty is GameStop itself. Capitalizing on the sudden renewed interest in Roaring Kitty, it <a href="" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to applewebdata://4A82FE28-2E94-4921-B51B-A12BF4365D1B/its%20largest%20shareholder," rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">flooded the market</a> with 120 million newly minted shares, diluting everyone including CEO Ryan Cohen, its largest shareholder. Thanks to the two issues, cash on hand quadrupled while its balance sheet doubled in size over the span of four short weeks.</p>







<p>The company filled its coffers so full that Andrew Left of Citron Research raised the white flag and exited his short. He argued the company is still a basket case but it could survive alone on the back of its cash pile even if its core business implodes. “With $4 billion in the bank, they have enough runway to appease their cult-like shareholders,” Left’s firm said. </p><p></p>



<p>GameStop could now achieve <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-profits-share-sale-cash-pile-raoaring-kitty-gme-2024-6" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-profits-share-sale-cash-pile-raoaring-kitty-gme-2024-6" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">profitability</a> by simply investing in ultra-safe U.S. Treasuries rather than selling actual video games, making it the equivalent of a Ryan Cohen family office with a captive brick-and-mortar retail business. </p>



<p>Even the company doesn’t seem to have plans about what to do with all the money now in its bank account. The annual shareholder meeting lasted just a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/gme-shares-drop-to-session-lows-after-annual-meeting-fails-to-offer-details-on-firms-strategy.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/gme-shares-drop-to-session-lows-after-annual-meeting-fails-to-offer-details-on-firms-strategy.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">half hour</a> and no questions were taken from investors.</p>



<p>Unless something unexpected happens that can capture people’s imagination and galvanize support, social media will not prove as effective at rallying enough troops to sustain a run in GameStop shares this time around.</p>



<p>“It’s like a sequel with no plot,” says Sosnick.</p>



<p>With Gill seemingly on the sidelines for now, maybe he can loan out Cohen his trusty Magic Eight Ball.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Corporate enthusiasm for Pride Month is waning</strong>: Companies are becoming more cautious about celebrating Pride Month, with some even ending all spending tied to diversity and environmental causes, as seen with Tractor Supply's decision to stop sponsoring Pride festivals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoiding controversy in a presidential election year</strong>: With the 2024 presidential election approaching, companies are hesitant to express strong opinions on controversial issues like LGBTQ+ rights or diversity and inclusion, fearing backlash from conservative customers or being dragged into the "culture wars".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Some companies are scaling back diversity and inclusion efforts</strong>: While it's difficult to track exact numbers, Gravity Research notes that 45% of Fortune 100 companies had taken steps to support LGBTQ+ causes in June, down from previous years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retailer Tractor Supply is a stark example</strong>: Tractor Supply's decision to end all diversity and environmental spending, including stopping Pride festival sponsorships, is an outlier in its magnitude. It's unclear if other companies will follow suit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The corporate world's enthusiasm for Pride Month has cooled</strong>: Traditionally, companies have celebrated Pride Month with rainbow-themed merchandise, ads, and social media posts. However, this year, there's a sense of caution in the air, with some companies opting for a more low-key approach to avoid controversy.</p>

That includes no longer sponsoring Pride festivals, the statement said.</p><p>The move, while an outlier in its magnitude, underscores how some companies that made inclusion commitments in recent years are treading cautiously.</p><p>It is difficult to track how many companies shared supportive messages, donated to LGBTQ+ causes or sold rainbow-themed merchandise in June compared to previous years. According to Gravity Research, a Washington, D.C.-based reputational research firm, 45% of Fortune 100 companies had at least one social media post on LinkedIn or X explicitly related to Pride as of June 21 this year, compared with 51% last June.</p><p>Gravity Research President Luke Hartig said the volatility of the presidential election and the two candidates’ willingness to call out companies by name has also made companies less likely to go public about their stand.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>“There’s a little bit of like, ‘keep our heads down while we go through this election,’” he said.</p><p>Tim Bennett, cofounder of Tribury Productions, a marketing company that specializes in reaching LGBTQ+ Americans, works with Fortune 500 companies, including recent projects with <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-3"><a href="/quotes/PG/">Procter &amp; Gamble.</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> He said more clients have taken “a wait-and-see” approach to marketing to LGBTQ+ consumers or decided to scatter efforts throughout the year instead of making a big splash in a single month.</p><p>“June this year has not been like the last five or six,” Bennett said.</p><p>That may not be a bad thing for LGBTQ+ initiatives and charities. Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of nonprofit advocacy group GLAAD, said she’s seeing more companies get involved with year-round philanthropy and activism in more meaningful ways.</p><p>She also pointed to a survey by Gravity Research that found that 78% of companies did not plan to change their Pride strategy this year. Thirteen percent were unsure whether they’d make changes and 9% said they planned to revise their strategy. Gravity Research surveyed 45 corporate executives and Fortune 500 leaders across industries in April.</p><p>“The visibility of companies putting flags out and having product to celebrate our Pride and to mark a month that’s really significant and important for our community is really important, and I don’t want to ever devalue that,” Ellis said. “I do think, though, those companies must look inside and make sure that they have the policies and the HR practices that match their outward marketing.”</p><p>Major companies are still writing checks for LGBTQ+ causes, too. A GLAAD spokesperson said Friday that the group has not seen donations or corporate support decline this Pride month, though it does not yet have a total tally.</p><p>On Friday, when the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center officially opened its doors to commemorate the New York City bar that was a catalyst in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the event had major backing from the business community.<strong> </strong>Supporters included Google, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Booking.com.</p><p>President Joe Biden also made an appearance and remarks at the monument’s opening.</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107249922" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">Pride Month merchandise is displayed at a Target store on May 31, 2023 in San Francisco, California. </p><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit">Justin Sullivan | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline0"></a>The Bud Light and Target effect</h2><div class="group"><p>Consumer staples brands were the most likely to say they planned to shift their Pride month strategy this year, according to Gravity Research’s survey. That may stem from the conservative<strong> </strong>boycotts of Target and Bud Light last year.</p><p>Target has carried a Pride collection for over a decade. Yet last year, the big-box retailer <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/24/target-pulls-some-pride-collection-items-after-threats-to-employees.html">removed some items and moved displays</a> after employees faced threats.

Ron DeSantis called for a boycott of the beer and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, after Bud Light sent personalized cans of its beer to transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The marketing campaign coincided with the March Madness college basketball tournament.</p><p>Bud Light sales tumbled around 25%, and the brand lost its spot as the best-selling beer in the U.S., ceding the position it held for more than two decades to Constellation Brands’ Modelo.</p><p>AB InBev distanced itself from Mulvaney and fired Bud Light’s vice president of marketing. In October, AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the brand would focus its marketing more on events like sports games and concerts. It also returned as the official sponsor of the UFC.</p><p>In recent months, some consumers have returned to Bud Light, as RBC Europe analysts estimate that the brand’s U.S. volume is down only about 10% these days. For its part, Bud Light hasn’t posted in support of Pride month on its Instagram or X pages this year.</p><p>The boycott was unusually sticky for a few reasons, according to Neil Reid, a geography professor at the University of Toledo who researches the beer industry. Studies have shown that consumers’ loyalty to top-selling beers may be more tied to the brand than the taste, Reid said.</p><p>Right-wing news outlets like Fox News also devoted plenty of airtime to the controversy, stretching its duration and potentially reaching new consumers who missed the initial reaction. Plus, once Bud Light sales fell, retailers gave more shelf space to its rivals.</p><p>“You can look at this issue from a moral, ethical perspective or you can also look at it from a pure business perspective. Those two often don’t result in the same strategy,” Reid said.</p></div><div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107388942" data-test="InlineImage"><div class="InlineImage-wrapper"><div><p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption">The New York Stock Exchange welcomes e.l.f.

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>Share prices of <strong>Rivian</strong> <span class="ticker">(NASDAQ: RIVN)</span> surged higher after the maker of electric vehicles (EV) received a sizeable investment from German automaker <strong>Volkswagen</strong> <span class="ticker">(OTC: VWAGY)</span>. Despite the recent price gains, the stock is still down nearly 43% in 2024.</p><p>Let's look at the importance of this investment, how it could help Rivian, and if it is too late to buy the stock.</p><h2>Volkswagen investment</h2><p>Volkswagen announced it will invest up to $5 billion in Rivian over three years as well as form a 50/50 joint venture (JV) between the companies. Volkswagen will initially invest $1 billion in the company in the form of a convertible note, which will convert to Rivian shares once it receives regulatory approvals, but not before Dec. 1, 2024.</p><p>If the JV is approved, the German automaker would look to invest another $4 billion into Rivian or the JV by 2026, including another $1 billion this year upon the implementation of the JV. The purpose of the JV will be to develop next-generation electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture for EVs.</p><p>For the JV, Rivian will contribute its expertise in the field of electronic architecture for software-defined vehicles and the associated IP via a fully paid-up license. The formation of the JV will also allow Volkswagen to use Rivian's current electronic architecture in its own vehicles, which includes its new zonal hardware design.</p><p>For Volkswagen, the deal brings with it immediate access to much-needed technology to develop its next generation of EVs. Rivian is one of the few non-Chinese automakers outside of <strong>Tesla</strong> so far to develop zonal architecture.</p><p>For Rivian, meanwhile, this is a huge cash infusion that will allow the company to continue to scale its business. Along with the current $7.9 billion in cash on its balance sheet, this should give Rivian ample room to ramp up production of its lower-priced R2 SUV models at its Illinois plant, as well as build out its planned $5 billion manufacturing campus in Georgia, which it temporarily paused construction on earlier this year.</p><p>Volkswagen will also lend some of its manufacturing expertise, which can help Rivian continue to cut manufacturing costs. Rivian has done a great job creating popular luxury electric SUVs, but it has not been able to sell them for a profit, losing money on each vehicle it sells. At its investor day following the Volkswagen announcement, the company spent much of its time discussing reducing the costs of its vehicles so it could obtain a positive <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/g/gross-margin/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=c7d6bb89-2f3c-486d-bd18-616b8c562fe4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gross margin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="14">gross margin</a>.</p><p>The company reiterated its forecast to be near a positive gross margin in the fourth quarter, and it set a long-term target of a 25% gross margin. It is also looking for a 10% free cash flow margin and a high-teens adjusted profit margin over the long term.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="15"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">Image source: Getty Images.</figcaption></p></figure><h2>Is it too late to buy the stock?</h2><p>The Volkswagen investment, if the JV is approved, should give Rivian the cash it needs to scale its business and make it viable. Negative gross margins and cash flow have been its biggest issues, but the company has made aggressive steps to reduce the cost of its vehicles and improve its manufacturing process.</p><p>The development of its zonal architecture, meanwhile, has not only greatly improved the cost structure of its vehicles, but has also proven to be a highly valuable technology that Volkswagen was willing to pay a lot of money to get access to for use in its vehicles.</p><p>The deal now gives Rivian two very large powerful investors and partners in Volkswagen and <strong>Amazon</strong>, for whom it has a deal in place to make Amazon's electric van fleet.</p><p>Rivian remains a high-risk/high-reward stock given its early-stage nature and still negative gross margin. However, the deal with Volkswagen helped remove a lot of the liquidity risk associated with the company. As such, the stock looks more attractive from a risk-reward basis after its recent run-up than before the deal.</p><h2>Should you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?</h2><p>Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:</p><p>The <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the <strong><a href="https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=8a3e6da0-fdf5-4690-97f3-549d3077764d&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-foolcom-sa-bbn-dyn%3Faid%3D8867%26amp%253Bsource%3Disaeditxt0010895%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D13885&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=c7d6bb89-2f3c-486d-bd18-616b8c562fe4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 best stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

<p>Spot lumber prices have plummeted 75% from their May 2021 record high of $1,514 per thousand board feet to just $366 this week, roughly matching pre-pandemic levels, according to Random Lengths’ Framing Lumber Composite Price Index. Lumber’s price drop has been particularly dramatic in just the last 90 days in the futures market, with contract prices for July falling 28% to $466 per thousand board feet (futures prices are around $100 above spot prices due to a delivery fee).</p>



<p>Industry experts blame the record <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/20/housing-affordability-crisis-long-plagued-renters-coming-for-homeowners/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/20/housing-affordability-crisis-long-plagued-renters-coming-for-homeowners/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">drop</a> in U.S. housing affordability and a slowdown in home renovations for quashing lumber demand. It’s just too expensive for consumers to buy new homes or renovate their current ones. That’s led to fewer construction projects, and slowing lumber sales. Meanwhile, overly optimistic industry demand forecasts amid hopes for plunging interest rates and rising home sales have led lumber mills to increase supply at the worst possible moment. </p>



<p>Put it all together and “it’s an ugly scenario” for the lumber market, Ashley Boeckholt, director of lumber and risk management at Sitka Forest Products USA, told <em>Fortune</em>. “We’re kind of having a hangover from a great three years.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"></p></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The demand side: A record deterioration in housing affordability and a renovation slowdown</h2>



<p>The factors behind lumber’s price moves are varied and complex, but, as always, it all comes down to supply and demand. On the demand side, sky-high home prices and elevated mortgage rates have led to a record drop in U.S. housing affordability over the past few years. The Atlanta Federal Reserve’s Home Ownership Affordability Monitor (HOAM) Index is now at its <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/center-for-housing-and-policy/data-and-tools/home-ownership-affordability-monitor" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.atlantafed.org/center-for-housing-and-policy/data-and-tools/home-ownership-affordability-monitor" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">lowest level</a> since before the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.</p><p></p>



<p>As a result, even with an ongoing housing <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/11/root-cause-housing-affordability-crisis-crunch/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/08/11/root-cause-housing-affordability-crisis-crunch/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">shortage</a>, demand for new homes has remained subdued, leading to similarly weak demand for lumber to build them. “Housing affordability is just really offsides right now,” Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist who leads Fastmarkets’ Wood Products team, told <em>Fortune</em>. “It's one of the least affordable times to buy a house in decades and the pool of qualified buyers is starting to kind of dwindle a bit, too. So high interest rates eventually do start to bite.”</p>



<p>Weak demand for new homes led home builder confidence to drop to a five-month low last month, and housing starts fell 19% from a year ago. Most of that drop was the result of the 52% year-over-year <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lance-lambert-0bb5b677_single-family-housing-starts-are-down-2-activity-7209717907713396736-kQGO/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lance-lambert-0bb5b677_single-family-housing-starts-are-down-2-activity-7209717907713396736-kQGO/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">plunge</a> in multi-family housing starts. For a while, steady single-family home starts kept lumber prices from dropping significantly, because single-family homes use more wood than multi-family projects. But now that trend has flipped as well, with single-family housing starts down 2% year-over-year in May.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"></p></figure>



<p>What’s more, the critical home-renovation market, which boomed during the pandemic helping to lift lumber prices, is also showing signs of weakness. HomeDepot saw its U.S. comparable sales sink 3.2% in the first quarter, for example. One of the reasons for the drop was “softer engagement in larger discretionary projects…such as kitchen and bath remodels,” Billy Bastek, the retailer’s executive vice president of merchandising, noted on its May earnings call.</p>



<p>Boeckholt, a veteran lumber trader who also hosts the weekly “<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-lumber-word/id1701995783" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-lumber-word/id1701995783" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Lumber Word</a>” podcast, said he is seeing evidence of declining lumber demand from retail buyers as well. Traders like him are starting to receive “premium” lumber that is typically reserved for the Home Depots and Lowes of the world. “That generally means there's pushback” from retail buyers at home goods centers, he noted.</p>



<p>This home renovation slowdown, when combined with the U.S.’ long-running housing affordability challenges, has led to a serious lack of demand for wood products, particularly when compared to what was forecast just a year ago.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The supply-side: A hope-driven ‘bullwhip’ effect</h2>



<p>While the demand side of the lumber market is ailing, the supply side may be in an even worse position. After lumber prices surged in 2021 and 2022, the lumber industry responded by investing to increase production. Many lumber veterans saw a long-term opportunity for increased demand for their products due to the housing shortage; and like many Americans, they also anticipated imminent interest-rate cuts which tend to drive more near-term lumber demand.</p><p></p>



<p>The only issue with this plan, as Fastmarkets’ Jalbert explained, is that it takes years to create new sawmills and increase lumber supply. This means that a lot of the new lumber supply that was commissioned during the pandemic is just now coming to market—at a time when added supply is the last thing the industry needs. </p>



<p>“It's a classic bullwhip,” Jalbert noted. “The supply side [responds] in a like manner to demand, and by the time it comes to the market that demand picture is already changed—and in this case in a negative way.”</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>Boeckholt backed up Jalbet’s argument, saying it’s an example of the “hangover” the lumber market is experiencing after its highly profitable pandemic years led to too much “hope” for more demand. That’s especially true “down in the southern U.S., where there have been mills in a pipeline to build for three or four years that have finally been coming on over the last year,” he said, adding that there was also a lot of investment into older mills to increase production in many regions nationwide.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect from lumber prices through year-end 2024</h2>



<p>When it comes to what to expect for the rest of this year, Boeckholt warned that lumber prices may languish near their current, pre-pandemic levels, with the potential for a minor—roughly $50—price increase in the fourth quarter. “There was a lot of hope out there, so when we wash all that hope out—which we will, eventually—that's when we'll bottom,” he said. </p>



<p>Jalbert also believes lumber prices will likely stagnate through year-end 2024, but in 2025, he argues things could turn around. Some sawmills will be forced to slow or shut down production due to depressed lumber prices in the second half of this year, lowering lumber supply—“the bullwhip in the opposite direction.” </p><p></p>



<p>That, coupled with interest rate cuts that could stoke lumber demand, will likely lead lumber futures prices to a range between $500 and $600, or slightly above pre-pandemic levels, according to Jalbert. “Supply is going to be cut and demand will recover,” he said. “But that's going to take time.”</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the Fortune Next to Lead newsletter to get weekly strategies on how to make it to the corner office. </p><a href="https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p>.</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Stock futures rise ahead of second half of 2024</strong>: Stock futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq-100 indexes all rose in overnight trading, suggesting a positive start to the week ahead of the second half of 2024.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Dow Jones futures up 55 points, 0.1%</strong>: Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 55 points, or 0.1%, in overnight trading, indicating a modest increase in the opening bell on Monday.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Market off a losing session</strong>: The recent trading session saw the major averages suffer a losing day, with the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both falling. This suggests that investors are looking to bounce back in the second half of the year.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Crypto platforms must report transactions to the IRS</strong>: Starting in 2026, crypto platforms that hold assets (such as Coinbase) will need to provide a standard 1099 form to individual investors and to the government, similar to banks and traditional brokerages.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralized platforms are exempt</strong>: Decentralized platforms that don't take possession of customer assets will be exempt from these reporting requirements, after lobbying from the crypto industry.</li>
<li><strong>Gains from selling crypto are taxable</strong>: The IRS has long deemed gains from selling crypto and other digital assets as taxable, but there was no standardization around how those gains were reported to individual investors and to the government.</li>
<li><strong>IRS aims to crack down on tax evasion</strong>: The new regulations are intended to crack down on tax evasion and improve detection of noncompliance in the high-risk space of digital assets.</li>

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Crypto platforms will need to report transactions to the Internal Revenue Service, starting in 2026. However, decentralized platforms that don’t hold assets themselves will be exempt.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Those are the main takeaways from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-14004/gross-proceeds-and-basis-reporting-by-brokers-and-determination-of-amount-realized-and-basis-for">new regulations</a> that the IRS and U.S. Department of Treasury finalized Friday — essentially implementing a provision of the Biden Administration’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was passed in 2021.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Gains from selling crypto and other digital assets are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/14/irs-fud-what-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-taxes/">taxable</a> even without these new regulations; however, there was no real standardization around how those gains were reported to individual investors and to the government. Beginning in 2026 (covering transactions in 2025), crypto platforms must provide a standard 1099 form, similar to the ones sent by banks and traditional brokerages.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Beyond making it simpler to pay taxes on crypto, the IRS also said it’s trying to crack down on tax evasion.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“We need to make sure digital assets are not used to hide taxable income, and these final regulations will improve detection of noncompliance in the high-risk space of digital assets,” said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-irs-issue-final-regulations-requiring-broker-reporting-of-sales-and-exchanges-of-digital-assets-that-are-subject-to-tax-under-current-law-additional-guidance-to-provide-penalty-relief-address">a statement</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But again, these regulations apply to “custodial” platforms (such as Coinbase) that actually take possession of customer assets. After lobbying from the crypto industry, decentralized brokers that don’t take possession are excluded from these rules. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In fact, the Blockchain Association (an industry lobbying group) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theblockchainassociation.org/blockchainassociation-statement-on-irs-broker-rule/">called the exclusion</a> “a testament to the incredibly powerful voice of our industry and community.”</p>
<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">
</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Treasury Department and IRS said they will cover these decentralized brokers in a separate set of regulations.</p>

                    A series of upcoming economic reports and Congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could jolt U.S. government bonds out of a narrow trading range.
</p><p>Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasuries, which move inversely to bond prices, have bounced between about 4.20% and 4.35% since mid-June, as the market digested data showing slowing inflation and signs of cooling economic growth in some indicators. The 10-year yield stood at 4.33% on Friday.</p>

<p>So far, the economic numbers have failed to dispel doubts over how deeply the Fed will be able to cut interest rates this year, keeping Treasury yields range-bound. But next week's U.S. employment data, followed by inflation numbers and Powell's appearance could change that outlook.</p>

<p>"The market has settled into a narrative that we may see incremental softness but not a growth scare," said Garrett Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. "That will continue to keep us in this range, but the one thing that will push it meaningfully lower is an increase in the unemployment rate."</p>

<p>U.S. monthly inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was unchanged in May, a report released on Friday showed, advancing the narrative of slowing inflation and resilient growth that has tamped down bond market gyrations and buoyed stocks in recent weeks. Yet futures linked to the fed funds rate showed traders pricing in just under 50 basis points of rate cuts for the year.</p>

<p>Market reactions to employment data, due next Friday, could be exacerbated by low liquidity during a week when many U.S. bond traders will be on vacation for the July 4th U.S. Independence Day holiday, said Hugh Nickola, head of fixed income at GenTrust.</p>

<p>"The market is waiting for the other shoe to drop."</p>

<p>A recent survey by BofA Global Research showed fund managers the most underweight bonds since November 2022. Some believe that means yields could fall further if weakening data bolsters the case for more rate cuts and spurs increased allocations to fixed income.</p>

<p>Other highlights for the month include consumer price data scheduled for July 11. Powell is scheduled to give his semiannual testimony on monetary policy on July 9 at the Senate Banking Committee, said the office of its chairman, Senator Sherrod Brown, on Monday. If tradition holds, the Fed Chair will deliver the same testimony at the House Financial Services committee the following day.</p>

<p>Some investors are not convinced Treasury yields have much further to fall. Despite its recent cooling, inflation has proven more stubborn than expected this year, forcing the Fed to rein in expectations for how aggressively it can cut rates. A recent unexpected inflationary rebound in Australia underscored how difficult it has been for some central banks to keep consumer prices under control.</p>

<p>At the same time, some investors believe inflation is unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels and the U.S. economic is likely to show a higher level of underlying strength, limiting the longer term downside for bond yields, said Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group.</p>

<p>"The market has become much more acclimated to the idea that when the Fed cuts rates, they won't cut by as much as people surmised a few months ago," Wizman said. "People have adjusted their expectations but there's a limit to how much yields can fall on one month of bad data."</p>

<p>The Fed required the banks to wait until after the market closed Friday to announce any updates, allowing time for each firm, as well as investors, to digest the results. </p><p></p>



<p>This year’s annual exam, a product of the 2008 financial crisis, included banks with at least $100 billion of assets. For the entire group, the so-called common equity tier 1 capital ratio — deemed to be the highest-quality regulatory capital — would bottom out at 9.9% in a “severely adverse” economic scenario, well above the 4.5% minimum requirement. </p>



<p>Even as banks breezed through, the stress tests are still the subject of intense debate among economists and policymakers. Excess volatility in the Fed’s models means that the scenarios and exams should be subject to greater public scrutiny, according to Francisco Covas, head of research at the Bank Policy Institute.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the Fortune Next to Lead newsletter to get weekly strategies on how to make it to the corner office. </p><a href="https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p>.</p></div></div></div>
