<ol>
<li>A recent study found that four cities in California are among the most "impossibly unaffordable" housing markets in the world, with price-to-income ratios above 9, including San Jose, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego.</li>
<li>The study, conducted by Chapman University in California and the Frontier Center for Public Policy in Canada, analyzed 94 markets across 8 countries and found that high housing prices relative to incomes are having a "feudalizing" impact on California, particularly affecting young people, minorities, and immigrants.</li>
<li>The report attributed the high housing prices to "urban containment policies" that restrict sprawl and increase density, resulting in higher land prices and dramatically higher home prices within urban containment boundaries.</li>
<li>The study found that high housing costs have reduced standards of living and increased poverty, posing an existential threat to the middle class, with the report warning that the middle class is "under siege" due to the escalation of land costs.</li>
<li>The report noted that a price-to-income ratio above 3 is deemed unaffordable, and a ratio above 9 is labeled "impossibly unaffordable", with Hong Kong, Sydney, Vancouver, and the four California cities mentioned above being among the worst affected.</li>

    <div><p>There are unaffordable housing markets, and then there are “impossibly unaffordable” markets, four of which are in California, a recent study said.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>The housing crisis represents an obstacle to upward mobility, and the Golden State risks suffering from especially acute stratification, according to the annual <a href="http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Demographia International Housing Affordability</a> report, which was produced by Chapman University in California and the Frontier Center for Public Policy in Canada.</p>



<p>“High housing prices, relative to incomes, are having a distinctly feudalizing impact on our home state of California, where the primary victims are young people, minorities, and immigrants,” wrote Chapman’s Joel Kotkin. “Restrictive housing policies may be packaged as progressive, but in social terms their impact could be better characterized as regressive.”</p>



<p>The report points to “urban containment policies” that are meant to limit sprawl and increase density. Those have resulted in higher land prices, which have translated to dramatically higher home prices, it explained. </p>



<p>The trend toward increasing density was geared toward reducing reliance on cars and freeways, improving gridlock, and making neighborhoods more walkable. But the report said while such policies were well intentioned, they resulted in land prices being eight to 20 times higher in urban containment boundaries than outside of them.</p><p></p>



<p>In determining affordability, the report looked at 94 markets in Australia, Canada, China, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, the U.K., and the U.S., comparing the median home price in each location against the median income. </p>



<p>A price-to-income ratio of 3 and below was deemed affordable, with higher ratios corresponding to worsening levels of unaffordability. A ratio of 9 or above was labeled “impossibly unaffordable.” Of the 11 cities in that category, four of them are in California.</p>



<ol><li>Hong Kong (16.7)</li>



<li>Sydney (13.8)</li>



<li>Vancouver (12.3)</li>



<li>San Jose (11.9)</li>



<li>Los Angeles (10.9)</li>



<li>Honolulu (10.5)</li>



<li>Melbourne (9.8)</li>



<li>San Francisco (9.7)</li>



<li>Adelaide (9.7)</li>



<li>San Diego (9.5)</li>



<li>Toronto (9.3)</li></ol>



<p>The report also warned that the housing crisis poses an existential threat to the middle class, noting that high housing costs have reduced standards of living and increased poverty.</p>



<p>“The middle-class is under siege principally due to the escalation of land costs,” it said. “As land has been rationed in an effort to curb urban sprawl, the excess of demand over supply has driven prices up.”</p>



<p>The report pointed out that all of the “impossibly unaffordable” cities follow urban planning policies favoring more density, and recommended that cities open up the availability of land to reduce housing costs.</p><p></p>



<p>In the U.S. housing market, the worsening affordability problem has been exemplified by the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/housing-market-starter-home-going-extinct-affordability-havens/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/housing-market-starter-home-going-extinct-affordability-havens/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/housing-market-starter-home-going-extinct-affordability-havens/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">disappearance of the $200,000 starter home</a>. That’s left many millennials trying to upgrade to bigger homes to accommodate their growing families out in the cold. </p>

Next year's cost of living adjustment may shrink</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">At the start of 2024, <a href="https://www.fool.com/retirement/2023/10/12/its-official-heres-your-social-security-raise-for/?utm_source=usa-today&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=106c197a-b3f4-4f00-9efb-2f6bfe569f52" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Social Security benefits rose 3.2%.</a> Social Security benefits are eligible for an annual cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to help seniors maintain their buying power in the face of inflation.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Social Security recipients will clearly be in line for a COLA in 2025. But next year's raise may not be as generous as this year's, since the pace of inflation has slowed.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Current estimates are calling for a <a href="https://www.fool.com/retirement/2024/05/28/social-securitys-2025-cola-forecast-just-improved/?utm_source=usa-today&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=106c197a-b3f4-4f00-9efb-2f6bfe569f52" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">2.66% COLA</a>, based on inflation data gathered from the first few months of 2024. However, Social Security COLAs are calculated based on third-quarter inflation data, so any projection that's out there at present is subject to change.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">2. The wage cap for Social Security taxes increased</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Social Security's main source of funding is payroll tax revenue, but it's not a given that workers will pay those taxes on their entire salary. That's because there's a wage cap put in place each year that determines how much income is taxed for Social Security purposes.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In 2024, the wage cap rose to $168,600 but was $160,200 the year before. Next year, the wage cap for Social Security is likely to go up again. But some lawmakers want to see that wage cap rise substantially.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">President Biden has pledged to strengthen Social Security for future retirees, but part of his plan involves <a href="https://www.fool.com/retirement/2024/06/10/joe-biden-wants-to-save-social-security-by-raising/?utm_source=usa-today&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=106c197a-b3f4-4f00-9efb-2f6bfe569f52" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">taxing earnings over $400,000</a> for Social Security purposes. It's not yet clear whether lawmakers will allow that proposal to go through and whether it'll mean that higher earners are eligible for a larger maximum monthly benefit from Social Security due to paying more money into the program.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">3. It's gotten harder to qualify for Social Security</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">To collect Social Security in retirement, you need to earn 40 work credits in your lifetime at a maximum of four credits per year. The value of a work credit rose to $1,730 in 2024, up from $1,640 the previous year.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The fact that the value of work credits is rising isn't so terrible, though. Social Security needs payroll tax revenue to stay afloat, and requiring workers to earn a bit more to be eligible for benefits lends to that goal.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It's natural to assume that Social Security will stay the same from one year to the next, but it's important to keep reading up on the program whether you're a current retiree or new to the labor force. You never know when a given change might impact your finances one way or another.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><em>The Motley Fool has a <a href="https://www.fool.com/legal/fool-disclosure-policy/?utm_source=usa-today&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=106c197a-b3f4-4f00-9efb-2f6bfe569f52" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">disclosure policy</a>.</em></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><em>The Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

<li>The survey, conducted by YouGov in January and February, found that a total of 94,943 adults across 47 countries were surveyed, with respondents citing reasons such as the news being depressing, relentless, and boring as reasons for avoiding it.</li>
<li>Interestingly, the report found that elections have increased interest in the news in a few countries, including the United States, which may be attributed to the usual excitement and interest in presidential elections.</li>
<li>The study's findings suggest that some people are turning away from news due to factors such as the continuous coverage of conflicts, wars, and disasters, which may be overwhelming and depressing for some individuals.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The EU's plan to impose a 50% tax on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) will likely backfire and may lead to retaliation from China, potentially targeting high-end luxury vehicles sold in China.</li>
<li>A tariff war between the EU and China could have severe consequences, including damage to European manufacturers and potentially wiping off billions of Euros from their values.</li>
<li>The EU's protectionist policies may lead to flabby industries that fail to innovate and instead put up prices to milk profits, hindering the development of electric vehicles (EVs) as a new technology.</li>
<li>To drive innovation in EV technology, there needs to be fierce competition between many companies to improve range, battery life, vehicle weight, and price, which may not happen if European manufacturers are protected by tariffs.</li>
<li>The EU's protectionist policies may make European EV manufacturers less competitive globally, as they will not need to innovate to stay ahead in a competitive market.</li>

    <p>We can argue about whether the Chinese cars are subsidised by the state or are simply manufactured more efficiently by companies that have brilliantly mastered the technology in a very short space of time (the truth is probably somewhere between the two).</p><p>And yet leaving that aside, one point is certain: it will stall their advance. It is hard to compete when you face a 50pc tax on each car you sell.</p><p>The trouble is <a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/06/13/why-brussels-war-chinese-electric-car-hurt-bmw-tesla/">the policy is going to backfire spectacularly on the EU</a> and of course on the UK if we are foolish enough to impose similar levies. There are three reasons for that.</p><p>First, anyone who thinks the Chinese will simply shrug their shoulders is simply kidding themselves. It will inevitably mean retaliation. There are already reports that China will respond with tariffs on large-engine imports from the EU, specifically targeting the high-end, luxury vehicles that sell best in that country.</p><p>Given that the EU exports €18bn of vehicles to China every year, and has even more money tied up in local joint-venture operations, that is going to be very painful for European manufacturers.</p><p>Tariffs may well be targeted at other EU goods as well. It is not as if China does not have a robust trade policy or that it is ever slow to defend its industries. In the wake of the announcement, €4.5bn was <a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/06/14/germany-battles-block-eu-clampdown-chinese-evs/">wiped off the value of the major German auto manufacturers</a> as investors braced themselves for the inevitable response.</p><p>With grim inevitability, the EU’s giants will end up paying a high price and will end up locked out of what will soon be the world’s largest market. It is hard to see that as a great victory for anyone.</p><p>Next, the European manufacturers will inevitably grow flabby behind tariff walls. We have a long history of trade wars, tariffs and protectionism to teach us that the result is always the same. The protected industry does not have to compete anymore, it doesn’t bother to innovate and it simply puts up prices to milk easy profits out of customers who no longer have the choice of going elsewhere.</p><p>EVs are still a new technology, and there need to be huge improvements in driving range, battery life, vehicle weight and most of all price if they are to become the standard way of getting around.</p><p>That is only going to happen with ferocious competition between lots of different companies. Once a cosy cartel is established, they will just stagnate. The result? Even if they are protected at home, the European manufacturers will be steadily less competitive on the global market where they can’t hide behind tariff walls.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Federal Reserve has held interest rates at a 23-year high, indicating that rates are likely to stay higher for longer in 2024.</li>
<li>Elevating interest rates can benefit savers, with top yields on savings accounts, money markets, and CDs outpacing the rate of inflation, making them a great place for short-term goals or expenses.</li>
<li>The current rate environment is particularly advantageous for retirees and those nearing retirement, as it offers an opportunity to stockpile cash in low-risk, fixed-income investments such as Treasury securities and CDs.</li>
<li>One way for retirees to take advantage of the high rates is to shave some of the profits from their equity holdings in retirement and non-retirement accounts.</li>
<li>The experts suggest that retirees should prioritize building an emergency fund or setting aside enough cash to cover living expenses for a year or two after retirement.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fed interest rate cut possible in December</strong>: Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari predicts that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates once this year, with a high likelihood of a single cut in December.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation concerns</strong>: Kashkari emphasized the need to see more evidence of a decline in inflation, which is currently at 2.7%, before the Fed considers cutting interest rates. The Fed's target inflation rate is 2%.</li>
<li><strong>Job market performance</strong>: Kashkari has been surprised by the resilience of the US job market, which has continued to perform well despite interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023. He expects modest cooling in the job market ahead.</li>
<li><strong>Housing market concerns</strong>: Kashkari acknowledges that high borrowing costs are a barrier to homebuying, but believes that cutting interest rates to address this issue would only lead to higher housing prices and poor affordability. Instead, he suggests focusing on bringing inflation back down to target.</li>
<li><strong>Patience is key</strong>: Kashkari believes that the Fed can take its time to make decisions, citing the strong position of the economy and the availability of more data on inflation and the labor market before making any rate cut decisions.</li>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>By Ann Saphir</p><p>(Reuters) -Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari on Sunday said it's a "reasonable prediction" that the U.S. central bank will cut interest rates once this year, waiting until December to do it.</p><p>"We need to see more evidence to convince us that inflation is well on our way back down to 2%," Kashkari said in an interview with CBS' "Face the Nation" program.</p><p>The Fed last week held its benchmark policy rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range, where it has been since last July, to keep continued pressure on the economy so as to cool inflation. It also published projections that showed the median forecast from all 19 U.S. central bankers was for a single interest rate cut this year.</p><p>"We're in a very good position right now to take our time, get more inflation data, get more data on the economy, on the labor market, before we have to make any decisions," Kashkari said. "We're in a strong position, but if you just said there's going to be one cut, which is what the median indicated, that would likely be toward the end of the year."</p><p>Kashkari, who has been more cautious about the possibility of easing monetary policy than many of his colleagues, did not say how many rate cuts he personally expects.</p><p>He said he has been surprised by how well the U.S. job market has performed even as the Fed raised borrowing costs aggressively in 2022 and 2023, but that he expects more cooling ahead.</p><p>"I hope it's modest cooling, and then we can get back down to more of a balanced economy," he said.</p><p>Inflation by the Fed's targeted measure, the year-over-year change in the personal consumption expenditures price index, registered 2.7% in April. The Fed has a 2% target.</p><p>The unemployment rate in May ticked up to 4%, the highest since just before the Fed launched its rate hiking campaign in March 2022 but still below what most of its policymakers see as sustainable.</p><p>Asked about the barrier high borrowing costs pose for people trying to buy a home, Kashkari said the best thing the Fed can do for the housing market is to bring inflation back down to target.</p><p>"If we simply cut interest rates to try to support home ownership right now, that would probably push up the price of houses, and it actually wouldn't lead to any better affordability," he said.</p><p>"The best thing we can do is do our job - get inflation back down to our target - and then, hopefully, the supply side of the economy can step in to build the homes that Americans need."</p><p>(Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Paul Simao)</p></div></div>

<p>Be honest: Have you ever carried your own alcohol into a restaurant? What about arguing with the wait staff over prices? If so, you’ve broken some “unwritten rules” of dining out.</p>



<p>But those aren’t even the top two offenses, according to a recent survey conducted by the UK-based <a href="https://today.yougov.com/consumer/articles/49191-what-americans-think-about-restaurant-etiquette">market research firm YouGov</a>. </p>



<p>The company polled more than 1,000 Americans back in April to find out which behaviors from restaurant customers are the most unacceptable.</p>



<p>While many survey respondents were split on certain acts, like making modifications to a menu item, the vast majority agreed on one thing. About 90% said the most annoying thing you can do at a restaurant is refuse to pay for a meal that you ate but didn’t like. </p>





<p>Bryan Hull, a contracts professor at Loyola Law School in California, previously told <a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/article/spending/t050-c032-s014-your-legal-rights-when-restaurant-meal-goes-wrong.html">financial news site Kiplinger</a> that in most cases you’ll be obligated to foot the bill for an unsavory dish that you still scarfed down. However, many restaurants would simply take the meal back to the kitchen and not charge the customer if they didn’t eat it entirely, Hull explained. </p>



<p>Allowing your kids to roam freely around a restaurant is another big no-no when it comes to eating out, said 90% of respondents. Some restaurants have gone as far as banning younger children altogether, such as Nettie’s House of Spaghetti in Tinton Falls, New Jersey. </p>





<p>In February 2023, the Italian eatery made headlines after announcing on social media that it would no longer allow kids under age 10 to dine-in. </p>



<p>“We love kids. We really, truly, do,” Nettie’s post read, <a href="https://www.today.com/food/restaurants/new-jersey-restaurant-netties-not-allowing-children-under-10-rcna70198">according to TODAY</a>. “Between noise levels, lack of space for high chairs, cleaning up crazy messes, and the liability of kids running around the restaurant, we have decided that it’s time to take control of the situation.”</p>





<p>Despite the ban drawing mixed reactions online, it’s still in effect, <a href="https://www.nettiesrestaurant.com/reservations">per Nettie’s website</a>.</p>



<p>Debating menu prices with the staff, staying past the restaurant’s closing time and snapping your fingers to get a waiter’s attention rounded out the top five. </p>
