				<p>The former chairman and CEO of a publicly traded Henderson health-care company has been convicted of insider trading in the first prosecution exclusively using rules limiting the use of certain trading practices.</p>
<p>Terren Scott Peizer, 64, a resident of Puerto Rico and Santa Monica, California, and a former chairman and CEO of Henderson-based Ontrak Inc., was found guilty Friday of one count of <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/henderson-healthcare-ceo-facing-insider-trading-charges-2737992/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">securities fraud</a> and two counts of insider trading.</p>
<p>Peizer is expected to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer on Oct. 21. He faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison on the securities fraud count and up to 20 years in prison on each of the insider trading counts.</p>
<p>According to a company profile, Ontrak operates as an artificial intelligence powered, telehealth-enabled, and virtualized health-care company that provides in-person services to third-party payors in the United States. Its technology-enabled platform predicts people whose chronic disease will improve with behavior change, recommends effective care pathways that people are willing to follow, and engages and guides them to and through the care they need.</p>
<p>“When Terren Peizer learned significant negative news about Ontrak, he set up Rule 10b5-1 trading plans to sell shares before the news became public and to conceal that he was trading on inside information,” Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, said in a release.</p>
<p>“With today’s verdict, the jury convicted Peizer of insider trading. This is the Justice Department’s first insider trading prosecution based exclusively on the use of a trading plan, but it will not be our last. We will not let corporate executives who trade on inside information hide behind trading plans they established in bad faith.”</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Down payments are no longer enough</strong>: A 20% down payment is no longer sufficient for most people to afford monthly payments due to increased home values (45% higher than pre-pandemic levels) and mortgage rates (115% higher).</li>

<li><strong>Variation by market</strong>: The required down payment share varies significantly by market, with some cities (e.g. Los Angeles and San Jose) requiring over 80% down payments, while others (e.g. in New York City) require around 60%.</li>
<li><strong>Housing affordability crisis</strong>: The article highlights the ongoing housing affordability crisis, with many households struggling to afford housing and potentially becoming cost-burdened or severely cost-burdened as a result of increasing home values and mortgage rates.</li>

    <div><p>Thinking about buying a home? You might be in for a rude awakening: a 20% down payment is no longer enough for most people to afford monthly payments—not when home values are 45% higher than before the pandemic, and mortgage payments are roughly 115% higher, according to <a href="https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Zillow</a>. </p><div class="paywall">



<p>“Down payments have always been important, but in the current market, where interest rates remain high and volatile and home values are stable or rising, boosting the amount you put down can make the difference between a home that’s affordable and one that’s not,” Zillow’s chief economist, Skylar Olsen, wrote in <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/down-payment-needed-34176/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.zillow.com/research/down-payment-needed-34176/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">an analysis</a> yesterday. </p>



<p>The analysis, looking at major metropolitan areas, found homebuyers earning the median income need to put down 35.4%, which equates to almost $127,750, to comfortably afford payments on the typical home in America. </p>



<p>Comfortably, in this case, means you’re spending no more than 30% of the typical income in your specific area on housing—so your mortgage payment, property taxes, and insurance. Anyone who spends more than 30% of their income on housing is considered <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/20/housing-affordability-crisis-long-plagued-renters-coming-for-homeowners/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/20/housing-affordability-crisis-long-plagued-renters-coming-for-homeowners/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">cost-burdened</a>, and severely-cost burdened if housing takes up more than half their income. (In May, the value of a typical home was $360,310, and the typical monthly mortgage payment was $1,931, after a 20% down payment, <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/may-2024-market-report-34136/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.zillow.com/research/may-2024-market-report-34136/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">per</a> Zillow). </p>



<p>“In more expensive markets, where home values have long outpaced incomes, middle-income households need an even bigger down payment share on top of the bigger price tag,” Olsen wrote, pointing to some sunny California cities, among others. </p><p></p>



<p>In Los Angeles, for one, a median-income household needs to put down 81.1%, or $780,203, to afford the typical home and its monthly payments; she called that percentage, the highest in the nation, “nearly impossible.” In San Jose, they’d need to put down 80.9%, or more than $1.3 million, “which is more than the typical home is worth in every other major market.” </p>



<p>In New York City, median-income households would need to come up with a more than 60% down payment, in Miami, they’d need to come up with a 64.5% down payment—and the list goes on. </p>



<p>“A median-income household in Seattle—making around $116,000—would need about $462,000 to lower the debt enough to comfortably afford the monthly payment on the typical home, worth almost $753,500,” Olsen wrote. “It would take almost 24 years to build up that kind of savings if that household saved 10% of their income every month into a cash account earning a guaranteed 4% return.”</p>



<p>Olsen continued with another example: “In a more affordable market like Atlanta, a median-income household would need more than $118,000 saved for 30.5% down on the typical home in that market, currently valued at almost $387,500. That would take more than 10 years,” she wrote.</p>



<p>People across the country already struggle to come up with even 20% down. The National Association of Realtors <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/nar-finds-typical-home-buyers-annual-household-income-climbed-to-record-high-of-107000" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/nar-finds-typical-home-buyers-annual-household-income-climbed-to-record-high-of-107000" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">found</a> the typical down payment in the year ending June 2023 was just 8% for first-time buyers and 19% for repeat buyers. And they often rely on outside help: Last year, 43% of buyers used a gift from family or friends for part of their down payment, according to Zillow. A separate Redfin-commissioned <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/03/27/housing-market-nepotism-down-payment-parents-help-gen-z-millennials/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/03/27/housing-market-nepotism-down-payment-parents-help-gen-z-millennials/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">survey</a> found more than a third of millennials and Gen Zers planning to buy a home expect their parents, or family, to help with their down payment.</p><p></p>



<p>There’s only 10 out of 50 major metropolitan areas where a household earning the median income can put less than 20% down and still have an “affordable” payment on the typical home, Zillow found. “Most are in the Midwest, where home values have largely grown at a strong clip in recent years,” Olsen wrote. </p>



<p>Austin, Jacksonville, Charlotte, and Raleigh are others where a median-income household can put 20% down. “The relative affordability of these markets is a big reason why many of them were boom markets during the pandemic, and likely will be into the future,” she wrote. If so, they may not be considered affordable for much longer. </p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the Fortune Next to Lead newsletter to get weekly strategies on how to make it to the corner office. </p><a href="https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/newsletters/next-to-lead?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=next_to_lead" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p> before it launches on June 24, 2024.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>A classic Edwardian-style home in San Francisco's Russian Hill neighborhood is being sold for $488,000, despite having a market value of $1.8 million.</li>
<li>The home is being sold "as-is" by Todd Lee, the current owner, who is Sandra Lee's son and the tenant's landlord. This means that whoever buys the home will become Sandra's landlord.</li>
<li>The homeownership dispute stems from a family feud over property rights and money. Sandra Lee, the current tenant, is 83 years old and lived in the home with her late parents, who bought it in the 1970s for $52,000.</li>
<li>Sandra's parents, Florence and Kenneth Goo, passed away in the home in 2006 and 2018. Sandra's son, Todd, is now selling the home as a result of their deaths and the subsequent disputes over property distribution.</li>
<li>Sandra Lee expressed feelings of loss and destruction, stating "We had a large family. Now we're destroyed." implying that the family's dynamics have been significantly disrupted following the deaths of her parents.</li>

Schaben | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>At the ICR conference in January, Authentic Brands CEO Jamie Salter said acquiring Forever 21 was “probably the biggest mistake” of his career, adding he also erred when he failed to recognize the competitive threat posed by Shein and Temu earlier. </p><p>He recalled a conversation he had with Simon’s CEO David Simon, who asked Salter why he wanted to partner with Shein. </p><p>“I said, ‘David, it’s the right decision, we cannot beat them. Their supply chain is too good. They know what’s going on. They’ve figured this out. We need to partner with them,’” Salter said. “So I was the brave one that said, ‘Let’s go partner with these guys.’”</p><p>As part of the two retailers’ partnership, Shein will design, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/27/shein-to-sell-co-branded-forever-21-clothes-online.html">manufacture and distribute</a> a line of co-branded Forever 21 apparel and accessories that will be sold primarily on Shein’s website. Forever 21 has also hosted Shein pop-up stores and begun accepting Shein returns, both of which have driven positive foot traffic to Forever 21′s shops, one of the people said. </p><p>The two <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/24/shein-strikes-deal-with-fast-fashion-retailer-forever-21.html">originally linked up</a> last August and under the terms of the agreement, Shein acquired about one-third of Sparc while Sparc took a minority stake in Shein. </p><p>Given the concerns that Forever 21 is having with its leases, and the success of Shein’s pop-up shops, some industry observers questioned whether the digital giant could soon take over Forever 21′s stores. However, one of the people said that’s unlikely because the retailer lacks experience in physical retail and its business model involves small-batch production and an inventory that constantly shifts based on trends.</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Don’t miss these from CNBC PRO</h2></div></div></div></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

<li><strong>Share price crashes</strong>: Trump Media, a company owned by former President Donald Trump, saw its share price crash after his felony conviction on May 30, and the situation worsened with a recent move to dilute existing shares.</li>
<li><strong>Dilution of shares</strong>: As a result of the SEC's approval, Trump Media created and sold over 14 million new shares, diluting existing investors' holdings and sending the stock price tumbling. The share price fell from over $50 to around $25.</li>
<li><strong>Plan to use new cash</strong>: The company plans to use the approximately $250 million raised from the sale of new shares to grow its holdings, develop its platform, and explore mergers and acquisitions.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Trump's net worth</strong>: As the largest individual investor in Trump Media, Trump's wealth is closely tied to the company's performance. The share price decline has likely had a significant impact on his net worth, which is estimated to be over half comprised of his Trump Media stake.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns about company's legitimacy</strong>: Trump Media has been criticized for its association with a fraudster accounting firm and allegations that it serves as a cash-funneling service for Trump's allies, further eroding investors' trust and confidence in the company.</li>

								<p>The former president’s media company has seen a share price crash following his May 30 felony conviction for falsifying business records to hide hush money payments, but a recent move to dilute existing shares plunged the stock even lower.</p>
<p>A poisonous message to existing investors in a <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2660/0001140361-24-030534.htm" target="_blank">Tuesday filing</a>, that the SEC had green-lit the firm to create and sell more than 14 million new shares, sent the price tumbling.</p>
<p>The Truth Social parent company went public in March, revealing its 2023 revenue of $4.1 million and losses of $58.2 million, climbing to a peak valuation of over $66 per share that month. </p>
<p>Shares were trading well over $50 in the days leading up to the verdict before 12 jurors found Trump guilty on all 34 counts of the charges stemming from his attempts to cover up an affair. Losing nearly a third of its valuation, Trump Media pushed forward on its April plan to print more shares.</p>
<p>Today, shares sit at just over $25, down over 25% since Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>The move, which diluted existing investors’ holdings in the company, enables the organization to collect, per their estimate, just under $250 million from stock sales. Trump Media plans to use that new cash to grow its holdings, it says.</p>
<p>“With our S-1 declared effective, we’re expecting to be well positioned to energetically pursue TV streaming, other enhancements to the platform, and potential mergers and acquisitions,” Trump Media <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/04/19/media-ceo-devin-nunes-blasted-by-megadonors-hedge-fund/">CEO Devin Nunes</a> wrote in an announcement.</p>
<p>Trump Media has been closely tied to the former president’s net worth, with the $3-6 billion stake reportedly making up over half of his wealth. As the largest individual investor in the group, he is <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/03/22/cashes-in-on-truth-social-meme-stock--but-cant-use-the-money-to-pay-454-million-penalty/" target="_blank">especially sensitive</a> to price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Trump Media, and Trump’s holding in it, were mired in speculation from the group’s start, holding associations with a <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/05/03/media-audit-firm-charged-with-fraud/">fraudster accounting firm</a> and bucking charges that it serves merely as a cash-funneling service for the former president’s allies.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rise in falsified semaglutide globally</strong>: The WHO has reported that instances of falsified semaglutide have been increasing globally for the past two years, coinciding with increased demand for medicines like Ozempic and Wegovy, which contain semaglutide as their active ingredient.</p>

Derivatives are Wall Street contracts tied to stocks, bonds, currencies or interest rates.</p><p>For example, when asked to quickly test Citigroup’s ability to unwind its contracts using different inputs than those chosen by the bank, the firm came up short, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621a3.pdf" target="_blank">according</a> to the regulators.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sarepta Therapeutics gets FDA approval</strong>: The company's Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, Elevidys, has been expanded in approval by the FDA, allowing it to be sold almost without restrictions.</li>
<li><strong>Company is "unshackled"</strong>: With the broad approval, Sarepta has gained the freedom to sell its gene therapy without many restrictions, with the potential to reach peak US sales of $2-3 billion.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty about benefits for Duchenne patients</strong>: While the expanded approval is a positive development, it is unclear whether the drug will benefit boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</li>
<li><strong>FDA decision raises questions</strong>: Peter Marks, the FDA's top regulator of gene therapies, made the decision to expand the approval without consulting FDA staff, leading to questions about the transparency and accountability of the process.</li>

	<p><span class="big-cap-wrap"><span class="big-cap">S</span></span>arepta Therapeutics always wins. That was a given, even before the Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/20/fda-sarepta-gene-therapy-elevidys-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy/">expanded approval</a> of the company’s Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug on Thursday. Will boys with Duchenne also benefit? I hope they do, but it’s uncertain. And is this a good look for the FDA? No, it is not.</p>
<p>There is much to unpack from the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/20/sarepta-duchenne-elevidys-fda-approval-peter-marks-overruled-staff/">unilateral decision</a> by Peter Marks, the FDA’s top regulator of gene therapies, to expand the use of Sarepta’s Elevidys to nearly all Duchenne patients. Some thoughts:</p>
<p>Sarepta is unshackled. The broad approval — its best-case scenario — gives the company freedom to sell its gene therapy almost without restrictions. Manufacturing capacity — and how fast it can be upgraded — might be one of the only brakes right now on Sarepta’s effort to hit peak U.S. sales of $2-3 billion.</p>

<li><strong>Nvidia's stock price volatility</strong>: Nvidia's stock price has been on a wild ride, reversing direction from all-time highs and sparking debate among analysts about how much more the company can add to its record-setting rally.</li>

<li><strong>Competition and profitability concerns</strong>: Moor Insights &amp; Strategy founder Patrick Moorhead warned that increased competition and decreased downstream profitability could be a headwind to Nvidia's pricing power. He noted that if software companies like Adobe and Salesforce aren't making more money from AI features, it could hurt Nvidia's business.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia's market capitalization</strong>: Nvidia's market capitalization briefly surpassed $3.12 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world, but it has since fallen slightly below Microsoft's $3.33 trillion market cap.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of a pullback</strong>: Moorhead cautioned investors to be watchful for signs of a pullback, especially if software companies aren't generating more revenue from AI features.</li>

As such, the company has access to massive amounts of health information on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/01/united-healthcare-ceo-says-maybe-a-third-of-u-s-citizens-were-affected-by-recent-hack/">about a third of all Americans</a>. </p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The cyberattack <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/21/change-healthcare-cyberattack/">prompted the company to shut down its systems</a>, resulting in outages and delays to thousands of healthcare providers who rely on Change, and affecting countless patients who could not obtain prescriptions or had medical care or procedures delayed. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Change said in its latest statement that it “cannot confirm exactly” what data was stolen about each individual, and that the information may vary from person to person. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The affected information includes personal information, such as names and addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers and email addresses, as well as government identity documents, such as Social Security numbers, driver licenses and passport numbers.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The data also includes medical records and health information, such as diagnoses, medications, test results, imaging and care and treatment plans, said Change. The hackers stole health insurance information, including plan and policy details, as well as billing, claims and payment information, which Change said includes financial and banking information. </p>

	
	

<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">
</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Change said it was still in the “late stages” of its review of the stolen data to determine what was taken and that more affected individuals may be identified. Some of the stolen information may relate to guarantors who paid healthcare bills for someone else, the company said.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company added that affected individuals should receive notice by mail beginning late July.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The ransomware attack on Change Healthcare stands as one of the largest-ever known digital thefts of U.S. medical records. While the full impact of this data breach remains unclear, the ramifications for the millions of Americans whose private medical information was irretrievably compromised are likely incalculable.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Change said it secured a copy of the stolen dataset in March to review for identifying and notifying affected individuals, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/change-healthcare-stolen-patient-data-ransomhub-leak/">TechCrunch previously reported was obtained in exchange for paying a ransom demand</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/unitedhealth-change-healthcare-hackers-substantial-proportion-americans/">UnitedHealth confirmed it paid at least one ransom demand</a> to the cybercriminal group behind the ransomware attack, known as ALPHV, in an effort to prevent the publication of the stolen files. Another hacking group called RansomHub demanded an additional payment from UnitedHealth after claiming ALPHV made off with the first ransom payment but left the stolen data with one of its affiliates — essentially a contractor — who broke in and deployed the ransomware on Change’s systems.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">RansomHub <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/change-healthcare-stolen-patient-data-ransomhub-leak/">subsequently published several files on its dark web leak site</a> and threatened to sell the data to the highest bidder if another ransom wasn’t paid. </p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">According to UnitedHealth chief executive Andrew Witty, the hackers broke into Change Healthcare’s network using a set of stolen credentials to an internal system that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/30/uhg-change-healthcare-ransomware-compromised-credentials-mfa/">not protected with multi-factor authentication</a>, a security feature that makes it more difficult for malicious hackers to misuse stolen passwords.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The ransomware attack cost UnitedHealth around $870 million in the first three months of the year, during which the company made $100 billion in revenue, according to the company’s earnings report. UnitedHealth is expected to report its most recent earnings in mid-July.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Apple won't release new features in EU due to regulatory concerns</strong>: Apple has announced that it won't be releasing three new features, including its flagship "Apple Intelligence" AI product, in the European Union (EU) in 2024 due to "regulatory uncertainties" related to the EU's Digital Markets Act antitrust regulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Concerns over compromising product integrity</strong>: Apple believes that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force the company to compromise the integrity of its products, risking user privacy and data security, which is why it has decided not to release the features in the EU.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EU passed the Digital Markets Act in 2023</strong>: The Digital Markets Act was passed in 2023 in response to concerns that a handful of major technology companies, including Apple, were dominating the market and limiting competition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Features to be impacted include Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring, and SharePlay enhancements</strong>: The three features that will not be available to EU customers include Apple Intelligence, a new AI product, iPhone Mirroring, and enhancements to SharePlay, a screen-sharing product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other tech companies may also be affected by the Digital Markets Act</strong>: The Digital Markets Act is intended to promote competition and prevent dominant companies from exploiting their market position. It's likely that other major tech companies, such as Amazon and Alphabet, may also be impacted by the regulation.</p>

Their longstanding success and deep commitment to providing high-quality care to North Carolina communities make them an ideal fit to become a part of Risant Health.

<p></p>

<p>“Becoming part of Risant Health presents a unique opportunity to shape the future of health care in the Triad, the state, and across the nation,” said Cone Health president and CEO, Dr. Mary Jo Cagle. “As part of Risant Health, Cone Health will build upon its long track record of success making evidence-based health care more accessible and affordable for more people. The people across the Triad will be among the first to benefit,” she said.</p>
