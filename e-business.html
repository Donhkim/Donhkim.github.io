Many major firms rely on a third-party appraiser to determine the worth of a fund’s assets, in part so investors can trust that the appraised value is accurate and not unduly influenced by the firms.

(Third-party appraisers often use delayed data.)</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Blackstone also says that its portfolio of real estate assets is of a higher quality than its competitors, and includes high-growth sectors such as data centers and student housing.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">To underscore that point, Blackstone noted that it had sold assets for higher values, including stakes in two Las Vegas casinos, self-storage warehouses and most recently <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-25/blackstone-strikes-1-6-billion-student-housing-deal-with-kkr" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">student housing</a> — all <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.ft.com/content/e6f2e31f-265e-4145-9689-93048e5a440d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at a profit</a>.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The fund also hasn’t meaningfully sold assets in the biggest part of its portfolio, apartment buildings and industrial facilities, according to Matthew Werner, a managing director of REIT strategies at Chilton Capital Management, an asset management firm.

<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p>“I’ve started selling tradelines on my credit cards,” Smith says in the video that has since garnered millions of views across the social mediasphere. “Essentially what this is, is if a person has bad credit, but they know that they need to get a mortgage or a car loan or something, they pay money to this website,” she says, referring to Tradeline Supply Company, a San Diego based broker. “This website matches them up with me based on what they’re looking for and I add them as an authorized user to my credit card.”</p>

<p>A tradeline, for the uninitiated, is what the credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) call each credit card account listed on an individual’s credit history report. Algorithms turn the information in credit reports into a credit score–most often a FICO score ranging from 300 to 850.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>

<p class="article_paragraph_7"></p><p>Incredibly, individuals like Smith with strong credit histories, can make money by adding total strangers as authorized users on their credit cards. These buyers don’t actually gain access to the card; instead, they get a tradeline, paying for the benefit of the card’s favorable characteristics—its long account history, high credit limits and impeccable on-time payment record—to appear on their own credit reports. The richer the card’s history and the larger its credit line, the higher the fee it commands. After a few months, the seller removes the buyer from the card and opens up the spot for the next customer to piggyback off their sterling credit profile.</p>

<p>On Tradeline Supply’s website recently a three-year-old Capital One card with a $5,000 limit was listed at $322. Meanwhile, a 19-year-old Chase card with a $69,700 limit was priced at $1,955–almost as much as the average American<a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cesan.nr0.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cesan.nr0.htm" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cesan.nr0.htm" aria-label="household spends on housing"> household spends on housing</a> each month.</p>
<p>There appears to be quite a big mark-up involved. Social influencer Smith says she earned $40 from a sale that Tradeline Supply priced at $275. Darren Iba, Tradeline Supply’s chief operations officer, wouldn’t discuss the company’s revenue or mark-ups, but did take pains to point out that the company isn’t promising buyers results. “Many consumers make the mistake of thinking that tradelines arbitrarily boost credit scores, however, this is not necessarily true,” he says. (Two other tradeline selling sites, competitors Boost Credit 101 and Superior Tradelines, didn’t respond to requests for comment.)</p>
<p>Despite Iba’s disclaimer, tradeline buyers obviously believe it’s a quick and effective way to hack their credit scores, getting a temporary boost that might qualify them for credit lines and loans–or for lower rates–than they could get otherwise. And there’s some evidence it can work.</p>
<p>There are also plenty of critics. “I don’t think this is a good idea for buyers or sellers,” says Beverly Harzog, a credit card expert and the host of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_FjKfxQsNTF1Fvie1VGVRQmu8Rl8jL-y" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_FjKfxQsNTF1Fvie1VGVRQmu8Rl8jL-y" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_FjKfxQsNTF1Fvie1VGVRQmu8Rl8jL-y" aria-label="“Your Personal Economy”">“Your Personal Economy”</a> podcast. “It’s not technically illegal, but whenever you have to say that something isn’t technically illegal, there’s something else wrong with it. There’s a lot of risk involved, you could break the terms and conditions of your credit card, you could be helping someone commit fraud.”</p>
<p>For sellers, the main risk is getting their card canceled if the issuer catches wind of the tradeline selling. Then there's the slim chance, albeit a scary one, that a buyer might finagle their way into actually charging purchases on the account, even without a physical card. They could, in theory, pull some tricks using the details that pop up on their credit report. Online chatter suggests it's unlikely, but Smith admits you probably wouldn't hear someone confess they got duped like that. Plus, as Harzog points out, by selling tradelines, sellers might unwittingly be giving a leg up to fraudsters.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/are-buying-tradelines-legal/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/are-buying-tradelines-legal/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/are-buying-tradelines-legal/" aria-label="blog">blog</a> post on Experian’s site suggests tradeline buyers could be at risk of becoming victims of identity theft if the personal information (including Social Security number) they provide to get added as an authorized user is misused. The post also raises the specter that a tradeline buyer applying for a loan or credit card with an artificially boosted score could be in danger “of committing bank fraud,” by falsely representing their creditworthiness to lenders.</p>
<p>There’s also the matter of out and out fraud. Back in 2013, the <a href="https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/newark/press-releases/2013/eighteen-people-charged-in-international-200-million-credit-card-fraud-scam" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/newark/press-releases/2013/eighteen-people-charged-in-international-200-million-credit-card-fraud-scam" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/newark/press-releases/2013/eighteen-people-charged-in-international-200-million-credit-card-fraud-scam" aria-label="FBI">FBI</a> busted a huge credit card fraud ring, arresting 13 people across four states as part of a $200 million scam, one of the largest of its kind at the time. The crooks used authorized user tradelines to pump up the credit limits on credit cards tied to fake IDs, then went on a shopping spree, splurging on fancy cars, designer clothes, electronics, and gold. Agents even found a stash of $70,000 in cash in one suspect's oven. They tracked down about $60 million sent off to places like Pakistan, India, and the United Arab Emirates. Fast forward to 2016, and 19 people had <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/pennsylvania-woman-sentenced-40-months-prison-role-international-200-million-credit-card" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/pennsylvania-woman-sentenced-40-months-prison-role-international-200-million-credit-card" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/pennsylvania-woman-sentenced-40-months-prison-role-international-200-million-credit-card" aria-label="pleaded guilty">pleaded guilty</a> to being part of this massive con that grew to involve 7,000 fake identities and tens of thousands of credit cards, according to prosecutors. This scheme took place before Tradeline Supply or TikTok even existed–the FBI says the fraudsters bought their tradelines on “a network of black-market businesses called `tradelines’ providers.”</p>

<p>So tradeline selling isn’t new, even if it’s gotten a fresh boost from social media and out-in-the-open web sites. “It emerged about 20 years ago, but back then it was branded as ‘piggybacking,’’ says Rod Griffin, director of public education and advocacy at Experian. “In response, many credit card providers implemented policies about who and how many people you can add as authorized users,’’ he adds.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-2"><p id="article-0-topx-2"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>Those restrictions haven’t killed the tradeline market. “At Thanksgiving, I’ll tell people about this, and they’ll be like whaaaaat? But it’s relatively common,’’ says Naftali Harris, the co-founder and CEO of San Francisco based <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2023/06/06/inside-the-rise-of-a-fintech-startup-using-ai-and-human-insight-to-fight-fraud/?sh=345598b05e12" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2023/06/06/inside-the-rise-of-a-fintech-startup-using-ai-and-human-insight-to-fight-fraud/?sh=345598b05e12" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2023/06/06/inside-the-rise-of-a-fintech-startup-using-ai-and-human-insight-to-fight-fraud/?sh=345598b05e12" aria-label="SentiLink">SentiLink</a>, a fraud prevention company used by 10 of America’s 15 biggest banks. “I would say of [credit] applications that we see, about one out of a thousand appear to be a buyer or a seller. Fraud is an uncommon thing in general, 98 or 99% of the applications we see are completely fine. So one out of a thousand is relatively common.”</p>
<p>Weeding out individuals who have embellished their credit histories by buying tradelines is challenging due in large part to the Federal Reserve’s Regulation B and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) of 1974, which prohibits discrimination based on race, gender, marital status, age, religion, national origin, or public assistance status. Before the law, banks often required a woman to get a male co-signer to get a loan or credit card and married women could fall into a pernicious credit history trap. A happy couple would share a credit card in the man’s name, with the wife listed as an “authorized user.” Even if she paid some or all of the monthly credit card bill, the bank would report the payments in the husband’s name only. Then, if the woman became divorced or widowed, she would be left without a credit history or borrowing power.</p>
<p>So in Regulation B implementing the act, the Fed required that lenders attribute payments to both the cardholder and the authorized user spouse in reports to the credit bureaus. In addition, when analyzing a person’s credit worthiness, lenders had to consider the history of any account in which the person was an authorized user spouse. But–and this is key–Regulation B didn’t require banks to figure out which authorized users were spouses and which weren’t. Instead, if they wanted, they could simply give all authorized users the same treatment mandated for a spouse.</p>
<p>No, influencer Smith didn’t discover this reading Regulation B. Instead, she stumbled upon the tradeline idea while browsing Mr. Money Mustache, a popular FIRE (financial independence, retire early) website that champions “financial freedom through badassity.” Selling tradelines has become such a common side hustle within the FIRE community that Tradeline Supply even <a href="https://tradelinesupply.com/tradelines-fire-movement/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://tradelinesupply.com/tradelines-fire-movement/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://tradelinesupply.com/tradelines-fire-movement/" aria-label="promotes">promotes</a> it as “the perfect complement to a FIRE lifestyle.”</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-3"><p id="article-0-topx-3"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>“I’ve gone to FIRE movement meetings. A couple people there had been selling tradelines for years,” Smith says. “I was able to ask them if they had issues like if their cards got shut down. So that gave me the confidence that this would work. It’s still a little sketchy, but to make $40 dollars for 15 minutes of work, to me, that seems worth it especially since you can give someone without good credit a chance. I got a comment from someone who went through a bad divorce who told me buying tradelines helped her reestablish her credit.”</p>
<p>The concept of tradelines may be resonating beyond FIRE circles. Take the song “Tradeline” by Ray Vaughn, a rapper under the label Top Dawg Entertainment (it once included Kendrick Lamar), that’s featured on the NBA 2K24 video game soundtrack. In his lyrics, Vaughn plays with the idea: “tradelines we finally up the score / ha ha / got to get a check / like I’m out here burning / got to get the earnings.” (A request sent to Vaughn through his record label for clarification of his lyrics’ meaning wasn’t answered.)</p>
<p>Maybe Vaughn’s song helps explain why Smith’s video attracted the attention it did. Buying and selling tradelines is subversive and treads a murky line—it’s apparently not illegal, yet it’s also not what some people would consider ethical. On its <a href="https://tradelinesupply.com/are-tradelines-legal/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://tradelinesupply.com/are-tradelines-legal/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://tradelinesupply.com/are-tradelines-legal/" aria-label="website">website</a>, Tradeline Supply Company sidesteps any legal issues by stating that it “does not give legal advice and cannot definitively state what is legal and what is not.”</p>
<p>But in a <a href="https://tradelinesupply.com/ethics-of-tradelines/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://tradelinesupply.com/ethics-of-tradelines/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://tradelinesupply.com/ethics-of-tradelines/" aria-label="blog post">blog post</a>, Tradeline defends the ethics of the practice–on the grounds that people manipulate their credit scores all the time. For example, the post notes, parents might put their 18-year-old on their oldest cards as an authorized user to help their kid build a credit record. Iba offers an equality spin to the argument. Most of those who have authorized users on their cards are “the higher income demographic, ” he says. “We believe that we are selling a right that everyone should have access to since our American culture has evolved to use this strategy as one way to establish credit or build credit.”</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, credit card companies aren’t keen to talk about this issue. Discover, American Express, Capital One, and Chase didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-4"><p id="article-0-topx-4"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>Like credit bureau Experian, credit scoring leader FICO questions the wisdom of tradeline buying. “In general, individuals should be careful and think twice before they pay to be added to another person’s credit card account as an authorized user,” a FICO spokesperson said in an email. “When done, the information on that credit card account will be reported on your credit reports as well. It could result in an increase, decrease or have no impact on your credit score – it depends on the information reported on the authorized user account in addition to the other information found in your credit report. This action is not without risk. For example, if the card holder charges a lot on the card that increases the balance, that high balance information will populate on your credit report when the account is updated which could cause the score to decrease.”</p>
<p>Translation: There’s no guarantee you’re buying a credit score boost, and you could even unwittingly be dinging your score.</p>
<p>But if tradelines weren't effective in boosting FICO scores, why would people with poor credit or limited credit histories, who probably aren’t rolling in cash, still invest hundreds to thousands of dollars in them? “There’s a bump; if you get added to a card with twenty years of perfect payment history, you’ll get a bump,” says SentiLink’s Harris.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-5"><p id="article-0-topx-5"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>Experian’s Griffin cautions that, at best, buying a tradeline is a temporary solution to a long-term issue. “The impact of an authorized user account is limited and it’s going to be negated by maxed out cards, late payments, or delinquencies. The only real way to improve your score is to catch up on your debts, otherwise you’re spending your hard earned money that, frankly, you already owe to other people, on something that might not work.”</p>
<p>Plus, a tradeline buyer might be turned down by a diligent lender, warned one mortgage broker who commented on X about Amber Smith’s viral tradeline video. Wrote KareemBaldwin1: “Authorized user accounts are being looked at differently with mortgages now. They want a letter to determine the relationship between you and the authorized user and the billing statement. Saying you bought a tradeline will definitely get your loan denied.”</p>
<p>Experian’s Griffin suggests that there’s a bigger problem with this credit hack that affects all borrowers–and not just those who buy their way to unearned higher scores. “The macro issue is that when these people take on more debt, lenders inevitably take on more losses,” he says. “It increases the cost of services for everyone else. Those losses get passed on to everyone else. That’s what the credit reporting system is meant to address.”</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-6"><p id="article-0-topx-6"></p></fbs-ad>

<p><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Gregg Meyer, senior vice president for quality and safety at Massachusetts General Hospital and Massachusetts General Physicians Organization, will lead the command center, which will coordinate responses from state agencies, hospitals, community health centers, community service organizations and others.</p>
<p>Steward, which has 33 hospitals in nine states including <a data-mce-href="https://www.steward.org/network/our-hospitals#view-state-ma" href="https://www.steward.org/network/our-hospitals#view-state-ma" target="_blank">eight in Massachusetts</a>, filed voluntary petitions for relief in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. </p>
<p>Massachusetts Secretary of Health and Human Services Kate Walsh told state legislators this past week that state agencies were preparing for a pending Steward bankruptcy filing, according to Boston-based WBUR. </p>
<p>Under the terms of the filing, Steward said it will keep its operations running.</p>
<p>State officials said that the hospitals remain open and are providing care, according to <a data-mce-href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/05/03/massachusetts-emergency-steward-response-system" href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/05/03/massachusetts-emergency-steward-response-system" target="_blank">WBUR</a>, but DPH will monitor the facilities for necessary supplies and staffing to ensure that safe and effective care can be delivered. </p>
<p><strong>THE LARGER TREND</strong></p>
<p>In March, Steward Health Care in Massachusetts agreed to <a data-mce-href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/optum-care-buy-physician-group-troubled-steward-health-care" href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/optum-care-buy-physician-group-troubled-steward-health-care" target="_blank">sell its physician group to Optum Care</a>.</p>
<p>Steward blamed decreasing government reimbursement rates as a primary factor and rising labor, operations and materials costs for its precarious financial situation.</p>
<p><strong>ON THE RECORD</strong></p>
<p>"This week, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health activated its Emergency Operation Plan as part of our ongoing commitment to ensure patient safety, protect access to care and preserve jobs," Walsh said in a statement. "This next step is part of our continued response to Steward Health Care’s financial challenges."</p>

<p>Continuing its crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may potentially sue Robinhood Markets over securities violations alleged in the popular investing app's crypto unit, Robinhood Crypto <a href="https://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/robinhood-response-to-receipt-of-wells-notice-from-the-u-s-securities-and-exchange-commission/">said</a> Monday.</p>
<p>In a recent SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000178387924000138/hood-20240504.htm">filing</a>, Robinhood Markets Chief Financial Officer Jason Warnick confirmed that Robinhood Crypto has received investigative subpoenas from the SEC regarding its "cryptocurrency listings, custody of cryptocurrencies, and platform operations."</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>Despite Robinhood cooperating with these investigations, the SEC sent a "Wells Notice" on Monday, the filing said. The notice alerted Robinhood that SEC staff had made a "preliminary determination" recommending that the SEC "file an enforcement action" alleging that Robinhood Crypto had violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
<p>If the SEC sues Robinhood, the SEC filing said, that "may involve a civil injunctive action, public administrative proceeding, and/or a cease-and-desist proceeding." Potential remedies might include "an injunction, a cease-and-desist order, disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, civil money penalties, and censure, revocation, and limitations on activities."</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/robinhood-response-to-receipt-of-wells-notice-from-the-u-s-securities-and-exchange-commission/">press release</a>, Dan Gallagher— Robinhood Markets' chief legal, compliance, and corporate affairs officer—said that Robinhood was "disappointed." The SEC issued the Wells Notice "after years of" the company's "good faith attempts to work with the SEC for regulatory clarity" ended last year without resolution, he said.</p>
<p>In 2022, Robinhood <a href="https://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/all-eligible-waitlist-members-now-have-a-crypto-wallet-lightning-network-is-coming-to-robinhood/">announced</a> that 2 million customers—everyone on their waitlist—had access to its Crypto Wallet. In that blog, CEO and co-founder Vlad Tenev told customers that Robinhood's "goal" was to become "the most trusted and easiest to use crypto platform."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>But achieving that goal would require more clarity from regulators, Robinhood found out. By last June, Gallagher had <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AG/AG00/20230606/116051/HHRG-118-AG00-Wstate-GallagherD-20230606.pdf">testified</a> to Congress that a year and a half of engaged talks with the SEC did not help Robinhood get any more clarity on how to register its crypto trading business. This left Robinhood living in a "world of confusion around crypto," Robinhood said on its <a href="https://policy.aboutrobinhood.com/policy/crypto/">website</a> in December 2023.</p>
<p>"The most fundamental problem in digital asset markets is that there is no clear guidance on which digital assets the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission deem to be securities and commodities, respectively, and how cryptocurrency platforms and digital asset securities can be appropriately registered under federal law," Gallagher told Congress.</p>
<p>Robinhood is considered "more conservative than other US cryptocurrency businesses," The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/robinhood-gets-sec-notice-on-recommendation-of-enforcement-action-against-crypto-unit-9846e60c">noted</a>. And Robinhood has seemingly attempted to monitor SEC enforcement to ensure its crypto business does not commit any known SEC violations.</p>
<p>That's why Robinhood delisted cryptocurrencies flagged by the SEC during a Coinbase lawsuit, including Solana, Polygon, and Cardano, The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/6/24150045/robinhood-cryptocurrency-wells-notice-warning-sec">reported</a>. And it's also why Robinhood prohibits cryptocurrency earnings from lending or staking, specifically because the SEC regards those products as securities, Robinhood's press release noted.</p>
<p>Likewise, <a href="https://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/robinhood-adds-new-spot-bitcoin-etfs/">Robinhood acts quickly</a> to immediately offer SEC-approved cryptocurrencies on its platform. Robinhood's press release and SEC filing did not clarify which crypto products the SEC might be considering securities on its platform. Gallagher maintains there are no securities on Robinhood's platform.</p>
<p>"We firmly believe that the assets listed on our platform are not securities," Gallagher said.</p>
<p>Robinhood will now have an opportunity to plead its case to the SEC and potentially dodge the lawsuit. In the meantime, the company assured customers in its blog that "this development will not affect your account or the services we provide," declaring, "Robinhood Crypto is here to stay."</p>
<p>"We look forward to engaging with the SEC to make clear just how weak any case against Robinhood Crypto would be on both the facts and the law," Gallagher said.</p>

                        </div><p>An investor at famed Silicon Valley firm Andreessen Horowitz is the latest VC to get involved in the debate around "fake work" in the tech industry.</p><p>In an interview published Monday with Emily Sundberg for her Substack newsletter "Feed Me," <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/david-ulevitch-joins-andreessen-horowitz-2018-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="40">Andreessen Horowitz general partner David Ulevitch</a> called Google "an amazing example" of a corporation employing people in "BS jobs."</p><p>"As we (society / our economy) prioritize conglomerates and megacorps, irrelevant jobs proliferate," he <a target="_blank" href="https://www.readfeedme.com/p/instagram-italian-or-neighborhood" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="60">said</a>. "Anyone who works in a 10,000+ person or larger white-collar job company knows that a bunch of the people can probably be let go tomorrow and the company wouldn't really feel the difference, maybe it'd even improve with less people inserting themselves into things."</p><p>Ulevitch was previously the CEO of web security startup OpenDNS, which he sold to Cisco for $635 million in 2015.</p><p>"The growing professional managerial class in America, and more importantly, the societal perception that those jobs are 'really important,' is a weakness, not a strength," he added. "I should note, I have been a part of this class in my career, and it's great — people really treated me like I was very impressive and important when I was an SVP at Cisco, and so naturally I thought I was, too. This dynamic is endemic across corporations and is lame."</p><p>Ulevitch said one effect is "the decline of small businesses that power America's industrial and manufacturing base," as people in these industries age out of the workforce, the work gets outsourced abroad, and these jobs are seen as less desirable than white-collar gigs. He also pointed to another consequence:</p><p>"Another issue with all the 'BS' jobs in large corporations is that it takes profits away from shareholders who are most often the pensioners and retirement accounts of the rest of America," he said. "So those people aren't just being useless (and being coddled to think useless jobs actually matter – they don't), but they are also taking money away from the rest of the workforce's retirement programs."</p>
                        <p>Ulevitch went on to point the finger at Google specifically, calling it "an amazing example."</p><p>"I don't think it's crazy to believe that half the white-collar staff at Google probably does no real work," he said. "The company has spent billions and billions of dollars per year on projects that go nowhere for over a decade, and all that money could have been returned to shareholders who have retirement accounts."</p><p>Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reached by email, Ulevitch told BI, "My only comment is that I think it ranks as one of the least controversial things I've ever said."</p><p>Other VCs have also entered the debate around "fake work" and overstaffing within Big Tech in recent years.</p><p>Marc Andreessen has criticized <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1513113304104783875" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="80"><u>a managerial "laptop class"</u></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/pmarca/status/1515195878604087297" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="80">tweeted</a> in 2022, "The good big companies are overstaffed by 2x. The bad big companies are overstaffed by 4x or more."</p><p>Tech investor and PayPal Mafia member <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-meta-staff-do-fake-work-says-vc-keith-rabois-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="80">Keith Rabois</a> last year attributed mass layoffs and Meta and Google to this.</p><p>"All these people were extraneous, this has been true for a long time, the vanity metric of hiring employees was this false god in some ways," he said.</p><p>"There's nothing for these people to do…it's all fake work," he continued. "Now that's being exposed, what do these people actually do, they go to meetings."</p><p>Thomas Siebel, the billionaire CEO of C3.ai, said last year that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/c3ai-ceo-says-meta-google-over-hired-employees-did-nothing-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">Google and Meta overhired staff</a> and didn't have enough work for them to do.</p><p>"They really were doing nothing working from home," he said. "If you want to work from home, like four days of work in your pajamas, go to work for Facebook."</p><p>While some tech workers say they've had to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/laid-off-meta-employee-says-paid-not-to-work-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">"basically fight to find work,"</a> others say <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-industry-fake-work-problem-bad-managers-bosses-layoffs-jobs-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">bad management is to blame</a>, with bosses overhiring and assigning workers busy work to make themselves look more important and secure promotions.</p><p>Tech firms like Meta and Google laid off thousands of workers in recent years, often citing an interest in becoming more efficient.</p><p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a target="_blank" rel="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-year-efficiency-meta-facebook-could-mean-more-layoffs-2023-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100"><u>declared 2023 would be the company's "year of efficiency"</u></a> and expressed his distaste for a bloated organizational structure of "managers managing managers." <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-productivity-sundar-pichai-improved-ceo-2022-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">Google CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly told staff</a> in a 2022 all-hands that "there are real concerns that our productivity as a whole is not where it needs to be for the headcount we have."</p>
