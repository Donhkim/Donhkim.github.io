<li><strong>Fed Chair Powell is encouraged by cooling inflation</strong>: Jerome Powell, Federal Reserve Chair, expressed encouragement by the recent inflation data, which showed prices increasing at their slowest pace in more than three years.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation rate slowed down in May</strong>: The "core" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation target, rose 2.6% in May, down from 2.8% in April, and in line with expectations.</li>
<li><strong>No rate cut expected at next meeting</strong>: Powell declined to answer a question about whether the Fed could cut rates as soon as September, and instead emphasized the need for more time and evidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to its 2% target.</li>
<li><strong>Fed wants to see sustained cooling of inflation</strong>: Powell emphasized that the Fed wants to understand that the current levels of inflation are a true reading of what is happening with underlying inflation, and that they need to see sustained cooling of inflation before considering rate cuts.</li>
<li><strong>Fed can afford to be patient due to strong job market</strong>: With a strong job market that is cooling gradually, the Fed can afford to be patient and wait for more evidence before making any decisions on interest rates.</li>

            Economists have been closely watching the quits rate — which has held steady at 2.2% for seven months running — as it serves as a signal for workers’ willingness to test the labor market’s waters. When people switch jobs, that typically can correlate to bigger pay bumps, which in turn potentially could make it more difficult to rein in inflation.

            “People are still moving between jobs at a slightly faster rate than they were pre-pandemic … but the pay raises they’re getting when they make those moves is a degree softer,” he said. “That sort of suggests that the pendulum has swung slightly more in favor of firms and away from workers.”

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Peloton has refinanced its debt</strong>: The company has secured a new $1 billion term loan, raised $350 million in convertible senior notes, and received a $100 million line of credit from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, reducing its debt from $1.75 billion to around $1.55 billion.</li>
<li><strong>The refinancing has alleviated immediate liquidity concerns</strong>: Peloton no longer faces an imminent liquidity crunch, as it has pushed off looming due dates on loans that it likely wouldn't have had the cash to pay back. The company would have had to pay around $1 billion towards its debt by November 2025, but has now delayed those payments.</li>
<li><strong>Peloton still faces a long road to profitability</strong>: Despite the refinancing, the company has not turned a net profit since December 2020 and has seen sales fall for nine straight quarters. It will need to fundamentally change its business to get back to profitability.</li>
<li><strong>The refinancing signals investor confidence in Peloton's ability to turn around its business</strong>: The fact that investors are willing to lend Peloton more money suggests they believe the company can rightsize its business and eventually pay them back, according to restructuring experts.</li>
<li><strong>Peloton's debt still poses an existential threat to the company</strong>: Although the refinancing has given Peloton some breathing room, the company's debt remains a significant issue that could still pose an existential threat if not addressed.</li>

All of those are due in 2029. </p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>The refinance reduced Peloton’s debt from about $1.75 billion to around $1.55 billion and pushed off looming due dates on loans that it likely wouldn’t have had the cash to pay back.</p><p>Before the refinancing, Peloton would have needed to pay around $800 million toward its debt by November 2025. If it managed to pay that, about another $200 million still would have been due around three months later. The term loan would have been due in May 2027. </p><p>For Peloton, which hasn’t turned a net profit since December 2020 and has seen sales fall for nine straight quarters, the debt pile posed an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/07/private-equity-firms-circle-peloton-for-potential-buyout.html">existential threat</a> and fueled investor concerns about a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/04/retailers-like-peloton-saks-express-are-late-on-vendor-bills.html">possible bankruptcy</a>.</p><p>Now that it has refinanced, Peloton has eased investor concerns about liquidity and has the breathing room it needs to try to turn around its business.</p><p>The fact that it was able to secure these loans signals investors believe in its ability to rightsize its business and eventually pay them back, restructuring experts told CNBC.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>“This refinancing is now putting us in a much better position for sustainable, profitable growth and just a much stronger financial footing than where we were before, and our investors saw that,” finance chief Liz Coddington told CNBC in an interview. “I think they believe in the story. They believe in what we’re trying to do, as do we, and in the transformation of the business. And so it was just a great vote of confidence for Peloton’s future.”</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline0"></a>Peloton faces risks ahead </h2><div class="group"><p>While the refinance may have bought Peloton some time, it’s far from a panacea. Under the terms, Peloton will now be spending about $133 million annually in interest, up from around $89 million previously. It will make Peloton’s efforts to sustain positive free cash flow more difficult. </p><p>Coddington acknowledged to CNBC that the higher interest expense is going to “impact” free cash flow, but said that’s partly why the company started to cut costs in early May. The plan is expected to reduce annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million.</p><p>Even with the higher interest payments, Coddington expects the company will be able to sustain positive free cash flow without having the business “materially grow in the near term.” </p><p>“The cost reduction plan made us much more comfortable with that,” said Coddington. </p><p>While Peloton insists that investors bought into its refinance because they believe in its strategy, some could be trying to put themselves in a better position if the company fails.</p><p>Two of Peloton’s largest debt holders, Soros Fund Management and Silver Point Capital, are known to sometimes invest in distressed companies.<strong> </strong>Since the Peloton loans they invested in are secured, they are near the top of the capital structure. If Peloton can’t turn its business around and ends up in a position where it’s considering or filing for bankruptcy, its creditors would be in a strong position to take control of the company.</p><p>“I would describe this refinancing slash recapitalization as sort of opportunistic,” said Evan DuFaux, a special situations analyst at CreditSights and an expert in distressed debt. “I think that’s just sort of a smart, opportunistic and kind of tricky move.”</p><p>Silver Point declined to comment. Soros didn’t return a request for comment.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline1"></a>More cost cuts to come?</h2><div class="group"><p>Peloton is in a far better cash position than it was a few months ago, but the company still needs to address the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/19/peloton-rise-fall-attempted-comeback.html">demand issues</a> that have plagued it since the Covid-19 pandemic wound down and figure out what kind of business it will be in the future. </p><p>“It really is an exercise in kicking the can down the road because the refinancing itself buys time, but it doesn’t actually fix any of the underlying problems at Peloton,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. “Those are very different issues to the refinancing.”</p><p>Following former CEO Barry McCarthy’s departure and with two board members, Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo, now in charge, Peloton needs to decide: is it a content company, like the <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-6"><a href="/quotes/NFLX/">Netflix</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> for fitness, or is it a hardware company that needs to develop new strategies to sell its pricey equipment?</p><p>So far, straddling both has proven to be unsuccessful. </p><p>“They’re going to have to make some decisions about which parts of the model are survivable, which parts are not, or things that they can do to advance forward without losing the great brand value that they still currently have, especially with the loyal following that they have,” said Scott Stuart, the CEO of the Turnaround Management Association and an expert in corporate restructurings.</p><p>“Money doesn’t fix everything, and the issue becomes the more money you take and the more you refinance ... the more problematic it becomes,” he added.</p><p>Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst for BMO Capital Markets, said Peloton can start addressing its issues by forgetting about trying to grow the business for now and instead focus on “bear hugging” its millions of brand loyalists. </p><p>He pointed out that the company makes about $1.6 billion in recurring, high-margin subscription revenue and sees more than $1.1 billion in gross profit from that side of the business.</p><p>“The problem is, they lose money. How do you lose money if you’re generating a billion one of recurring gross profit dollars?” said Siegel. “Well, you take all of that gross profit and you spend it to try and chase new growth.”</p><p>He said Peloton could generate around $500 million in EBITDA if it cuts research and development, marketing and other corporate expenses. For example, Peloton’s marketing budget is around 25% of annual sales, and if the company reduces it to even 10%, it would still be in the “upper echelon of most brands,” said Siegel.  </p><p>“Their debt is scary on a company that’s burning cash, their debt’s not scary at all on a company that can make half a billion dollars of EBITDA,” he said. “They have a business that’s generating a tremendous amount of cash. They need to stop spending it.” </p><p>In May, Peloton announced it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/02/peloton-ceo-barry-mccarthy-steps-down-15percent-of-staff-laid-off.html">would cut 15% of its corporate workforce</a>, but it may be more reluctant to back off its growth strategy. Peloton founder John Foley set a goal of growing to 100 million members, and McCarthy adopted the target when he took over. As of the end of March, Peloton had about 6.6 million members — woefully behind that long-term target.</p><p>Since the company announced its cost cutting plan, McCarthy’s departure and another disastrous earnings report in early May, Peloton has been largely mum on its strategy. It said that it’s searching for a new permanent CEO, and the person it hires will offer clues about the company’s direction. </p><p>If it hires another “hyper growth tech CEO” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/08/meet-pelotons-new-ceo-barry-mccarthy.html">like McCarthy</a> – who had done stints at Netflix and <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-9"><a href="/quotes/SPOT/">Spotify</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> – then Peloton will likely face the same issues, Siegel said. But if it taps someone different, it could signal a strategy shift.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline2"></a>Content magic </h2><div class="group"><p>One notable shift afoot at Peloton is its live programming schedule. The company currently offers live streaming classes from its New York studio seven days a week, but beginning on Wednesday, that will change to six. Last month, its London studio moved from seven days of live streaming classes to five.</p><p>“We’re all going to still be creating, creating social content, dropping new classes,” Peloton’s Chief Content Officer Jen Cotter told CNBC. “I think that we’ll just be using the brain space that would have been spent on live classes that day to come up with new programs, new ways to distribute wellness content, new categories of business to go in, like nutrition and rest and sleep, which we’ve not really done as deeply as we plan to do.”</p><p>She added that the change will save the company some money, but it’s more of an opportunity to make better use of its production staff than it is a cost-cutting measure.</p><p>For example, the company in May partnered with Hyatt Hotels as it tries to generate new revenue and diversify income streams. As part of the agreement, hundreds of Hyatt properties will be outfitted with Peloton equipment, and guests will have access to bespoke Peloton classes on their hotel room TVs in around 400 locations. The schedule tweak will allow staff to be available to make content for projects like the Hyatt partnership.</p><p>The shift comes after three Peloton trainers – Kristin McGee, Kendall Toole, and Ross Rayburn – decided not to renew their contracts with the company. The news raised concerns among Peloton’s rabid fanbase that trainers, one of its core assets, were leaving in droves.</p><p>Cotter insisted the parting was amicable – and the door is open should the athletes want to return. </p><p>“All I can say is, they decided they wanted to leave. All the instructors were offered contracts and I mean it when I say we have deep respect and appreciation for what they’ve contributed, and if they want to try something new, that’s okay,” said Cotter. </p><p>“As much as we’re going to miss them, we are like a professional sports team,” she added. “Athletes do leave the team and you still love the athlete and you still love the team and so we’re really hopeful that this change does allow our members to understand this is okay, and yes, we’re going to miss them, but yes, it’s okay for people to go try other things.” </p><p>McGee, Toole and Rayburn all left when Peloton was in the process of renewing trainer contracts. </p><p>Some instructors may be teaching fewer classes as part of the live content pullback. It’s unclear if any instructors took pay cuts as a result, or if McGee, Toole and Rayburn left because of disagreements over compensation. </p><p>When asked, Cotter declined to answer.</p></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Low occupancy rates in Paris hotels</strong>: Hotel occupancy rates in Paris are down by almost 25% compared to previous years, with some hotels experiencing half-full bookings, a significant drop from the usual 80-90% occupancy rates.</li>
<li><strong>Tourists are holding out for last-minute deals</strong>: Many tourists are waiting for prices to drop further, causing a last-minute shortage in bookings. This is expected to lead to a surge in unsold rooms during the Olympic Games.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns over high costs and logistics</strong>: Hotel directors are citing high prices for metro tickets, tourist taxes, and traffic restrictions as reasons for tourists to stay away. Additionally, the weather has been difficult, making people less inclined to visit Paris.</li>
<li><strong>Occupancy rates are unprecedentedly low</strong>: According to the official statistics office of France, Insee, hotel occupancy rates in Paris averaged 90.7% last July, but current numbers project up to 40 unsold rooms may be available during the 2024 Olympics.</li>
<li><strong>Tourism and hotel professionals hope for a comeback</strong>: Despite the low occupancy rates, tourism and hotel professionals in Paris are hoping to make up for lost time with the showcase effect that the Olympics will have on their bookings for the coming seasons.</li>

<li><strong>Barry Diller to bid on Paramount Global</strong>: Legendary media mogul Barry Diller is considering a bid to take control of Paramount Global, the studio that got away from him in the 1990s.</li>
<li><strong>Diller's history with Paramount</strong>: Diller was CEO of Paramount Pictures from 1974 to 1984, during which time the studio produced popular TV series and films. He has a deep understanding of the company's value and potential.</li>
<li><strong>Shari Redstone's concerns</strong>: Paramount's controlling shareholder Shari Redstone, Sumner Redstone's daughter, is seeking a buyer who will keep the company largely intact, rather than allowing it to be sold for parts. This may make Diller a more attractive option for her.</li>
<li><strong>Skydance deal scrapped</strong>: A recent deal between Redstone's National Amusements and Skydance Media was scrapped due to outstanding issues, including the lack of a shareholder consent vote.</li>
<li><strong>Competing bids</strong>: Diller's potential bid follows a $26 billion all-cash bid from an alliance of Sony Pictures Entertainment and Apollo Global Management, which is thought to be less advantageous for Paramount shareholders. Diller's bid, if successful, could offer a more profitable outcome for shareholders.</li>

<p>Legendary media mogul <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/barry-diller-paramount-sale-bid-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barry Diller is taking one more crack at Paramount</a>, the studio that got away. </p>



<p>In the early 1990s, Diller lost a bid to buy the studio — to then-Viacom chief Sumner Redstone.</p>	
	



<p>Now 82, Diller is back in the game, exploring a bid to take control of a far more-troubled Paramount Global, an individual with knowledge told TheWrap on Monday. </p>	
	



<p>Diller’s company IAC has signed nondisclosure agreements with National Amusements, the holding company of Paramount’s controlling shareholder Shari Redstone, an individual confirmed to TheWrap. <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/barry-diller-paramount-sale-bid-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times </a>first reported the story.</p>



<p>The potential bid comes after Redstone, who is Sumner Redstone’s daughter, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-skydance-deal-scrapped-shari-redstone-national-amusements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scrapped a deal</a> with David Ellison’s Skydance Media last month to acquire NAI and merge with the Hollywood studio.  While both sides agreed to the economic terms of the deal, there were outstanding issues they did not agree on — most notably, giving all shareholders a consent vote on the sale.</p>






<p>Representatives for National Amusements, Paramount and IAC all declined to comment to TheWrap. Diller was said to be out of reach on a yacht in Europe – as media moguls are meant to be in July. </p>



<p>The emergence of Diller, a billionaire who led Paramount Pictures in the heyday of broadcast television in the 1970s and 1980s, could be the missing link for Shari Redstone. She initially favored a deal with Skydance because Ellison offered more promises of keeping the company together — even though the deal was far less-lucrative for Paramount shareholders than a $26 billion all-cash bid by an alliance of Sony Pictures Entertainment and Apollo Global Management. </p>	
	



<p>Redstone’s desire to keep the company largely intact — rather than allowing it to be sold for parts as Wall Street analysts have speculated it should be — has featured prominently in negotiations among prospective buyers, National Amusements and Paramount’s special board committee evaluating deals.</p>	
	



<p>But Diller has special history with this studio. </p>



<p>He was CEO of Paramount Pictures from 1974 to 1984. Under his tenure, the studio produced popular TV series such as “Laverne &amp; Shirley” and “Cheers” and films including “Saturday Night Fever,” “Grease” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” </p>



<p>In 1983, he was also named president of the company’s Entertainment and Communications Group, which included Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., Madison Square Garden Corporation and SEGA Enterprises, Inc. </p>



<p>Then from 1984 to 1992, Diller left, serving as chairman and CEO of Fox Inc. and was responsible for creating Fox Broadcasting Company in addition to Fox’s motion picture operations. </p>	
	



<p>In the early ’90s, he made his unsuccessful bid for Paramount Communications. At the time, referring to Redstone’s winning offer to buy the legendary studio from Gulf+Western, Diller said in a statement: “They won. We lost. Next.”</p>	
	



<p>Diller is also credited with mentoring a stellar group of Hollywood executives, dubbed “The Killer Dillers,” who later became power brokers themselves. They included Michael Eisner, who was president of Paramount Pictures and later chairman and CEO of Disney; Jeffrey Katzenberg, Paramount’s head of production under Diller and then a co-founder of DreamWorks SKG; and Dawn Steel, who went on to serve as president of Columbia Pictures.</p>



<p>In 1995, Diller founded IAC, an internet and media conglomerate that owns brands across 100 countries, including platforms like Tinder, print and digital publisher Dotdash Meredith and the website Care.com. The company acquired the assets of Silver King Broadcasting in 1996, which owned the Home Shopping Network, and USA Network in 1997. He is currently the chairman and senior executive of IAC and Expedia Group. </p>



<p>Forbes has pegged <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/barry-diller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diller’s net worth</a> at $4.1 billion. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paramount-still-in-play">Paramount still in play</h2>



<p>Paramount has been in play since last year. Skydance had an exclusive 30-day negotiating window with National Amusements, but last month Redstone decided she no longer wanted to proceed with a deal. NAI controls some 77% of Paramount’s voting stock.</p>



<p>In addition to Skydance and the Sony-Apollo bid, Allen Media Group founder Byron Allen also <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-stock-climbs-byron-allen-30-billion-bid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">placed a $30 billion bid including debt</a>, though it is unclear how that bid would be financed. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav also has met with former Paramount CEO Bob Bakish about a potential merger, but those talks were <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/warner-bros-discovery-paramount-global-halting-merger-talks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later halted.</a> </p>



<p>Separately, NAI has received two separate<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/edgar-bronfman-jr-bain-capital-national-amusements-bid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> expressions of interest</a> from “Baby Geniuses” producer Steven Paul and former Warner Music Group CEO and chairman Edgar Bronfman Jr.</p>



<p>According to an individual close to Redstone, all three bids are currently in play. </p>






<p>While Redstone weighs her options, Paramount is currently being run by three co-CEOs —Brian Robbins, Chris McCarthy and George Cheeks — who replaced Bakish after he <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-ceo-bob-bakish-exits/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down</a> in April. </p>



<p>The trio has outlined a long-term strategic plan that includes $500 million in cost cuts, divesting assets and teaming up with other streamers or technology platforms on a streaming joint venture or long-term partnership. CNBC reported on Monday that Warner Bros. Discovery is among the companies considering a potential streamer merger with Paramount+ and Max.</p>



<p>During a town hall with employees last week, the Paramount executives revealed they have started cutting costs, including in legal and corporate marketing, though they did not reveal a timeline nor confirm how many employees could be impacted. </p>



<p>They’ve also hired bankers to help with asset sales, which could potentially include Pluto TV, BET, VH1 and the Paramount studio lot, which would be leased back for the studio’s use, four individuals familiar with the matter previously confirmed to TheWrap. </p>



<p>The company also said it was continuing talks with potential partners in international markets that will “significantly transform the scale and economics” of its streaming business, which is currently on track to reach domestic profitability in 2025. </p>



<p>Paramount, which has a market capitalization of $6.97 billion, saw its shares climb over 3% in after-hours trading on Monday. The stock has fallen 29% in the past six months and 37% in the past year. The company also faces $14.6 billion in long-term debt and its <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-global-downgraded-streaming-losses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit rating has been downgraded to junk status</a>.</p>



<p>Paramount’s co-CEOs will update Wall Street on its long-term strategic plan during its second quarter earnings call.</p>
