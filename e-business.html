<p>On Wednesday, former OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever announced he is forming a new company called <a href="https://ssi.inc/">Safe Superintelligence, Inc.</a> (SSI) with the goal of safely building "superintelligence," which is a hypothetical form of artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence, possibly in the extreme.</p>

<p>"<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">We will pursue safe superintelligence in a straight shot, with one focus, one goal, and one product," <a href="https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1803472979873128498">wrote</a> Sutskever on X. "We will do it through revolutionary breakthroughs produced by a small cracked team.</span>"</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>Sutskever was a founding member of OpenAI and formerly served as the company's chief scientist. Two others are joining Sutskever at SSI initially: <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/~danilevy/">Daniel Levy</a>, who formerly headed the Optimization Team at OpenAI, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gross_(entrepreneur)">Daniel Gross</a>, an AI investor who worked on machine learning projects at Apple between 2013 and 2017. The trio posted a statement on the company's new website.</p>

<p>Sutskever and several of his co-workers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chief-scientist-ilya-sutskever-leaves-openai-six-months-after-altman-ouster/">resigned</a> from OpenAI in May, six months after Sutskever <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/report-sutskever-led-board-coup-at-openai-that-ousted-altman-over-ai-safety-concerns/">played a key role</a> in ousting OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who later returned. While Sutskever did not publicly complain about OpenAI after his departure—and OpenAI executives such as Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1790518031640347056">wished him well</a> on his new adventures—another resigning member of OpenAI's Superalignment team, Jan Leike, publicly <a href="https://x.com/janleike/status/1791498184671605209">complained</a> that "over the past years, safety culture and processes [had] taken a backseat to shiny products" at OpenAI. Leike <a href="https://x.com/janleike/status/1795497960509448617">joined</a> OpenAI competitor Anthropic later in May.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>A nebulous concept</h2>
<p>OpenAI is currently seeking to <a href="https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/">create AGI</a>, or artificial general intelligence, which would hypothetically match human intelligence at performing a wide variety of tasks without specific training. Sutskever hopes to jump beyond that in a straight moonshot attempt, with no distractions along the way.</p>

<p>"This company is special in that its first product will be the safe superintelligence, and it will not do anything else up until then," said Sutskever in an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-19/openai-co-founder-plans-new-ai-focused-research-lab?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxODgxNjU5NywiZXhwIjoxNzE5NDIxMzk3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTRkM3ODJUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI5MTM4NzMzNDcyQkY0QjlGQTg0OTI3QTVBRjY1QzBCRiJ9.9s8N3QuUytwRVZ6dzDwZ6tPOGDsV8u05fpTrUdlHcXg&amp;sref=nPlhheXZ">interview with Bloomberg</a>. "It will be fully insulated from the outside pressures of having to deal with a large and complicated product and having to be stuck in a competitive rat race."</p>
<p>During his former job at OpenAI, Sutskever was part of the "<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-superalignment/">Superalignment</a>" team studying how to "align" (shape the behavior of) this hypothetical form of AI, sometimes called "ASI" for "artificial super intelligence," to be beneficial to humanity.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, it's difficult to align something that does not exist, so Sutskever's quest has met skepticism at times. On X, University of Washington computer science professor (and frequent OpenAI critic) Pedro Domingos wrote, "<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Ilya Sutskever's new company is guaranteed to succeed, because superintelligence that is never achieved is guaranteed to be safe.</span>"</p>
<p>Much like AGI, superintelligence is a nebulous term. Since the mechanics of human intelligence are still poorly understood—and since human intelligence is difficult to quantify or define because there is no one set type of human intelligence—identifying superintelligence when it arrives may be tricky.</p>
<p>Already, computers far surpass humans in many forms of information processing (such as basic math), but are they superintelligent? Many proponents of superintelligence imagine a sci-fi scenario of an "alien intelligence" with a form of sentience that operates independently of humans, and that is more or less what Sutskever hopes to achieve and control safely.</p>
<p>"You’re talking about a giant super data center that’s autonomously developing technology," he told Bloomberg. "That’s crazy, right? It’s the safety of that that we want to contribute to."</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>American Airlines has put an unspecified number of employees on leave due to their involvement in an incident where several Black passengers were removed from a flight in Phoenix, allegedly over a complaint about body odor.</li>
<li>The incident involved three Black passengers who sued the airline, charging that they were removed from the flight because of racial discrimination.</li>
<li>The passengers said they did not know each other and were seated separately while waiting for the plane to depart for New York. They were among eight Black men on the flight who were told to leave the plane.</li>
<li>After a delay of about an hour, the passengers were allowed back on the plane. An investigation is ongoing, and the airline has announced that it will form an advisory group to focus on the experience of Black customers and improve diversity training.</li>
<li>American Airlines CEO Robert Isom has written a note to staff apologizing for the incident, saying it was "unacceptable" and "contradicts our values." He has also promised to improve the airline's procedures for reporting and addressing allegations of discrimination.</li>

<strong>
<em>– First Phase 3 HIV Prevention Trial Ever to Show Zero Infections –</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>– Independent Data Monitoring Committee Recommended That Gilead Stop the Blinded Phase of the PURPOSE 1 Trial at Interim Analysis and Offer Open-Label Lenacapavir to All Participants –
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Foster City, Calif. – June 20, 2024 </span></strong>– Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced topline results from an interim analysis of its pivotal, Phase 3 PURPOSE 1 trial indicating that the company’s twice-yearly injectable HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, demonstrated 100% efficacy for the investigational use of HIV prevention in cisgender women.</p>
<p><span>PURPOSE 1 met its key efficacy endpoints of superiority of twice-yearly lenacapavir to once-daily oral Truvada<em>®</em> (emtricitabine 200mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300mg; F/TDF) and background HIV incidence (bHIV). Based on these results, the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended that Gilead stop the blinded phase of the trial and offer open-label lenacapavir to all participants.</span></p>
<p><span>“With zero infections and 100% efficacy, twice-yearly lenacapavir has demonstrated its potential as an important new tool to help prevent HIV infections,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “We look forward to additional results from the ongoing PURPOSE clinical program and continuing toward our goal of helping to end the HIV epidemic for everyone, everywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span>These are the first data generated from Gilead’s landmark PURPOSE program, which is the most comprehensive and diverse HIV prevention trial program ever conducted. The PURPOSE program comprises five HIV prevention trials around the world that are focused on innovation in science, trial design, community engagement and health equity.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Topline PURPOSE 1 data</span></strong></p>
<p><span>PURPOSE 1, a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized study, is evaluating the safety and efficacy of twice-yearly, subcutaneous lenacapavir for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and once-daily oral Descovy<em>®</em> (emtricitabine 200mg and tenofovir alafenamide 25mg; F/TAF) in more than 5,300 cisgender women and adolescent girls aged 16-25 across 25 sites in South Africa and three sites in Uganda. The drugs are being tested in parallel, with one group receiving twice-yearly lenacapavir and one group taking once-daily oral Descovy. Additionally, a third group was assigned once-daily oral Truvada. Study participants were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to lenacapavir, Descovy and Truvada, respectively. Because effective PrEP options already exist, there is broad consensus in the PrEP field that a placebo group would be unethical; thus, the trial used bHIV as the primary comparator and Truvada as a secondary comparator.</span></p>
<p><span>There were 0 incident cases of HIV infection among 2,134 women in the lenacapavir group </span>(incidence 0.00 per 100 person-years)<span>. </span>There were 16 incident cases among 1,068 women in the Truvada group (incidence 1.69 per 100 person-years). <span>The results demonstrated superiority of twice-yearly lenacapavir over bHIV (primary endpoint, incidence </span>2.41 per 100 person-years<span>) and superiority of twice-yearly lenacapavir over once-daily Truvada (secondary endpoint), with p&lt;0.0001 for both endpoints. In the trial, lenacapavir was generally well-tolerated and no significant or new safety concerns were identified.</span></p>
<p><span>HIV incidence in the Descovy group was numerically similar (39 incident cases among 2,136 women, incidence 2.02 per 100 person-years) to that in the Truvada group and was not statistically superior to bHIV. Previous clinical trials among cisgender women have commonly found challenges with adherence to daily oral pills for PrEP, and adherence analyses for Descovy and Truvada from PURPOSE 1 are ongoing. In the trial, both Descovy and Truvada were generally well-tolerated and no new safety concerns were identified.</span> </p>
<p><span>More detailed data from PURPOSE 1 will be presented at a future conference.</span></p>
<p><span>“Twice-yearly lenacapavir for PrEP, if approved, could provide a critical new choice for HIV prevention that fits into the lives of many people who could benefit from PrEP around the world—especially cisgender women,” said Linda-Gail Bekker, MBChB, DTM&amp;H, DCH, FCP(SA), PhD, Director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Center at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, and past President of the International AIDS Society. “While we know traditional HIV prevention options are highly effective when taken as prescribed, twice-yearly lenacapavir for PrEP could help address the stigma and discrimination some people may face when taking or storing oral PrEP pills, as well as potentially help increase PrEP adherence and persistence given its twice-yearly dosing schedule.”</span></p>
<p><span>The use of lenacapavir and the use of Descovy for the prevention of HIV in cisgender women are investigational and have not been determined to be safe or efficacious and are not approved anywhere globally.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Additional PURPOSE trials assessing twice-yearly lenacapavir for PrEP are ongoing</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Gilead expects results in late 2024/early 2025 from the program’s other pivotal trial, PURPOSE 2, which is assessing twice-yearly lenacapavir for PrEP among cisgender men who have sex with men, transgender men, transgender women and gender non-binary individuals who have sex with partners assigned male at birth in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Thailand and the United States. The regulatory filing for lenacapavir for PrEP will include the results of both PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2, if positive, in order to ensure lenacapavir for PrEP can be approved for multiple populations and communities most in need of additional HIV prevention options.</span></p>
<p><span>Gilead is committed to partnering with communities that are disproportionately affected by HIV in their respective countries and regions, and community input on the PURPOSE trials has been instrumental in factors ranging from program design to participant recruitment strategies. This kind of collaborative approach will continue to help Gilead implement clinical trials with rigor, innovation and intentional inclusion of communities that have historically been underrepresented in HIV prevention research. It will also help bolster the post-implementation science activities that Gilead will conduct for PURPOSE 1 and future successful trials.</span></p>
<p><span>Gilead recognizes the importance of helping to enable access in order for twice-yearly lenacapavir for PrEP, if approved by regulatory authorities, to achieve the broadest impact. In light of today’s milestone and the company’s ongoing commitment to communities affected by HIV, Gilead intends to brief community partners and provide a public statement regarding its planned access approach for high-incidence, resource-limited countries, which are primarily low- and lower-middle-income countries.</span></p>

</p>
<p>
DESCOVY for PrEP is indicated in at-risk adults and adolescents (≥35 kg) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection, excluding individuals at risk from receptive vaginal sex. HIV-1–negative status must be confirmed immediately prior to initiation.
</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
    <li>
    Limitation of Use: DESCOVY FOR PrEP is not indicated in individuals at risk of HIV-1 from receptive vaginal sex because effectiveness in this population has not been evaluated by the U.S. FDA.

<strong>BOXED WARNING: RISK OF DRUG RESISTANCE WITH USE OF DESCOVY FOR PrEP IN UNDIAGNOSED EARLY HIV-1 INFECTION and POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B</strong>
</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
    <li>
    DESCOVY FOR PrEP must be prescribed only to individuals confirmed to be HIV negative immediately prior to initiation and at least every 3 months during use. Drug-resistant HIV-1 variants have been identified with use of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) for HIV-1 PrEP following undetected acute HIV-1 infection. Do not initiate if signs or symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection are present unless HIV-negative status is confirmed
    </li>
    <li>
    Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in individuals infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) who discontinued products containing FTC and/or TDF and may occur with discontinuation of DESCOVY. Closely monitor hepatic function with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in individuals with HBV who discontinue DESCOVY. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Contraindication</strong>
</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
    <li>
    DESCOVY FOR PrEP is contraindicated in individuals with unknown or positive HIV status
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Warnings and precautions</strong>
</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
    <li>
    <strong>Comprehensive management to reduce risks:</strong>
    <ul class="bwlistcircle">
        <li>
        Use DESCOVY FOR PrEP to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection as part of a comprehensive strategy that includes adherence to daily dosing and safer sex practices, including condoms, to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>HIV-1 risk factors:</strong> Behavioral, biological, or epidemiologic HIV-1 risk factors may include, but are not limited to: condomless sex, past or current STIs, self-identified HIV risk, having sexual partners of unknown HIV-1 viremic status, or sexual activity in a high-prevalence area or network
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Reduce STI risk:</strong> Counsel on the use of STI prevention measures (e.g., consistent and correct condom use, knowledge of partner’s HIV-1 viremic status, regular testing for STIs)
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Reduce potential for drug resistance:</strong> Only prescribe DESCOVY FOR PrEP to individuals confirmed to be HIV negative immediately prior to initiation, at least every 3 months while taking DESCOVY, and upon an STI diagnosis. HIV-1 resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection who are taking only DESCOVY because DESCOVY alone is not a complete regimen for treating HIV-1
        </li>
        <li>
        Some HIV tests may not detect acute HIV infection. Prior to initiating DESCOVY FOR PrEP, ask individuals about potential recent exposure events. If recent (&lt;1 month) exposures are reported or suspected, or symptoms of acute HIV infection (e.g., fever, fatigue, myalgia, skin rash) are present, confirm HIV-negative status with a test approved by the FDA for use in the diagnosis of acute HIV infection
        </li>
        <li>
        If HIV-1 infection is suspected or if symptoms of acute infection are present while taking DESCOVY FOR PrEP, convert the DESCOVY FOR PrEP regimen to a complete HIV treatment regimen until HIV-negative status is confirmed by a test approved by the FDA for use in the diagnosis of acute HIV infection
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Counsel on adherence:</strong> Counsel individuals to strictly adhere to daily dosing, as efficacy is strongly correlated with adherence. Some individuals, such as adolescents, may benefit from more frequent visits and counseling
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>New onset or worsening renal impairment: </strong>Postmarketing cases of renal impairment, including acute renal failure, proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT), and Fanconi syndrome have been reported with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-containing products. Do not initiate DESCOVY in individuals with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt;30 mL/min. Individuals with impaired renal function and/or taking nephrotoxic agents (including NSAIDs) are at increased risk of renal-related adverse reactions. Discontinue DESCOVY in individuals who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome. Monitor renal function in all individuals (see Dosage and Administration section)
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis:</strong> Fatal cases have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including FTC and TDF. Discontinue use if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity develop, including hepatomegaly and steatosis in the absence of marked transaminase elevations
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Adverse reactions</strong>
</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
    <li>
    <strong>Most common adverse reactions</strong> (≥2%) in the DESCOVY FOR PrEP clinical trial were diarrhea, nausea, headache, fatigue, and abdominal pain
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Drug interactions</strong>
</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
    <li>
    <strong>Prescribing information:</strong> Consult the full Prescribing Information for DESCOVY for more information, warnings, and potentially significant drug interactions, including clinical comments
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Metabolism:</strong> Drugs that inhibit P-gp can increase the concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), a component of DESCOVY. Drugs that induce P-gp can decrease the concentrations of TAF, which may lead to loss of efficacy
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Drugs affecting renal function:</strong> Coadministration of DESCOVY with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of FTC and tenofovir and the risk of adverse reactions
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Dosage and administration</strong>
</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
    <li>
    <strong>Dosage:</strong> One tablet taken once daily with or without food
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>HIV screening:</strong> Test for HIV-1 infection immediately prior to initiating, at least every 3 months during use, and upon diagnosis of an STI (see Warnings and Precautions section)
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>HBV screening:</strong> Test for HBV infection prior to or when initiating DESCOVY

In order for that lender to make a profit and reduce risk to itself, it will charge interest on the principal — that is, the amount you borrowed.</p><p>Expressed as a percentage, a mortgage interest rate is essentially the cost of borrowing money. It can vary based on several factors, such as your <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/credit-score-needed-for-mortgage" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>credit score</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/what-is-your-dti-ratio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>debt-to-income ratio</u></a> (DTI), <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/first-time-homebuyer-down-payment-assistance?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>down payment</u></a>, loan amount and repayment term.</p><p>After getting a mortgage, you’ll typically receive an <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/first-time-homebuyers-mortgage-amortization-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>amortization schedule</u></a>, which shows your payment schedule over the life of the loan. It also indicates how much of each payment goes toward the principal balance versus the interest.</p><p>Near the beginning of the loan term, you’ll spend more money on interest and less on the principal balance. As you approach the end of the repayment term, you’ll pay more toward the principal and less toward interest.</p><p>Your mortgage interest rate can be either fixed or adjustable. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the rate will be consistent for the duration of the loan. With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate can fluctuate with the market.</p><p>Keep in mind that a mortgage’s interest rate is not the same as its annual percentage rate (APR). This is because an APR includes both the interest rate and any other lender fees or charges.</p><p>Mortgage rates change frequently — sometimes on a daily basis. Inflation plays a significant role in these fluctuations. Interest rates tend to rise in periods of high inflation, whereas they tend to drop or remain roughly the same in times of low inflation. Other factors, like the economic climate, demand and inventory can also impact the current average mortgage rates.</p><p>To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible’s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score.

Generally, they reserve the lowest rates for low-risk borrowers — that is, those with a higher credit score, income and down payment amount. Here are some other personal factors that may determine your mortgage rate:</p><ul><li>Location of the home</li><li>Price of the home</li><li>Your credit score and credit history</li><li>Loan term</li><li>Loan type (e.g., conventional or FHA)</li><li>Interest rate type (fixed or adjustable)</li><li>Down payment amount</li><li>Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio</li><li>DTI</li></ul><p>Other indirect factors that may determine the mortgage rate include:</p><ul><li>Current economic conditions</li><li>Rate of inflation</li><li>Market conditions</li><li>Housing construction supply, demand, and costs</li><li>Consumer spending</li><li>Stock market</li><li>10-year Treasury yields</li><li>Federal Reserve policies</li><li>Current employment rate</li></ul><h2><a name="how-to-compare-mortgage-rates" id="how-to-compare-mortgage-rates"></a>How to compare mortgage rates</h2><p>Along with certain economic and personal factors, the lender you choose can also affect your mortgage rate. Some lenders have higher average mortgage rates than others, regardless of your credit or financial situation. That’s why it’s important to compare lenders and loan offers.</p><p>Here are some of the best ways to compare mortgage rates and ensure you get the best one:</p><ul><li><strong>Shop around for lenders: </strong>Compare several lenders to find the best rates and lowest fees. Even if the rate is only lower by a few basis points, it could still save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.</li><li><strong>Get several loan estimates: </strong>A loan estimate comes with a more personalized rate and fees based on factors like income, employment, and the property’s location. Review and compare loan estimates from several lenders.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved for a mortgage: </strong><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/mortgage-preapproval?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-approval</a> doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a loan, but it can give you a better idea of what you qualify for and at what interest rate. You’ll need to complete an application and undergo a hard credit check.</li><li><strong>Consider a mortgage rate lock: </strong>A <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/money/lock-or-float-mortgage-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>mortgage rate lock</u></a> lets you lock in the current mortgage rate for a certain amount of time — often between 30 and 90 days. During this time, you can continue shopping around for a home without worrying about the rate changing.</li><li><strong>Choose between an adjustable- and fixed-rate mortgage: </strong>The interest rate type can affect how much you pay over time, so consider your options carefully.</li></ul><p>One other way to compare mortgage rates is with a mortgage calculator. Use a calculator to determine your monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan. Just remember, certain fees like homeowners insurance or taxes might not be included in the calculations.</p><p>Here’s a simple example of what a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might look like versus a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage:</p><h3>15-year fixed-rate</h3><ul><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>$300,000</li><li><strong>Interest rate: </strong>6.29%</li><li><strong>Monthly payment: </strong>$2,579</li><li><strong>Total interest charges: </strong>$164,186</li><li><strong>Total loan amount: </strong>$464,186</li></ul><h3>30-year fixed-rate</h3><ul><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>$300,000</li><li><strong>Interest rate: </strong>6.89%</li><li><strong>Monthly payment: </strong>$1,974</li><li><strong>Total interest charges: </strong>$410,566</li><li><strong>Total loan amount: </strong>$710,565</li></ul><h2><a name="pros-and-cons-of-mortgages" id="pros-and-cons-of-mortgages"></a>Pros and cons of mortgages</h2><p>If you’re thinking about taking out a mortgage, here are some benefits to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Predictable monthly payments: </strong>Fixed-rate mortgage loans come with a set interest rate that doesn’t change over the life of the loan. This means more consistent monthly payments.</li><li><strong>Potentially low interest rates: </strong>With good credit and a high down payment, you could get a competitive interest rate. Adjustable-rate mortgages may also come with a lower initial interest rate than fixed-rate loans.</li><li><strong>Tax benefits: </strong>Having a mortgage could make you eligible for certain tax benefits, such as a <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/mortgage-interest-deduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>mortgage interest deduction</u></a>.</li><li><strong>Potential asset: </strong>Real estate is often considered an asset. As you pay down your loan, you can also build home equity, which you can use for other things like debt consolidation or home improvement projects.</li><li><strong>Credit score boost: </strong>With on-time payments, you can build your credit score.</li></ul><p>And here are some of the biggest downsides of getting a mortgage:</p><ul><li><strong>Expensive fees and interest: </strong>You could end up paying thousands of dollars in interest and other fees over the life of the loan. You will also be responsible for maintenance, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/property-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>property taxes</u></a>, and homeowners insurance.</li><li><strong>Long-term debt: </strong>Taking out a mortgage is a major financial commitment. Typical loan terms are 10, 15, 20, and 30 years.</li><li><strong>Potential rate changes: </strong>If you get an <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/adjustable-rate-mortgage-definition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>adjustable rate</u></a>, the interest rate could increase.</li></ul><h2><a name="how-to-qualify-for-a-mortgage" id="how-to-qualify-for-a-mortgage"></a>How to qualify for a mortgage</h2><p>Requirements vary by lender, but here are the typical steps to qualify for a mortgage:</p><ol><li><strong>Have steady employment and income: </strong>You’ll need to provide proof of income when applying for a home loan. This may include money from your regular job, alimony, military benefits, commissions, or Social Security payments. You may also need to provide proof of at least two years’ worth of employment at your current company.</li><li><strong>Review any assets: </strong>Lenders consider your assets when deciding whether to lend you money. Common assets include money in your bank account or investment accounts.</li><li><strong>Know your DTI: </strong>Your DTI is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward your monthly debts — like installment loans, lines of credit, or rent. The lower your DTI, the better your approval odds.</li><li><strong>Check your credit score: </strong>To get the best mortgage rate possible, you’ll need to have good credit. However, each loan type has a different credit score requirement. For example, you’ll need a credit score of 580 or higher to qualify for an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment.</li><li><strong>Know the property type: </strong>During the loan application process, you may need to specify whether the home you want to buy is your primary residence. Lenders often view a primary residence as less risky, so they may have more lenient requirements than if you were to get a secondary or investment property.</li><li><strong>Choose the loan type: </strong>Many types of mortgage loans exist, including conventional loans, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/va-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>VA loans</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/usda-loans-what-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>USDA loans</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/how-to-use-fha-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>FHA loans</u></a>, and jumbo loans. Consider your options and pick the best one for your needs.</li><li><strong>Prepare for upfront and closing costs: </strong>Depending on the loan type, you may need to make a down payment. The exact amount depends on the loan type and lender. A USDA loan, for example, has no minimum down payment requirement for eligible buyers. With a conventional loan, you’ll need to put down 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI). You may also be responsible for paying any closing costs when signing for the loan.</li></ol><h2><a name="how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage" id="how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage"></a>How to apply for a mortgage</h2><p>Here are the basic steps to apply for a <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/what-is-a-mortgage?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mortgage</a>, and what you can typically expect during the process:</p><ol><li><a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/money/some-of-the-best-mortgage-lenders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Choose a lender</u></strong></a><strong>: </strong>Compare several lenders to see the types of loans they offer, their average mortgage rates, repayment terms, and fees. Also, check if they offer any down payment assistance programs or closing cost credits.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved: </strong>Complete the pre-approval process to boost your chances of getting your dream home. You’ll need identifying documents, as well as documents verifying your employment, income, assets, and debts.</li><li><strong>Submit a formal application: </strong>Complete your chosen lender’s application process — either in person or online — and upload any required documents.</li><li><strong>Wait for the lender to process your loan: </strong>It can take some time for the lender to review your application and make a decision. In some cases, they may request additional information about your finances, assets, or liabilities. Provide this information as soon as possible to prevent delays.</li><li><strong>Complete the closing process: </strong>If approved for a loan, you’ll receive a closing disclosure with information about the loan and any closing costs. Review it, pay the down payment and closing costs, and sign the final loan documents. Some lenders have an online closing process, while others require you to go in person.

<li>NIO CEO William Li expressed his opposition to the additional tariffs imposed by the European Union on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), stating that the tariffs are "not right" and a "conflict of logic".</li>
<li>The additional tariffs, which range from 21% to 38.1%, will be imposed on Chinese EVs imported to Europe starting next month, with NIO and other Chinese battery electric vehicle (BEV) makers paying a 21% average tariff.</li>
<li>Despite the additional tariffs, NIO's upcoming Firefly sub-brand will still be competitive in Europe, according to NIO CEO William Li.</li>
<li>The additional tariffs will negatively impact Chinese carmakers' incentives to export EVs to Europe, and NIO's plans to launch its Firefly sub-brand in Europe may need to be reassessed.</li>
<li>The final decision on the additional tariffs is expected to be announced by October or November, although NIO has already expressed its opposition to the tariffs and stated that its commitment to Europe remains unchanged.</li>

<p>Nio (NYSE: NIO) founder, chairman, and CEO William Li expressed his opposition to the additional tariffs imposed by the European Union on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), while noting that even so, the company's upcoming models under its third brand, codenamed Firefly, will still be competitive in Europe.</p>
<p>"The EU originally imposed a 10 percent tariff on Chinese EVs, and now an additional 21 percent has been added, raising it to 31 percent, which is definitely not right," Li said at a user communication event in Tianjin on June 19, according to a video seen by CnEVPost.</p>
<p>Europe is a global role model for clean energy and sustainability, but now imposing additional tariffs on Chinese EVs is a conflict of logic, he said.</p>

<p>Li also noted that the additional tariffs are not yet decisive and a final decision will be announced by October or November.</p>
<p>The European Commission <a href="https://cnevpost.com/2024/06/12/eu-to-impose-additional-tariffs-on-chinese-evs/">announced on June 12</a> that it would impose additional provisional tariffs on EVs imported from China starting next month, varying by carmaker and reaching up to 38.1 percent.</p>
<p>Nio and a number of other Chinese battery electric vehicle (BEV) makers that cooperated with the investigation but were not sampled will pay an additional 21 percent weighted average tariff.</p>
<p>On the day the decision was announced, Nio said it strongly opposed the additional European tariffs and emphasized that its <a href="https://cnevpost.com/2024/06/12/nio-commitment-to-europe-remains-unwavering/">commitment to Europe remained unchanged</a>.</p>
<p>The additional tariffs will inevitably hit Chinese carmakers' incentives to export EVs to Europe, and for Nio, its Firefly sub-brand, which it had planned to launch in Europe first, will need to make new weighing.</p>
<p>"We certainly don't want to end up with so many additional tariffs, but if that's what's ultimately decided, then for Firefly, even with these additional tariffs, it will still be competitive in Europe," Li said in the user communication yesterday.</p>
<p>"Even if we are going to be hit with so many tariffs, we still have a chance, we are still competitive, but of course it will affect some sales and profits," he said.</p>
<p>Li noted that in the long run, the internationalization of car companies will need to rely on localized operations.</p>
<p>"The initial volume may not be enough to support (localized operations), which would not be cost-effective, but if a certain volume is reached, say 100,000 units, local production should be carried out," he said.</p>
<p>After reaching a certain local volume, Nio will actively consider local plans, "It's something that has to be done to go global," Li said.</p>
<p>It's like companies in Europe and the US that would build factories in China if they thought the Chinese market was big enough, he added.</p>
<p>In January 2023, Nio co-founder and president Qin Lihong confirmed the existence of the new brand Firefly at a user event and said the brand was aimed at the small car as well as micro car market.</p>
<p>Firefly models will be priced in the range of RMB 100,000 ($13,780) to RMB 200,000, and are expected to debut in the European market in the third quarter of 2024, Qin said at the time.</p>
<p>In an interview with local media earlier this year in May, Qin said the third brand's products were ready, but the launch of the new brand would be delayed until the second quarter of 2025, given the overall brand sequence.</p>
<p>Nio had originally planned to launch the Firefly brand first in Europe, but has now changed its strategy and will speed up the launch of the new brand and launch it first in China, according to <a href="https://cnevpost.com/2024/06/06/nio-firefly-1st-model-to-debut-in-china-instead-of-europe/">a June 6 report</a> by local media outlet 21jingji.</p>
<p>Firefly's first model will make its debut in China, likely at the end of this year, before launching in Europe in the first half of next year, the report said, citing multiple sources.</p>
<p>The sub-brand's mobile app is expected to go live in December, according to the report.</p>

              </figcaption></figure><p>CDK Global, a company that provides auto dealerships across the U.S. with software for managing sales and other services, has been hacked, prompting the company to temporarily shut down most of its systems. </p><p>That is effectively preventing about 15,000 car dealerships from making sales. General Motors dealerships rely on CDK's systems, as does Group 1 Automotive, an auto retailer with hundreds of dealerships across the U.S. Holman, with dealerships across eight U.S. states, is another CDK client. </p><p>"We are actively investigating a cyber incident," a CDK spokesperson told CBS News on Wednesday. "Out of an abundance of caution and concern for our customers, we have shut down most of our systems and are working diligently to get everything up and running as quickly as possible." </p>    
  <p>Later on Wednesday afternoon, CDK said that after conducting tests and consulting with third-party experts, some of its systems were back up and running. </p><p>"With the work done so far, our core [dealer management system] and Digital Retailing solutions have been restored. We are continuing to conduct extensive tests on all other applications, and we will provide updates as we bring those applications back online," CDK said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. </p>

    </p>
<p>However, CDK told CBS MoneyWatch on Thursday afternoon that its systems were once again offline, after it suffered another cyberattack on Wednesday. </p><p>"Late in the evening of June 19, we experienced an additional cyber incident and proactively shut down most of our systems," the spokeperson said. "In partnership with third party experts, we are assessing the impact and providing regular updates to our customers. We remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible."</p><p>Calls to a CDK customer support hotline produced a continuous busy signal. But the company's automated recording said the outage could affect dealerships for days, according to <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/cyberattack-disrupts-auto-dealerships-across-us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PC Mag</a>. The message told callers, "At this time, we do not have an estimated time frame for resolution and therefore our dealers' systems will not be available likely for several days," the publication reported.</p><p>The number of cyberattacks has been on the rise in the last year, with more than 3,200 data breaches in 2023, a 78% jump from the prior year, according to a new study from data firm <a href="https://soax.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">SOAX</a>. Those breaches impacted more than 65 million victims last year, it added.</p>

<p>CDK's dealer management system, or DMS, is a hub that lets businesses monitor operations from a single interface, while its retail tools let dealerships transact online and in showrooms. </p><h2>What is CDK? </h2><p>CDK provides dealerships with tools to manage payroll, inventory and office operations. </p><p>On its website, it also touts its cybersecurity capabilities. "CDK Cybersecurity Solutions provide a three-tiered cybersecurity strategy to prevent, protect and respond to cyberattacks so you can defend your dealership," it says. </p><h2>When did the cyberattack begin?</h2><p>The cyberattack on CDK Global began Tuesday evening, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cdk-global-cyberattack-impacts-thousands-of-us-car-dealerships/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Bleeping Computer</a>, a cybersecurity news site, reported Wednesday, taking the 15,000 car dealerships it serves offline.  </p><p>As mentioned above, CDK said it suffered another cyberattack on Wednesday evening.</p><p>It is not currently known who, or what group, is behind the cyberattack. </p><h2>How are dealerships responding?</h2><p>Some dealerships appeared to get creative to continue doing business during the outage. Dealership employees posted about the outage on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/1djl7iy/comment/l9blify/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Reddit</a> Wednesday, sharing that they were relying on spreadsheets and sticky notes to sell customers small parts and make repairs, but that they weren't making any large transactions. </p>

Chili’s introduced an ad campaign that calls out the Big Mac and other fast-food burgers for their prices. Dine Brands CEO John Peyton <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/08/applebees-owner-dine-brands-targets-fast-food-customers.html">told CNBC</a> in May that Applebee’s has been leaning into deals to win over fast-food diners.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>On Darden’s quarterly earnings call Thursday, Cardenas told analysts that industry data is showing “a little bit of a shift from [quick-service restaurants] to some of those competitors” in casual dining.</p><p>As of May, full-service menu prices had risen 3.5% over the last 12 months, compared with a 4.5% increase for those of limited-service eateries, according to Department of Labor data. The overall <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/12/cpi-report-june-inflation.html">consumer price index</a> rose 3.3% in that period.</p><p>Consumers have been feeling the pinch of the more than two years of price hikes, even with fast-food chains, which typically benefit from tougher economic environments because consumers trade down to their cheaper meals. But both full-service restaurants and grocers alike have been highlighting their own value compared to fast-food meals, whether it’s the actual price or the overall experience and quality.</p><p>In particular, <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-6"><a href="/quotes/MCD/">McDonald’s</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> has faced backlash from customers, social media users and even House Republicans for its higher prices. In an open letter in late May, the company’s U.S. president, <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-stories/article/providing-meaningful-value-to-our-fans-with-a-side-of-facts.html" target="_blank">Joe Erlinger, hit back</a> at critics claiming its menu prices have doubled, saying its prices are up<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/29/mcdonalds-cost-increases.html"> 40%</a> since 2019.</p><p>Even so, the company has taken steps to try to appeal to price-conscious diners. On Thursday, McDonald’s announced a new $5 <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/15/mcdonalds-5-value-meal-starts-june-25-last-about-a-month.html">value meal</a>, plus free French fries on Fridays with any purchase of at least $1 for its mobile app customers.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>Darden has been using a different strategy to win over diners. It has leaned on television advertising and kept its overall pricing lower than inflation to attract customers. In its fiscal fourth quarter, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/20/darden-restaurants-dri-q4-2024-earnings.html">company reported</a> flat same-store sales growth and weaker-than-expected revenue, although its earnings beat Wall Street’s estimates.</p><p>Cardenas said the company has dealt with a “consistently weaker consumer environment,” as well as increased discounting and marketing pressure from its rivals. Still, executives touted that its restaurants are outperforming the broader casual-dining segment.</p><p>Shares of Darden rose more than 1% in morning trading on Thursday. The company’s stock has fallen 6% this year, dragged down by concerns about the consumer environment.</p></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

<li><strong>Gas-powered leaf blowers are being banned or restricted</strong>: Communities across America are passing laws to curb the use of gas-powered leaf blowers due to their loud noise, air pollution, and environmental impact.</li>
<li><strong>The move is part of a broader push to reduce fossil fuel use</strong>: The ban on gas-powered leaf blowers is part of a larger effort to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and transition to cleaner energy sources.</li>
<li><strong>The leaf blower industry is pushing back</strong>: The industry is complaining about the increased costs and decreased performance of battery-powered leaf blowers, which are being mandated by government regulations.</li>
<li><strong>The switch to battery-powered blowers is a challenge</strong>: The new regulations are forcing manufacturers to develop and produce battery-powered leaf blowers, which some argue may not perform as well as their gas-powered counterparts.</li>
<li><strong>Local residents are driving the push for change</strong>: Activists like Jessica Stolzberg, who helped pass a ban on gas-powered leaf blowers in her hometown of Montclair, New Jersey, are leading the charge for reduced noise and pollution in their communities.</li>

wires fell on the tracks a few miles from New York Penn Station, halting trains along the nation's busiest stretch of rail at the worst possible time — 5:05 p.m.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Chatham resident, who commutes daily on the Morris &amp; Essex line to her Manhattan job, waited an hour at New York Penn Station on May 22 before finding out all trains were canceled. She and hordes of others made their way to the nearest PATH station, where every train car was 10 to 20 people deep. So she had to wait for the next train.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Amid pushing and shoving, she eventually boarded another packed train out of Hoboken — after almost getting smacked in the face by another rider's backpack — only to have it stop at the next station because of a medical emergency.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">She was at the three-hour mark by then.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong><em>Story continues below photo gallery</em></strong></p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/new-york/2024/05/21/gateway-hudson-tunnel-photos/73788136007/" data-t-l=":l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project on track for 2038 completion" data-g-r="nav_mo" data-g-tn="pgcss" data-g-mtn="pg73788136007" data-g-moh="hpgm" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" data-c-id="73788136007"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/21/PNJM/73788138007-050924-gateway-tunnell-002.JPG?crop=4971,2797,x0,y258&amp;width=660&amp;height=372&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/21/PNJM/73788138007-050924-gateway-tunnell-002.JPG?crop=4971,2797,x0,y258&amp;width=1320&amp;height=744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt=""><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="25"><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg__ca"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"></use></svg><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_expand"></use></svg></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project on track for 2038 completion" aria-label="Scenes from the Manhattan side of the Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project, Thursday, May 9, 2024."></p></a><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Her 10-mile journey home ultimately took four hours.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Over the course of just three days, NJ Transit and Amtrak commuters endured a litany of hours-long, haphazard commutes because of equipment failures along three bridges or tunnels whose average age is 105 and overhead wires, or catenary, that predates the 1950s. Journeying on aging, deteriorated and long-neglected infrastructure to get to and from New York Penn Station has — yet again — become a predictably unpredictable odyssey. And the end isn’t near.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Michelle's commute the morning before took three hours as trains were delayed and canceled because NJ Transit’s pantograph, the equipment atop the train that distributes power, became ensnared with the overhead wire.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That week’s commuting problems didn’t end there.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">May 23, the day after the downed wires, was little better as customers dealt with residual delays and cancellations because train equipment was not where it needed to be. Crews were also short because they worked too many hours the day before and couldn’t work the next day. Before noon, there were new wire versus pantograph issues and signal problems cropped up at the 89-year-old Dock Bridge outside Newark Penn Station, causing new layers of delays and travel chaos.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And the night cap? During the evening rush hour, the 114-year-old Portal Bridge, which carries trains over the Hackensack River, had to open for marine traffic, causing more delays.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Déjà vu from ‘Summer of Hell’ circa 2017?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">NJ Transit and Amtrak customers are trapped in this commuting purgatory for at least another 10 years as the decades-old assets on the notorious 10-mile stretch of rail between Newark Penn Station and New York Penn Station slowly get replaced, repaired and reinforced.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">As the northeast endures an extreme heat wave this week, wire versus pantograph issues have already cropped up, forcing New York Penn Station to close during the morning rush Tuesday. Delays and commuting headaches were felt up and down the corridor all day, with an Amtrak train breaking down in Penn during the evening rush hour.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Michelle, a veteran commuter who has endured the far-reaching effects of the erratic Northeast Corridor for a decade, said the recent problems are reminiscent of 2017, when delays and cancellations snowballed in the first few months of the year. (She didn't provide her last name because of her employer's corporate media policy.)</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong><em>Story continues below video</em></strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">By the end of April that year, there were two minor derailments in New York Penn Station and Amtrak officials decided to accelerate more than three years of planned work into eight weeks, a period known as the “Summer of Hell” because it required cancellations and train diversions to other stations.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The problems unfolding today are not a direct comparison to 2017. Today’s issues are largely related to signals, wires and NJ Transit’s pantographs, while the major problems that led to the emergency work in 2017 were derailments due to track problems in New York Penn Station.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In the first four months of 2017, NJ Transit canceled 708 trains because of Amtrak-related issues, according to the agency — NJ Transit shares the use of Amtrak-owned rail routes on the busiest stretch of track in the state between Philadelphia and New York. In the first four months of this year, NJ Transit says 329 of its trains were canceled because of Amtrak.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The May 22 incident alone impacted 155 NJ Transit and 29 Amtrak trains over two days.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Michelle remembers 2017 being a long, painful summer as the repairs were completed, but said she would endure another weeks-long period of repairs — if it meant getting improved service faster.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/-mm-/ec24e72fa705b4d2b09163c69be434c3cc037b01/c=0-0-2400-1356/local/-/media/2017/07/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636353093280579110-commute001.JPG?width=660&amp;height=373&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/-mm-/ec24e72fa705b4d2b09163c69be434c3cc037b01/c=0-0-2400-1356/local/-/media/2017/07/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636353093280579110-commute001.JPG?width=1320&amp;height=746&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Commuters arrive at the 33rd St. Path in Manhattan from Hoboken during the height of Monday morning's commute.

Meetings like the one earlier this month were frank, but productive, according to Corbett.

It will be headed by Amtrak's Williams and Jim Sincaglia, NJ Transit’s senior vice president of rail, but Corbett said the most important thing is it will bring together the people underneath them, the ones who are “going to make a difference” to prevent and respond to the incidents that affect commuters.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This is in addition to weekly updates Amtrak provides NJ Transit on progress regarding routine upgrades and repairs, the result of another fiasco last July when <a href="/story/news/transportation/2023/07/20/amtrak-explains-why-400-nj-trains-were-canceled-or-delayed-in-july/70435525007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">three Amtrak wire incidents led to days of outages</a> and more than 400 trains cancelled or delayed.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“We’re going to be outlining, with NJT, how to increase the level of maintenance, but also more importantly the programmatic work or basically the production work where we would actually replace wire and things like that,” Williams said. “Unfortunately, to really get the ability and the productivity to do that, you've got to have time on the railroad at night.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This new group will help ensure more repair work can get done on the Northeast Corridor by bringing together the people who can work out four essential things: the most urgent problems in need of fixing; overnights or weekends when some trains may get canceled so more work can get done; ensuring there are enough people to complete the work; and identifying root causes of problems “and solve it without trying to nail anybody, but just to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Corbett said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Corbett hopes this group will be able to take project ideas to replace catenary or bury signal wires, which were expected to take place in at least five years, and accelerate them — or prioritize them over other projects — so they can reap benefits in the near-term.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Dock Bridge is not a major cause of delays," Corbett said as an example. "It’s much more important that they accelerate the catenary and signal projects than prioritizing a <a href="/story/news/transportation/2023/05/01/gateway-projects-nj-ny-need-money/70154830007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">project like Dock Bridge</a> — so that’s the kind of issues we’re working through.”</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/presto/2023/04/27/PNJM/564b340c-403c-4d16-928e-e0eafaa07a34-042723_Newark_rail_TZ_53857.JPG?width=660&amp;height=372&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/presto/2023/04/27/PNJM/564b340c-403c-4d16-928e-e0eafaa07a34-042723_Newark_rail_TZ_53857.JPG?width=1320&amp;height=744&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Dock Bridge next to Newark Penn Station over the Passaic River in Newark, NJ on Thursday April 27, 2023."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Dock Bridge next to Newark Penn Station over the Passaic River in Newark, NJ on Thursday April 27, 2023. " data-c-credit="Tariq Zehawi/NorthJersey.com"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Having the manpower to take full advantage of planned outages has been a challenge for Amtrak. Though they’ve made strides in hiring, extensive training must take place before certain skilled workers can be on a high-voltage railroad job site, so those who are qualified end up on large-scale projects rather than routine outages for repairs.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">NJ Transit is developing a pilot program to lend Amtrak some of their workforce to assist with some repairs during outages.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">If Amtrak and NJ Transit can come to agreements on outages, manpower and prioritizing new projects, the final hurdle will be paying for it, which will lead to a different debate: money<strong>.</strong></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Should NJ Transit’s annual payments to Amtrak be used for what it considers to be state-of-good-repair work, like upgrading catenary and signals? Or, as Amtrak’s Gardner and Williams have said, will more money be needed from New Jersey because some of NJ Transit’s annual state-of-good-repair money is going to <a href="/story/news/transportation/2024/05/13/portal-bridge-project-50-finished-date-on-budget/73677227007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">construction payments on Portal North Bridge</a>?</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Improving trickle-up communication</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">One critical area everyone agrees needs work is to improve communications to customers when unexpected outages occur.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">For Amtrak, it’s getting information from the ground-level once a problem is identified and into the devices of customers on stalled trains or waiting on platforms.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Until we get people at these locations and can verify what occurred and are actually starting to fix it, we don’t have a good feel for how long this is going to be,” Williams said. “We have to figure out how to communicate despite that and give our customers as much information as we can.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">NJ Transit is also often in the dark during incidents like what occurred on May 22. That delays agency officials from communicating to their customers about whether delayed trains get canceled, making plans for cross-honoring with PATH, preparing staff at Hoboken or Port Authority Bus Terminal for a deluge of customers, or setting up emergency bus service between stops.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Corbett said the working group will also try to develop a system so NJ Transit can send people out with Amtrak when an incident occurs so they can get information up the chain faster.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“We want to be in there with them at the incident so we can communicate out,” Corbett said. “We’re having further meetings about how to really drill that down so that it’s not just ad hoc response, but to be ahead of the curve, rather than us waiting and pressing them usually under a heated sense of urgency.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Without information, Michelle said, tempers rise as crowds swell in overcrowded New York Penn Station or when frustrated commuters are racing one another to board packed buses and PATH trains.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“If they don’t improve communication, I’m genuinely concerned for the welfare of the public-facing NJ Transit employees that have to deal with the worst complainers and don’t get home for hours right along with us — especially when the fare hikes go into effect, people are going to be fuming,” she said.</p></div></div>
