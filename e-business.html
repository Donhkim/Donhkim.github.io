    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tesla shareholders reapproved Elon Musk's record-breaking pay pact</strong>: Despite controversy, Tesla shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of Musk's $56 billion compensation package, with 72% of votes cast in its favor (excluding Musk and his brother Kimbal).</li>
<li><strong>Removing a hurdle for Tesla's stock</strong>: The vote removes a potential overhang on Tesla's stock, which could lead to a surge in share prices. Some analysts believe the removal of this overhang could boost the company's valuation to north of $1 trillion in 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Analysts optimistic about Tesla's future</strong>: Analysts such as Nick Colas and Dan Ives are optimistic about Tesla's future, citing the removal of the overhang and the company's focus on execution. Ives predicted that Tesla's stock could reach $350 over the next 12-18 months.</li>
<li><strong>Musk's leadership and vision</strong>: Colas noted that keeping talented leaders at the helm of companies is crucial, citing the example of Open AI's firing of Sam Altman. Tesla shareholders have chosen to "keep Musk" and his vision for the company.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on execution and new technologies</strong>: With the controversy surrounding Musk's compensation package resolved, Tesla can now focus on executing its plans for autonomous and full self-driving (FSD) technologies, which are expected to drive growth and valuation in the near future.</li>

But this is the reason why every one of these is happening. But, I do deliver in the end. That’s what’s important.”</p><p>With the upcoming Tesla robotaxi, Musk said some vehicles in the fleet would be owned by Tesla, while others would be owned by customers. Tesla owners would have something akin to “Airbnb” functionality with their cars, Musk said, giving them control over their vehicles' timing and frequency of participation in the robotaxi network.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Research firms like Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest see robotaxis as the main driver for the company's long-term $2,600 price target.</p><p>“ARK estimates that nearly 90% of Tesla’s enterprise value and earnings will be attributed to the robotaxi business in 2029,” ARK analyst Tasha Keeney wrote in a note. “Meanwhile, electric vehicles could approximate a quarter of total sales and ~10% of Tesla’s earnings potential, as we believe the robotaxi business will have much higher margins.”</p><p>Tesla’s robotaxi reveal event is set for Aug. 8.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-1">Visitors view the Tesla Bot humanoid robot of Tesla "Optimus" at the 2023 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, China, July 6, 2023.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 that experienced a potentially dangerous movement known as a "Dutch roll" while in flight.</li>
<li>The FAA is also investigating the use of potentially falsified documents to certify the use of titanium in Boeing planes, which has emerged amid concerns over the safety record of Boeing planes.</li>
<li>Boeing has acknowledged that the titanium issue is "industry-wide" and involves shipments from a limited set of suppliers, but has emphasized that tests performed so far indicate that the correct alloy was used, despite the false documentation.</li>
<li>Boeing has begun removing any affected parts from planes prior to delivery and has assured that the in-service fleet can continue to fly safely.</li>
<li>The FAA and other regulators are working to determine the scope of the issue and will "not hesitate to take action" to address the problem, with the Canadian transportation safety officials saying they are working with foreign regulators to develop a co-ordinated approach to the titanium issue.</li>

The time elapsed since the incident, and the absence of airworthiness action on the fleet, suggest that this is a one-off, not another widespread problem for Boeing," said Tim Atkinson, a former UK accident investigator-turned-consultant.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Safety campaigners have raised alarm about the quality of recent planes produced by Boeing. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">An incident in which a panel broke off a plane in mid-air in January reignited concerns, sparking lawsuits and increased oversight of Boeing. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Boeing has slowed its production and last month presented the FAA with an action plan aimed at resolving the issues. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><i id="theo-leggett-contributed-to-this-article." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog">Theo Leggett contributed to this article. </i></p></div></div>

<li>The US Space Force has chosen Blue Origin, a company founded by Jeff Bezos, to compete for launch missions worth up to $5.6 billion over the next five years, alongside incumbent providers United Launch Alliance and SpaceX.</li>
<li>The National Security Space Launch (NSSL) contracts, announced on June 13, mark a new strategy for space launch, with a dual-lane approach that allows for more competition and innovation in the market.</li>
<li>The two lanes are: Lane 1 for commercial-like missions, geared towards new providers, and Lane 2 for firms whose rockets meet more stringent security and performance requirements.</li>
<li>Blue Origin's entry into the market is due to the Space Force's new strategy for space launch, known as NSSL Phase 3, which aims to boost competition in the launch business.</li>
<li>Companies including Firefly Aerospace, Rocket Lab, and Relativity Space are developing launch vehicles with Lane 1 in mind, and newcomers can bid to join the pool after their rockets fly at least once.</li>

        <p>The <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/have-passport/renew-online.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. State Department</a> recently announced it is beta testing a public-facing program that enables would-be travelers to renew passports online.</p>
<p>As of this week, people who want to renew their passports digitally can do so online. However, because the program is in trial mode, access is limited. It will only be available for a limited amount of time, beginning 1 p.m. (EST) and can only accept a limited number of applications each day.</p>
<p>According to the <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/have-passport/renew-online.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State Department’s website</a>:</p>
<p>“During the next several months, we plan to continue to limit the number of applications accepted each day so we can monitor the system’s performance in real time. This beta release during which we are limiting the daily applications is an important and standard part of the software development process.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time the State Department has test-driven the program. It first tested a similar program in 2022 but took it down in 2023. This time officials sound more optimistic about the outcome, promising there will be a “full launch” of the digital application process soon.</p>
<p>This move from the State Department is undoubtedly welcome news to anyone who has had to update their passports through the traditional — and sometimes cumbersome — process of renewing by mail. However, as <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.pymnts.com/digital-identity/2024/how-solving-for-digital-id-acceptance-could-transform-digital-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PYMNTS Intelligence reported earlier this year</a>, the agency may be a little behind the curve when compared to other government agencies.</p>
<p>There are now more than 20 U.S. states in the process of adopting mobile driver’s licenses for their residents. Arizona, Colorado, Georgia and Maryland also support mobile IDs on the iPhone’s Apple Wallet. Meanwhile, Utah, California and Iowa have each issued unique state-sponsored mobile IDs that run on native platforms (rather than third-party digital wallets).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the federal level, both <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202405/dhs-and-tsa-adjust-digital-strategies-with-biometrics-facial-recognition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the TSA and the Department of Homeland Security</a> are exploring the use of AI and biometrics to enhance their identification confirmation requirements, and the <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.pymnts.com/travel-payments/2024/new-us-passport-app-removes-friction-amid-business-leisure-travel-shifts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a> recently introduced an app enabling eligible travelers to submit their photo, travel documents and customs declaration information directly through their mobile devices to streamline entry into the U.S.</p>
<p>PYMNTS Intelligence data confirms U.S. consumers support efforts such as these.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-1960784 aligncenter" src="https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/digital-ID-verification-consumer-interest.png" alt="digital ID verification, consumer interest"></p>
<p>In our Digital Identity Tracker, “<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.pymnts.com/tracker/digital-identity-verification-theft-authentication-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advanced Identity Verification Accelerates Digital Onboarding</a>,” we found that 70% of U.S. adults are interested in advanced ID verification methods and 42% say that using such resources would positively impact the thrust they would have in the organization offering them.</p>
<p>As the report determined, the more familiar consumers become with advanced ID verification technologies, the more their interest they have in learning more about the technologies. As the figure above illustrates, on average, nearly 3 in 10 U.S. consumers are very or extremely interested in advanced tools like facial recognition, and that enthusiasm grows once people use the technology. Fifty-seven percent of consumers surveyed who have used advanced ID verification technology in the past are very or extremely interested in using them again, which suggests that familiarity may incubate further interest — perhaps because it helps put privacy concerns or other types of apprehension to rest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 61% of respondents say they had only slight interaction with the technologies, or none at all, suggesting organizations and agencies still have a lot of work to do in educating consumers about advanced ID verification technologies.</p>
<p>Such an investment in education may be worth it. As we found in completing our Digital Identity Tracker, consumers — whether preparing to travel around the globe or opening an account at their local financial institution — want frictionless and streamlined experiences. The more that agencies and businesses can do to deliver on this consumer demand, the sooner outdated and inefficient manual processes can be eliminated.</p>

<p><a href="https://fortune.com/company/broadcom/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/broadcom/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Broadcom</a>, an American semiconductor manufacturer, announced a 10-to-1 stock split and better-than-expected earnings in its <a href="https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2024-financial" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2024-financial" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">second-quarter earnings report</a> on Wednesday. In the report, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/broadcom/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/broadcom/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Broadcom</a> also projected $51 billion in sales for the 2024 fiscal year, slightly higher than anticipated. Shares soared that day in after-hours trading and were going for about $1,740 around 3 p.m. ET on Friday—about 16% higher than their Wednesday opening price near $1,500.</p>



<p>In a note to investors on Thursday, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/bank-of-america-corp/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/bank-of-america-corp/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Bank of America</a> boosted its target price for Broadcom shares to $2,000 and raised its 2025 fiscal year sales forecast to $59.9 billion, which would be a 16% year-over-year gain. BofA cited semiconductor sales and its acquisition of software firm VMWare last year.</p>



<p>“We reiterate Buy, consider it a top AI pick” along with Nvidia, the analysts wrote, citing Broadcom’s potential growth in custom chips, ethernet networking, and VMWare upsells.</p>



<p>If BofA’s prediction materializes, that would push Broadcom’s market cap past $1 trillion and into an exclusive club currently occupied by just six firms: <a href="https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/apple/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/apple/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Apple</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Nvidia</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Amazon</a>, Alphabet, and Meta.</p><p></p>



<p>Nvidia, valued near $3.25 trillion, is the only chip manufacturer to reach a 13-figure market cap. In just the past week, it overtook both Amazon and Alphabet, and last it week briefly nudged past Apple for the second spot behind Microsoft before retreating to third.</p>



 



<p>The dominance of Nvidia, a company unknown to many consumers, is both simple and complicated. The short answer is that it produces chips that are becoming essential to every corner of the economy. The longer answer is that for the past 15 years or so, developers have built code around Nvidia’s CUDA architecture, making it difficult to unravel.</p>



<p>Last year, over $4 billion was invested into 93 separate efforts to do so, according to PitchBook. And earlier this year, the Unified Acceleration Foundation, <a href="https://uxlfoundation.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://uxlfoundation.org/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">or UXL</a>, was formed by <a href="https://fortune.com/company/intel/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/intel/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Intel</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Google</a>, Arm, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/qualcomm/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/qualcomm/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Qualcomm</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/samsung-electronics/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/samsung-electronics/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Samsung</a>, and other tech companies to develop open-source software to free AI developers beholden to CUDA.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

<p>Just days after the EU Commission determined EVs imported from <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/china/">China</a> have an unfair advantage due to government subsidies and responding with higher tariffs, Germany, one of the region’s largest automotive markets, has spoken against the decision, stating the imposed tariffs could hurt the success of local automakers selling vehicles in China.</p>



<span id="more-367642"></span>



<p>It has been a long saga leading up to this week’s decision by the EU Commission that Chinese EVs have an unfair advantage in European markets following a probe that began last fall. While the probe was taking place behind closed doors, the EU was already <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/31/eu-delays-decision-on-chinese-ev-tariffs-european-parliament-elections/">threatening tariffs on Chinese imports</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the US didn’t need a probe (or many Chinese EV imports, for that matter) to impose its own steep tariffs. In retaliation, China threatened <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/24/china-threatens-tariffs-up-to-25-imports-retaliation-eu-probe-us-tariffs/">tariffs of up to 25%</a> on European-built models like those from Germany, for example, imploring the EU to play fair and not follow the US’ decision.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for China, the EU Commission confirmed the results of its probe, hailing EV imports as unfair due to local subsidies. As a result, it announced <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/06/12/how-new-eu-tariffs-impact-chinese-ev-makers-byd-nio/">plans to slap massive tariffs of up to 48%</a> on those incoming models that are just starting to hit their stride in new markets overseas.</p>



<p>Days later, Germany spoke out against the EU’s decision on tariffs, expressing hope there is still time to reach an agreement to avoid them. Or, at the very least, soften those percentages.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-germany-argues-chinese-tariffs-hurt-eu-automakers-too">Germany argues Chinese tariffs hurt EU automakers too</h2>



<p>Following the EU Commission’s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese EVs next month, the government of Germany is stepping up to try to mediate tensions and, ideally, stop the upcharges altogether.</p>



<p>Per <em>Automotive News Europe</em>, a spokesperson with ties to Berlin officials who requested anonymity said the group remains optimistic <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/germany-works-block-eu-tariffs-chinese-evs">the EU can resolve the issue</a> through direct talks with China. With allies overseas, Germany believes there’s still room (and time) to reverse or soften the tariffs, but both sides must compromise.</p>



<p>Germany’s strongest argument is that retaliatory tariffs against China may also hurt local OEMs, including Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group, and BMW – all of which rely heavily on sales in Asia, particularly China.</p>



<p>Mercedes-Benz is an especially popular automaker in China, and its G- and S-Class vehicles, in particular, have done well with those consumers. As the German automaker goes electric, Mercedes has seen EV growing sales in China and intends to bring <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/23/mercedes-unveils-2025-electric-g-class-with-4-motors-and-tank-turns/">its new all-electric G-Class</a> overseas this year. Germany argues the EU’s tariffs could throw a wrench in those plans as its local OEMs could face the eye-for-eye wrath from the Chinese government.</p>



<p>Germany’s Economy Minister Robert Habeck said there’s still time to stop this looming tariff escalation and will travel to China next week to discuss the issue with government officials.</p>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><figure class="caas-figure"></figure><p>Shares of luxury furniture company <strong>RH</strong> <span class="ticker">(NYSE: RH)</span> cratered on Friday after the company reported financial results for its fiscal first quarter of 2024. Management says it's "investing aggressively" in the business during "the worst housing market in 30 years," which is a tough way to inspire investors. As of 11:50 a.m. ET, RH stock was down 18%.</p><h2>RH's profits disappoint</h2><p>RH's Q1 ended on May 4. During the quarter, the company generated net revenues of $727 million. That was down by less than 2% year over year, which wasn't bad, considering the headwinds in the furniture space right now. But its profit margins disappointed.</p><p>RH's Q1 cost of goods sold was up compared to the prior-year quarter, even though its revenue was down. Its operating expenses were also up year over year, leading to an <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/o/operating-margin/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=b17cb766-789b-4a15-b944-d93d4f488876" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:operating margin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="13" data-v9y="0">operating margin</a> of just 7.5% compared with 13.4% in the same quarter of last year. This resulted in a lower profit than investors expected for RH, which is why the stock is dropping so sharply today.</p><h2>When will business pick back up?</h2><p>RH continues to open new locations, including expanding into Europe. It also plans to open a showroom for its bathroom brand, Waterworks, later this year. But this is illustrative of why things are difficult for the company right now. Its stores are usually quite large and are intended to showcase the luxury flavor of its offerings. This gives the business high fixed costs, and when sales slump, as they are now, so too does profitability.</p><p>RH may indeed be well positioned for when housing sales rebound, particularly when a rebound happens at the higher end of the real estate market. But it's unclear when that will happen exactly. Therefore, investors seem content with avoiding the uncertainty surrounding RH stock right now.</p><h2>Should you invest $1,000 in RH right now?</h2><p>Before you buy stock in RH, consider this:</p><p>The <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the <strong><a href="https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=dfec5bf1-1df2-49a1-bba3-e783ad8dd678&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-foolcom-sa-bbn-dyn%3Faid%3D8867%26amp%253Bsource%3Disaeditxt0010895%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D13885&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=b17cb766-789b-4a15-b944-d93d4f488876" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 best stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="0">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy now… and RH wasn’t one of them.

<li>Meta has put its plans for its AI assistant on hold in Europe after receiving objections from Ireland's privacy regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC).</li>
<li>The DPC asked Meta to delay training its large language models on content that had been publicly posted to Facebook and Instagram profiles.</li>
<li>Meta expressed disappointment with the request, citing that it had incorporated regulatory feedback and had informed European Data Protection Authorities since March.</li>
<li>Despite the pause, Meta will continue to work collaboratively with the DPC and has previously notified European users of its plans to collect their data and offered an opt-out option.</li>
<li>The article highlights that Google and OpenAI have already used data from Europeans to train AI, which Meta sees as a criticism of its own plans.</li>

                                        <p>DETROIT (AP) — A Tesla apparently operating on one of the company’s automated driving systems crashed into a parked police vehicle Thursday near Los Angeles, narrowly missing an officer who was managing traffic at another crash.</p><p>The Tesla driver told police in Fullerton, California, that he engaged the vehicle’s “self-drive” system and used his cell phone, according to a police statement. </p><p>The collision appears to be another in a long list of crashes in which Teslas using a partially automated driving system hit firetrucks or police cars parked on roads with flashing lights activated. In the Fullerton case, the officer also had put out flares, authorities said.</p><p>Police said the crash is still under investigation, but called the California driver’s conduct a “clear violation of responsible driving practices and California law.”</p><p>The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has made Tesla recall its “Full Self-Driving” and “Autopilot” systems, said Friday it is aware of the crash and has contacted Tesla for more information.</p>
    

<p>Although the driver told authorities he switched on “self-drive” mode, police said they have not confirmed whether he was using Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” or Autopilot systems. A message was left early Friday seeking comment from Tesla.</p>



<p>Neither “Full Self-Driving” nor Autopilot can drive themselves, and Tesla tells owners that they must be ready to intervene at all times. “Full Self-Driving,” which is being tested on public roads by volunteer Tesla owners, can take on most driving functions, even on city streets, the company says. Autopilot is supposed to keep vehicles from hitting objects in front of them, and keep them centered in their lanes. </p>
    
<p>Fullerton police said the officer saw the Tesla coming, and he and a police dispatcher who was riding with him were able to quickly move to the side of the road. “A potential disaster was averted,” police said in the statement.</p>
    

<p>The Tesla driver stayed at the scene of the crash, which happened near an intersection at 12:04 a.m. Thursday. The driver is cooperating with police. </p><p>Officers were investigating a fatal crash at the time the Tesla hit the police car, authorities said.</p><p>“While there are no laws against the ‘self-drive’ mode, all rules and laws of the road still apply to the driver while controlling the vehicle,” the statement said.</p><p>NHTSA began investigating Autopilot crashes into emergency vehicles in 2021, but closed the probe in April after Tesla agreed to recall the software and boost its driver monitoring functions. Later NHTSA began investigating whether the company’s recall actually worked. </p><p>In documents explaining why the investigation was ended, NHTSA said it ultimately found 467 crashes involving Autopilot resulting in 54 injuries and 14 deaths.</p><p>In addition, the agency found 75 crashes and one death involving “Full Self Driving.” It’s not clear whether the system was at fault. NHTSA last year made Tesla recall the software after finding that the system misbehaved around intersections and could violate traffic laws. </p><p>CEO Elon Musk said Thursday at Tesla’s annual shareholders meeting that the safety of “Full Self-Driving” is better per mile than human drivers, but he did not give full underlying data.</p>

 <div class="key-facts-element">
  <p>Musk, who described himself as “pathologically optimistic” and has a history of making bold claims about his companies that fail to materialize, previously said he thinks Tesla is the “best positioned of any humanoid robot maker” to produce the bots at scale and believes they could become the company’s most valuable asset by far and evidently valuable enough to spur a more than 40-fold increase to Tesla’s market capitalization.</p>
  <p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>
 </div>
 <div class="key-facts-element">
  <p>Animesh Garg, assistant professor of AI robotics at the Georgia Institute of Technology, told Forbes Musk’s timeline is “aggressive” but “realistic from a pure release perspective,” but said the question will be “how useful are the skills that ship out of the box,” particularly when it comes to breadth, generalizability and robustness.</p>
  <p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p>
 </div>
 <div class="key-facts-element">
  <p>To launch, Garg said he would expect Tesla to have a humanoid platform with limbs, though it’s “unclear how robust and useful” the hands will be, but would be surprised if Optimus could perform tasks beyond competent locomotion and skills like picking up objects that aren’t complicated to grasp, with other features like interacting with objects like windows and doors to possibly follow a year or two later.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="key-facts-element">
  <p>Jonathan Aitken, a roboticist at the University of Sheffield in the U.K., agreed Musk’s “timeline would be very challenging” and described 2025 as “ambitious but not out of the question,” saying that a lot depends on “the details of exactly what” Musk is suggesting for its applications.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="key-facts-element">
  <p>Christian Hubicki, a robotics professor at Florida State University, said he “wouldn’t be shocked to see some carefully prepared video demos of an Optimus doing some nominal tasks in a factory” by the end of the year but warned it will be “incredibly difficult” to get the bots into the hands of customers who will find them useful in that time.</p>

<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">What We Don’t Know</h2>
<p>Hubicki said there are several unknowns surrounding the humanoid robots of Tesla and its competitors like Boston Dynamics and Figure AI that are critical to evaluating their potential for use in the real world outside of glitzy, carefully staged demo videos. Foremost among these is reliability, he said, adding that “the only useful robot is a reliable robot.” Hubicki said this “is a problem for humanoids,” where control is still in the laboratory phase and hardware is fragile. “Will they work 90% of the time? 99%? How many 9’s are enough before they’re more useful in your production line than they are a hassle to fix and babysit? Those are the numbers I’d want to know from a humanoids company.”</p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">What’s The Point Of Humanoid Robots?</h2>
<p>Most of the built world is designed for humans and humanoid robots, by design, are well suited to this. While work environments and tasks can be challenging for robots with wheels or other designs to navigate, a humanoid could feasibly thrive and undertake kinds of work that are otherwise limited to humans or very specific machinery. The design imposes a number of formidable technical challenges for both hardware and software, including tasks most humans take for granted like movement and grasping objects. The current boom in AI is helping to drive the field forward, Aitken said, as generalizability is crucial to making humanoids viable tools. “We can't program a robot to pick up 1000 different objects by programming a process for each one individually,” he explained</p>

<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">What To Watch For</h2>
<p>It’s tough to imagine Musk’s claim that Optimus will one day overshadow Tesla’s other products will be realized at any point in the near future, robotics experts told Forbes, particularly its cars. For his part, Musk did not indicate a timeline for the enormous growth he expects Optimus will catalyze. Garg said humanoids are “unlikely to be cashflow positive anytime soon” and despite the hype, they lack a convincing use case that other emerging technologies like driverless cars have. They “will not likely come close to the car business in terms of revenue” for the next decade, he said. Aitken told Forbes “it's hard to see a humanoid competing seriously with the large industrial players in the sector” and questions whether they’d be able to do the kinds of “high-value, dull, dirty and dangerous” work that would motivate a company to invest. Hubicki said he “would not bet on that market approaching automotives for the foreseeable future.” While humanoid bots have “progressed impressively” in recent years, he said they lack a compelling use case suggesting “a massive market is imminent” and at the moment remain “a complicated technology for completing tasks we can already do better.”</p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" class="inread-active" display-called=""></fbs-ad>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Chief Critic</h2>
<p>Analyst Gordon Johnson, of GLJ research, said Musk’s claims were “absurd” and dismissed his year-end 2025 target for Optimus as “utter nonsense and borderline investor fraud.” Johnson said companies that have worked on humanoids for decades haven’t got anywhere close to “where Musk is claiming he will be by the end of 2025.” Optimus is a “pipe dream stock pump,” Johnson said. “There is no product.”</p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Forbes Valuation</h2>
<p>Musk is the world’s richest person and has a net <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/?sh=2c6554bd7999" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/?sh=2c6554bd7999" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/?sh=2c6554bd7999" aria-label="worth">worth</a> of $210.7 billion. Much of his wealth is tied up in Tesla, including a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars that a Delaware judge struck down. Tesla and Musk plan to fight the ruling and shareholders voted in favor of ratifying the deal, a step that could possibly help the company reinstate Musk’s compensation package.

<p>A group of Tesla investors yesterday sued Elon Musk, the company, and its board members, alleging that Tesla was harmed by Musk's diversion of resources to his xAI venture. The diversion of resources includes hiring AI employees away from Tesla, diverting microchips from Tesla to X (formerly Twitter) and xAI, and "xAI's use of Tesla's data to develop xAI's own software/hardware, all without compensation to Tesla," the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24747977/2024-06-13-e-filed-verified-stockholder-derivative-complaint-tesla-xai.pdf">lawsuit</a> in Delaware Court of Chancery was filed by three Tesla shareholders: the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund, Daniel Hazen, and Michael Giampietro. It seeks financial damages for Tesla and the disgorging of Musk's equity stake in xAI to Tesla.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>"Could the CEO of Coca-Cola loyally start a competing soft-drink company on the side, then divert scarce ingredients from Coca-Cola to the startup? Could the CEO of Goldman Sachs loyally start a competing financial advisory company on the side, then hire away key bankers from Goldman Sachs to the startup? Could the board of either company loyally permit such conduct without doing <em>anything</em> about it? Of course not," the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>Tesla and Musk have touted artificial intelligence "as the key to Tesla's future" and described Tesla as an AI company, the lawsuit said. By founding xAI, Musk started a competing company "and then divert[ed] talent and resources from his corporation to the startup," with the apparent approval of Tesla's board, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>After founding xAI in March 2023, "Musk hired away numerous key AI-focused employees from Tesla to xAI" and later diverted Nvidia GPUs from Tesla to X and xAI, the lawsuit said. The GPU diversion was recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/elon-musk-is-diverting-teslas-gpus-to-x-xai-nvidia-emails-say/">confirmed</a> by Nvidia emails that were revealed in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html">report by CNBC</a>.</p>
<h2>GPU diversion</h2>
<p>Before founding xAI, "Musk stated that Tesla needed more Nvidia H100 GPUs than Nvidia had available for sale, a common problem in the AI industry... After Musk established xAI, however, he began personally directing Nvidia to redirect GPUs from Tesla to xAI and X," the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>The investors suing Musk and Tesla don't buy Musk's justification. "For his part, Musk dubiously claimed in a post on X following the publication of the CNBC report that, contrary to his prior public representations about Tesla's appetite for Nvidia hardware, 'Tesla had no place to send the Nvidia chips to turn them on, so they would have just sat in a warehouse,'" the lawsuit said.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The complaint says that a pitch deck to potential investors in xAI said the new firm "intended to harvest data from X and Tesla to help xAI catch up to AI companies OpenAI and Anthropic. X would provide data from social media users, and Tesla would provide video data from its cars."</p>
<p>"It is apparent that Musk has pitched prospective investors in xAI partly by exploiting information owned by Tesla," the lawsuit also said. "On information and belief, Musk has already or intends to have xAI harvest data from Tesla without appropriately compensating Tesla even though X has already been provided xAI equity for its data contributions. None of this would be necessary if Musk properly created xAI as a subsidiary of Tesla."</p>
<p>We contacted Tesla today and will update this article if the company provides a response to the lawsuit. The filing of the complaint was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/13/tesla-shareholders-sue-musk-for-starting-competing-ai-company/">previously reported</a> by TechCrunch.</p>
<h2>Same court nullified Musk’s pay</h2>
<p>The Delaware Court of Chancery is the same one that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/elon-musks-56-billion-pay-plan-voided-as-shareholders-beat-tesla-in-court/">nullified</a> Elon Musk's 2018 pay package following a different investor lawsuit. Tesla shareholders yesterday <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/musk-says-hes-winning-tesla-shareholder-vote-on-pay-plan-by-wide-margin/">re-approved the $44.9 billion pay plan</a>, with <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000110465924071439/tm2413800d31_8k-gen.pdf">72 percent voting yes</a> on the proposal, but the re-vote doesn't end the legal battle over Musk's pay. Tesla shareholders also approved a corporate move from Delaware to Texas, which was proposed by Musk and Tesla after the pay-plan court ruling.</p>
<p>That drama factors into the lawsuit filed yesterday. After the pay ruling that effectively reduced Musk's stake in Tesla, "Musk accelerated his efforts to grow xAI" by "raising billions of dollars and poaching at least <em>eleven</em> employees from Tesla," the new lawsuit said. The lawsuit also points to Musk's threat "that he would only build an AI and robotics business within Tesla if Tesla gave him at least 25% voting power."</p>
<p>The lawsuit accuses Tesla's board of "permit[ting] Musk to create and grow xAI, hindering Tesla's AI development efforts and diverting billions of dollars in value from Tesla to xAI." The board's failure to act is alleged to be "an obvious breach of its members' unyielding fiduciary duty to protect the interests of Tesla and its stockholders."</p>
<p>The Tesla board members' close ties to Musk could play a key role in the case. In the pay-plan ruling, Delaware Court of Chancery Judge Kathaleen McCormick found that most of Tesla's board members were beholden to Musk or had compromising conflicts. The lawsuit filed yesterday points to the court's previous findings on those board members, including Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's brother; and James Murdoch, a longtime friend of Musk.</p>
