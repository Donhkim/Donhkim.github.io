    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>By David Shepardson</p><p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Security Administration said it had screened 2.99 million airline passengers on Sunday, the highest-ever number in a single day.</p><p>The agency said on Monday it expects to screen more than 32 million travelers during the 2024 Independence Day travel period that runs from Thursday through July 8, which is 5.4% higher than 2023 levels.</p><p>The TSA said it expects on Friday it will for the first time screen more than 3 million people, the busiest day expected during the upcoming holiday period. Sunday's record broke the prior high of 2.95 million set in late May, while seven of the 10 busiest travel days ever have occurred over the past month.</p><p>A group representing major U.S. airlines forecast record summer travel with airlines expected to transport 271 million passengers, up 6.3% from last year.</p><p>Industry group Airlines for America said U.S carriers plan to fly more than 26,000 daily flights this summer, up nearly 1,400 or 5.6% over 2023, when they carried 255 million passengers. The summer travel season forecast is for June 1 to Aug. 31.</p><p>The forecast comes as the Federal Aviation Administration is struggling to address a persistent shortage of air traffic controllers. Some airlines voluntarily trimmed New York flights last summer to address congestion issues and have raised new concerns about the lack of controllers.</p><p>The FAA said on June 5 it would again extend cuts to minimum flight requirements at congested New York City-area airports through October 2025, citing shortages of air traffic control staff.</p><p>The FAA said the number of controllers handling traffic in New York is insufficient for normal traffic levels and that without "increased flexibility," congestion, delays, and cancellations are likely at JFK, LaGuardia and Newark airports.</p><p>Under minimum flight requirements, airlines can lose their takeoff and landing slots at congested airports if they do not use them at least 80% of the time. The FAA's waiver allows airlines to fly fewer flights and still retain slots.</p><p>(Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Chris Reese and Matthew Lewis)</p></div></div>

  <p>CDK added in the note that it has started restoring its systems and expects the process of bringing major applications back online "to take several days and not weeks."</p><h2>Beware of phishing</h2><p>In its memo, the company also warned car dealerships to be alert to phishing scams, or entities posing as CDK but who are in fact bad actors trying to obtain proprietary information like customers' passwords. </p>

<p>Tom Maoli, owner of Celebrity Motor Car Company, which operates five luxury car dealerships across New York and New Jersey, on Monday told CBS MoneyWatch his employees "are doing everything manually."</p><p>"We are trying to keep our customers happy and the biggest issue is the banking side of things, which is completely backed up.

Additionally, thousands of private sector companies were targeted. Some experts believe that the only way to stop such attacks is to ban the payment of ransoms, which Emisoft said would lead bad actors to "quickly pivot and move from high impact encryption-based attacks to other less disruptive forms of cybercrime."</p><p>Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of State <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hive-ransomware-reward-government/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">offered $10 million in exchange for the identities</a></span> of leaders of the Hive ransomware gang, which since 2021 has been responsible for attacks on more than 1,500 institutions in over 80 countries, resulting in the theft of more than $100 million. </p>

    <div><div data-cy="article-content" class="rawHtml-content-no-nativo"><p>Andreessen Horowitz plans to raise its first private equity fund, according to disclosures reviewed by <em>Fortune</em>, in yet another sign of the venture capital giant’s push into new businesses.</p><p class="paywall-selector"></p><div class="paywall">



<p>The documents, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the end of March, say that the fund will be called a16z Perennial Private Equity Fund, and that it will “invest in the private equity asset class,” without revealing further details or a launch date. It’s unclear whether the fund will invest directly in companies or whether it will invest in third-party PE funds. </p>



<p>An a16z spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>



<p>The move into buyouts would be a notable shift for a16z, whose rise has been rooted squarely in the world of early-stage venture capital, where Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz made their initial wealth as founders during the early days of the internet, then later as investors. A16z has been <a href="https://fortune.com/longform/andreessen-horowitz-beyond-silicon-valley/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/longform/andreessen-horowitz-beyond-silicon-valley/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">expanding its scope</a> into other areas, too, debuting a public investing strategy and hiring academics and researchers to influence policymaking for the tech and finance industries. Some other firms, including Bessemer Venture Partners, have also <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/10/13/why-bessemer-venture-partners-launched-a-buyout-fund/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2022/10/13/why-bessemer-venture-partners-launched-a-buyout-fund/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">launched</a> private equity funds in recent years.</p>



<p>Andreessen Horowitz made the disclosure through its wealth management arm, dubbed Perennial, which was set up in 2022 with the <a href="https://fortune.com/longform/andreessen-horowitz-beyond-silicon-valley/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/longform/andreessen-horowitz-beyond-silicon-valley/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">goal</a> of managing the personal wealth and philanthropy for the families of entrepreneurs and investors it had already built relationships with. Based on its name, the new private equity fund may cater to those customers. It’s unusual for firms to run both a family office and VC firm in unison—though Iconiq Capital has for a decade operated this way.</p><p></p>



<p>Perennial was <a href="https://fortune.com/longform/andreessen-horowitz-beyond-silicon-valley/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/longform/andreessen-horowitz-beyond-silicon-valley/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">started</a> by a16z’s longtime investor relations head Scott Kupor, and its investments are overseen by Michel Del Buono, a former chief investment officer at the multi-family office Jordan Park Group. Andreessen has already brought on 14 people into the new division, many of whom have backgrounds in family offices or ultra-high-net-worth wealth management firms like UBS or Jordan Park, to manage its clients’ money, estate planning, and philanthropic efforts, according to a new page on the a16z website that first appeared last fall, according to website archives. The firm already has attracted approximately 19 clients and $822 million of assets to manage, as of mid-May, according to the disclosures.</p>



<p>As part of the disclosures, Andreessen also said it anticipates in the “near future” a first close of two new funds from its family office division: a real assets fund, which invests in real estate, as well as a “diversifying investments” fund, which focuses on “income-producing and diversifying strategies,” according to the filings.</p>

Sure, excessive levels of capital spending have slashed earnings and free cash flow generation upfront. But, this business investment spree could pay off in a major way over the next couple of years for shareholders.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">At this juncture, Intel's cheap valuation vs. similar<span class="paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible"> Big Tech semiconductor names appears to be an exercise in trailing frustration, not one anticipating a bullish upturn in operating results. As measured by the top line and important price to sales ratio against semiconductor competitors and peers, Intel's dislike by investors has reached extreme proportions in the summer of 2024. Using this yardstick, Intel is selling for a whopping 78% discount to the industry median average today (2.4x vs. 11x)!</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/6/22/17314402-17190575643842912.png" alt="YCharts - Intel vs. Largest Semiconductor Names, Price to Trailing Sales, 2 Years" contenteditable="false" data-width="635" data-height="609" loading="lazy"> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>YCharts - Intel vs. Largest Semiconductor Names, Price to Trailing Sales, 2 Years</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">My bottom line... when I cross the ideas of rising future earnings with an insanely low valuation vs. peers, Intel's buy argument now stands out in the sector. It's a much better investment setup than a few years ago, and a completely contrarian way of viewing reality.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Honestly, Intel is everything <strong>NVIDIA</strong> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA" title="NVIDIA Corporation">NVDA</a>) is not. Despite operating in the notoriously cyclical semiconductor space, Nvidia's record-breaking leap in price (to an unheard of level as the most valuable U.S. company by equity market capitalization over $3.2 trillion) has been pushed on the average investor everywhere you read business news stories or watch stock market-related television. In stark contrast, Intel's $130 billion market cap (4% of Nvidia) appears to be sitting in the exact opposite investor sentiment position, completely kicked to the curb, with a brighter future than most realize.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Let me explain why I recently bought unloved Intel shares, the undervalued gem in the semiconductor space, during June 2024.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Business Turnaround in Progress</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Intel has missed out on many of the new chip markets created over the past decade plus, like the revolutionary AI semiconductor inventions of Nvidia, or chips for the <strong>Apple</strong> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL" title="Apple Inc.">AAPL</a>) <em>iPhone</em>. During 2023-24, management has been playing a game of catchup to stay relevant in the AI space.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The king of PC processors starting in the early 1980s has been searching for an encore with limited success. It has entered an array of markets as a worthy competitor, but profit results have been mixed. This struggle is clearly evident in a flatlined total-return stock pattern, really since the original 1990s technology/dotcom stock boom peaked in the year 2000. In terms of recent performance, comparing the largest winner of the Tech 2.0 bubble, Nvidia, with declining business sales at Intel highlights the dichotomy between past and present chip market dynamics.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/6/21/17314402-17190023756644833.png" alt="YCharts - Intel vs. Nvidia, Total Return Price, Since January 2000" contenteditable="false" data-width="635" data-height="439" loading="lazy"> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>YCharts - Intel vs. Nvidia, Total Return Price, Since January 2000</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/6/21/17314402-17190024378124642.png" alt="YCharts - Intel vs. Nvidia, Total Return Percentages, 5 Years" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>YCharts - Intel vs. Nvidia, Total Return Percentage Change, 5 Years</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But, here's the rub. Nvidia is now priced for perfection. Valuation ratios have reached some of the highest readings for any company since the original technology boom ended 24 years ago. And, while I do expect Nvidia sales to increase rapidly for a few more years, actual business profitability could turn lower as intense AI-based competition heats up from every major semiconductor name. In the end, incredible profit margins during 2023-24 at Nvidia are set to plummet from new AI-chip entries. Don't fool yourself. Economic forces and the profit incentive all but guarantee Nvidia margins will decline from early 2024 levels. It's the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4540916-exploding-ev-competition-could-send-tesla-under-100">same competition problem</a> <strong>Tesla</strong> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA" title="Tesla, Inc.">TSLA</a>) is now facing. Decent sales growth, absent much for operating income.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Intel, on the other hand, has decided to transform itself into the top U.S. foundry company. Outsourcing fabless companies without production assets will increasingly have the option to manufacture high-end state-of-the-art semiconductors inside America. If you will, Intel is investing tens of billions to quickly steal the thunder of <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing</strong> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM" title="Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited">TSM</a>) in Asia, as the new go-to U.S. resource for hundreds of fabless chip firms in North America.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/6/21/17314402-17190059383784008_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="1787" data-height="527" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="false" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="false" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="false" data-og-image-msn="false" data-og-image-facebook="false" data-og-image-google_news="false" data-og-image-google_plus="false" data-og-image-linkedin="false"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/6/21/17314402-17190059383784008.png" alt="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/overview.html" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"></a></span><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Intel Website - Foundry Services, June 21st, 2024</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/6/21/17314402-1719005974541915_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="960" data-height="802" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="true" data-og-image-msn="true" data-og-image-facebook="true" data-og-image-google_news="true" data-og-image-google_plus="true" data-og-image-linkedin="true"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/6/21/17314402-1719005974541915.png" alt="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/overview.html" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"></a></span><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Intel Website - Foundry Services, June 21st, 2024</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With the help of tax breaks and subsidies from the<em><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" rel="noopener noopener"> CHIPS and Science Act of 2022</a></em>, the U.S. government is shouldering a significant portion of Intel's construction effort ($8.5 in proposed direct funding, income tax credits of up to $25 billion, and $11 billion in low interest-rate federal loans) for Intel's record-breaking $100+ billion investment in its U.S.-based future over five years (up to $200 billion globally). According to a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html" rel="nofollow">March 20th, 2024 press release</a>,</p> <blockquote class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"> <p> </p> <p>... the U.S. Department of Commerce and Intel Corporation announced a preliminary memorandum of terms under which Intel will receive approximately $8.5 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS and Science Act.

The company’s strategy is centered on three core elements – establishing process technology leadership, building a more resilient and sustainable global semiconductor supply chain, and creating a world-class foundry business – all of which align with the objectives of the CHIPS Act to bring manufacturing and technology leadership back to the United States.</p> <p>Together, CHIPS Act funding and Intel’s previously announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. over five years constitute one of the largest public-private investments ever made in the U.S. semiconductor industry.</p> </blockquote> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Obviously, the Intel business setup of 2029, five years into the future, will be quite different than today. To boot, its sales and income growth performance over time could be quite eye-popping again, just like the 1990s. Don't just take my word for it.

Plus, I honestly believe Nvidia's EPS growth will stall from competition, while Intel's new foundry business could support steady and exceptional growth over the next 5-10 years.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/6/22/17314402-17190650435872808.png" alt="YCharts - Intel vs. NVIDIA, Analyst Estimates for EPS Growth into 2027" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>YCharts - Intel vs. NVIDIA, Analyst Estimates for EPS Growth into 2027</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Perhaps the best indicator that illustrates the direction of stock pricing as a function of expected earnings growth is the<em> PEG Ratio</em>. When we take into account estimated earnings growth as a function of the P/E valuation, Intel is looking more interesting by the day in 2024. On a forward projected EPS basis, Intel has moved from a reasonable PEG idea at $50 per share to very undervalued over six months at $31 per share. Flipping the script, Nvidia's split-adjusted price under $50 in early January has exploded to $125 today. And, on the graph below, you can see the forward PEG valuation has quadrupled. Why not invest in the lower valuation - strong earnings rebound candidate, is my question to you?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/6/22/17314402-1719065201482996.png" alt="YCharts - Intel vs. NVIDIA, P/E to Forward Growth PEG Ratio Estimates, Since Jan 2024" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>YCharts - Intel vs. NVIDIA, P/E to Forward Growth PEG Ratio Estimates, Since Jan 2024</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Chart Trading Momentum</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Despite lagging share performance from Intel over the past 12 months, serious selling pressure does not appear to be part of the problem. It's been a string of disappointing Intel earnings releases, matched against new capital rushing into the AI darlings of the day.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">You can review below how the <em>Negative Volume Index</em> (measuring trading inflows/outflows on slower volume days) and <em>On Balance Volume</em> indicators have been zigzagging higher in a healthy fashion.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Price has been basing for months, and could be ready to jump above its 50-day moving average for the first time since January. Another bullish sign is the 20-day <em>Chaikin Money Flow</em> reading has been in positive territory for several weeks.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As a consequence, I am getting prepared for a price reversal higher soon. In my research, a material and sustainable down move in price from $31 may be possible only with a large selloff in Big Tech names generally (which remains a serious risk to contemplate before buying any stock on Wall Street in June).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/6/22/17314402-17190649918893943_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="850" data-height="633" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="true" data-og-image-msn="true" data-og-image-facebook="true" data-og-image-google_news="true" data-og-image-google_plus="true" data-og-image-linkedin="true"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/6/22/17314402-17190649918893943.png" alt="StockCharts.com - Intel, 12 Months of Daily Price &amp; Volume Changes" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"></a></span><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>StockCharts.com - Intel, 12 Months of Daily Price &amp; Volume Changes</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Intel could morph into a huge Big Tech winner without warning, if China gets serious about invading Taiwan, or at least changes (through military and political pressure) the current low-risk supply chain argument for semiconductors from TSM production. For example, Nvidia sources most of its chip supply from Taiwan, which could become a huge operational risk overnight. Any slide toward heightened Chinese belligerence could cause geopolitical shock waves in the high-tech community, where fabless firms contract future production to new Intel facilities under construction.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In fact, "safer" supply-chain sourcing could be the main reason to consider adding Intel to your portfolio at reduced share pricing this summer, given an estimated 75% of high-end semiconductor supply globally comes from Southeast Asia. Under worst-case scenarios for geopolitical trouble in Asia, the transformed Intel as a leading foundry organization could stand tall as a critical national-security asset to own, supporting a local chip infrastructure and supply chain (with leaping operating profitability down the road).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The hybrid business model of producing its own chips and manufacturing product for fabless outsourcing companies like Nvidia could be the winning design for shareholders. In this vein, comparing Intel's valuation to the top two chip foundry businesses makes sense. My conclusion: Intel appears to be just as amazingly inexpensive vs. both Taiwan Semi and <strong>Global Foundries</strong> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GFS" title="GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc.">GFS</a>). On price to forward 1-year estimates for earnings and sales, Intel remains an outlier bargain.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/6/21/17314402-1719007158559973.png" alt="YCharts - Intel vs. Taiwan Semi &amp; Global Foundries, Price to Forward Estimated Earnings, Since January 2024" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>YCharts - Intel vs. Taiwan Semi &amp; Global Foundries, Price to Estimated 2025 Earnings, Since Jan 2024</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/6/21/17314402-17190071394617422.png" alt="YCharts - Intel vs. Taiwan Semi &amp; Global Foundries, Price to Forward Estimated Sales, Since Jan 2024" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy"> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>YCharts - Intel vs. Taiwan Semi &amp; Global Foundries, Price to Estimated 2025 Sales, Since Jan 2024</span></p></figcaption></figure><p></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">What are the risks owning Intel around $31 per share? The primary headwind risks would be a Big Tech bust in share pricing overall on Wall Street, and/or an industry-wide recession in chip demand. I do feel both have decent odds of playing out into 2025 (25% to 50% range). For sure, the likelihood or not of Intel trading down to $25 or even $20 in a deep, prolonged recession are worth weighing in your decision process.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I will interject, I fully expect Intel to "outperform" the chip sector, no matter which direction general stock pricing trends move. If Intel does decline by -20% or -30% in price over the next 3-6 months, the semiconductor space would almost surely fall at a greater pace, perhaps to the tune of -40% to -50% from its clearly overvalued position currently (led by Nvidia).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Nevertheless, Intel's upside potential in future years is quite substantial at $30. Fair value targets of $60 to $80 are not out of the question over the next five years, especially if analyst estimates prove on the low side of reality. Total returns of +15% to +20% annualized, including 2% in yearly dividends, are my forecast on today's $31 purchase number. A P/E multiple of 15x $4.50 EPS and 3x sales of $90 billion gets you closer to $70 for price by late 2028.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In terms of buying on weakness, prices of $25 or $20 could open a rare opportunity to compound money for long-term investors. With a $70 quote forecast in five years, buying at $20 could support future annualized total returns in the +25% to +35% range.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">When I review all the pros and cons, Intel may be sitting in the exact opposite investment position as Nvidia, bullish vs. bearish. A very low INTC valuation vs. an extremely high NVDA one is the loudest difference. Unusual negative investor/analyst sentiment about the old-school semi king vs. insanely optimistic views on the world's AI-chip leader is another. Plus, the hard to accept forecasts of rebounding Intel earnings vs. sharply decelerating income growth at Nvidia (on exploding AI competition), round out the foundational ideas to consider when investing for the future.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I am upgrading my rating of Intel to <em>Buy</em>, and own a small position. My plan is to increase portfolio exposure and sizing if the stock quote declines appreciably under $30. I peg <em>Strong Buy</em> territory under $25, all other variables remaining the same.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><em>Thanks for reading.

<p>ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said she plans to vote for Trump because of his track record on the economy—the single most important issue to her, she said during an interview with YouTuber Kevin Paffrath. </p>



<p>Wood said she had discussed the topic with her three children, who are split on whom they will cast their votes for. </p>



<p>“As I’ve said to them, ‘Look, I am going to vote for the person who’s going to do the best job for our economy,’” Wood said. “I am a voter when it comes to economics, and on that basis, Trump.”</p>



<p>The interview with Wood was originally posted to Paffrath’s <a href="https://fortune.com/company/twitter/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/twitter/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">X</a> page, but he has since taken it down. In a <a href="https://x.com/realMeetKevin/status/1805094637134385461" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/realMeetKevin/status/1805094637134385461" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">post</a> explaining why, Paffrath says Wood later told him her remarks did not adequately represent the nuance of her political views. Paffrath went on to say he felt he’d “ambushed” Wood with the question about which candidate she would support in the upcoming presidential election. After pushback from Wood’s team, Paffrath wrote that he interpreted Wood’s explanation to mean “there’s more to a vote than economics.” </p><p></p>



<p>He then apologized to Wood. “We are saddened that we have disappointed you,” Paffrath continued. </p>



<p>ARK Invest did not respond to a request for comment. </p>



<p>A well-known tech investor, Wood made her name in financial circles aligning herself with another famous and polarizing figure in Elon Musk. ARK Invest was an early investor and evangelist of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/tesla/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/tesla/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Tesla</a>, whose soaring stock price made her a fortune. </p>



<p>The former president’s support among the corporate class has been the subject of much discussion, as he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/14/investing/trump-tax-cuts/index.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/14/investing/trump-tax-cuts/index.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">courts</a> their deep pockets in what is expected to be an <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-trump-debate-offers-rare-chance-change-stubbornly/story?id=111279743" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-trump-debate-offers-rare-chance-change-stubbornly/story?id=111279743" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">extremely tight</a> race. Trump reportedly <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/trump-electric-vehicles-oil-gas-climate-chevron-exxon/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/trump-electric-vehicles-oil-gas-climate-chevron-exxon/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">met</a> with a group of energy CEOs and offered them a plethora of favorable legislation in <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/trump-electric-vehicles-oil-gas-climate-chevron-exxon/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/09/trump-electric-vehicles-oil-gas-climate-chevron-exxon/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">exchange</a> for $1 billion in campaign financing. Wall Street CEOs in particular have warmed to Trump again, after keeping him at arm’s length following the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/donald-trump-campaign-business-executives-warming-4aa10c04" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/donald-trump-campaign-business-executives-warming-4aa10c04" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">according</a> to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>.</p>



<p>Other CEOs though are still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/business/economy/biden-trump-ceos.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/business/economy/biden-trump-ceos.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">keeping their distance</a>, wary of Trump’s proposed 10% tariffs on all imports and his disdain for global trade agreements. Yale business school professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/24/there-are-no-fortune-500-ceos-who-are-supporting-donald-trump-says-yales-jeffrey-sonnenfeld.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/24/there-are-no-fortune-500-ceos-who-are-supporting-donald-trump-says-yales-jeffrey-sonnenfeld.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">told CNBC on Monday</a> there was a “historic break” between corporate America and Trump.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Another Trump presidency would feature more tax cuts</strong> </h3>



<p>Trump still retains support among some Republican stalwarts. During her interview, Wood paraphrased comments from Art Laffer, an economist who worked in the Reagan administration, in which he <a href="https://youtu.be/xpafQKys048?si=UHvCbmkx-a0jVpRp&amp;t=145" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://youtu.be/xpafQKys048?si=UHvCbmkx-a0jVpRp&amp;t=145" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">said</a> Trump was the best president in a century for the economy, until the pandemic struck. “I would agree,” Wood told Paffrath. </p><p></p>



<p>Laffer, an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidenomics-also-known-as-mmt-modern-monetary-theory-spending-ccadee9c" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidenomics-also-known-as-mmt-modern-monetary-theory-spending-ccadee9c" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">avowed</a> Biden critic, is also known for popularizing the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/01/trump-is-giving-arthur-laffer-presidential-medal-freedom-economists-arent-laughing/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/01/trump-is-giving-arthur-laffer-presidential-medal-freedom-economists-arent-laughing/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Laffer curve</a>, which suggests that cutting taxes to a certain rate can actually increase government revenue. It is often cited for cutting taxes on corporations and those in the highest tax brackets. But the accuracy of the Laffer curve is <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/laffer-curve-separating-fact-fiction" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cato.org/blog/laffer-curve-separating-fact-fiction" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">often debated</a>.  </p>



<p>The ideas behind the Laffer curve provided justification for the Trump-era tax cuts passed in 2017. Those cuts—officially known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—were the signature economic policy and legislative achievement of Trump’s presidency. A study from March found that while the bill did spur investment, it didn’t do so to the level that would have offset the major drop in tax revenue. Instead the bill <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/04/us/politics/trump-corporate-tax-cut.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/04/us/politics/trump-corporate-tax-cut.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">added $100 billion a year</a> to the U.S. national debt. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>If he were to win the election in November, Trump would extend his earlier tax cuts and implement further cuts. “When President Trump is back in the White House, he will advocate for more tax cuts for all Americans and reinvigorate America’s energy industry to bring down inflation, lower the cost of living, and pay down our debt,” Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an emailed statement. </p>



<p>On the campaign trail, he has proposed a set of policies that would <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/trump-all-tariff-policy-to-replace-income-tax.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/trump-all-tariff-policy-to-replace-income-tax.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">eliminate</a> most, if not all, income taxes and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-proposal-10-percent-1700-cost-per-us-household/#:~:text=Former%20President%20Donald%20Trump%20is,into%20the%20U.S.%20from%20overseas." target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-proposal-10-percent-1700-cost-per-us-household/#:~:text=Former%20President%20Donald%20Trump%20is,into%20the%20U.S.%20from%20overseas." rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">replace them with tariffs</a> on all imported goods. That idea, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/donald-trump-tax-plans-election-2024-17b7fc3e" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/donald-trump-tax-plans-election-2024-17b7fc3e" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">far outside</a> the usual bounds of economic policies, would lead to the “<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/22/trump-tax-cuts-tariffs-economic-policies-stagflation-larry-summers-trade-war/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/22/trump-tax-cuts-tariffs-economic-policies-stagflation-larry-summers-trade-war/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">mother of stagflation</a>,” according to former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. </p>



<p>For his part, Biden has <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/06/economy-soft-landing-recession-debt-ceiling-default-joe-biden/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/05/06/economy-soft-landing-recession-debt-ceiling-default-joe-biden/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">overseen</a> a record-breaking job market with a <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/unemployment-rate-remains-4-27th-consecutive-month-rcna150548" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/unemployment-rate-remains-4-27th-consecutive-month-rcna150548" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">streak of sub-4% unemployment</a> that was the longest since the 1960s, helped by a series of legislative packages meant to incentivize spending from both the public and private sectors. And while inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, it is well below the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-ECONOMY/INFLATION/lbpgneoyqvq/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-ECONOMY/INFLATION/lbpgneoyqvq/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">soaring 9% rate</a> of June 2022. </p><p></p>



<p>But Wood has said she is <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/16/cathie-wood-forget-inflation-deflation-real-enemy-federal-reserve-interest-rates/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/16/cathie-wood-forget-inflation-deflation-real-enemy-federal-reserve-interest-rates/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">worried about deflation</a> in 2024 and warned unemployment could go above 5%. “Now I’m saying that knowing that this is an election year and that this administration probably will try and spend more than is currently in the budget through executive order or what have you,” she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHM72BEBilI" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHM72BEBilI" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">told Bloomberg</a> earlier this year.</p></div></div>

This is a more powerful version of the company's publicly available Titan model, the people familiar said.</p><p class="premium">At the most basic level, Metis gives text- and image-based answers in a smart, conversational manner, according to the internal document. It's also able to share links to the source of its responses, suggest follow-up queries, and generate images.</p><h2 id="77ec3b8a-cc27-4622-8b94-5c1fab4da79b" data-toc-id="77ec3b8a-cc27-4622-8b94-5c1fab4da79b" class="premium">More up-to-date responses</h2><p class="premium">Amazon wants Metis to use an artificial-intelligence technique called retrieval-augmented generation, the people said. This means Metis will be able to retrieve information from beyond the original data used to train its underlying Olympus model.</p><p class="premium">The goal is to generate more up-to-date responses. For example, Metis should be able to share the latest stock prices, while some other chatbots that are not RAG can't do so, the people familiar with the situation said.</p><p class="premium">Metis is also expected to work as an AI agent, one of the people said. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-future-ai-agents-project-astra-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="60">AI agents</a> are capable of automating and performing complex tasks based on existing data, like making a vacation itinerary. Metis' use cases could include turning on your lights and booking a flight for you, one of the people told BI.</p><h2 id="53ca8f6f-df23-4b4b-8db2-6de4a75b081c" data-toc-id="53ca8f6f-df23-4b4b-8db2-6de4a75b081c" class="premium">There are a lot of AI assistants</h2><p class="premium">With Metis, Amazon is joining an already crowded AI-assistant market. Its biggest rivals, Microsoft and Google, launched their own AI assistants nearly two years ago, while <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/developers-adding-ads-and-affiliate-links-to-their-chatgpt-apps-2024-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="60">OpenAI</a> has been pouring billions of dollars into its market-leading ChatGPT for years. Anthropic and several other AI startups also offer AI chatbots and assistants.</p><p class="premium">Amazon is trying to catch up in the AI race. Its Titan model is considered less powerful than its rivals, and Amazon Q, a chatbot targeting corporate customers, was met <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-q-chatbot-launch-rushed-flawed-anthropic-claude-ai-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="80">with mixed reviews</a>. Amazon's own AI chips, called Trainium and Inferentia, are struggling with low demand and performance issues, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-nvidia-aws-ai-chip-dominance-gpu-trainium-inferentia-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="80">as BI previously reported</a>. Last month, Amazon even instructed some employees to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-secret-workaround-scrape-microsoft-github-ai-training-data-2024-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="80">help scrape GitHub's open-source data</a> to speed up its AI-model training process.</p><p class="premium">An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.</p><h2 id="93ef1b28-76fa-4356-8010-0a275fb1df10" data-toc-id="93ef1b28-76fa-4356-8010-0a275fb1df10" class="premium">Andy Jassy is involved with Metis</h2><p class="premium">Amazon CEO Andy Jassy previously said that almost every part of the company was working on some kind of AI project. The company is a pioneer in cloud computing and has been working on machine learning, a type of AI, for years. Jassy <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/amazoncom-amzn-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="80">recently said</a> Amazon's AI initiatives were on pace to generate more than $1 billion in annual revenue and that he expected them to drive "tens of billions of dollars" in sales over the next several years.</p><p class="premium">But consumer AI assistants have been a missing spot for Amazon. An internal document last year <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-chatgpt-response-scared-crowdsourcing-hackathon-openai-microsoft-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="80">specifically pointed out</a> that Amazon "does not have a publicly or internally available product that looks and works exactly like ChatGPT."</p><p class="premium">Jassy is directly involved in Metis and recently reviewed the progress of the team, one of the people said. The project is being tested internally, this person added.</p><h2 id="0a156931-6e6d-4b71-bfd5-52380d1f84b9" data-toc-id="0a156931-6e6d-4b71-bfd5-52380d1f84b9" class="premium">Amazon's AGI team</h2><p class="premium">Metis is part of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-agi-ai-restructuring-new-products-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="80">Amazon's AGI team</a>, led by Rohit Prasad, its head scientist and a senior vice president, the people familiar with the project said.

Vishal Sharma, the vice president of artificial general intelligence, has direct oversight of Project Metis, one of the people said.</p><p class="premium">Amazon is also relying on Alexa for the development of Metis, two of the people said. Many employees working on Metis moved over from Alexa's AI team, and Metis' technology uses some of the resources found in the upgraded version of Alexa, internally dubbed "Remarkable Alexa," they said. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-paid-alexa-plus-service-issues-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100">BI first reported in January</a> that Amazon planned to launch a new, paid version of Alexa, powered by Remarkable Alexa, and a new web-browser-based service.</p><h2 id="ae27a8b4-7d3f-47e2-b2be-3cef14abcd0b" data-toc-id="ae27a8b4-7d3f-47e2-b2be-3cef14abcd0b" class="premium">'Playing chase'</h2><p class="premium">The tentative launch date for Metis is September, right around the time when Amazon hosts a big Alexa event, though the timeline could change, one of the people said. Still, some people on the Metis team said it felt like Amazon was already late to the AI-chatbot game and it's unclear how much investment the company is committed to make for the project.</p><p class="premium">"Technically it will work, I guess, but the question is if it's already too late," one of the people said. "We're playing chase."</p><p class="premium"><strong><em>Do you work at Amazon?

<p>Yellen said the Democratic administration is “pursuing a broad affordability agenda to address the price pressures that families have been feeling.”</p><p>Both homebuyers and renters are facing increasing housing costs that skyrocketed after the pandemic. According to the Case-Shiller 20-City Composite Home Price Index, home prices increased by 46% between March 2020 and March 2024. A new Treasury analysis shows that over the past two decades, housing costs have been rising faster than incomes. </p>

<p>For low-income Americans, statistics from the National Low Income Housing Coalition show that nationally there is a shortage of more than 7 million affordable homes for the more than 10.8 million extremely low-income U.S. families. And there is no state or county in the country where a renter working full-time at minimum wage can afford a two-bedroom apartment, according to the group.</p>

<li><strong>NVIDIA's market cap reaches $3 trillion</strong>: NVIDIA has surpassed a market capitalization of $3 trillion, making it the most valuable public company in the world, surpassing Microsoft for a brief period.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Automakers' petition</strong>: The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing major automakers, has petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to reconsider a regulation requiring nearly all new cars and trucks to have advanced automatic emergency braking systems by 2029.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation details</strong>: The regulation, adopted in April, requires all cars and trucks to be able to stop and avoid hitting vehicles in front of them while moving at speeds of up to 62 mph using available technology.</li>
<li><strong>Industry concerns</strong>: The auto industry group argues that the regulation is "practically impossible" with current technology, citing concerns about the feasibility of meeting the safety standards.</li>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: The regulation was adopted in response to a provision in the 2021 infrastructure law, which directed the NHTSA to develop minimum performance standards for automatic emergency braking (AEB) systems.</li>
<li><strong>Affected companies</strong>: The regulation would impact major automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), Stellantis (STLA), Toyota (TM), and others, which are represented by the trade group.</li>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Target is the first major retailer to collaborate with Shopify to introduce its merchants’ products into physical stores. The initial group of Shopify sellers to be featured at Target include True Classic and Caden Lane, among others. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Target Plus launched in 2019 to allow consumers to discover new products from third-party retailers, such as Crocs, Maui Jim, Timberland and Ruggable. However, the retailer lags behind rivals like Amazon, eBay and Walmart.

    <div><p data-beyondwords-marker="a0fa396a-db7c-47d9-9650-21338ce00a27">The acquisition of Coyote Logistics by RXO announced Sunday received a rip-roaring reception on Wall Street Monday, with the company’s stock price trading up by double-digit percentages on a move that management said will make it the third-largest freight brokerage in the country.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="b7c619bc-aa9a-4780-b7e5-7450260cc245">At about 11:15 a.m. EDT, RXO stock was up about 21.9% to to $24.64, a gain of $4.43. It hit a 52-week high on the day at $25.07, according to Barchart.</p>



<div id="omeda-post-content">


<p data-beyondwords-marker="c61a400b-0ed8-4740-82aa-f084339bf64d">Seidl and RXO management, on a Monday morning call with analysts, said the acquisition of Coyote will move the company to the No. 3 brokerage. While no other companies’ names were identified, the top two are widely believed to be C.H. Robinson <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CHRW/">(NASDAQ: CHRW)</a> and TQL.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="73b5d8ba-50c3-4eaf-a7f6-d359bd5fa29f">RXO’s full-year revenue in 2023 was $3.93 billion. On the analyst call, RXO CEO Drew Wilkerson said Coyote revenue last year was about $3.2 billion.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="65bbf885-221c-41b0-99de-89288545ec43">Other details about Coyote that emerged from the conference call: It generated about $470 million in gross margin last year, for a margin percentage of about 14.5% of revenue.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="8b197e4f-b333-4f69-aedc-c5e7c1d29420">EBITDA for Coyote last year was about $86 million, and combined, RXO and Coyote would have generated about $218 million in EBITDA last year. </p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="e9020fce-0b81-4c17-aa15-00da4e9a8db1">Synergies in the deal were estimated by RXO at $25 million, and they are all expected to be realized within a year after the closing, which is expected by the end of the year.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="ace88ba2-856a-407f-ae1e-45acfa1adce3">Wilkerson said the acquisition of Coyote will increase the number of users of its service who do more than $1 million in revenue with the brokerage by about 80%, though the average Coyote customer tends to be smaller than the average RXO customer.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="60703231-1077-476f-86e0-b8d85535ba67">The combined company will have a more diversified book of business as well, Wilkerson added. Coyote’s top two verticals are food and beverage and transportation; RXO’s business has tended toward retail and industrial/manufacturing. “There’s minimal overlap across our largest customers,” he said.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="5a7d827a-f28a-46e0-b240-b30200a78e34">That lack of overlap received praise from Seidl. “We are encouraged to see that there is minimal customer overlap with Coyote’s business heavily focused on small to medium businesses and RXO’s legacy business focused on larger enterprise customers,” Seidl said. “There are also differences in terms of carrier base. Coyote tends to focus on smaller carriers while RXO has access to larger fleets.”</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="44d6ba7b-2234-4fdf-aeab-048c55e9844b">One customer that is sticking around: UPS. Wilkerson said the sales agreement with UPS contains a provision that will have UPS continue to use RXO’s services through 2030, though the size of the commitment was not revealed.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="f996feda-380a-4c57-acc4-1912f2bc19c0">Seidl said he was raising his estimated earnings for RXO in 2025, when Coyote will be in the field, to an EBITDA of $292 million, up from $193 million without Coyote. There are no changes in Seidl’s estimate for 2024, given that the deal is not likely to close until the fourth quarter. </p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="b5b464f0-054b-4129-9d85-034c4f0f58d5">Although RXO has boasted about its organic growth, Wilkerson noted it had made a dozen acquisitions since 2012, including those when it was part of XPO <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPO/" target="_blank">(NYSE: XPO) </a>before it was spun off in 2022. “Our differentiated approach has enabled us to organically grow brokerage volumes by nearly 70% over the last five years, significantly outperforming the industry,” he said.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="e7e3961e-576c-47ae-bef6-e3fa65c8e24b">And he said he does not expect the consolidation trend to end anytime soon. “We believe there will be an increase in consolidation in the next five years, and the winner will be whoever offers the deepest customer relationships, the best technology and strong financial protocols,” Wilkerson said.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="dc970edb-8ed2-4396-99e8-56e403249d01">CFO Jamie Harris, on the call, repeated what RXO said Sunday when it first announced the deal: The acquisition of Coyote will be “immediately and significantly accretive to adjusted earnings per share and adjusted cash flow.”</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="f9d4d8cd-79d2-4bfb-8619-b7e7d418fed5">Several times during the call, RXO management touted the benefit from the deal of taking the combined fixed cost structure and spreading it out over a wider book of business. “We’ll be able to continue to optimize our cost structure and leverage our fixed costs more effectively,” Harris said.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="8cf1c406-f6d7-4687-ae4e-d676f1554d83">Jared Weisfeld, RXO’s chief strategy officer, said Coyote’s business is about 79% truckload, with the balance in less-than-truckload and to a lesser extent intermodal. He added that he expects the acquisition will help RXO grow its footprint in small to medium business and the “middle market.”</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="4721c488-2b86-431a-b222-7705a10cdc03">A merger of two brokerage companies always raises the question of the pace and direction of technology integration. In response to an analyst question, Wilkerson said Coyote “has put investments into technology and they have a strong operating system.” </p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="4b8283e4-1163-419f-b6c4-2892e8f8a471">“We’ve got an opportunity to be able to take the best of both worlds, to continue to have the best transportation technology in the world.”</p>
