<li>The European Central Bank (ECB) cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point to 3.75%, its lowest level since 2015.</li>
<li>ECB President Christine Lagarde said the rate cut was due to easing inflation concerns, but warned that rates may remain "sufficiently restrictive" to combat inflation.</li>
<li>The ECB's rate cut comes as central banks around the world are shifting towards lowering interest rates to boost economic growth. The US Federal Reserve is expected to follow suit.</li>
<li>Despite the rate cut, inflation remains above the ECB's 2% target at 2.6%, and Lagarde declined to indicate the pace and depth of future rate cuts.</li>
<li>Analysts predict the ECB may not lower rates again soon, with some expecting rates to remain unchanged until further confirmation of inflation control.</li>

                                        <p>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank cut its key interest rate Thursday by a quarter-point, moving ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve as central banks around the world lean toward lowering borrowing costs — a shift with far-reaching consequences for home buyers, savers and investors.</p><p>The ECB cut its benchmark rate to 3.75% from a record high of 4% at a meeting of the bank’s 26-member rate-setting council in Frankfurt.</p><p>Speaking afterward at a news conference, ECB President Christine Lagarde said inflation had eased enough for the central bank to start lowering rates. </p><p>But with annual inflation at 2.6% in May and expected to remain above the ECB 2% target into next year, Lagarde declined to indicate how fast or how deep any future rate cuts might be. </p><p>“We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary,” she said. “We are not committing to a particular rate path.” </p>
    

<p>“Are we today moving into a dialing-back phase? I wouldn’t volunteer that,” she said. </p><p>Rate increases combat inflation by making it more expensive to borrow in order to buy goods, lowering demand and taking the pressure off prices. But high rates also hold back growth, which has been in short supply in the eurozone.</p>



<p>With inflation coming down but taking its time to reach levels central bankers like, the question now is, how soon, how fast and how deep future rate cuts from the Fed, the ECB and others will be. </p>
    
<p>Analysts say the ECB will likely leave rates unchanged when it next meets on July 18, while it awaits further confirmation that inflation is under control.</p><p>“Today’s cut doesn’t necessarily mark the start of an easing cycle,” said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, the Dutch banking firm. </p><p>Though the annual inflation rate for May is well below a peak of 10.6% in October 2022, the decline has slowed in recent months. Inflation even ticked up slightly from 2.4% in April. Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains particularly elevated at 4.1%.</p>
    

<p>The ECB’s move represents a switch from the onset of the inflation surge, when the Fed took the lead in tightening credit by raising rates starting in March 2022, sending mortgage costs higher but also boosting returns for savers with money in certificates of deposit or money market funds. The ECB started four months later.</p><p>Major central banks around the world now are leaning toward lowering interest rates. Central banks in smaller economies have already cut rates, including in Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bank-england-interest-rate-inflation-economy-43c776087d42175b447c667f5a769732">Bank of England’s policymakers</a></span> are scheduled to meet on June 20, but it’s not clear whether the governing board will cut the rate from 5.25%. Japan, an economic outlier among the world big economies, has started raising rates after years of below-zero rates and low inflation.</p><p>Lower rates can mean lower mortgage costs and credit card charges for consumers. Lower rates also can boost stock prices and the value of retirement accounts since they diminish returns on conservative alternatives such as certificates of deposit and can mean stronger economic growth that will boost corporate earnings.</p>
    

<p>The ECB’s higher rates quashed a nine-year-long rally in eurozone home prices and slammed construction activity. Growth in economic output has hovered just above and below zero for more than a year before a modest upbeat surprise in the first three months of the year, when gross domestic product rose 0.3% from the quarter before.</p><p>The inflation surge <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/europe">in Europe</a></span> was unleashed first and foremost by Russia cutting off most natural gas supplies to the continent, and by logjams in supplies of raw materials and parts as the global economy rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the eurozone was hit first and hardest by the Russian cutoff, the resulting energy price spike has now <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/european-central-bank-ecb-inflation-interest-rates-eurozone-5b12d36fe7a494650b0ea21a09e69759">largely subsided</a></span> after spiking to 10.6% in October 2022.</p><p>The Federal Reserve faces a very different economy, one in which inflation was fueled less by the Russian energy shock than by government pandemic recovery spending, and more robust growth fueled inflation. The U.S. consumer price index is at an annual 3.4%, some way from the Fed’s goal, also 2%.</p>
    

<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the bank expects to cut rates this year from the current benchmark level of 5.25%-5.5%, but no change is expected at the Fed’s policy meeting next week. With <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-election-federal-reserve-rates-economy-d0e67b8a70a3f0c4f201357893d9c972">inflation cooling slowly</a></span> in the U.S., economists and investors now increasingly expect only one or two cuts this year.</p><h2>___</h2><p> AP Economics Writer Christopher Rugaber contributed to this report from Washington.</p>

                        </p><p>(WISH) — The ailing Red Lobster restaurant chain will be shutting down five Indiana locations, adding three more since it <a href="https://www.wishtv.com/news/business/red-lobster-is-abruptly-closing-dozens-of-restaurants/">announced nationwide closings just a few days ago</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the list of seafood restaurants closings in Indiana:</p>

<p>The Indianapolis and Elkhart restaurants were closed in May, according to the Red Lobster website.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>In Indianapolis, two Red Lobster locations remain open: 6410 E. 82nd St. and 690 E. Thompson Road. Other Indiana locations that will remain open include ones in Avon, Anderson, Bloomington, Columbus, Fort Wayne, Lafayette, Muncie and Terre Haute, the website showed Thursday.</p>
<p>Red Lobster, which brought affordable shrimp and lobster to middle-class America and grew to become the largest seafood restaurant chain in the world, <a href="https://www.wishtv.com/news/national/red-lobster-files-for-bankruptcy/">filed in May for bankruptcy</a>.</p>
<p>Red Lobster said that it had more than $1 billion in debt and less than $30 million in cash on hand. It plans to sell its business to its lenders, and in turn, it will receive financing to stay afloat. Part of its plan is to close some locations of its nearly 600 restaurants in the meantime.</p>
<p>Nationally, the restaurants closing include the iconic one in Times Square in New York City.</p><div id="ns-embed-cb0d32a9-c717-44e6-81ab-596a84c99ef1"><div class="ns-video-player-container"><div

<p>In one Amazon office in Europe, a senior customer service official informed employees during a group meeting that a restructuring would remove an entire level of middle management, but since he refrained from using words like “layoffs,” it wasn’t initially clear whether impacted employees would be out of a job completely or simply reassigned. As employees exchanged puzzled looks trying to decipher what exactly was transpiring, they finally realized that some in attendance had effectively just been laid off.</p>



<p>“In the end, we only barely understood that my colleague next to me was fired,” one longtime Amazon customer service manager told <em>Fortune</em>. “I’ve never felt that embarrassed.”</p>



<p>Around the same time in other parts of the world, some longtime managers tried to log into their Amazon computer system unsuccessfully. In at least one instance, a manager contacted the company’s IT department for assistance only to learn that they should expect outreach from HR instead. Other managers returned to their computers after being bushwhacked by news of their fate to find that there would be no goodbyes: The company had already locked them out of their systems.</p>



<p>The bare-knuckled job cuts are just one of the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/14/tech-jobs-layoffs-benefits-changes-google-amazon-meta-paypal-cisco/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/14/tech-jobs-layoffs-benefits-changes-google-amazon-meta-paypal-cisco/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">many rounds of layoffs</a> made by tech businesses over the past two years, as companies like <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Alphabet</a>, Meta, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/salesforce-com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/salesforce-com/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Salesforce</a> retrench from a pandemic-fueled hiring spree. At Amazon, tens of thousands of workers across the company have been let go since the fall of 2022, a business practice that some insiders say has become more common since <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/andy-jassy-new-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-steps-down-amzn/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/andy-jassy-new-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-steps-down-amzn/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Andy Jassy replaced Jeff Bezos as CEO</a>.</p><p></p>



<p>For Amazon’s customer service ranks—the frontline staff at a nearly $2 trillion business that proudly markets itself as “customer-obsessed”—the layoffs carry a special significance. At a time when remote work and cost-cutting have upended established work patterns, and with the first wave of generative AI threatening to reshape the very nature of many professions, the plight of Amazon’s customer service managers offers what could be a preview of broader changes coming to corporate workforces around the world. </p>



<p>Already, the question of what comes next for this division at Amazon is dominating side conversations and text threads between Amazon employees in call centers and virtual offices from the U.S. to Costa Rica to India. Will Amazon continue to outsource even more customer interactions to third-party firms? Are current employees unknowingly training an AI replacement under the guise of a new software tool that management is forcing them to use? How far off is complete automation of their roles? </p>



<p><em>Fortune</em> spoke to a dozen Amazon customer service employees and managers, all of whom requested anonymity either because Amazon policies prohibit them from speaking to the press without permission or because they don’t want to risk losing out on severance that the company is offering them. Throughout the conversations, one common theme emerged: The workers believe the future of their work is more tenuous than it was yesterday and more difficult than ever before.</p>



<p>Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan told <em>Fortune</em> that business leaders and teams are empowered to make their own staffing and investment decisions, and that leadership has been managing through an unprecedented series of events, including the global pandemic and the resulting unpredictable shifts in consumer demand and the labor market. </p>



<p>When <em>Fortune</em> told Amazon that Amazon employees and managers estimate that anywhere between a couple hundred and 600 roles were recently eliminated, the spokesperson would only confirm that more than 100 positions were cut. </p><p></p>



<p>In the U.S., Amazon provided 60 days of pay and benefits to the customer service managers who were recently laid off, plus severance. Some may be reassigned to another Amazon role if there’s a fit elsewhere in the company, and Amazon said that’s already occurred in some instances. </p>



<p>In a statement, she said that the opinions and anecdotes of the 12 employees who spoke to <em>Fortune</em> “do not match the data” that Amazon gleans from the thousands of customer service employees it regularly surveys. “Overall, the majority of our frontline customer service employees report having high job satisfaction, and in fact, it is up this year versus last,” she said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The “low-level guys”</strong></h2>



<p>Within the vast universe of Amazon workers, which totaled 1.5 million full- and part-time employees at the end of March, customer service representatives inhabit a curious middle zone—not exactly fitting within the ranks of the warehouse workers and delivery drivers, nor entirely within the corporate realm of engineers, salespeople, and other office folks.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>

<p>The Amazon managers who were laid off are salaried employees who might make somewhere between $60,000 and $80,000 a year in the U.S. if they were promoted internally. (Amazon’s spokesperson said that range is below the average, but declined to provide more detail.) They aren’t paid overtime but have job commitments that could at times necessitate working 50 to 60 hours a week, employees told <em>Fortune</em>. They are also eligible to earn some Amazon stock based on their performance. </p>



<p>At the lower level, Amazon customer service agents, or CSAs, get paid hourly (from just north of $15 to a couple of dollars over $20 in the U.S.) to respond by phone, email, chat, and social to questions and complaints from shoppers and Amazon device users when online self-service tools don’t suffice. While some agents work out of call centers, many work remotely from home. In 2022, Amazon moved more employees from call centers to remote positions, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-29/amazon-to-close-all-but-one-us-customer-call-center" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-29/amazon-to-close-all-but-one-us-customer-call-center" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">reportedly to save money on real estate costs</a>. Amazon also outsources some customer service work to third-party companies, employees said.</p><p></p>



<p>Despite Amazon’s longtime tenet that it <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">“strives to be Earth’s most customer-centric company,”</a> the common feeling among customer service employees, however long they have worked at the company, is not so warm and fuzzy. “We are the low-level guys, the ones who cost something,” said one longtime customer service manager.</p>



<p>“We definitely are seen as a cost to the company and that’s something that they remind us of often,” said a longtime manager laid off recently.</p>



<p>As with most things at Amazon, customer service teams operate in a culture of thrift and efficiency (even at its corporate offices, Amazon’s idea of employee perks leans more toward <a href="https://fortune.com/2017/01/11/amazon-banana-seattle/#" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2017/01/11/amazon-banana-seattle/#" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">free bananas</a> than the<a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/lunch-at-google-insanely-awesome-as-you-thought" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.seriouseats.com/lunch-at-google-insanely-awesome-as-you-thought" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL"> complimentary gourmet food</a> found at Google). In recent years, however, the push to squeeze costs out of the customer service team has been more pronounced, sources said. All customer service managers and employees who spoke to <em>Fortune </em>said that the already small budgets for rewarding agents with modest gift cards or swag have been slashed or eliminated over the last few years. </p>



<p>“They have cut down all our engagement budgets,” one said: “everything related to improve a team’s morale, relieve stress, make them feel like they belong to the company.”</p>



<p>An Amazon spokesperson disputed that “engagement” budgets have been cut despite claims to the contrary from frontline agents as well as managers with direct knowledge of such budgeting. </p><p></p>



<p>Amazon previously told <em>Fortune </em>that the restructuring was intended to help shrink the gap between higher levels of management and customers. But some managers and frontline agents who spoke to <em>Fortune</em> expressed concern about how much the workloads of the remaining managers will increase, and how customer escalations from frontline agents might get lost in the shuffle.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The mental health toll of vitriolic diatribes</strong></h2>



<p>The cutbacks have come at the same time that Amazon has made it more difficult for customer service agents to provide concessions to customers as easily as they once did, according to employees, some of whom also say that scammers, and customers who have been the victims of scammers, have grown alongside Amazon’s sales. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/amazon-sellers-plagued-by-surge-in-scam-returns-04c86665?mod=hp_lead_pos4" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/amazon-sellers-plagued-by-surge-in-scam-returns-04c86665?mod=hp_lead_pos4" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Customers who abuse Amazon return policies</a> may also be partly to blame.</p>



<p>The upshot for Amazon customer service employees is that accomplishing day-to-day tasks is more challenging, and often accompanied by abuse.</p>



<p>“We’ve become so restrictive and set on frugality that it’s become an uphill climb for even a reasonable customer to get help,” one longtime manager said. </p>



<p>While Amazon helped create the expectation of free returns for the e-commerce industry, the company’s returns process can be at times friction-filled, and employees say it has gotten worse. “It’s just not the customer service that people once knew Amazon for,” one said. </p>

Carter Smith—Bloomberg/Getty Images</p></div>



<p>Longtime employees say this cost-focused environment has exacerbated what some consider to be a mental health crisis among Amazon’s CS agents. They say a dramatic shift began during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when customers who were bound by stay-at-home orders began spewing the type of vitriol at phone agents that they’d never consider unleashing face to face. </p><p></p>



<p>Customers wishing rape or death on Amazon customer service employees is now not unheard-of. Diatribes laced with profanity have become more of the norm.</p>



<p>“The amount of coworkers who’ve told me something like, ‘I don’t think I’d step in front of a bus but I probably wouldn’t move if one was coming,’ is high,” one longtime Amazon employee said.</p>



<p>Managers have taken notice.</p>



<p>“I am very concerned about the mental health of people who report to me and the stress they are under,” one longtime customer service manager told <em>Fortune</em>. </p>



<p>Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan said the company cares “deeply about our employee experience and works hard to continually improve it.” She added that Amazon has programs and resources in place for employees who deal with a “difficult” or abusive interaction, and that CSAs can terminate a customer conversation if a warning doesn’t curb the customer’s behavior.</p><p></p>



<p>Amazon also disputed claims from longtime employees and managers that it is harder for them to provide customer concessions than in the past, but noted that the company has worked over the past two years to more consistently apply its concessions policies in different markets around the world. </p>



<p>“We’re not perfect, and when mistakes occur, we’re not only diligent to remediate it with our customer, but we also use the situation as a learning opportunity that fuels continuous improvement to our tools, processes, and policies,” Amazon’s Callahan said. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A new worry: Are you training your chatbot replacement?</h2>



<p>While some of these issues have percolated for years, a newer one is causing significant strife throughout Amazon’s customer service operation—and AI fears are partly to blame. Recently, Amazon leaders have mandated that customer service agents exclusively use a new internal software tool to resolve customer issues. The software program, known as AC3, has been in development for years, but only recently has access to the previous tool been cut off. </p>



<p>The first issue with the program, according to frontline employees and managers alike, is that the tool is slow and full of bugs, with some agents telling <em>Fortune</em> that it can extend customer interactions by two to three times the previous average. Whereas the old tool used to easily allow an agent to browse a customer’s Amazon history, the tool now mainly prompts employees to follow a Q&amp;A process.</p>



<p>In a role where efficiency goals are stressed, the software hiccups are anxiety-inducing for frontline reps. Consistently missing these goals can affect job security and promotion eligibility, employees told <em>Fortune</em>. Even one manager who believes the tool holds great promise admits it was rolled out before it was ready for prime time.</p><p></p>



<p>“It is defective,” the manager said. </p>



<p>The tool has also severely limited the amount of customer information and purchase history that Amazon customer service agents can access, employees told <em>Fortune</em>. While several managers said limiting access could be a win for customer privacy, they also admitted it often makes resolving issues much more complicated and could actually end up benefiting customers with a history of abusing Amazon’s return policies because representatives are effectively blind to useful, historical context. Several employees described their work as attempting to help customers with a hand tied behind their back.</p>



<p>An Amazon spokesperson said the company continues to invest in tools to improve both the customer and employee experience, and uses feedback to improve. </p>



<p>To make matters worse, some employees also fear that the software tool is designed in such a way that they are essentially helping train their AI replacement. A new structured Q&amp;A flow that agents are now required to follow has struck some workers as an odd, and largely unnecessary, process for their routine interactions with customers. Another possible clue, according to one employee: After an agent resolves a refund issue for a customer using AC3, the final messaging on the screen is written as if a customer is viewing it, not an agent.</p>



<p>“It was employee-facing before and now it’s customer-facing,” one customer service employee said. “It was almost like the customer could do this themselves.” </p><p></p>



<p>Another current longtime customer service manager claimed to <em>Fortune</em> that their superior has confirmed as much.</p>



<p>“It learns,” the longtime manager said of the software. “We are training AI. It’s not speculation.”</p>



<p>The Amazon spokesperson did not offer a comment on the idea that employees are training AI through the tool.</p>



<p>Considering the AI hype cycle currently dominating the business world, no one should blame customer service agents for thinking the worst. The company’s Amazon Web Services division, after all, is currently marketing its own <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/chatbots-in-call-centers/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://aws.amazon.com/chatbots-in-call-centers/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">AI chatbot service specifically to call centers</a>. These fears are not materializing out of thin air.</p>



<p>From the most recent layoffs, to the stress and verbal abuse they encounter regularly, to their dissatisfaction with the new work tool, Amazon customer service employees are wondering whether company executives are even aware of their plight—and whether they should still be able to boast of customer obsession with a straight face.</p><p></p>



<p>“I was excited to join the company years ago,” one longtime manager told <em>Fortune. </em>“I thought we were revolutionary at the time.”</p>



<p>“Now,” they added, “we are exactly the same as anyone else.”</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Job market expectations</strong>: Economists expect the US economy to add 190,000 jobs in May, a slight increase from the 175,000 gain in April.</li>
<li><strong>Wage growth expectations</strong>: Average hourly earnings are expected to increase 0.3% in May, with a 12-month increase of 3.9%, indicating that inflationary pressures remain a concern.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on interest rates</strong>: The jobs report will be closely watched by the Federal Reserve, with a weaker report potentially giving the Fed impetus to cut interest rates sooner than expected. Citi expects the Fed to cut rates in September, with one more cut in December.</li>
<li><strong>Private payrolls growth</strong>: ADP reported slower growth in private payrolls in May, with a gain of 152,000, less than expected. This may indicate a deceleration in employment growth.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Fed policy</strong>: A stronger-than-expected jobs report may reinforce the idea that there is no urgency to cut rates, while a weaker report could give the Fed a reason to cut rates sooner. Citi's out-of-consensus view on rate reductions suggests they expect a more dovish Fed policy.</li>

<li>The European Central Bank (ECB) has cut its main lending rate from 4% to 3.75%, the first rate cut in five years, as the global battle against inflation is shifting gears.</li>
<li>This move comes after a series of rate cuts in recent months from countries like Sweden, Switzerland, Brazil, and Mexico, indicating a shift from aggressive rate hikes to more relaxed monetary policy.</li>
<li>The UK and US are expected to hold off on further rate cuts at their upcoming meetings, but analysts predict that later in the summer or early autumn, the Fed and BoE may also consider cutting rates.</li>
<li>The global battle against inflation, sparked by the pandemic, is entering a new phase as price inflation is finally coming under control, with inflation rates dropping to 2.6% in Europe and 2.3% in the UK.</li>
<li>The ECB's rate cut is a sign of confidence that trends are moving in the right direction, with officials hoping to get inflation back down to the 2% target level, which has been the long-term goal for central banks.</li>

"This is not a central bank in a rush to ease policy.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In Europe, the forces that kept rates low before the pandemic, including slower growth and an aging population, are likely to re-emerge, ultimately sending them back closer to zero, said Joseph Gagnon, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But he said the US is unlikely to see a return to the ultra-low borrowing costs that prevailed in the decade after the financial crisis, pointing in part to big budget deficits that are likely to keep upward pressure on rates. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"We will be a little slower than Europe to cut, but I think we're  also going to end up at a higher interest rate when this is all over," he said. </p></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reversed its ban on e-cigarette products made by Juul Labs, a company associated with the youth vaping epidemic.</li>
<li>The decision does not immediately affect consumers, as Juul products have remained on store shelves since the company appealed the FDA's initial decision to ban the products in June 2022.</li>
<li>The FDA cited court cases involving the vaping industry and the agency's "gained experience" with scientific issues involving e-cigarette products as reasons for reconsidering the ban.</li>
<li>The FDA stressed that its decision does not constitute approval of Juul's requests to market the products, but rather returns the applications to a pending review status.</li>
<li>The reversal of the ban does not necessarily mean that Juul's products will be cleared for sale, as the FDA's review is ongoing and the agency may still restrict or ban the products based on further evaluation.</li>

            The NTSB’s new findings show that when the Southwest pilot radioed the tower, the controller “never determined the accurate position of the airplane” prior to clearing its takeoff. His incorrect assumption was the Southwest plane could take off before an incoming FedEx jet landed on the same runway.
    </p>

            However, taxiing and takeoff take longer in poor weather, and the Southwest plane sat on the runway for 19 seconds performing a procedure that is required under the weather conditions, the board said.
    </p>

            The board concluded the controller used an “inaccurate mental model” and was biased in his past experience of Southwest pilots promptly departing when he assumed the Southwest jet could make it in time.

            Ultimately, the FedEx plane was between 150 and 175 feet away from landing atop the Southwest plane before anyone spotted potential disaster. A FedEx pilot said in an NTSB interview he saw the silhouette of the Southwest wing appear through the clouds and quickly pulled away.

            The weather in Austin that day was so foggy that the controller later told investigators he was listening for the Southwest plane’s engines to know whether it had taken off. After the FedEx pilot averted the collision, the controller<strong> </strong>issued instructions that suggested he believed the Southwest jet was still on the ground, a board member said.

            The NTSB issued seven recommendations Thursday based on the Austin incident, including installing technology at all commercial airports to detect movement of planes and vehicles on the ground. The technology is currently only in use at a few dozen airports.
    </p>

            The NTSB called on the FAA to require pilots to report their position frequently when taxiing in limited visibility conditions.
    </p>

            The board also revealed alarming conditions for the weather office at the Austin airport, although the members did not fault the observer on duty. The windowless weather office has no internet access and no cell phone service. And the office has an FAA-issued computer but no password to log on.

In order for that lender to make a profit and reduce risk to itself, it will charge interest on the principal — that is, the amount you borrowed.</p><p>Expressed as a percentage, a mortgage interest rate is essentially the cost of borrowing money. It can vary based on several factors, such as your <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/credit-score-needed-for-mortgage" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>credit score</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/what-is-your-dti-ratio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>debt-to-income ratio</u></a> (DTI), <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/first-time-homebuyer-down-payment-assistance?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>down payment</u></a>, loan amount and repayment term.</p><p>After getting a mortgage, you’ll typically receive an <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/first-time-homebuyers-mortgage-amortization-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>amortization schedule</u></a>, which shows your payment schedule over the life of the loan. It also indicates how much of each payment goes toward the principal balance versus the interest.</p><p>Near the beginning of the loan term, you’ll spend more money on interest and less on the principal balance. As you approach the end of the repayment term, you’ll pay more toward the principal and less toward interest.</p><p>Your mortgage interest rate can be either fixed or adjustable. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the rate will be consistent for the duration of the loan. With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate can fluctuate with the market.</p><p>Keep in mind that a mortgage’s interest rate is not the same as its annual percentage rate (APR). This is because an APR includes both the interest rate and any other lender fees or charges.</p><p data-unit-credible="rate-table,mortgage-combined,interactive" class="credible"></p><p>Mortgage rates change frequently — sometimes on a daily basis. Inflation plays a significant role in these fluctuations. Interest rates tend to rise in periods of high inflation, whereas they tend to drop or remain roughly the same in times of low inflation. Other factors, like the economic climate, demand and inventory can also impact the current average mortgage rates.</p><p>To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible’s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score.

Generally, they reserve the lowest rates for low-risk borrowers — that is, those with a higher credit score, income and down payment amount. Here are some other personal factors that may determine your mortgage rate:</p><ul><li>Location of the home</li><li>Price of the home</li><li>Your credit score and credit history</li><li>Loan term</li><li>Loan type (e.g., conventional or FHA)</li><li>Interest rate type (fixed or adjustable)</li><li>Down payment amount</li><li>Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio</li><li>DTI</li></ul><p>Other indirect factors that may determine the mortgage rate include:</p><ul><li>Current economic conditions</li><li>Rate of inflation</li><li>Market conditions</li><li>Housing construction supply, demand, and costs</li><li>Consumer spending</li><li>Stock market</li><li>10-year Treasury yields</li><li>Federal Reserve policies</li><li>Current employment rate</li></ul><p data-unit-credible="simple-cta,mortgage-refi,learn-more" class="credible"></p><h2><a name="how-to-compare-mortgage-rates" id="how-to-compare-mortgage-rates"></a>How to compare mortgage rates</h2><p>Along with certain economic and personal factors, the lender you choose can also affect your mortgage rate. Some lenders have higher average mortgage rates than others, regardless of your credit or financial situation. That’s why it’s important to compare lenders and loan offers.</p><p>Here are some of the best ways to compare mortgage rates and ensure you get the best one:</p><ul><li><strong>Shop around for lenders: </strong>Compare several lenders to find the best rates and lowest fees. Even if the rate is only lower by a few basis points, it could still save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.</li><li><strong>Get several loan estimates: </strong>A loan estimate comes with a more personalized rate and fees based on factors like income, employment, and the property’s location. Review and compare loan estimates from several lenders.</li><li><strong>Get pre-approved for a mortgage: </strong><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/mortgage-preapproval?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-approval</a> doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a loan, but it can give you a better idea of what you qualify for and at what interest rate. You’ll need to complete an application and undergo a hard credit check.</li><li><strong>Consider a mortgage rate lock: </strong>A <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/money/lock-or-float-mortgage-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>mortgage rate lock</u></a> lets you lock in the current mortgage rate for a certain amount of time — often between 30 and 90 days. During this time, you can continue shopping around for a home without worrying about the rate changing.</li><li><strong>Choose between an adjustable- and fixed-rate mortgage: </strong>The interest rate type can affect how much you pay over time, so consider your options carefully.</li></ul><p>One other way to compare mortgage rates is with a mortgage calculator. Use a calculator to determine your monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan. Just remember, certain fees like homeowners insurance or taxes might not be included in the calculations.</p><p>Here’s a simple example of what a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might look like versus a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage:</p><h3>15-year fixed-rate</h3><ul><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>$300,000</li><li><strong>Interest rate: </strong>6.29%</li><li><strong>Monthly payment: </strong>$2,579</li><li><strong>Total interest charges: </strong>$164,186</li><li><strong>Total loan amount: </strong>$464,186</li></ul><h3>30-year fixed-rate</h3><ul><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>$300,000</li><li><strong>Interest rate: </strong>6.89%</li><li><strong>Monthly payment: </strong>$1,974</li><li><strong>Total interest charges: </strong>$410,566</li><li><strong>Total loan amount: </strong>$710,565</li></ul><p data-unit-credible="simple-cta,mortgage,find-my-rate" class="credible"></p><h2><a name="pros-and-cons-of-mortgages" id="pros-and-cons-of-mortgages"></a>Pros and cons of mortgages</h2><p>If you’re thinking about taking out a mortgage, here are some benefits to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Predictable monthly payments: </strong>Fixed-rate mortgage loans come with a set interest rate that doesn’t change over the life of the loan. This means more consistent monthly payments.</li><li><strong>Potentially low interest rates: </strong>With good credit and a high down payment, you could get a competitive interest rate. Adjustable-rate mortgages may also come with a lower initial interest rate than fixed-rate loans.</li><li><strong>Tax benefits: </strong>Having a mortgage could make you eligible for certain tax benefits, such as a <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/mortgage-interest-deduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>mortgage interest deduction</u></a>.</li><li><strong>Potential asset: </strong>Real estate is often considered an asset. As you pay down your loan, you can also build home equity, which you can use for other things like debt consolidation or home improvement projects.</li><li><strong>Credit score boost: </strong>With on-time payments, you can build your credit score.</li></ul><p>And here are some of the biggest downsides of getting a mortgage:</p><ul><li><strong>Expensive fees and interest: </strong>You could end up paying thousands of dollars in interest and other fees over the life of the loan. You will also be responsible for maintenance, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/property-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>property taxes</u></a>, and homeowners insurance.</li><li><strong>Long-term debt: </strong>Taking out a mortgage is a major financial commitment. Typical loan terms are 10, 15, 20, and 30 years.</li><li><strong>Potential rate changes: </strong>If you get an <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/adjustable-rate-mortgage-definition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>adjustable rate</u></a>, the interest rate could increase.</li></ul><p data-unit-credible="simple-cta,mortgage,learn-about-mortgage-rates" class="credible"></p><h2><a name="how-to-qualify-for-a-mortgage" id="how-to-qualify-for-a-mortgage"></a>How to qualify for a mortgage</h2><p>Requirements vary by lender, but here are the typical steps to qualify for a mortgage:</p><ol><li><strong>Have steady employment and income: </strong>You’ll need to provide proof of income when applying for a home loan. This may include money from your regular job, alimony, military benefits, commissions, or Social Security payments. You may also need to provide proof of at least two years’ worth of employment at your current company.</li><li><strong>Review any assets: </strong>Lenders consider your assets when deciding whether to lend you money. Common assets include money in your bank account or investment accounts.</li><li><strong>Know your DTI: </strong>Your DTI is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward your monthly debts — like installment loans, lines of credit, or rent. The lower your DTI, the better your approval odds.</li><li><strong>Check your credit score: </strong>To get the best mortgage rate possible, you’ll need to have good credit. However, each loan type has a different credit score requirement. For example, you’ll need a credit score of 580 or higher to qualify for an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment.</li><li><strong>Know the property type: </strong>During the loan application process, you may need to specify whether the home you want to buy is your primary residence. Lenders often view a primary residence as less risky, so they may have more lenient requirements than if you were to get a secondary or investment property.</li><li><strong>Choose the loan type: </strong>Many types of mortgage loans exist, including conventional loans, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/va-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>VA loans</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/usda-loans-what-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>USDA loans</u></a>, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/how-to-use-fha-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>FHA loans</u></a>, and jumbo loans. Consider your options and pick the best one for your needs.</li><li><strong>Prepare for upfront and closing costs: </strong>Depending on the loan type, you may need to make a down payment. The exact amount depends on the loan type and lender. A USDA loan, for example, has no minimum down payment requirement for eligible buyers. With a conventional loan, you’ll need to put down 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI). You may also be responsible for paying any closing costs when signing for the loan.</li></ol><p data-unit-credible="simple-cta,mortgage,compare-mortgage-rates" class="credible"></p><h2><a name="how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage" id="how-to-apply-for-a-mortgage"></a>How to apply for a mortgage</h2><p>Here are the basic steps to apply for a <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-money/mortgage/what-is-a-mortgage?utm_source=foxbusiness&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=mortgage-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mortgage</a>, and what you can typically expect during the process:</p><ol><li><a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/money/some-of-the-best-mortgage-lenders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Choose a lender</u></strong></a><strong>: </strong>Compare several lenders to see the types of loans they offer, their average mortgage rates, repayment terms, and fees.

In some cases, they may request additional information about your finances, assets, or liabilities.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Despite showing signs of easing, inflation is still affecting consumers, particularly lower-income households, according to Joel Anderson, CEO of discount retailer Five Below.</li>
<li>The CEO notes that lower-end customers are being stretched, and the company needs to deliver value through its products and in-store experience to attract these customers.</li>
<li>Five Below issued soft revenue guidance for the second quarter and full year, and revenue for the first quarter came in below expectations, leading to a nearly 11% drop in shares and a new 52-week low.</li>
<li>According to Anderson, consumers are becoming more discerning with their dollars and are buying only what they need, with sales shifting towards "consumable" categories such as candy, food, and beauty products.</li>
<li>Five Below's in-store shop, Five Beyond, which sells products for more than $5, performed better than its lower-income household stores, indicating that consumers seek value when making purchases.</li>

The executive sees underperformance particularly in the lower-income demographic.</p><p>“The lower-end customer is really being stretched,” Anderson said on an earnings call with analysts Wednesday. “We’ve got to deliver value, and we’ve got to really display that in how we go to market, and when you walk in the store, what you see.

<p>Rubio’s Coastal Grill has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a mere days after the Mexican fast casual chain announced the <a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/business/rubios-coastal-grill-closes-over-a-dozen-san-diego-area-stores/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/business/rubios-coastal-grill-closes-over-a-dozen-san-diego-area-stores/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closure of nearly 50 stores across California</a> citing the “rising cost of doing business.”</p>



<p>In a statement, the Carlsbad-based chain said it is seeking the bankruptcy protection for reorganization to “facilitate the sale of the business.” The statement added it will continue at “normal operations” at its remaining 86 stores in the Golden State, Arizona and Nevada.</p>



<p>“Despite the Company’s best efforts to right-size the company, the continued challenging economic conditions have negatively impacted its ability to meet the demands of its debt burden,” Nicholas Rubin, chief restructuring officer of Rubio’s, said in a statement. </p>





<p>“The Company believes the best path forward for Rubio’s is through a court-supervised sale process that will position the brand for long-term success to grow and flourish,” he continued.</p>



<p>Rubio’s will be entering what is known as a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stalkinghorsebid.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,A%20stalking%20horse%20bid%20is%20an%20initial%20bid%20on%20the,to%20succeed%20in%20buying%20them." data-type="link" data-id="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stalkinghorsebid.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,A%20stalking%20horse%20bid%20is%20an%20initial%20bid%20on%20the,to%20succeed%20in%20buying%20them." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stalking horse purchase agreement</a>, which is a type of negotiation where the company determines the lowest bid price, to sell its business, according to the statement — something it expects to be completed in 75 days.</p>



<p>It will mark the second time Rubio’s Coastal Grill has filed for bankruptcy in the last five years. It first sought <a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/report-rubios-restaurant-chain-files-for-bankruptcy/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/report-rubios-restaurant-chain-files-for-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 11 bankruptcy back in 2020</a>, selling off ownership to an investment group to help pull the chain out of a financial downturn.</p>





<p>According to Wednesday’s statement, Rubio’s said it has “a commitment from its existing lender to provide debtor-in-possession financing and has more than adequate liquidity to meet all its operating needs during the sale process” this time around.</p>



<p>Last Friday, the chain announced the abrupt closure of nearly 50 “underperforming” stores across California, including 13 in San Diego County — where the chain originated back in 1983. According to the company, 24 stores in the Los Angeles area were also closed last week, as well as 11 in Northern California.</p>



<p>“Making the decision to close a store is never an easy one,” a spokesperson for Rubio’s Coastal Grill said at the time, adding the move came “after a thorough review of its operations and the current business climate.”</p>



<p>However, the move drew pushback from purported customers and workers on the chain’s social media. At <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7pGMNzvN7h/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">least one user who said they were a worker</a> on a recent Instagram post, which has now been cleared of comments, said they were informed of their store’s closure the day it happened.</p>





<p>Known for its fish tacos, Rubio’s Coastal Grill was founded in Mission Bay in 1983. Since then, the chain has expanded to <a href="https://rubios.com/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 100 stores</a> in California, Arizona and Nevada. According to the spokesperson, 86 stores will remain open after the closures.</p>

    <p>Here are five key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has expressed support for the creation of a new Texas Stock Exchange, which would compete with the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.</li>
<li>The new exchange, called the TXSE Group, has received $120 million in funding from investors such as BlackRock and Citadel Securities, and plans to file registration documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of 2024.</li>
<li>The exchange aims to be more "CEO-friendly" and has announced plans to begin trading in 2025. It will be an entirely electronic exchange but will also have a physical presence in Dallas.</li>
<li>Abbott's support for the exchange sparked criticism from some conservatives, who are critical of BlackRock's involvement due to its ESG initiatives. Abbott has himself been critical of BlackRock in the past, signing a bill in 2021 that banned financial companies with ESG policies from doing business in Texas.</li>
<li>The exchange's backers, including BlackRock, are seeking to create a more "CEO-friendly" environment, which some conservatives see as a threat to the interests of shareholders and a shift towards prioritizing social causes over profits.</li>
