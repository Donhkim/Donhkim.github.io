            The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (IAM CORE), the union representing the workers, said in a <a href="https://www.goiam.org/news/iam-core-members-at-first-unionized-u-s-apple-retail-store-vote-to-authorize-strike/" target="_blank">news release</a> the vote “underscores the frustrations among workers regarding unresolved workplace issues.”

            Employees at the store in Towson, a suburb of Baltimore, have been in contract negotiations with Apple management since last year over a number of issues, including the store’s “unpredictable” scheduling practices and wages that don’t “align with the area’s cost of living.”

            The labor wave hitting Apple retail stores echoes the mass organizing that began at other influential companies in the United States, such as Starbucks and Amazon. As Apple grew to become <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/03/investing/apple-three-trillion-dollar-market-cap/index.html">the world’s first $3 trillion company</a>, a tight labor market from the Covid-19 pandemic exposed labor conditions and inequalities facing workers in stores and warehouses.

            “It speaks to a growing frustration among workers and also a contagion in labor activity, which is when one group of workers stands up and inspires others,” Kate Bronfenbrenner, the director of Labor Education Research at Cornell’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, previously told CNN.

"Going to the doctor will take an entire day. We’re going backward.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When Walmart entered primary care in 2019, it said it could provide many Americans with close and easy access to primary care, including dental, vision and mental health since 90% of Americans lived within 10 miles of a Walmart store.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">However, Walmart found that affordable care was not affordable for providers, even for a retail giant known for squeezing out a profit from low-margin businesses like groceries.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Primary care margins are small, similar to grocery margins," Andrews said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It was a "difficult decision, and like others, the challenging reimbursement environment and escalating operating costs create a lack of profitability that make the care business unsustainable for us at this time," Walmart said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Those economics lay bare the challenges of running a health care business, said Brian Marks, University of New Haven senior lecturer of economics and business analytics. “It’s problematic and suggests we need to reexamine the primary health care delivery system.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Only the company's vision centers and pharmacies, which weren't part of Walmart Health, will now stay open, Walmart said.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Who’s most directly affected by Walmart Health’s closing?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Walmart ran most of the centers in rural, low-income and underserved communities in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois and Texas. These areas will suffer the most from the closings, Trilliant's Andrews said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">People who came into the clinics often had not seen a primary care physician in two or three years or a dentist in five years, Marcus Osborne, Walmart’s former vice president of health and wellness transformation, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/business/walmart-health-care-clinics-amazon-cvs/index.html" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">told CNN in 2020</a>.

<li>The US core consumer price index (CPI) is expected to rise 0.3% from March to April, the first moderation in six months, which may indicate that underlying inflation is starting to ease.</li>
<li>Inflation is still expected to remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, with the core CPI projected to rise 3.6% from April 2023, which is still a relatively high rate.</li>
<li>The underlying services sector has been driving inflation, and prices for these services have not yet shown any significant decrease, which is a concern for the Federal Reserve.</li>
<li>The resilience of the American consumer has been a challenge for the Federal Reserve in bringing inflation down, and retail sales have remained solid in recent months.</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve is monitoring various economic indicators, including producer prices, housing starts, and industrial production, and Federal Reserve officials will be speaking publicly in the coming days to share their views on the economy and inflation.</li>

While that annual increase would be the smallest in three years, it’s still running too fast to placate Federal Reserve policymakers, who want evidence inflation is slowing consistently as they debate the timing of interest-rate cuts.</p><p>The overall CPI probably climbed 0.4% for a third straight month as gasoline prices reached a six-month high. While core goods prices have largely been retreating, underlying services costs remain elevated and explain why inflation proved stubborn in the first quarter.</p><p>Part of the difficulty the Fed has had in bringing inflation down toward its 2% goal rests with the resilient American consumer. Retail sales in February and March advanced solidly, although economists’ projections for April suggest households took a breather. Those figures are also due on Wednesday.</p><p>On Tuesday, economists will parse the government’s report on producer prices to assess the impact of categories such as health care and portfolio management that feed into the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditures price index.</p><p>Other reports in the coming week include housing starts and industrial production for April.</p><p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak Tuesday at a foreign bankers event in Amsterdam. Regional Fed presidents Loretta Mester of Cleveland and Raphael Bostic of Atlanta — who both vote on policy this year — are also slated to speak.</p><p>What Bloomberg Economics Says:</p><p>“April’s core CPI report could appear encouraging – we expect it to decelerate from March – but we see a meaningful likelihood that the month’s core PCE reading, a greater concern for the Fed, could still come in robust.”</p><p>—Anna Wong, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger and Estelle Ou, economists.

Housing starts, manufacturing and wholesale data will also be released.</p><p>Elsewhere, numbers on the strength of the Chinese and Japanese economies, wage data in the UK and the latest European Union forecasts will keep investors busy in coming days.</p><p>Click here for what happened in the past week and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy.</p><p>Asia</p><p>China publishes a slew of data Friday that’s expected to show the second quarter got off to a solid start, with growth in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment accelerating year on year.</p><p>But the housing slump will continue to pose risks, with property investment seen falling more than 9%.</p><p>Japan’s economy is estimated to have contracted in the first quarter on falling private consumption and business investment, as well as the first negative contribution from net exports in a year. Those numbers are due on Wednesday.</p><p>Growth will likely bounce back in the second quarter thanks to recovering auto output, according to Bloomberg Economics.</p><p>On Friday, Malaysia reports gross domestic product numbers.</p><p>Australian wage growth probably picked up a tad in the first quarter, with the unemployment rate forecast to have ticked higher to 3.9% in April.</p><p>Meanwhile, Australia’s Treasurer Jim Chalmers told Bloomberg that the budget will feature a bigger boost for the nation’s critical minerals industry, describing the lucrative market as a “golden opportunity.” He’s set to release his annual fiscal blueprint on Tuesday night.</p><p>Trade statistics are due in Indonesia and Singapore, and the central bank in the Philippines is expected to hold its benchmark rate at 6.5% on Thursday.</p><p>Europe, Middle East, Africa</p><p>The UK will take the spotlight with labor-market data that may encourage policymakers watching for waning inflation pressures.</p><p>Average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, probably rose an annual 5.9% in the first quarter, according to the median estimate of economists.</p><p>While still robust, the continuing downward shift would cheer Bank of England officials, two of whom voted on Thursday for an immediate reduction in borrowing costs against seven who favored no change.</p><p>In the wake of that decision, speeches by UK policymakers will draw attention. Among them, the BOE’s chief economist Huw Pill is scheduled to speak on Tuesday.</p><p>Over in the euro zone, the calendar features several European Central Bank officials. Governors from the Netherlands, Germany, France and Italy are among those set to speak. The ECB’s half-yearly financial stability review will arrive on Thursday.</p><p>Germany’s ZEW investor confidence number on Tuesday will be a highlight in a quieter week for data. The final report on April euro-area inflation will be published on Friday.</p><p>The Brussels-based European Commission will release economic forecasts for the region on Wednesday, including projections for growth, inflation, debt and deficits.</p><p>In Sweden, where the Riksbank delivered a rate cut on May 8 and pledged more this year, minutes of that decision will be released on Wednesday, along with the latest inflation reading.</p><p>GDP numbers from Norway and Poland will be published in the coming week.</p><p>Romania’s central bank on Monday may deliver its first rate cut in three years as inflation gradually subsides there. The country’s latest consumer-price and growth numbers are also due in the coming days.</p><p>Further east, Russia’s inflation is likely to have stayed close to 7.7%, based on the economy ministry’s weekly data. GDP numbers, meanwhile, may show growth picked up in the early months of 2024.</p><p>Bloomberg Economics estimates the Russian economy expanded by 5% year-on-year in the first quarter, from 4.9% in the prior three months, buoyed by war spending and consumer confidence.</p><p>Turning south, Israel’s inflation probably slowed to 2.5%, further evidence that the country’s war on Hamas has had little impact on cost-of-living increases.</p><p>In Nigeria, consumer-price growth is predicted to have accelerated to over 34% in April, partly due to a threefold increase in electricity prices for some urban consumers.</p><p>Elsewhere in Africa, two central bank decisions are due:</p><ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"><li><p>Zambia’s policymakers on Wednesday will probably raise the key interest rate for a sixth straight meeting to support the kwacha, which is trading at record lows against the dollar.</p></li><li><p>Angola’s monetary authority may follow suit on Friday and lift its benchmark for a second time in a row to combat inflation that’s expected to continue to surge due to the scaling back of fuel subsidies.</p></li></ul><p>Latin America</p><p>Colombia’s economy may have eked out a slight expansion in the first quarter, powered by stronger-than-expected output in February.</p><p>The central bank has raised its 2024 growth forecast to 1.4% from 0.8% while cutting next year’s estimate to 3.2% from 3.5%.</p><p>Industrial output, manufacturing and retail sales data, which have gone 12 months without posting a positive reading, are also on tap.</p><p>Meanwhile, Colombia’s top monetary policy official warned that the central bank must be wary that an acceleration of rate cuts may reverse the pace at which inflation is slowing.</p><p>Brazil’s economy picked up at year-end and remained solid in the first two months of 2024. February’s GDP-proxy print was slightly better-than-expected on the back of a minimum wage hike and government income support to lower income households.</p><p>Peru’s GDP-proxy figures for March may have lost some momentum after a higher-than-expected print in February.</p><p>The economy is forecast to rebound from its 2023 recession but the damage has been done: Peruvians living in extreme poverty hit an 11-year high last year.</p><p>In Uruguay, inflation of 3.68%, firmly within the central bank’s target range, may prompt policymakers to trim borrowing costs for a second straight meeting from the current 8.5% on Thursday.</p><p>Argentine President Javier Milei’s so-called shock therapy for the country’s crisis-plagued economy is getting results on the inflation front.</p><p>Analysts now see an April month-on-month print of 9%, down from the 13% forecast in January, with the year-end reading almost 66 percentage points lower at 161.3%.</p><p>--With assistance from Robert Jameson, Monique Vanek, Piotr Skolimowski, Paul Wallace, Tony Halpin and Brian Fowler.</p><p>(Updates with Colombian central banker in LatAm section)</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

<p>While his trading and quantitative analysis strategies have been heavily scrutinized, he has also shared several management and leadership lessons over the years. In 2010, he laid out five “<a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2020/01/22/my-guiding-principles/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2020/01/22/my-guiding-principles/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2020/01/22/my-guiding-principles/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">guiding principles</a>“:</p>



<p>1. “Do something new; don’t run with the pack. I am not such a fast runner. If I am one of <em>N</em> people all working on the same problem, there is very little chance I will win. If I can think of a new problem in a new area, that will give me a chance.”</p>



<p>2. “Surround yourself with the smartest people you can find. When you see such a person, do all you can to get them on board. That extends your reach, and terrific people are usually fun to work with.”</p>



<p>3. “Be guided by beauty. This is obviously true in doing mathematics or writing poetry, but it is also true in fashioning an organization that is running extremely well and accomplishing its mission with excellence.”</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>4. “Don’t give up easily. Some things take much longer than one initially expects. If the goal is worth achieving, just stick with it.”</p>



<p>5. “Hope for good luck!”</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>During a 2022 speech at an event organized by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTaQvnwLzM" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTaQvnwLzM" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUTaQvnwLzM" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">Abel Prize for mathematics</a>, Simons echoed those five principles and also noted that RenTech hired statisticians, physicists, astronomers, and mathematicians in its early years, adding that “I like to say that you can teach a physicist finance, but you can’t teach a finance person physics.”</p>



<p>In fact, RenTech rarely hired to fill a need and instead sought top talent with the assumption they would find ways to improve its quant trading, according to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/how-did-jim-simonss-firm-make-100-billion-he-told-his-secrets-to-our-reporter-f7b335f9" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/how-did-jim-simonss-firm-make-100-billion-he-told-his-secrets-to-our-reporter-f7b335f9" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/how-did-jim-simonss-firm-make-100-billion-he-told-his-secrets-to-our-reporter-f7b335f9" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS"><em>Wall Street Journal</em>‘s Gregory Zuckerman</a>, who wrote a <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557104/the-man-who-solved-the-market-by-gregory-zuckerman/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557104/the-man-who-solved-the-market-by-gregory-zuckerman/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557104/the-man-who-solved-the-market-by-gregory-zuckerman/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">book about Simons</a>. But his ability to motivate all those brilliant minds also stood out. A former senior executive told Zuckerman that “It’s not his genius. It’s his ability to manage genius.”</p>



<p>Zuckerberg also said Simons maintained a flat organizational structure at RenTech that encouraged collaboration and transparency. That philosophy also extended to RenTech’s compensation, in which employees were paid based on its Medallion Fund’s results rather than focusing on individual achievements. </p>



<p>“By Wall Street standards, Jim wasn’t greedy,” another former executive told Zuckerman. “So senior guys were mostly very happy and didn’t fight with each other.”</p>



<p>Simons resigned as RenTech’s chief executive in 2010 and retired as chairman in 2021, while turning more attention to his philanthropy.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/quant-pioneer-james-simons-math-money-and-philanthropy" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/quant-pioneer-james-simons-math-money-and-philanthropy" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/quant-pioneer-james-simons-math-money-and-philanthropy" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">series of talks at MIT in 2019,</a> he reflected on his career, highlighting the people he brought onboard along the way.</p>

    <div><p>A veteran cruise attendee at just 24 years old, Julia Wilcox is used to her inbox flooding with promotional emails from cruise lines courting loyal customers.

It’s the only cruise company that sends her paper mail—and it does so persistently.</p><div class="paywall paywallActive">



<p>“I get so much paper mail from Viking. I’m like, this is insane,” she told <em>Fortune</em>. “You could send me on a free cruise for the amount of paper and things that you send me.”</p>



<p>While anomalous in its marketing strategy, the logic behind Viking’s insistence on sending snail mail makes more sense after Wilcox, a Gen Z TikToker, admitted she’s not the company’s target audience. In fact, she was four decades younger than the cruise guests’ median age of 60 or 70. That’s just how Viking wants it.</p>



<p>“They’re the richest group we have around,” Viking CEO Torstein Hagen said in a May 1 CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/01/short-viking-ceo-on-ipo-very-different-from-other-cruise-companies.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/01/short-viking-ceo-on-ipo-very-different-from-other-cruise-companies.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">Squawk on the Street interview</a>. “They have the money; they have the time.” </p>



<p>Hagen, who at 81 surpasses his baby boomer target audience, has tailored the cruise to the tastes of the older demographic that holds <a href="https://www.usnews.com/pubfiles/USNews_Market_Insights_Boomers2015.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.usnews.com/pubfiles/USNews_Market_Insights_Boomers2015.pdf" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">70% of the country’s disposable income</a>. There are no kids under 18 allowed, and no casinos aboard. Instead, Viking’s line of 92 vessels—traveling to all seven continents and employing a staff of 10,000—offers walking tours of European cities and cheese tastings.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“It’s a quite serene environment for people up in their ages,” Hagen said, “and for curious people who want to go to destinations, not [who want] to go on waterslides and the like.”</p>



<p>Hagen’s strategy has certainly worked thus far. Viking, with a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1745201/000119312524125761/d721231dexfilingfees.htm" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1745201/000119312524125761/d721231dexfilingfees.htm" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">$10.4 billion valuation</a>, raised <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/01/cruise-operator-viking-billion-ipo-initial-public-offering/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/01/cruise-operator-viking-billion-ipo-initial-public-offering/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">$1.5 billion in its initial public offering</a> on May 1, the highest of any company this year.

<p>“We have a very, very clear focus, and that is reflected in all our customer ratings, the rewards we get, and so forth,” Hagen told CNBC. “It doesn’t make us as large as the others, but it certainly makes us more attractive to the consumer.” </p>



<p>Viking did not respond to <em>Fortune</em>‘s request for comment.</p>



<p>The precision and analytical approach Hagen brings to the company reflects his <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2019/04/15/meet-the-man-who-started-viking-cruises-in-his-50s-after-being-fired-losing-millions-and-surviving-cancer/?sh=d5caa262652c" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2019/04/15/meet-the-man-who-started-viking-cruises-in-his-50s-after-being-fired-losing-millions-and-surviving-cancer/?sh=d5caa262652c" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">initial pursuit of physics</a> from the Norwegian Institute of Technology before he came to the U.S. and got his MBA at Harvard. Originally from outside of Oslo, the Norwegian developed his business intuition through failure before success. As CEO of cruise line Royal Viking in the 1980s, Hagen arranged for a $240 million management buyout that failed when a competitor made a surprise purchase of the company. He was soon <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/torstein-hagen/?sh=1dbf9f0342ab" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.forbes.com/profile/torstein-hagen/?sh=1dbf9f0342ab" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">ousted from the role</a>.</p>



<p>Hagen, who operates the company alongside daughter Karine Hagen, founded Viking in 1997 at 54. He considered it a humble venture composed of  “two guys with two mobile phones and four river ships,” according to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1745201/000119312524087969/d496227df1.htm" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1745201/000119312524087969/d496227df1.htm" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">the company prospectus</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The flow</strong></h2>



<p>Viking has benefited from opportune timing for the cruise industry, namely its recovery from pandemic lockdowns that had wealthy vacationers itching for indulgent respites. Patrick Scholes, managing director of lodging and leisure equity research at Truist Securities, is bullish on the industry’s future because of that high demand.</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>“People want a vacation,” he told <em>Fortune</em>. “They’re looking for something different that they hadn’t done for the first two, three years of COVID, which certainly was going on a cruise ship.”</p>



<p>Cruises developed a reputation during the pandemic, as their closed quarters, conducive to contagious disease, sometimes resulted in boats <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/13/grand-princess-cruise-ship-covid-gastro-outbreak-docks-adelaide-south-australia" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/13/grand-princess-cruise-ship-covid-gastro-outbreak-docks-adelaide-south-australia" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">docking early</a>. Even Viking took a hit after <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/110-viking-cruise-passengers-hit-by-nasty-norovirus-outbreak-2023-6" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.businessinsider.com/110-viking-cruise-passengers-hit-by-nasty-norovirus-outbreak-2023-6" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">100 passengers</a> on a June 2023 cruise battled norovirus. Companies sweetened deals to win back customers, offering discounts and promises of private beaches. While restaurants and hotel resorts were slow to recover from the pandemic because of <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2022/article/expected-pandemic-driven-employment-changes.htm#:~:text=level%20in%202030.-,Travel%20and%20accommodation,loss%20of%20roughly%20544%2C200%20jobs." target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2022/article/expected-pandemic-driven-employment-changes.htm#:~:text=level%20in%202030.-,Travel%20and%20accommodation,loss%20of%20roughly%20544%2C200%20jobs." rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">labor shortages</a>, cruise ships’ presence on foreign waters meant not having to abide by U.S. wages and employing ample staff of mostly foreign workers. During Wilcox’s Viking cruise, she marveled at the consistent and frequent turndown and cleaning services.</p>



<p>“In that value proposition is the high, consistent level of staffing and service on a cruise ship,” Scholes said. “You’ve been to a restaurant, you’ve been to a hotel—staffing is a problem, is a challenge after COVID. And cruise lines have not had that problem.”</p>



<p>Bob Levinstein, CEO of travel agency CruiseCompete, told <em>Fortune</em> Viking especially lives up to its value promise, mastering food, service, excursions, and communication into a reliable product.</p>



<p>“They just really have it nailed down,” he said.</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>More growth for the company is on the way. Having weathered the pandemic, Viking has <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/23/cruise-operator-viking-ipo-11-billion-valuation/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/23/cruise-operator-viking-ipo-11-billion-valuation/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">24 ships on order</a>, an option for another dozen, and <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/viking-cruises-founder-torstein-hagen-how-tailoring-experiences-for-chinese-tourists-drives-growth" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/viking-cruises-founder-torstein-hagen-how-tailoring-experiences-for-chinese-tourists-drives-growth" rel="noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">ambitious plans</a> to expand its Chinese customer base to 150,000 passengers by 2025. Viking’s resilience in a tough time for the industry made the decision to go public a no-brainer for Hagen.</p>



<p>“The private equity firms, at some stage, have to create liquidity from their investments, and they’ve been in now for eight years—so it was as good a time as any,” Hagen <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/01/cruise-operator-viking-billion-ipo-initial-public-offering/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/01/cruise-operator-viking-billion-ipo-initial-public-offering/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">told <em>Fortune</em></a> last month. “During the pandemic, it was not easy, and I think now coming out of that and having good results, that was the natural thing to do.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The ebb</strong></h2>



<p>But tides turn, and the economic waters buoying the cruise business are no exception. As cruise companies accommodate growing demand by commissioning more ships, the promotional packages and companies’ pricing power will ebb, Scholes predicted.</p>



<p>“This is just economic capitalism,” he said. “Come 2029, we’re going to see a lot of new ships, and that’s going to be a lot of cabins to fill. It’ll be difficult to raise prices.”</p>



<p>There’s a reason for Viking to stay level-headed through the industry’s maturation, Levinstein argued. The company’s $1.5 billion IPO was well timed, he said, but it likely won’t make waves for Viking’s future. It’s likely just a way for ownership to stay liquid and pad their wallets.</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>“That’s only about four of the ocean ships—maybe a little less if prices have gone up since they made their last deal,” he said. “But it’s not game-changing money.”</p>



<p>The cruise’s humble but established amenities aren’t foolproof, either. “The food definitely was a miss,” Wilcox said of her time aboard a Viking, resulting in the “worst” room service hot dog she’d “ever had.” She heard from other cruisers that the specialty menus the cruise promised to change nightly, but the food items offered have been the same for a decade.</p>



<p>The slip-up in Viking’s reputation of rock-solid amenities may be a strike against the “cookie-cutter” model Hagen touts as a reason for the cruise line’s success, but the CEO remains clear-eyed on the company’s philosophy of streamlined, steadfast service.</p>



<p>“In my belief, the moment you try to do everything for everybody, you know what happens?” he said. “You do nothing well.” </p></div></div>

                                        A cyberattack on the Ascension health system operating in 19 states across the US forced some of its 140 hospitals to divert ambulances, caused patients to postpone medical tests, and blocked online access to patient records. An Ascension spokesperson said it detected "unusual activity" Wednesday on its computer network systems. Officials refused to say whether the nonprofit Catholic health system, based in St. Louis, was the victim of a ransomware attack or whether it had paid a ransom, and it didn't immediately respond to an email seeking updates. But the attack had the hallmarks of ransomware, and Ascension said it had called in Mandiant, the Google cybersecurity unit that's a leading responder to such attacks, per the <a href="https://www.newser.com/article/728ab2a0e5afaf7c344e46a5ce5ca42c/a-cyberattack-forces-a-big-us-health-system-to-divert-ambulances-and-take-records-offline.html">AP</a>.

                        <p>PHOENIX — Arizona’s attorney general is launching an investigation after a health care network with four hospitals in the state filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Dallas-based Steward Health Care <a href="https://www.steward.org/newsroom/2024-05-06/steward-health-care-finalizing-financing-deal-medical" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced Monday</a> it was filing for <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/Steward/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> in Texas, saying it didn’t expect any interruptions to its day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>At a court hearing the next day, the physician-owned network said it is planning to sell all 31 of its U.S. hospitals by the end of the summer to address $9 billion in total liabilities, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/bankrupt-steward-health-puts-its-hospitals-up-sale-discloses-9-bln-debt-2024-05-07/#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2C%20May%207%20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to Reuters</a>.</p><p></p>
<p>Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said Friday she is considering intervening in the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>

<p>“Arizonans deserve to know more about the circumstances that led to Steward’s bankruptcy filing. I am deeply concerned about the potential impact this could have on Arizona patients and medical providers,” Mayes <a href="https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-mayes-announces-investigation-steward-health-cares-bankruptcy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said in a press release</a>.</p>
<h2>What Arizona hospitals are part of Steward Health Care network?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.steward.org/network/our-hospitals#view-state-az" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steward operates</a> three metro Phoenix hospitals — Mountain Vista Medical Center in Mesa, St. Luke’s Behavioral Health Center in Phoenix and Tempe St. Luke’s Hospital — and Florence Hospital in Pinal County. They are set to be auctioned off June 28, along with Steward’s hospitals in Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.</p>
<p>“No matter who ultimately ends up owning and operating these facilities, I am committed to ensuring that no Arizonan is harmed by this bankruptcy, and I will fight to ensure that these hospitals remain open at all times to care for patients without any degradation of service,” Mayes said.</p>

Jones describes it as a mix between modern industrial and boho, with a touch of Balinese influence.</p>

                        <p>The building looks modern on the outside, thanks to the black steel window frames, a mezzanine-style design, and vaulted ceilings. In contrast, the interiors are cozy with lots of wood accents and furniture.</p><p>"We knew that the building itself was quite modern, so we wanted to bring a lot of the tropics and a lot of Bali into it with the interior design," Jones said.</p>

And that's carried on in 2024.</p><p>In a weekly note to clients, Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert examined how stocks are reacting to hotter-than-expected economic data. Investors started the year cheering the data as they priced in a "soft landing" for the US economy, where inflation would return to the Fed's 2% target without an economic downturn. At that time, the S&amp;P 500 moved higher with Citi's Economic Surprise Index, which gauges whether data is coming in better than consensus expectations.</p><p>But after recent hot inflation data, markets have been more skittish as investors have <a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-increasingly-expect-no-landing-for-us-economy-123944030.html" data-ylk='slk:increasingly priced in "no landing,";cpos:16;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;' class="link  yahoo-link" data-rapid_p="35" data-v9y="0">increasingly priced in "no landing,"</a> where inflation doesn't come down to the Fed's target but the economy keeps growing.</p><p>This had led to the market perceiving good economic news to be bad news for inflation, and therefore bad for the market's rate cut hopes. Subsequently, the correlation between the S&amp;P 500 and economic surprise has headed toward negative territory.</p><p>"This suggests hot macro data has increasingly threatened the soft landing narrative that may be needed to push markets higher from these elevated valuation levels," Chronert wrote.</p><p>If inflation data returns to showing further cooling, the question is whether good economic growth news will be once again welcome by the market.</p><h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="weekly-calendar">Weekly calendar</h2><h3 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="monday"><strong>Monday</strong></h3><p><strong>Economic data:</strong> New York Fed one-year inflation expectations, April (3% previously)</p><p><strong>Earnings: </strong>BuzzFeed (<a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BZFD" data-ylk="slk:BZFD;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="36" data-v9y="0">BZFD</a>), Petrobras (<a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PBR" data-ylk="slk:PBR;cpos:18;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="37" data-v9y="0">PBR</a>), Stone (<a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/STNE" data-ylk="slk:STNE;cpos:19;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="38" data-v9y="0">STNE</a>), Tencent Music Entertainment (<a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TME" data-ylk="slk:TME;cpos:20;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="39" data-v9y="0">TME</a>)</p><h3 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="tuesday"><strong>Tuesday</strong></h3><p><strong>Economic data:</strong> NFIB Small Business Optimism, April (88.2 expected, 88.5 previously);

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ethereum has a slightly more bullish bias</strong>: The article predicts that Ethereum's market sentiment is looking more positive, with a slight bounce from $2980 to $3040 on May 9th.</li>
<li><strong>Bitcoin consolidation phase ongoing</strong>: The Bitcoin market is still in a consolidation phase, with a price range of $60k to $64k, and a possible revisit to $60k.</li>
<li><strong>Speculators more eager to long ETH than BTC</strong>: The article suggests that speculators are more eager to long Ethereum than Bitcoin, as reflected in the funding rate and open interest data.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity pockets to attract prices</strong>: The article identifies potential liquidity pockets at $60k, $61.8k, and $63k for Bitcoin, and suggests that traders may want to buy the dip to $50.6k-$60k.</li>
<li><strong>Cautious trading</strong>: The article also advises traders to set stop-losses and be prepared for a move below $59.4k if Bitcoin dips and to be prepared to buy the rebound.</li>

<ul>
<li><em>Ethereum has a slightly more bullish bias for the coming week.</em></li>
<li><em>The Bitcoin consolidation phase was still ongoing, and a revisit to $60k was growing more likely.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/bitcoin-price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin [BTC]</a> traders were going through a relatively tough period after the easy, straightforward rallies that have been the norm since last October.</p>
<p><a href="https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/ethereum-price-prediction" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum [ETH]</a> has been more complicated, but BTC’s halving event last month has changed the market conditions to chop and range formations all over the market.</p>
<p>AMBCrypto investigated what the market sentiment was looking like over the weekend, and where this week’s price action could go.</p>
<h4>One of the two has speculators expectant of bullish returns in the near term</h4>

<p>The 10th of May saw an increase in the Bitcoin Open Interest, but the OI has been trending downward since the price spike on the 6th of May.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the price also formed a series of lower highs over the past week, descending from $64k to $61.1k at press time.</p>
<p>The Funding Rate was negative at the start of May when Bitcoin plummeted to $56k. Since then, the Funding Rate has recovered.</p>
<p>However, in the past few days, it has been barely above zero, which indicated the sentiment was not strongly bullish.</p>

<p>Ethereum also saw Funding Rates slip into the negative territory in early May but has since recovered. The past week’s downtrend saw the funding rate hover around the baseline +0.01 mark.</p>
<p>A slight bounce from $2980 to $3040 on the 9th of May saw the Open Interest and the funding rate jump higher.</p>
<p>This did not repeat with Bitcoin despite a similar price bounce, which suggested that speculators were more eager to long ETH than BTC.</p>
<h4>What are the next liquidity pockets that could attract prices?</h4>

<p>The 7-day liquidation heatmap of Bitcoin showed a bright cluster of liquidations at the $60k area. To the north, $61.8k and $63k are the next bullish targets.</p>
<p>On the 5th of May, we saw prices jump above the $64k mark to collect liquidity before a brutal short-term reversal.</p>
<p>Similarly, we might see a downward plunge on Monday to collect the liquidity at $60k before rebounding higher. Hence, BTC traders would want to buy the dip to the $50.6k-$60k region.</p>
<p>However, traders must also be prepared for a move below $59.4k for BTC, and set their stop-losses accordingly in the event of a dip to $60k.</p>

<hr>
<p>On the other hand, Ethereum has a cluster of liquidity nearby to the north at $2950. This was close to the current market price of $2928. A dip to the $2860 region would likely present a buying opportunity.</p>
<p>The liquidation levels around the $3.1k-$3.2k area present an attractive target. A drop below $2.8k would likely herald a strong short-term downtrend, and traders can cut their losses in this scenario.</p>

<ol>
<li>Union members gathered at Brock's Gap Brewing Co. in Hoover to show support for the United Auto Workers (UAW) ahead of a upcoming election at the Mercedes-Benz U.S. International plant in Vance, Alabama.</li>
<li>The event was organized by More Perfect Union Solidarity, an organization which supports labor, and around 250 people attended, enjoying live music, barbecue, and the outdoor setting.</li>
<li>The event featured a performance by Austin Brooks, a 20-year-old employee at Mercedes' electric battery plant in Bibb County, who sang "Folsom Prison Blues" by Johnny Cash and spoke about his support for the UAW union.</li>
<li>Brooks, who has worked at Mercedes for two years, emphasized the importance of having a union to advocate for workers' interests, saying "The only one who'll look after you in a boardroom is you" and advocating for a union to provide an additional layer of protection for workers.</li>
<li>The event reportedly took place ahead of a crucial election at the Mercedes-Benz plant, where workers are voting on whether to unionize with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.</li>

<ul>
<li>Most of the Americans want to have <strong>$1,400 Stimulus Checks Payment</strong> Amount 2024. Their expectation is that the federal government will provide the money.

Several families of four might receive $5,600 in direct benefits; $1,400 would go to people making less than $75,000, another $1,400 to couples making less than $150,000, and an additional $1,400 to dependents.</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>$1,400 Stimulus Checks 2024 Eligibility Requirements</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>People have to be US citizens or resident aliens for tax purposes, and they cannot be claimed as dependents by another US taxpayer.</li>
<li>Their maximum gross income should not be more than $75,000 for single people and $150,000 for married couples.</li>
<li>Scholars who are not residents of America and students who are in their first 5 years of study here are not eligible for stimulus payments.</li>
<li>Eligibility is restricted to individual taxpayers with an AGI income of more than $99000, as well as minors over 16 and college students under 24.</li>
<li>Even with earnings up to $112,500 and $1,400 for each dependent, the individuals are still entitled for $1,400. At a income of $150,000 or more, stimulus checks for those Americans will end completely.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When Will You Receive $1400 Stimulus Payments?</strong></h3>
<p>Most previous stimulus payment recipients received their funds directly into the bank linked to their IRS registration. If you were not registered for direct deposit with the IRS, the processing and delivery of your <strong>$1400 Stimulus Payment 2024</strong> as a check or debit card might take a little longer. The couples and individuals who meet the requirements will get the <strong>$1400 Stimulus Check Payment 2024</strong> immediately. The IRS website has a daily updated feature called “Get My Payment,” that you can use to see if your payment has been scheduled and to monitor its status. If so, you will be able to view the <strong>$1400 Stimulus Checks 2024 Payment Date</strong> and other updates.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>$1400 Stimulus Checks 2024 Latest Update</strong></h3>
<p>Several senators pushed for a stimulus check in 2024 in an attempt to help Americans who were struggling to recover from corona virus and its financial impacts but the <strong>$1400 Stimulus Checks 2024 </strong>never came to pass. The economy and employment had rebounded when the country started to reopen, so it didn’t seem necessary for another government stimulus check. Still, a number of governments took many action and provided their citizens with a fourth stimulus payment. A stimulus check is intended to support people experiencing financial hardship and encourage consumer spending. Thus, as of right now, I believe that in 2024 there won’t be a stimulus check from IRS.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>$1400 Stimulus Checks Fact Check</strong></h3>
<p>Government stimulus checks were already shared to citizens during the corona virus pandemic and afterwards. However, as this program is only available in emergency situations, the government is no longer running it. However, representatives hold constant meetings to talk about the rising cost of living and other issues. It was made clear by a recent fact check on <strong>IRS $1400 Stimulus Checks 2024 Payment</strong> that the US government has not officially announced any additional stimulus payments or other forms of assistance. The US Congress gave its approval for the prior stimulus payments, that were sent out in 2020 and 2021.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Restaurant visits are down</strong>: According to location analytics firm Placer, visits to sit-down restaurants in the US were down nearly 5% in 2023 compared to the previous year.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation is a major factor</strong>: The weakening of the US dollar due to inflation is leading to decreased spending power, causing people to eat out less.</li>
<li><strong>Restaurant closures are increasing</strong>: Over 40 bars and restaurants in New York City closed from December 2023 to January 2024, with some owners citing low demand.</li>
<li><strong>The problem is not limited to NYC</strong>: Other major metropolitan areas in the US are also struggling to maintain profitable environments for restaurants.</li>
<li><strong>Restaurant owners are struggling to repay loans</strong>: Many restaurants that are forced to close couldn't pay off their 30-month deferred loans, some of which were taken out during the COVID-19 lockdowns.</li>
