Both retailers are in the midst of ambitious turnaround plans and are performing better than expected because of new strategies they’ve implemented. </p><p>Gap <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/30/gap-gps-earnings-q1-2024.html">posted positive comparable sales</a> for all four of its brands — Athleta, Old Navy, Banana Republic and its namesake banner — for the first time in “many years,” beating Wall Street’s expectations across the board, the company said. </p><p>For years, Gap had been losing market share to buzzy competitors. But <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/gap-taps-mattel-executive-richard-dickson-to-be-its-new-ceo.html">under new CEO Richard Dickson</a>, the marketing guru credited with reviving the Barbie franchise, the apparel chain has focused on financial rigor, brand storytelling and product development. In under a year, Gap’s sales and profits have meaningfully improved, and its brands are beginning to be part of the cultural conversation again.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>A few weeks ago, actor Anne Hathaway went to a Bulgari party wearing a white Gap shirt dress that had been designed by the company’s new creative director, Zac Posen. Critically, Gap dropped the $158 dress to consumers, and it sold out within hours. This combination of marketing and exclusive product drops is what Gap had long been lacking, and what competitors had already been doing. </p><p>Foot Locker had declined over the last couple of years, but with the right combination of new strategies and a little bit of luck, its turnaround is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/30/foot-locker-fl-earnings-q1-2024.html">showing signs of life</a>. </p><p>Under CEO Mary Dillon, Foot Locker has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/24/inside-foot-lockers-plan-to-revitalize-retail-footprint.html#:~:text=The%20new%20format%20also%20includes,customized%20options%20like%20specialized%20lacing.">worked to change its stores</a>, where it does more than 80% of its sales.<strong> </strong>It has tried to create not only a better shopping experience for consumers but also a better place for its critical brand partners.</p><p>Instead of two walls of shoes with competing brands mixed together, Foot Locker is changing its fleet so the brands have their own unique displays. Its new “store of the future” concept at a New Jersey mall that brings that strategy to life has become its best performing store in North America in just a few weeks, Dillon told CNBC, adding that brands are thrilled with the new design. </p><p>The shift couldn’t have come at a better time. Years into Nike’s strategy to cut out wholesalers and sell directly to consumers, the retailer is realizing it went too far and is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/12/nike-ceo-acknowledges-it-went-too-far-in-direct-push.html">now changing course</a>.</p><p>With refreshed stores and better product displays, consumers are converting more, too, and paying full price — even Foot Locker’s lower-income shopper. </p><p>“Our consumer ... this is a category that is very important to them. So when people have discretionary income, it may be limited, but you’re gonna prioritize where you spend it, right?” said Dillon. “We’re proving that people are willing to spend full price, but you have to have the right products and serve it up in a way that makes it enticing, right?

She said the retailer was overly focused on jeggings in the past but now, low-rise, baggy fits are in. </p><p>During a store visit at the American Dream mall in New Jersey on Thursday, an associate told CNBC that the location didn’t have the low-rise, baggy fit in-stores, and they were only available online. Meanwhile, there was a wall of jeggings. Still, denim was a strong performer for the company during the quarter, and it had a variety of other styles that resonated with customers at the location, the company said.</p></div><div class="group"><p>Denim is having a moment with shoppers. Search levels for denim are hitting peaks in a 20-year data set, particularly for categories like tops and dresses, according to a Morgan Stanley research note. </p><p>Kohl’s is missing the mark in a far more meaningful way. The retailer <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/30/kohls-kss-earnings-q1-2024.html#:~:text=Kohl's%20reported%20a%20net%20loss,compared%20to%20the%20year%20prior.">posted dismal numbers</a> on Thursday, as both earnings and revenue fell well short of expectations. It cut its full-year forecast and its shares plunged more than 20%, the stock’s biggest single-day percentage decline ever.</p><p>The weak results illustrated a challenge the retailer is still contending with: Keeping up with trends and staying relevant. </p><p>CEO Tom Kingsbury told CNBC he expects the “head-to-toe” denim trend to play a role in the back half of the year, but it could already be out of style by the time Kohl’s gets around to adding the clothing items to its shelves.</p><p>“Denim is OK business for us. I mean it’s really not the most important time for denim,” said Kingsbury. “We’re selling shorts and tees. And more, you know, warm weather product.” </p><p>Gap, one of the longtime denim leaders, didn’t seem to be concerned about denim going out of favor because the weather is warmer. CEO Dickson said the company is getting ready to launch its “exclusive lightweight denim fabric” dubbed “Ultra Soft” in time for the summer.</p><p>Failing to chase trends has been an ongoing issue for the aging department store Kohl’s. Kingsbury told CNBC in March that Kohl’s used to buy product for the juniors department catering to teen girls — one of the most trend-driven areas of its stores — 12 to 14 months in advance. When the apparel hit the sales floor, it was “dead on arrival.”</p><p>In an age where viral TikTok videos dictate the life and death of trends, it’s more important than ever for retailers to stay on top of what’s working with customers and what isn’t. They’re not just competing with legacy players, they’re also vying for customers with innovative yet controversial upstarts like Chinese-linked Shein, which can go from an idea to an online product in a matter of weeks.</p><p>That’s a far cry from the lead times at <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-25"><a href="/quotes/UAA/">Under Armour</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span>, where it currently takes about 18 months to get a product from an idea to a showroom floor. During an earnings call with analysts on May 16, CEO Kevin Plank called the system “just plain uncompetitive in the 2024 landscape” as he laid out a plan to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/16/under-armour-uaa-earnings-q4-2024.html#:~:text=The%20company's%20reported%20net%20income,of%2011%20cents%20per%20share.">streamline the process</a>. </p><p>Meanwhile, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch posted another stellar set of results, even as it begins to lap tougher comparisons. It has posted torrid growth in part because the company is responsive to its customers and a has nimble supply chain that has allowed it to chase trends quickly and efficiently. </p><p>It posted its strongest first quarter in history, and now expects sales to grow 10% in fiscal 2024, up from previous guidance of between 4% and 6%. </p><p>CEO Fran Horowitz told CNBC that low-rise, baggy jeans are also uber-popular with its customers. During a recent visit by CNBC to its Hollister store just a short walk from American Eagle’s outpost, plenty of those style of jeans were on display for shoppers as soon as they walked into the store.</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Don’t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO</h2></div></div></div></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>

The rate was 8% in patients treated with a standard drug, the trial found.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The results are the longest progression-free survival (PFS) outcomes ever recorded in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the world’s most common form of the disease. They were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Asco) in Chicago on Friday.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“To our knowledge these results are unprecedented,” said the study’s lead author, Dr Benjamin Solomon, a medical oncologist at the Peter MacCallum <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Cancer</a> Centre in Melbourne, Australia.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">In the phase 3 trial, 296 patients with advanced forms of non-small cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to receive either lorlatinib (149 patients) or crizotinib (147 patients, of whom 142 ultimately received treatment).</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Just over half of the patients were women. In about 25% of them their lung cancer had already spread to the brain when the study began.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The participants all had ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. Lorlatinib and crizotinib are both ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). ALK TKIs are targeted treatments that bind to the ALK protein found in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer and stop the growth of tumour cells.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Despite significant advancements with newer generation ALK TKIs, the majority of patients treated with second-generation ALK TKIs will have progression of their disease within three years,” said Solomon.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Lorlatinib is the only ALK TKI that has reported five-year progression-free survival, and even after this time, the majority of patients continue to have their disease controlled, including control of disease in the brain.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The five-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 60% in patients who took lorlatinib and 8% in the crizotinib group.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“You don’t need a magnifying glass to see the difference between these two drugs,” said Dr Julie Gralow, Asco’s chief medical officer. “Sixty per cent five-year progression-free survival in non-small cell lung cancer is just unheard of.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Dr David Spigel, the chief scientific officer of the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in London, a world-leading clinical trials facility specialising in new therapies for cancer patients, welcomed the findings. “These long-term data results are off the chart,” he said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Most of the patients experienced some side-effects. Treatment-related issues occurred in 77% of patients on lorlatinib and in 57% of patients on crizotinib. The most common side-effects reported in the trial that was funded by Pfizer were swelling, high cholesterol and elevated lipid levels.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Cancer Research UK’s chief clinician, Prof Charles Swanton, who was not involved with the study, said the “groundbreaking” results would offer fresh hope for patients with advanced lung cancer.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Despite progress in our understanding of the disease, it can be incredibly challenging to control cancers that have spread and there are limited treatment options for lung cancer,” he said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Showcasing the power of cancer-growth blocker drugs, this study could present us with an effective way of stopping cancer in its tracks and preventing it from spreading to the brain.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“The groundbreaking results show that over half of the patients who took lorlatinib did not suffer a progression in their disease after five years. In contrast, over half of the patients who took crizotinib experienced disease progression after just nine months.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Research like this is vital to find new ways to treat lung cancer and help more people survive for longer.”</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are five key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dell Technologies reported modest growth in its first-quarter earnings report, with revenue rising 6% to $22.2 billion, beating estimates. However, adjusted earnings per share fell 3% to $1.27, which matched the consensus.</li>
<li>The company's guidance for the rest of the year disappointed, with adjusted earnings per share expected to be between $1.55 and $1.75, below the consensus estimate.</li>
<li>Dell's PC-focused Client Solutions Group reported flat revenue growth, while the Infrastructure Solutions Group, which is focused on artificial intelligence (AI), saw revenue rise 22% to $9.2 billion.</li>
<li>Dell's stock fell 19.6% as a result of the disappointing guidance and earnings report. The company's AI-focused business, however, continues to grow, with AI-optimized server orders increasing sequentially.</li>
<li>The article suggests that investors looking to capitalize on the growing demand for AI servers may be better off considering a peer like Super Micro Computer, which is seeing faster growth, rather than buying stock in Dell Technologies at the current time.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to a new study, nearly half of master's degree programs actually leave students financially worse off, with a negative return on investment (ROI) of 43%.</li>
<li>Master's degrees in fields such as business administration (MBA) have a low or negative payoff, with a median ROI of around $50,000.</li>
<li>Bachelor's degree programs, on the other hand, have a median ROI of $160,000, with some fields such as engineering, computer science, and economics having a payoff of $500,000 or more.</li>
<li>The only subject that may result in a six-figure starting salary is computer and information sciences, with an average starting salary of $105,894 for the class of 2022.</li>
<li>To increase earning potential, students are advised to study fields such as tech or business, with computer and information sciences being a good bet for a six-figure salary.</li>

    <div><div class="paywall">



<p>Quite the opposite: According to <a href="https://freopp.org/does-college-pay-off-a-comprehensive-return-on-investment-analysis-563b9cb6ddc5" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://freopp.org/does-college-pay-off-a-comprehensive-return-on-investment-analysis-563b9cb6ddc5" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">new research</a>, nearly half of master’s degree programs actually leave students financially worse off.</p>



<p>While 23% of bachelor degree programmes yield a negative financial return on investment this nearly doubles to 43% for masters degrees, according to the study by the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity.</p>



<p>“Even the MBA, one of America’s most popular master’s degrees, frequently has a low or negative payoff,” the report warned. </p>



<p>FREOPP used the Department of Education’s College Scorecard and Census Bureau earnings data to estimate ROI for over 53,000 degrees and certificate programs—and found that all sectors of higher education contain negative ROI programs. </p><p></p>



<p>However, master’s degrees are the worst performers due to their high fees, time spent out of the workforce, and often modest earnings.</p>



<p>The median ROI — defined as the lifetime earnings a student can expect when they enroll in a degree program minus their cost of attendance and earnings lost while enrolled — for all master’s degrees is around $50,000. </p>



<p>For those with an MBA, this rises to $101,000. But in comparison, bachelor’s degree programs have a median ROI of $160,000—and that’s including those who take drama and art.</p>



<p>Bachelor’s degrees in engineering, computer science, nursing, and economics tend to have a payoff of $500,000 or more.</p>



<p>“One reason for this poor performance is that MBA students typically have high preexisting earnings potential, having often chosen high-ROI undergraduate majors such as finance and economics, so the MBA adds little value on top of that,” the research explains. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Want a six-figure job? Get a master’s degree in computer and information sciences </h2>



<p>That being said, Gen Zers who are still hell-bent on one-upping graduates with more qualifications to their name, should look at studying tech or business fields if they actually want to up their earning potential. </p><p></p>



<p>Really, the only subject that may result in a six-figure starting salary is computer and information sciences.</p>



<p>The National Association of Colleges and Employers analyzed the starting salaries for the class of 2022 and found that those who had a master’s degree in computer and information sciences enjoyed an average starting salary of <a href="https://naceweb.org/job-market/compensation/00cf3736-e2f0-4b98-80f4-cec5332eac56" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://naceweb.org/job-market/compensation/00cf3736-e2f0-4b98-80f4-cec5332eac56" rel="noopener" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">$105,894. </a></p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>In comparison, those with a bachelor’s degree in the same field earned around $20,000 less. </p>



<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of the top 10 master’s degrees with the highest average starting salaries are in STEM fields. </p>



<p>Those who graduated with a Master of Engineering earned an average starting salary of around $98,040.</p><p></p>



<p>Meanwhile, those with a master’s degree in mathematics and statistics walked into jobs paying upwards of $83,000. However, even those with a mathematics and statistics bachelor’s degree secured positions with salaries over $76,000.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The 10 master’s degrees with the highest average starting salaries</h2>



<p>1. Computer and information sciences: $105,890<br>2. Engineering: $98,040<br>3. Engineering technologies and related fields: $90,610<br>4.

<li><strong>Improved sales</strong>: Gap now expects annual sales to be slightly up from last year, compared to previous expectations of roughly flat sales. The company's eponymous brand, Old Navy, and Athleta banners all posted sales growth in the first quarter.</li>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>By Granth Vanaik</p><p>(Reuters) -Shares of Gap soared about 28% on Friday after the apparel retailer lifted its full-year sales target, indicating that its effort to revitalize the business by bringing in newer styles is starting to bear fruit.</p><p>The stock is on track to its biggest one-day percentage gain since November and has risen over 37% this year, including Friday's gains. This follows a growth of over 85% in 2023.</p><p>Gap's upgraded outlook gives Wall Street fresh proof that CEO Richard Dickson's turnaround strategy - to introduce trendier styles across its brands and ramp up marketing efforts to attract picky shoppers - is paying off less than a year after he joined the struggling mall retailer from Mattel.</p><p>"(Dickson's) personnel, product, and operating changes have already re-invigorated a company that had been floundering for years," said Morningstar analyst David Swartz.</p><p>The Banana Republic owner now sees annual sales slightly up from last year, compared with prior expectations of roughly flat sales.</p><p>Gap's eponymous brand posted 3% comparable sales growth in the first quarter, while the Old Navy and Athleta banners posted 3% and 5% increases, respectively.</p><p>"While it is still early days for Gap’s turnaround plan, the Gap brand feels fresh again. It is on-trend and gaining cultural cache," said Emarketer analyst Zak Stambor.</p><p>The average rating of 20 analysts on Gap's stock is "hold", with a median price target of $23, according to LSEG data. As many as 10 brokerages lifted their price targets on Friday. The stock was last trading at $28.65.</p><p>Gap's median price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) for the next 12 months, a common benchmark for valuing stocks, is about 15, below its two-year average of 17, according to LSEG. That compares to an industry median PE of about 13.</p><p>Retailers including Walmart, Target and Gap's peer Abercrombie &amp; Fitch have indicated in their recent results that apparel demand has begun to pick up after a slowdown last year.</p><p>Gap has gained share in a competitive market where the consumer remains extremely choosy, said Mari Shor, an equity analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.</p><p>(Reporting by Granth Vanaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Tasim Zahid)</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nvidia is on track to surpass Apple as the second-most valuable company in the world, with a market value of $2.68 trillion, compared to Apple's $2.92 trillion.</li>
<li>Nvidia's success is attributed to its high-end chips being used in many artificial intelligence (AI) applications, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, which has fueled a nearly tripling of the company's value over the past year.</li>
<li>Apple, on the other hand, has been struggling with declining iPhone sales and competition in China, causing its market value to decline. It ceded the top spot to Microsoft earlier this year.</li>
<li>Nvidia's stock has been driven by strong demand for its graphics processors, which has led to consistently beating analysts' revenue and profit expectations. Its forward earnings valuation has also fallen to 37 times earnings, compared to 48 times a year ago.</li>
<li>Nvidia's popularity extends beyond the stock market, with a popular ETF tracking the company's stock and a record $2.82 billion in total net assets. Options traders are also bullish on the company's stock, with volumes picking up in recent sessions.</li>

Recently though, Apple's innovation curve seems to have flattened, showing slower future growth," said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.</p><p>"On the other hand, Nvidia has been able to catch wave upon wave of growth. Beginning with gaming demand, then crypto and now AI, they have been able to perfectly match innovation with demand and that equals explosive growth."</p><p>The semiconductor company is heavily weighted on the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq and has been pivotal in driving U.S. stocks to record highs.

And while all the focus was on the $71,995 Wagoneer S, the automaker had one more thing to show off: an off-road-capable Trailhawk concept of the same EV, sitting pretty on 31.5-inch tires. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">The forest green SUV sports several features that distinguish it from the standard Wagoneer S, including an intimidating laser-cut roof rack, 3D-printed tow hooks, lifted suspension, wheel caps, and a host of other goodies for gearheads and boulder lovers alike. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component clear-both block md:float-left md:mr-30 md:w-[320px] lg:-ml-100"><div class="duet--article--article-pullquote mb-20"><p class="mb-10 h-[22px] w-[65px] bg-franklin"></p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup relative bg-repeating-lines-dark bg-[length:1px_1.2em] pb-8 font-polysans text-28 font-medium leading-120 tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20  dark:bg-repeating-lines-light dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple">Sitting pretty on 31.5-inch tires</p></div></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Trailhawk is the trim name usually applied to Jeep’s most rugged off-road vehicles, complete with more durable equipment and materials. In addition, Trailhawk vehicles are often trail rated, meaning they’ve passed a battery of tests for maneuverability, articulation, and ground clearance. And with the Wagoneer S Trailhawk concept, Jeep is signaling its interest in extending those capabilities to its nascent battery-electric segment. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">The Trailhawk concept boasts a lot of the same features as the Wagoneer S — while taking them a step further. In addition to those all-terrain 31.5-inch tires, the concept sits on a lifted suspension for better ground clearance. Tow hooks are embedded in the front and rear of the vehicle, and functional air extractors are intended for high-pressure environments. The hood decal is anti-glare, the badging is flush with the vehicle, and the panoramic sunroof is dual panel for letting in fresh air — or trail dust, as it were. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Jeep’s five driver modes for the Wagoneer S gain a sixth mode for the Trailhawk concept: Rock. The mode selector is emergency red in the center console for ease of switching. And the steering wheel is octagonal-shaped, with special grips at the 9 and 3 o’clock positions for those especially hairy moments. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Electric off-roading isn’t exactly a new thing. Ford, Chevy, GMC, and Rivian all market their electric trucks as just as capable on gravel as they are on pavement. And the annual King of the Hammers off-roading competition features a segment just for battery-powered rock crawlers. But Jeep is a brand that prides itself on its overpowered dirt spewers, so introducing a plug-in version would make total sense. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">The company isn’t committing to putting the Trailhawk concept into production, but during today’s event, executives hinted heavily that the off-roader would indeed eventually become a real EV. Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa said that the Wagoneer S would feature several trims, with the fully loaded Launch Edition coming first. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white"><em>Photography by Andrew J.
