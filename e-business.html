    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Sahm Rule, a measure of unemployment rates, is used to predict recessions. When the three-month moving average of the jobless rate rises by at least a half-percentage point from its low during the previous 12 months, then a recession has started.</li>
<li>According to the latest unemployment figures, the gap between the Sahm Rule's low and current rate has widened to 0.43 in June, the highest level since March 2021.</li>
<li>The Sahm Rule's creator, Claudia Sahm, believes that even from low levels, a rising unemployment rate can set off a negative feedback loop that leads to a recession. When workers lose paychecks, they cut back on spending, and businesses need fewer workers, etc.</li>
<li>However, Sahm also notes that the pandemic may have caused so many disruptions in the economy and labor market that indicators like the Sahm Rule may not be as accurate right now.</li>
<li>Despite this, the Sahm Rule has signaled every recession since 1970, making it a reliable indicator of economic downturns.</li>

<p>While unemployment is still historically low, its rate of increase could be a sign of deteriorating economic conditions. That’s where the so-called <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/what-is-sahm-rule-unemployment-predictor-recession/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/what-is-sahm-rule-unemployment-predictor-recession/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/what-is-sahm-rule-unemployment-predictor-recession/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sahm Rule</a> comes in.</p>



<p>It says that when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate rises by at least a half-percentage point from its low during the previous 12 months, then a recession has started. This rule would have signaled every recession since 1970.</p>



<p>Based on the latest unemployment figures from the Labor Department’s monthly report on Friday, the gap between the two has <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmacro&amp;stream=business" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmacro&amp;stream=business" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmacro&amp;stream=business" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">expanded to 0.43</a> in June from 0.37 in May.</p>



<p>It’s now at the highest level since March 2021, when the economy was still recovering from the pandemic-induced crash. </p><p></p>



<p>The creator of the rule, Claudia Sahm, was an economist at the Federal Reserve and is now chief economist at New Century Advisors. She has previously explained that even from low levels a rising unemployment rate can set off a negative feedback loop that leads to a recession. </p>



<p>“When workers lose paychecks, they cut back on spending, and as businesses lose customers, they need fewer workers, and so on,” she wrote in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-07/one-highly-accurate-recession-indicator-could-be-wrong-this-time" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-07/one-highly-accurate-recession-indicator-could-be-wrong-this-time" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-07/one-highly-accurate-recession-indicator-could-be-wrong-this-time" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Bloomberg opinion column</a> in November, adding that once this feedback loop starts, it is usually self-reinforcing and accelerates.</p>



<p>But she also said the pandemic may have caused so many disruptions in the economy and the labor market that indicators like the Sahm Rule that are based on unemployment may not be as accurate right now.</p>



<p>A few weeks ago, however, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/economist-sahm-who-devised-recession-rule-says-the-fed-is-playing-with-fire-.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/economist-sahm-who-devised-recession-rule-says-the-fed-is-playing-with-fire-.html" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/economist-sahm-who-devised-recession-rule-says-the-fed-is-playing-with-fire-.html" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sahm told CNBC</a> that the Federal Reserve risks sending the economy into a recession by continuing to hold off on rate cuts.</p>



<p>“My baseline is not recession,” she said on June 18. “But it’s a real risk, and I do not understand why the Fed is pushing that risk. I’m not sure what they’re waiting for.”</p><p></p>



<p>That came days after the Fed’s June policy meeting when central bankers kept rates steady after holding them at 5.25%-5.5%—the highest since 2001—since July 2023. </p>



<p>The Fed meets again at the end of this month and is expected to remain on hold, but odds are rising that a cut could happen in September.</p>



<p>Sahm also said last month that the Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s stated preference to wait for a deterioration in job gains is a mistake and that policymakers should instead focus on the rate of change in the labor market.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“We’ve gone into recession with all different levels of unemployment,” she explained. “These dynamics feed on themselves. If people lose their jobs, they stop spending, [and] more people lose jobs.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Wall Street has had a more sanguine view of the economy, citing last year’s widespread recession predictions that proved wrong as well as the AI boom that’s helping to fuel a wave of investment and earnings growth.</p><p></p>



<p>Last month, Neuberger Berman senior portfolio manager Steve Eisman also pointed to the boost in infrastructure spending.</p>



<p>“We’re just powering through, and I think the only conclusion you can reach is that the U.S. economy is more dynamic than it’s ever been in its history,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/13/big-short-investor-steve-eisman-the-u-s-economy-is-more-dynamic-than-its-ever-been.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/13/big-short-investor-steve-eisman-the-u-s-economy-is-more-dynamic-than-its-ever-been.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">he told CNBC</a>.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get global CEO perspectives on the biggest stories in business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p>.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tax-free portfolio</strong>: The article proposes a portfolio that can generate a 7.8% dividend yield with solid dividend growth, while avoiding taxes at the individual and corporate level.</li>
<li><strong>Business development companies (BDCs)</strong>: The portfolio consists of three BDCs (BIZD), three midstream master limited partnerships (MLPs) (AMLP), and three real estate investment trusts (REITs) (VNQ). All these corporate structures are exempt from paying corporate income tax as pass-through entities.</li>
<li><strong>Tax-advantaged accounts</strong>: The REITs and BDCs are placed in a Roth account, while the MLPs are held in a taxable account. This allows the investor to avoid paying taxes on dividends.</li>
<li><strong>Tax-free benefits</strong>: By holding the MLPs until death, the investor can avoid paying taxes on the MLP distributions, as these distributions are mostly tax-free.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term strategy</strong>: The portfolio is designed to be held until death, allowing the investor to benefit from tax-free growth and income over an extended period.</li>

As many investors approach retirement, they become increasingly aware of the certainty of death. However, the motivation to avoid painful taxes also becomes quite strong. In<span class="paywall-full-content invisible"> this article, we will share a simple portfolio designed to generate a 7.8% dividend yield along with solid dividend growth while also avoiding taxes at the individual and corporate level.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">The way we accomplish this is by investing in three business development companies (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIZD" title="VanEck Vectors BDC Income ETF">BIZD</a>), three midstream MLPs (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMLP" title="ALPS Alerian MLP ETF">AMLP</a>), and three real estate investment trusts (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNQ" title="Vanguard Real Estate ETF">VNQ</a>) as all of these corporate structures are exempt from paying corporate income tax as pass-through entities. By placing the REITs and BDCs in a Roth account and the MLPs in a taxable account and<span class="paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible"> holding them until death, you get the benefits of not having to pay any taxes on dividends. This is because the MLP distributions are almost always considered to be return of capital, which means they are tax-deferred, and if you hold the MLPs until you die, you can pass them on to your heirs with a cost basis step-up, effectively rendering the distributions you have received in the meantime completely tax-free. Additionally, even if you live long enough for your return on capital to deplete your cost basis, by simply reinvesting some of your distributions in buying more of those same MLPs, you can increase your cost basis again, thereby continuing to defer paying taxes indefinitely. Note that this is not tax advice, as it merely reflects my own understanding of how things work, but I am not a tax expert.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Without further ado, let's discuss the nine stocks.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">BDCs</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">First, the BDCs include Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSDL" title="Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund">MSDL</a>), Blue Owl Corporation III (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OBDE" title="Blue Owl Capital Corporation III">OBDE</a>), and Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BXSL" title="Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.">BXSL</a>). I recently wrote a more <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702380-morgan-stanley-direct-lending-compelling-10-percent-defensive-yield-msdl-stock">in-depth article</a> on MSDL, but the bottom line is that they offer a very attractive 10.5% next 12-month dividend yield, they cover their dividend quite comfortably with net investment income, and they have strong underwriting performance with just 0.4% of the portfolio at cost on non-accrual, and 98.4% of the portfolio has an internal risk rating of either one or two. Additionally, 95% of the portfolio is invested in first-lien loans and 4% in second-lien loans, leaving a mere 1% in non-first or second-lien loans. On top of that, 94% of its portfolio is considered non-cyclical, and its net leverage ratio is very low at 0.77 times earnings, with an investment-grade credit rating. With such strong numbers behind it, and especially considering the fact that it trades at a very low premium to its net asset value at a time when its blue-chip peers like Hercules Capital (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HTGC" title="Hercules Capital, Inc.">HTGC</a>) and Main Street Capital (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAIN" title="Main Street Capital">MAIN</a>) trade at much larger premiums to NAV, MSDL makes for a great income stock for investors who want to be in business development companies right now but don't want to take on too much risk.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Meanwhile, OBDE has a 9.3% expected next 12-month total dividend yield, a leverage ratio of around 1, and 95.3% of its portfolio invested in debt, including 88.8% in first and second lien loans. It also has an investment-grade credit rating and trades at a 4.22% discount to NAV, making it one of the most attractive risk-adjusted BDC investment opportunities right now.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Last but not least, BXSL - despite trading at a fairly steep premium of 19.27%, and therefore I would not recommend buying it for someone concerned about total returns - offers a very attractive next 12-month dividend yield of 9.9% that is well covered by net investment income. This should be safe for the foreseeable future, especially because 98% of its portfolio is invested in debt, and 97.6% of the portfolio is in first or second-lien debt, with virtually all of that in first-lien loans, making it a very conservative portfolio. This is especially the case given that it is backed by Blackstone (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BX" title="Blackstone Inc.">BX</a>), which is the largest alternative asset manager in the world.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">MLPs</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The midstreams that I would hold right now in a retirement income portfolio are Enterprise Products Partners (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EPD" title="Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Common Units">EPD</a>), Energy Transfer (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ET" title="Energy Transfer LP Common Units">ET</a>), and MPLX (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPLX" title="MPLX LP Common Units">MPLX</a>).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I like Enterprise Products Partners because it has the strongest balance sheet in the midstream sector, with an A- credit rating and a 3 times leverage ratio. Its 7.4% distribution yield is very attractive and is covered about 1.7 times by distributable cash flow, and it is also growing its distribution at about a 5% CAGR, which is backed by similar distributable cash flow per unit growth. With its significant growth pipeline set to come online in the next few years, its leverage ratio is likely to drop even further, paving the way for even faster distribution growth and/or significant unit repurchases. Additionally, its portfolio is very well diversified and earns a wide moat rating from Morningstar.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I also like Energy Transfer right now because it has an attractive 7.9% distribution yield that's covered about 1.9 times by distributable cash flow. It is also growing its distribution at a 3-5% CAGR and has an investment-grade BBB credit rating. It is also pursuing attractive growth investments while recently redeeming a large number of its preferred units, which further strengthens its balance sheet and its common distribution safety. It will be interesting to see what it does next with the significant amount of excess cash flow that it generates, potentially opting for unit repurchases or faster distribution growth unless it decides to make a big acquisition.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">MPLX rounds out the group with a very strong track record of growing its distribution, currently yielding 8.4% on a next 12-month basis. Like Energy Transfer, it also has a BBB credit rating and comfortably covers its distribution. It has some solid growth investment projects underway that should continue to drive mid-single-digit distribution growth per year moving forward.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">REITs</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The three REITs that I like right now for a retirement income portfolio are W.P. Carey (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPC" title="W. P. Carey Inc.">WPC</a>), Realty Income (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/O" title="Realty Income Corporation">O</a>), and Mid-America Apartment Communities (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAA" title="Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.">MAA</a>). While these may not be my three favorite REITs from a total return perspective, I like them a lot from a yield and safety perspective.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">WPC has a 6.3% next 12-month dividend yield, trades at a discount to its net asset value, has a BBB+ credit rating, and recently exited the office sector. With a growing portfolio of quality industrial and warehouse properties and the majority of its rent comes from CPI-linked leases, it is uniquely well-positioned to weather periods of stagflation even if interest rates remain higher for longer.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">O does not have the significant CPI-linked exposure that WP Carey has, but it has an A- credit rating, arguably the best long-term track record of any major REIT, a 6% forward dividend yield that is well covered by earnings, and a very large and well-diversified portfolio of quality real estate that positions it very well to weather a recession.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Finally, MAA is a high-quality multifamily REIT that has a pristine balance sheet and an impressive long-term track record of generating attractive total returns and dividend growth. It offers a 4.3% next 12-month dividend yield and trades at a 9% discount to its net asset value. Putting that all together, MAA looks like an attractive way to diversify the portfolio into a defensive sector that also has attractive growth dynamics over the long term.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Investor Takeaway</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Keep in mind, as you can see from these nine selections, they are not all optimized for maximizing total returns, but the aggregate total return potential is still pretty solid. This is particularly true when you consider the starting yield for the next 12 months projected for the entire portfolio, assuming an equally weighted holding of each, is 7.8%. Meanwhile, the REITs and MLPs in this portfolio should be expected to grow on a weighted average of about 5% per year. The BDCs will likely grow at most 2% per year on average, though this will be choppy given that their kind of investment performance rises and falls with interest rates. Even if there is no growth from those holdings, in aggregate the dividends should grow at around a 3% annualized pace, which should be in line with long-term inflation levels.</p> <p class="before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It is also worth noting that the portfolio benefits from nice diversification. For one, it is very defensive in nature, so it should hold up fairly well during economic downturns. Additionally, triple net lease REITs tend to do best when interest rates fall, the BDCs will do better when interest rates rise, and the MLPs are more of an inflation hedge, given that energy tends to do best in high inflation environments, and - with their strong balance sheets and relatively internally funded growth investments - they are largely agnostic to where interest rates go, especially over short periods of time.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A California family's massive Trader Joe's receipt went viral on social media, sparking a debate about which grocery stores are affordable for families. The receipt shows the family buying a variety of items, including fresh produce, frozen food, and meat, with most items costing between $2.99 and $3.99.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The family, which has six children, said the receipt represents what it takes to feed them for about a week and a half. The video of the receipt has been viewed over 17 million times on the social media platform X.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some social media users responded to the video by dissing Trader Joe's prices and endorsing the discount supermarket chain Aldi. They argued that Trader Joe's prices are too high for many families, especially those with large households.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The receipt included a range of items, including strawberries, avocados, cucumbers, chicken and cheese tamales, chicken soup dumplings, and a margherita pizza. The most expensive items on the receipt were the frozen Korean-style beef short ribs, which cost $13.99 each.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The article also touches on the ongoing debate about the affordability of groceries, particularly in California where there has been a minimum wage increase. Some social media users blamed the minimum wage increase for the high prices of everyday items, including groceries.</p>

<p>The European Union initiated provisional penalty tariff increases on Chinese electric vehicles and Europe’s automakers aren’t sure when the expected retaliation will arrive, or how serious it will be.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p class="article_paragraph_2"></p>
<p>The EU Thursday raised tariffs up to almost 48% with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/600104.SS/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/600104.SS/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/600104.SS/" aria-label="SAIC’s">SAIC’s</a> MG facing a 37.6% tariff on top of the existing 10%. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/company/geely-automobile-holdings-ltd/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.reuters.com/company/geely-automobile-holdings-ltd/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/company/geely-automobile-holdings-ltd/" aria-label="Geely">Geely</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/company/byd-co-ltd/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.reuters.com/company/byd-co-ltd/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/company/byd-co-ltd/" aria-label="BYD">BYD</a> attracted increased levies of 19.9% and 17.4%. Other manufacturers who cooperated with the EU investigation face an average duty of 20.8% while non-cooperators face the 37.6% extra charge.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p>The duties become definitive in November suggesting negotiations might change the decision. EU member states could block the extra tariffs, imposed after it decided China subsidies for its EV industry harms Europe’s automakers.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>

<p>Some experts are puzzled by the EU’s decision to possibly trigger a tariff war with China because it appears to be playing with a weak hand. The EU has decreed that its automakers sell only new EVs by 2035, with a tightening quota starting with just over 20% this year, moving quickly to about 80% by 2030.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"><p id="article-0-inread"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>The trouble is EV sales in Europe have hit a plateau of about two million this year, and most forecasts reckon this will reach only between seven and eight million by 2030. Seven million is only roughly 50%, seriously short of the required 80%. So curbing the growth of Chinese EV imports cast doubts on the EU’s targets.</p>

<p>Germany in particular is also exposed to any Chinese retaliation, according to Professor ManMohan Sodhi of Britain’s <a href="https://www.bayes.city.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.bayes.city.ac.uk/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.bayes.city.ac.uk/" aria-label="Bayes Business School">Bayes Business School</a>.</p>






<p>“The German auto industry has made a last-ditch desperate plea to the EU not to impose these tariffs. After all, the German auto industry exports three times as much as it imports from China by way of cars and four times as much by way of parts. The EU is now inviting the Chinese tit-for-tat response,” Sodhi said.</p>


<p>The Chinese government’s initial unofficial response had seemed relatively mild, aimed at raising tariffs on mainly German high-value gasoline powered sedans and SUVs response.</p><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-1" role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion><p class="color-body light-text">China European Union trade</p></fbs-accordion><small>getty</small></figcaption></figure>
<p>“China hoped the EU would get the hint and not get into a tariff war. As with any tariff war, the Chinese will now be forced to react forcefully despite the move not being in their economic interest,” Sodhi said in an email exchange.</p>
<p>German manufacturers like Mercedes and BMW have all pointed to the pluses of free trade, while Germany has supported a negotiated solution with China.</p>
<p>China has hinted at widening its scale of possible retaliation to include big European earners like French wine, cognac and agricultural products, Toulouse-France based Airbus Industrie’s airliners, and pork exports led by Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark and France.</p>
<p>Thom Groot, CEO of <a href="https://www.electriccarscheme.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.electriccarscheme.com/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.electriccarscheme.com/" aria-label="The Electric Car Scheme">The Electric Car Scheme</a>, expects a quick response from the Chinese.</p>
<p>“I would expect China will react quickly, first with strong words, and perhaps later, if behind-the-scenes discussions do not look like they will resolve the situation, with actions,” Groot said in an email.</p>
<p>Groot says EV demand in Europe has been held back by high prices, and this has inhibited production investment, which the Chinese have taken advantage of.</p>
<p>“What the U.K. and Europe need is stronger incentives to drive demand like (tax incentives) and equalizing taxes on public charging compared to charging at home, while simultaneously investing in the car manufacturing supply chain to catch up to the Chinese manufacturers which are currently ahead of the more established western manufacturers,” Groot said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.just-auto.com/analyst-comment/eu-tariffs-can-chinese-car-manufacturers-still-flourish/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.just-auto.com/analyst-comment/eu-tariffs-can-chinese-car-manufacturers-still-flourish/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.just-auto.com/analyst-comment/eu-tariffs-can-chinese-car-manufacturers-still-flourish/" aria-label="GlobalData analyst Sammy Chan">GlobalData analyst Sammy Chan</a> said even if the penalty tariff regime is maintained, sales of China’s cheaper EVs will grow.</p>
<p>Chinese automakers have developed cost advantages through vertical integration and controlling key components like batteries. BYD has been selling products in Europe for sometimes double or nearly triple its pricing in China, Chan said.</p>
<p>Rhodium Group said recently that at tariffs lower than 50% Chinese EVs would still be profitable because of their more efficient manufacturing. Investment bank UBS has said that gives the likes of BYD a 30% cost advantage.</p>
<p>“Despite the tariffs, we do expect to see further Chinese brand growth in the Economy segment. Because European brands currently lack Chinese BEV-makers’ efficiencies and lower cost structure they are having to launch entry-level BEVs later to avoid losing money, giving Chinese BEVs in these segments a clearer run,” Chan said.</p>

<li><strong>US Judge Rules Against FTC</strong>: A US District Judge, Ada Brown, has ruled against the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in its challenge to a rule banning noncompete agreements, stating that the FTC lacks "substantive" rulemaking authority.</li>
<li><strong>Preliminary Injunction Granted</strong>: The judge granted a preliminary injunction, blocking the enforcement of the noncompete ban against the plaintiff, Ryan, LLC, and other groups that intervened in the case, although the ban remains in place for everyone else.</li>
<li><strong>FTC Rule Banned Noncompetes</strong>: In April, the FTC issued a rule that would render most current noncompete clauses unenforceable and ban future ones, deeming them an "unfair method of competition" and a "widespread and often exploitative practice".</li>
<li><strong>Other Groups Joined Lawsuit</strong>: The lawsuit was joined by the US Chamber of Commerce, two Texas business groups, and a lobby organization representing CEO's at US businesses in an attempt to block the ban on noncompetes.</li>
<li><strong>Appeals Expected</strong>: The case will likely be appealed to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is considered a conservative court, potentially leading to a further challenge to the FTC's authority to regulate noncompete agreements.</li>

<p>A US judge ruled against the Federal Trade Commission in a challenge to its rule banning noncompete agreements, saying the FTC lacks "substantive" rulemaking authority.</p>
<p>The preliminary ruling only blocks enforcement of the noncompete ban against the plaintiff and other groups that intervened in the case, but it signals that the judge believes the FTC cannot enforce the rule. The case is in US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, so appeals would be heard in the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit—which is generally regarded as one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>In April, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/ftc-bans-noncompete-clauses-declares-vast-majority-unenforceable/">FTC issued a rule</a> that would render the vast majority of current noncompete clauses unenforceable and ban future ones. The agency said that noncompete clauses are "an unfair method of competition and therefore a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act," calling them "a widespread and often exploitative practice imposing contractual conditions that prevent workers from taking a new job or starting a new business."</p>
<p>A tax services firm called Ryan, LLC <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.389064/gov.uscourts.txnd.389064.1.0.pdf">sued</a> the FTC in an attempt to block the rule. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/business-groups-sue-ftc-to-block-ban-on-noncompetes-claim-they-help-workers/">lawsuit was joined</a> by the US Chamber of Commerce, two Texas business groups, and a lobbyist association that represents chief executive officers at US businesses.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.389064/gov.uscourts.txnd.389064.153.0_3.pdf">ruling on Wednesday</a>, US District Judge Ada Brown granted a preliminary injunction and postponed the effective date of the rule as it applies to the plaintiffs. The rule is scheduled to take effect on September 4, 2024. As of now, the FTC's ban on noncompetes is slated to apply to everyone except the entities involved in the lawsuit.</p>
<h2>“FTC lacks substantive rulemaking authority”</h2>
<p>"The issue presented is whether the FTC's ability to promulgate rules concerning unfair methods of competition include the authority to create <em>substantive</em> rules regarding unfair methods of competition," Brown, a Trump appointee, wrote.</p>
<p>Brown acknowledged that "the FTC has some authority to promulgate rules to preclude unfair methods of competition." But "the text, structure, and history of the FTC Act reveal that the FTC lacks substantive rulemaking authority with respect to unfair methods of competition under Section 6(g)," she wrote.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The FTC has argued it can impose the rule using authority under sections 5 and 6(g) of the FTC Act. "Alongside section 5, Congress adopted section 6(g) of the Act, in which it authorized the Commission to 'make rules and regulations for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of' the FTC Act, which include the Act's prohibition of unfair methods of competition," the FTC said when it issued the rule.</p>
<p>"The FTC stands by our clear authority, supported by statute and precedent, to issue this rule," an FTC spokesperson told Ars today. "We will keep fighting to free hardworking Americans from unlawful noncompetes, which reduce innovation, inhibit economic growth, trap workers, and undermine Americans' economic liberty."</p>
<p>Consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge <a href="https://publicknowledge.org/public-knowledge-condemns-district-court-decision-restricting-ftc-rulemaking-and-enjoining-noncompete-ban/">called Brown's ruling</a> "the latest in a series of attacks on the administrative state, which only further embolden judges without subject matter expertise to seize power from federal agencies and prevent them from effectively serving the American people."</p>
<p>The Supreme Court last week <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/scotus-kills-chevron-deference-giving-courts-more-power-to-block-federal-rules/">overturned</a> the 40-year-old <em>Chevron</em> precedent, which gave agencies leeway to interpret ambiguous laws as long as the agency's conclusion was reasonable. The SCOTUS ruling effectively gives courts more power to block federal rules.</p>
<h2>FTC’s cited authority just a “housekeeping statute”</h2>
<p>Brown concluded that section 6(g) is merely a "housekeeping statute," authorizing "rules of agency organization procedure or practice" but not "substantive rules."</p>
<p>"Plaintiffs next contend the lack of a statutory penalty for violating rules promulgated under Section 6(g) demonstrates its lack of substantive rulemaking power. The Court agrees," Brown wrote. "When authorizing legislative rulemaking, Congress also historically prescribes sanctions for violations of the agency's rules—confirming that those rules create substantive obligations for regulated parties."</p>
<p>The judge said the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits and would be harmed if the rule takes effect. Brown intends to issue a ruling on the merits by August 30.</p>
<p>The preliminary injunction does not apply nationwide, as Brown chose to limit "the scope of the injunctive relief herein to named Plaintiff Ryan, LLC and Plaintiff-Intervenors Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America; Business Roundtable; Texas Association of Business; and Longview Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>The business trade groups wanted the injunction to apply to all of their member entities but could not convince Brown to extend the injunction that far. "Plaintiff-Intervenors have directed the Court to neither sufficient evidence of their respective associational member(s) for which they seek standing, nor any of the three elements that must be met regarding associational standing. Without such developed briefing, the Court declines to extend injunctive relief to members of Plaintiff-Intervenors," Brown wrote.</p>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made a name for himself for being a workaholic. He is also known to poke fun at people who he disagrees with. These two habits made its way to X during Independence Day, as Elon Musk shared a notable update from Giga Texas, before throwing some shade on a fellow CEO. </p>



<p>Amidst the Independence Day celebrations a few days ago, Elon Musk posted a quick video update about Giga Texas’ upcoming supercomputer cluster. Drone footage taken of Giga Texas by longtime Tesla watchers indicate that the southend extension, which will house a <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-tesla-supercomputer-cluster-giga-texas-location/">“super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster,”</a> is progressing well. </p>



 








<p>As <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1809070845689516043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted by Musk in his update</a>, Tesla is just finalizing the construction of Giga Texas’ supercomputer cluster. He also noted that the electric vehicle maker would be attempting to get the supercomputer cluster online in the coming months. The cluster is expected to further accelerate the progress of Tesla’s FSD efforts, which is crucial for the rollout of the company’s dedicated Robotaxi, which will be unveiled on August 8, 2024.</p>



<p>While Musk was all work in his Giga Texas update during Independence Day, he also took some time to poke fun at Meta CEO Mark Zuckerburg, who posted a video of himself wakeboarding in a suit and sunglasses, sipping some beer, and holding up an American flag to celebrate the Fourth of July. Zuckerburg’s video went viral, with social media users noting that it made the Meta CEO very likable and cool. </p>



 



<p>Elon Musk, for his part, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1809075977093345758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threw some shade towards Zuckerberg</a>. In a response on X, Musk noted that he prefers to work. “May he continue to have fun on his yachts. I prefer to work,” Musk wrote. Musk’s reply received polarizing reactions from social media users, with some taking it as yet another dig at Zuckerberg and others claiming that it showed Musk was being jealous of the Meta CEO. </p>



<p>Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have been throwing shade at each other for years, and last year, it even seemed like an <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-vs-mark-zuckerberg-fight-walter-isaacson/">actual MMA fight between the two CEOs</a> was about to happen. Musk has been <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-slams-mark-zuckerberg-rosy-ai-view/">critical of Zuckerberg’s rosy view of AI</a>, and the Meta CEO has been critical of Neuralink’s efforts, stating in August 2022 that the brain implants being developed by the startup <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/neuralink-not-wanted-normal-people-mark-zuckerberg/">will not be wanted by “normal people.”</a></p>
