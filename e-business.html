    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Three black men, Alvin Jackson, Emmanuel Jean Joseph, and Xavier Veal, were removed from an American Airlines flight from Phoenix to New York due to a complaint about body odor.</li>
<li>The men claim that they were singled out and treated unfairly because of their race, with every black man on the flight being removed, despite not knowing each other.</li>
<li>The lawsuit alleges that the airline's explanation for the removal was false, and that the pilot made an announcement about a delay due to "body odor" without mentioning the racial profiling.</li>
<li>American Airlines claims to be investigating the matter and says it takes claims of discrimination seriously, but the plaintiffs believe that the incident was motivated by racial discrimination.</li>
<li>The incident has resulted in a federal lawsuit against American Airlines, with the men seeking compensation for their distress and humiliation.</li>

The group was at that point allowed to re-take their seats on their original flight.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">American Airlines said in a statement: "We take all claims of discrimination very seriously and want our customers to have a positive experience when they choose to fly with us. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Our teams are currently investigating the matter, as the claims do not reflect our core values or our purpose of caring for people."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The lawsuit adds that while the men waited outside the plane, the pilot made an announcement telling passengers that there was a delay due to an issue with "body odour". The plaintiffs say the claim about odour was false.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Throughout the flight - from the moment of their reboarding, in each interaction with the white male flight attendant, and continuing until landing - Plaintiffs experienced profound feelings of embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, anger, and distress," the lawsuit states. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"The act of returning to their seats after the unwarranted delay, navigating past the predominantly white passengers, several of whom eyed them with anger and undue suspicion, compounded their humiliation."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The lawsuit says that the airline should be forced to pay unspecified damages for the "trauma" the men endured. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">One of the men suing, Mr Joseph, told the BBC that the “alienating” experience reminded him of Civil Rights hero Rosa Parks being forced to move to the back of an Alabama bus in 1955 due to state-sanctioned racial discrimination.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“It's a strange, crazy story that in 2024 we are still going through stuff like this,” said Mr Joseph.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He added that the lawsuit is necessary to make sure American Airlines does not end up “with a slap on the wrist”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In 2017, the NAACP, a civil rights group, issued a travel advisory telling black Americans to avoid American Airlines due to discrimination. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">They lifted the advisory the following year after the carrier announced it had made changes to its operations.</p></div></div>

    <div><section class="content__body"><p>Nissan is urging the owners of about 84,000 older vehicles to stop driving them because their Takata air bag inflators have an increased risk of exploding in a crash and hurling dangerous metal fragments.</p><p>Wednesday's urgent request comes after one person in a Nissan was killed by an exploding front-passenger inflator, and as many as 58 people were injured since 2015. </p><p>"Due to the age of the vehicles equipped with defective Takata airbag inflators, there is an increased risk the inflator could explode during an airbag deployment, propelling sharp metal fragments which can cause serious injury or death," Nissan said in a statement.</p>    
  <p>Nissan said the "do not drive" warning covers certain 2002 through 2006 Sentra small cars, as well as some 2002 through 2004 Pathfinder SUVs, and 2002 and 2003 Infiniti QX4 SUVs. Owners can find out if their vehicles are affected by going to <a href="file:///C:/Users/X780800/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/HSWBL88K/nissanusa.com/takata-airbag-recall" rel="nofollow">nissanusa.com/takata-airbag-recall</a> or <a href="file:///C:/Users/X780800/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/HSWBL88K/infinitiusa.com/takata-airbag-recall" rel="nofollow">infinitiusa.com/takata-airbag-recall</a> and keying in their 17-digit vehicle identification number. </p><p>The company says owners should contact their dealer to set up an appointment to have inflators replaced for free. Nissan also is offering free towing to dealers, and in some locations mobile service and loaner cars are available.</p>

    </p>
<p>"Even minor crashes can result in exploding Takata airbags that can kill or produce life-altering, gruesome injuries," the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement. "Older model year vehicles put their occupants at higher risk, as the age of the airbag is one of the contributing factors."</p><p>Nissan originally recalled 736,422 of the vehicles in 2020 to replace the Takata inflators. The company said around 84,000 remain unrepaired and are believed to still be in use. </p><p>Nissan said it has made numerous attempts to reach the owners with unrepaired Takata inflators.</p><p>The death was reported to NHTSA in 2018, the company said. The person killed was in a 2006 Sentra, according to Nissan. </p>

    </p>
<p>The death is one of 27 in the U.S. caused by the faulty inflators, which used volatile ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to inflate airbags in a crash. The chemical can deteriorate over time when exposed to high temperatures and humidity. It can explode with too much force, blowing apart a metal canister and spewing shrapnel. More than 400 people in the U.S. have been hurt.</p><p>Worldwide at least 35 people have been killed by Takata inflators in Malaysia, Australia and the U.S.</p><p>Potential for a dangerous malfunction led to the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, with at least 67 million Takata inflators involved. The U.S. government says many have not been repaired. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. The exploding airbags sent Takata into bankruptcy.</p><p>Honda, Ford, BMW, Toyota and Stellantis and Mazda have issued similar "do not drive" warnings for some of their vehicles equipped with Takata inflators. </p>

<ol>
<li>Vasu Raja, Senior Vice President of Strategy at American Airlines, is leaving the company after 20 years, effective June, due to a failed strategy to shift corporate customers to booking through American's website rather than through travel agencies.</li>
<li>Raja's strategy, which was implemented in April 2022, was met with criticism and led to a decline in bookings, causing a loss of customers for American Airlines.</li>
<li>American Airlines' CEO, Robert Isom, has announced that the company will move away from its new distribution capability (NDC) strategy and will instead focus on restoring its previous corporate strategy, which included allowing customers to book through travel agencies.</li>
<li>Isom has acknowledged that American Airlines' approach has driven customers away from the airline and has committed to getting those customers back.</li>
<li>Isom has expressed admiration for Raja's creative thinking and passion, but believes that the company needs a "reset" and will focus on executing and innovating in the short term to improve its fortunes.</li>

<p>Vasu Raja seemed like a breath of fresh air when he took over as American Airlines senior vice president of strategy in October 2019. He advocated for a Boston hub. He advocated for a Northeast operating agreement with JetBlue. He advocated for a Seattle hub partnership with Alaska. In perhaps his boldest move, in February 2020 he advocated for a Seattle-Bangalore flight.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p class="article_paragraph_2"></p>
<p>Within weeks, every plan was upended by the pandemic. (Later, a misguided judge upended the JetBlue alliance.) For the pandemic, Raja devised an innovative and distinctive strategy. While competitors pulled back, American ramped up Sunbelt flying, pushing beach-happy customers through its Charlotte and Dallas hubs.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, another Raja innovation was to advocate for a plan where American corporate customers were pushed to book through the carrier’s site rather than through travel agencies. American dismantled its corporate sales division in favor of “NDC” for new distribution capability.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>

<p>The strategy failed and Raja paid the price for it. American said Tuesday that he will depart in June, leaving the job as chief commercial officer that he took over in April 2022. He joined American in 2004.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"><p id="article-0-inread"></p></fbs-ad>
<p>At an investor conference on Wednesday, CEO Robert Isom formally gave up on NDC. He said American would move quickly to restore its previous corporate strategy. Speaking of Delta and United, he said, “Others are benefitting from what we’ve done over the last six months. We’ll get that back. I know for a fact we can recapture what we’ve ceded to others.”</p>

<p>To start, American has already ditched a plan to restrict mileage points for some travel agency tickets. “Our approach has driven customers away from American,” Isom said. “We’re unequivocally committed to getting those customers back.”</p>






<p>As for Raja, Isom said, "I’ve known Vasu for a long time. I admire his creative thinking, his passion. He’s an innovator, a disruptor, he's a good friend. But sometimes we need a reset.</p>
<p><strong>“ </strong>I am passionate about executing,” Isom said. “We will absolutely innovate. We will swing for the fences. It’s essential in this business.” However, he said. “We have to produce in the short term.”</p>

<p>It was a distinct change of direction for a newly empowered Isom, just weeks after American reported that he was paid $31.4 million in 2023. He has always been focused on schedule reliability. But now, he said, his role will expand.</p>
<p>“I’ve been around this business a long time,” he said. “You’re going to see me devoting a lot of attention to how we produce revenue day in and day out.”</p>
<p>Isom took responsibility for the corporate customer strategy fiasco, but said it must change. “They were my strategies,” he said. “I believe they are absolute the right ones.” However, “It’s very clear that we have driven some customers away.

<p>Wall Street took a dim view of American’s announcement on Tuesday that it had cut its revenue and profit forecast for the second quarter, normally the best quarter for airlines. Shortly after midday, American shares were down about 14% to $11.53.</p>
<p>It’s the second time Isom has been in the middle of an executive displacement at American. In 2016, President Scott Kirby was asked to leave and Isom replaced him. Kirby quickly moved on to become CEO of United Airlines.</p>
<p>Dennis Tajer, spokesman for Allied Pilots Association, which represents American pilots, said Isom needs to look beyond the single corporate ticketing sales failure. “American’s trailing results are more than just a failed strategy to sell corporate tickets,” he said. “United and Delta have better long-haul international strategies. Vasu wanted a domestic and short-haul international airline and said our partners can take you long-haul. That’s not working.</p>
<p>“Now Robert Isom has taken full responsibility,” Tajer said. “He has come into the cockpit and said ‘This is my airplane.’”</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland today announced the appointment of <a href="/people/profiles/h/hammack-beth-m">Beth M. Hammack</a> as its next president and chief executive officer. In this role, Hammack will represent the Fourth Federal Reserve District on the Federal Open Market Committee in the formulation of US monetary policy and will lead the 1,100 employees of the Cleveland Fed. </p>
<p>“Beth Hammack is the ideal leader to build on the great work already underway at the Cleveland Fed to promote a healthy economy and financial stability within the region and on the national stage,” said Heidi Gartland, chief government and community relations officer with University Hospitals and chair of the presidential search committee and the Cleveland Fed’s board of directors.</p>
<p>“Beth has a deep understanding of financial markets and the monetary policy transmission process, expertise in leading complex business lines, and a proven commitment to mission-focused work. Her appreciation for the diversity, history, and natural beauty of the Fourth District stood out during the interview process, as did her enthusiasm to make the region her home. The search committee is confident that Beth will employ all these qualities, along with her strategic mindset and talent for clear, accessible communication, in her new role serving the public,” Gartland continued.</p>
<p>Hammack has more than 30 years of experience in finance, capital markets, and risk management, as well as service on several advisory groups to the US Department of the Treasury and the financial industry. Most recently, she was cohead of global financing at the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., where she was a member of the management committee. Her previous roles at the firm include global treasurer, global head of short-term macro trading, and global head of repo trading.</p>
<p>Hammack has worked closely with US policymakers as chair of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee and as a member of the Financial Research Advisory Committee and the Treasury Market Practices Group, the latter of which aims to advance financial industry best practices. She is the current chair of the board of the nonprofit Math for America and a member of the Northwell Health and City Harvest boards of trustees.</p>
<p>The rigorous selection process was led by a search committee comprising eligible members of the Cleveland Reserve Bank’s board of directors (Class B and C directors who are not affiliated with institutions regulated by the Federal Reserve), in accordance with Federal Reserve policies and the Federal Reserve Act. The announcement of Hammack’s unanimous selection by the presidential search committee followed approval by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p>Hammack, 52, will take office on August 21, 2024, as the twelfth president of the Cleveland Fed. She succeeds Loretta J. Mester, whose tenure with the Bank will conclude on June 30, 2024, consistent with Federal Reserve mandatory age and length-of-service policies. Hammack will become a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee upon taking office, following the established rotation of Reserve Banks.</p>
<p>Until Hammack’s start date, Cleveland Fed First Vice President Mark S. Meder will serve as interim president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Hammack joined Goldman Sachs in 1993 as an analyst in capital markets before moving to the interest rate products trading desk and then into other roles of increasing responsibility. She was named managing director in 2003 and partner in 2010. During her tenure, Hammack served on several firmwide committees, including the enterprise risk, finance, and global inclusion and diversity committees. Hammack holds a bachelor of arts in quantitative economics and history from Stanford University.</p>
<p>“I am honored to become the next president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. It is a great privilege to serve the Fourth District, and the country, in fulfilling our mission of fostering a strong, stable economy in which all Americans have the opportunity to prosper,” Hammack said. “I look forward to meeting the people who work and live in the Fourth District, both as their representative on the FOMC and as their neighbor. I cannot wait to lead the Bank’s talented team, who deliver every day on our important mission.”</p>
<p>As president, Hammack will be responsible for all Bank activities, including those related to monetary policy, financial institution supervision, and payments services. The president sets the organization’s strategic direction and short- and long-term objectives. The president also represents the institution to the public, including with business and community leaders, educators, and government officials.</p>
<h3>Search Process</h3>
<p>The selection of Hammack follows an expansive national search process consistent with the Federal Reserve Act and the policy of the Board of Governors. The process launched in November 2023 with the formation of a search committee comprising nonbanking members of the Cleveland Fed’s board of directors. In addition to Gartland, other members of the search committee were Jacqueline Gamblin, chief executive officer, JYG Innovations; Ramona Hood, president and chief executive officer, FedEx Custom Critical; Richard J. Kramer, former chairman, chief executive officer and president, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company; Darrell McNair, president and chief executive officer, MVP Plastics, Inc.; and Holly Wiedemann, founder, AU Associates, Inc. Doris Carson Williams, president and chief executive officer, African American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania, also served on the search committee prior to the conclusion of her board service on December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>As part of the search process, the committee sought input from a wide range of external and internal audiences. The committee hosted two public town halls and conducted outreach within the community to seek nominations from the public and feedback on what the committee should look for in the Cleveland Fed’s next president.</p>
<p>The committee identified a broad, highly qualified, and diverse candidate pool from a variety of backgrounds, professions, and regions of the country. Committee members conducted multiple rounds of interviews with candidates before making their selection.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>McDonald's disputes reports of massive price increases</strong>: McDonald's U.S. President Joe Erlinger claims that reports suggesting the price of the average Big Mac has doubled since 2019 are false. The actual price increase is 20.5%, with the average Big Mac costing $5.29 now compared to $4.39 in 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Average U.S. Big Mac meal now costs $9.29</strong>: A Big Mac meal, which includes a sandwich, fries, and a drink, currently costs an average of $9.29 in the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Some menu items have seen bigger price increases</strong>: While the Big Mac has seen a 20.5% price increase, other menu items like medium fries have seen a 44% increase, from $2.29 in 2019 to $3.29 now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>McDonald's operating costs have increased</strong>: The company cites a 40% increase in labor, paper, and food costs as a reason for the price increases, which has resulted in a 40% average increase in menu item prices over the last five years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>McDonald's to offer more deals and value</strong>: In response to slowing store traffic due to inflation-weary customers, McDonald's plans to introduce a $5 meal deal across the U.S. next month, which will include a sandwich, four-piece McNuggets, small fries, and a small drink.</p>

<p>Anglo said after markets closed the company had set out “a clear pathway” to accelerate delivery of its strategy and “to unlock significant value” for its shareholders. “Our shareholders will benefit from value transparency and undiluted exposure to a simpler portfolio of world class assets,” <a href="https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/uk/anglo_american_group1/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=49&amp;newsid=1825968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chairman Stuart Chambers said</a>.</p>
<p>Anglo’s refusal earlier in the day argued that BHP had failed to address its concerns over the “highly complex and unattractive structure” of the proposed deal.  </p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed alignright is-type-wp-embed is-provider-mining-com wp-block-embed-mining-com"></figure>
<p>Analysts had warned that Anglo’s denial of BHP’s requested deadline extension indicated the mega deal was likely to be cancelled. RBC said in a note to investors on Wednesday the proposed $49.2 billion (£38.6bn) takeover structure is too complex for BHP to go hostile. </p>
<p>“If BHP doesn’t launch a formal bid, it will be barred from buying Anglo for six months, unless a competing offer emerges,” they wrote.</p>
<p>The mining giants had been in talks since May 22, when Anglo <a href="https://www.mining.com/anglo-american-rejects-bhps-third-bid-extends-deadline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebuffed BHP’s third bid</a>, with the parties focused on finding a deal structure satisfactory to both. </p>
<p>BHP proposed a complicated transaction scheme, which remained the main bone of contention in the past five weeks of negotiations.</p>
<p>Anglo argued that the requirement to first <a href="https://www.mining.com/web/bhp-and-anglo-remain-split-on-south-africa-as-time-runs-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spin off its majority stakes in two South African miners</a> created excessive risk for its own investors, who would end up holding those shares. The target company wanted the suitor to either alter the structure of the proposal or compensate its shareholders for any loss of value as a result of the spinoffs.</p>
<p>BHP <a href="https://editorial.northernminergroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/240529-BHPs-offer-for-Anglo-American.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had sa</a><a href="https://editorial.northernminergroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/240529-BHPs-offer-for-Anglo-American.pdf">id</a> the risks associated with its takeover plan were “quantifiable and manageable”, adding that the costs of the proposed measures had already been incorporated into its offer.</p>
<p>“We remain of the view that our proposal was the most effective structure to deliver value for Anglo American shareholders, and we are confident that, working together with Anglo American, we could have obtained all required regulatory approvals, including in South Africa,” Henry said.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-all-about-copper"><strong>All about copper</strong></h2>
<p>BHP’s main interest in targeting Anglo was its copper mines. An electrified world has become increasingly dependent on battery metals, particularly on copper, and BHP was, not surprisingly, eager to secure a leading position in this market. A tie-up would have given the mining giant <a href="https://www.mining.com/bhp-anglo-american-potential-merger-its-all-about-copper/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about 10% of global copper production</a> at a time when copper prices are hitting record-highs. They have climbed about 23% so far this year.</p>
<p>A successful deal not only would have reshaped the mining industry, but would have also boosted BHP’s presence in the world’s top copper producing countries, Chile and Peru. This would have made it the world’s largest producer of the metal, far surpassing Codelco.</p>
<p>Anglo American, which traces its roots in South Africa to its founding 107 years ago, has come up with <a href="https://www.mining.com/anglo-american-to-sell-de-beers-amplats-to-fend-off-bhps-bid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its own sweeping break up plan</a>. This includes keeping its copper and iron ore assets, the two most profitable units, and reducing investments in its Woodsmith fertilizer project in northern England. Despite some investors urging Anglo to shelve or offload the project, the company is not ready to part ways with it. Instead, it plans to find strategic investors who can support the resumption of full-scale operations at Woodsmith starting in 2026.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bhp-s-concessions"><strong>BHP’s concessions</strong></h2>
<p>BHP had made some concessions to Anglo, hoping to reach an agreement. They included keeping Anglo’s office in Johannesburg fully staffed and listing BHP shares on the South African market. The company also mentioned its willingness to contribute to a potential increase in South African employee ownership of the two units, if it was necessary. These measures would have been upheld for a minimum of three years following the completion of the takeover. </p>
<p>Henry also expressed openness to negotiating a break fee in the event that regulatory authorities, including those in South Africa, block the potential deal.</p>
<p>According to UK regulations, BHP must now wait at least six months before thinking of approaching Anglo American again.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes that Nvidia (NVDA) could surpass Microsoft (MSFT) in market capitalization, citing the rapid growth of the artificial intelligence company.</li>
<li>Cramer acknowledges that some investors are skeptical about Nvidia's rapid rise to the top, due to their unfamiliarity with the company's products and AI-related applications.</li>
<li>He likens Nvidia's sudden success to Apple's (AAPL) rise to the top, which also surprised many investors and analysts.</li>
<li>Cramer suggests that Nvidia's growth is not a flash in the pan, but rather the result of the company's strong performance and innovation, which has not gone unnoticed in the market.</li>
<li>The article highlights the rapid growth of Nvidia, which has led to increased scrutiny and speculation about its future prospects, with some investors questioning its sustainability and valuation.</li>

<li>ExxonMobil was once the top-performing oil company, with superior returns on capital and stock market valuations, which led to an air of arrogance among its executives.</li>
<li>In 2003, Lee Raymond, a former CEO of ExxonMobil, stated that "everyone at this company works for the general good—and I'm the general of that general good," revealing an arrogant tone.</li>
<li>In recent years (2016-2020), ExxonMobil struggled to generate strong returns as oil prices stagnated, and faced pressure from climate activists and asset managers concerned about environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues.</li>
<li>In 2020, ExxonMobil suffered an unprecedented defeat when Engine No.1, a small activist fund, successfully elected three climate-minded directors to its board.</li>
<li>ExxonMobil's arrogance and perceived lack of concern for environmental and social issues may have contributed to its loss of dominance in the industry, as well as the company's struggles in recent years.</li>

It was the biggest of the Western majors, and the best-managed. It regularly posted higher returns on capital than its peers and enjoyed superior stockmarket valuations. This led to an arrogance among its chief executives that infuriated not just greens but even other oilmen. In 2003 Lee Raymond, a former boss with a ferocious temper, bragged that “everyone at this company works for the general good—and I’m the general of that general good.”</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0">More recently ExxonMobil appeared to have lost some of this braggadocio. Between 2016 and 2020, together with the rest of the industry, it eked out meagre returns as oil prices languished. At the same time it was hounded by climate activists and asset managers concerned about environmental, social and governance (<small>ESG</small>) issues. The lowest point came three years ago when it suffered an unprecedented defeat at the hands of Engine No.1, an obscure activist fund that managed to get three climate-minded directors elected to its board.</p></div></div>

<p>Dozens of closed 99 Cents Only locations across Arizona, <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/" data-type="link" data-id="https://ktla.com/news/california/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California</a>, Nevada and Texas could reopen as Dollar Tree stores.</p>



<p>The bargain retailer <a href="https://corporate.dollartree.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/267/dollar-tree-inc-completes-transaction-for-170-99-cents" data-type="link" data-id="https://corporate.dollartree.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/267/dollar-tree-inc-completes-transaction-for-170-99-cents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed Wednesday</a> that it acquired the rights for 170 of the 99 Cents Only stores across the four states.  </p>



<p>The deal to acquire the store leases was completed through two transactions in May.</p>





<p>“As we continue to execute on our accelerated growth strategy for the Dollar Tree brand, this was an attractive opportunity to secure leases in priority markets where we see strong, profitable growth potential,” Michael Creedon, Jr., Dollar Tree’s chief operating officer, said in a statement.</p>



<p>“The portfolio complements our existing footprint and will provide us access to high-quality real estate assets in premium retail centers, enabling us to rapidly grow the Dollar Tree brand across the western United States, reaching even more customers and communities.”</p>



<p>Dollar Tree hopes to welcome 99 Cents Only customers to the re-opened locations as early as this fall.</p>





<p>In April, 99 Cents Only Stores announced that <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/99-cents-only-to-close-down-all-stores/#:~:text=99%20Cents%20Only%20will%20be,%2C%20Texas%2C%20Arizona%20and%20Nevada." data-type="link" data-id="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/99-cents-only-to-close-down-all-stores/#:~:text=99%20Cents%20Only%20will%20be,%2C%20Texas%2C%20Arizona%20and%20Nevada." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it would close all its locations,</a> citing financial difficulties stemming from the pandemic, changing consumer demand and rising inflation.</p>



<p>The popular discount stores were famous for their wide variety of items at discount prices, including household goods, fresh groceries, snacks, office supplies, health and beauty products, party supplies and more.</p>





<p>Dollar Tree didn’t specify which locations in California would reopen; 99 Cents Only had locations throughout the Golden State including in Sacramento, San Jose, Los Angeles, Bakersfield and San Diego.</p>



<p>Dollar Tree currently operates nearly 17,000 stores across 48 states and five Canadian provinces.</p>

But things took a big turn when massively influential food reviewer <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/11/02/keith-lee-atlanta-restaurants-tiktok/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8">Keith Lee</a> echoed those laments — and added a few dings of his own — in a May 3 <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@keith_lee125/video/7364650719380770094">TikTok review</a>.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="PJLV PJLV-ifqoyRo-css"><div data-test-id="tf-wrapper" class="wpds-c-ciKXky"><div class="wpds-c-UazGY"><img src="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/static/my-post/images/icon-recipes.png" alt="" class="wpds-c-bmaSfm"><p class="wpds-c-crIVVh"><strong>Follow</strong> Recipes</p></div><button data-test-id="tf-open-popover" type="button" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="radix-:r1:" data-state="closed" class="wpds-c-kSOqLF wpds-c-kSOqLF-uTUwn-variant-primary wpds-c-kSOqLF-biynoz-density-compact wpds-c-kSOqLF-ejCoEP-icon-left wpds-c-kSOqLF-idEeDEh-css">Follow<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 16 16" fill="currentColor" fr="" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img" class="wpds-c-fBqPWp wpds-c-fBqPWp-ilhigxQ-css "><path d="M14 7.5H8.5V2h-1v5.5H2v1h5.5V14h1V8.5H14Z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Lee, whose mild-mannered delivery and efforts to avoid getting special treatment have distinguished him from a sea of online food reviewers, wields considerable influence, even beyond his 16.3 million TikTok followers.

He even collaborated with the brand last year, with Chipotle introducing a special menu item, the “<a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/operations/chipotles-tiktok-inspired-keithadilla-will-be-officially-official-march-2" target="_blank">Keithadilla</a>,” which was inspired by a custom order that Lee and fellow TikTok celebrity Alexis Frost had popularized in a viral video series.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">The incident only highlights that the sway of social media influencers can cut both ways, says Kate Finley of Belle Communications, who works with both brands and influencers. And she says that if so many customers are noticing the same kind of changes, Chipotle — or other brands — should acknowledge it. “If there was a change, they could have used influencers to communicate that change proactively, along with the ‘why’ behind it,” she said.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">For Chipotle, the virtual pile-on intensified. Some people called for users to register their displeasure with the company by leaving <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wowdrew/video/7364864477247917355">one-star reviews</a> on its app. Others took their grievances to their local locations, posting videos of themselves starting an order, but <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@isaac_francis/video/7370384391220038955?q=chipotle%20walk%20out&amp;t=1717006214540">walking out</a> of the restaurant midway if they thought the workers behind the counter were not doling out sufficiently generous scoops.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-bHCGeL-isStandardLayoutAd-true article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="cb db dn-ns" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-mobile"><div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-md mt-sm pt-sm pb-sm ad-mobile"><div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"><p class="dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md">Story continues below advertisement</p></div><p class="relative flex flex-column justify-center w-100"><wp-ad id="slug_mob_bigbox_3" class="chromatic-ignore" data-chromatic="ignore" data-slot="/701/wpni.food" aria-hidden="true" data-renderbehavior="never" data-refresh="true" data-json='{"targeting":{"zeus_rendercount":"1","zeus_slot":"slug_mob_bigbox_3.init.dsk","kpi":"ctr","pos":"mob_bigbox_3","ctr":["zeus_mob_bigbox_3"],"wp_ad_refresh":"0","wp_refresh":"mob_bigbox_3_0","pwt":["mob_bigbox_3_mab_0"]}}'></wp-ad></p></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">All of this is playing out against a backdrop of customer frustration with rising food costs across the board: at the grocery store, in fast-food drive-throughs and at white-tablecloth restaurants. Rising costs on ingredients, labor and more are to blame, experts note, but the consumer backlash has been vitriolic. In some widely circulated videos, people have been decrying the prices of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/24/bigmac-price-tiktok-biden-economy-inflation/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18">Big Mac meals</a>, some as high as $18. And although Chipotle insists that its portions have stayed the same, consumers are faced all around with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/03/05/cookie-monster-shrinkflation-white-house/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18">“shrinkflation,”</a> a tactic often employed in the food world, where customers pay the same amount for a subtly smaller product.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">More trouble for Chipotle came with a new spate of videos about what some were calling a “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bertsports/video/7373885457710599470?q=chipotle%20phone&amp;t=1717003101585">Chipotle phone hack</a>” or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@samuel_lift/video/7372341978693963050?q=chipotle%20phone%20rule&amp;t=1717003281808">“Chipotle phone rule.”</a> It’s not clear where it originated, but on TikTok, videos claimed that Chipotle workers had been instructed to mete out larger portions if customers were filming them. Many of the videos showed workers piling food into bowls, which posters took as “proof” of the validity of the rumors.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">But stopping a wildfire-like message spreading on TikTok isn’t easy, Finley said, particularly among millennials and Gen Zers. “They will speak it like it was in Encyclopaedia Britannica,” she said.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-bHCGeL-isStandardLayoutAd-true article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="cb db dn-ns" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-mobile"><div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-md mt-sm pt-sm pb-sm ad-mobile"><div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"><p class="dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md">Story continues below advertisement</p></div><p class="relative flex flex-column justify-center w-100"><wp-ad id="slug_mob_bigbox_4" class="chromatic-ignore" data-chromatic="ignore" data-slot="/701/wpni.food" aria-hidden="true" data-renderbehavior="never" data-refresh="true" data-json='{"targeting":{"zeus_rendercount":"1","zeus_slot":"slug_mob_bigbox_4.init.dsk","kpi":"ctr","pos":"mob_bigbox_4","ctr":["zeus_mob_bigbox_4"],"wp_ad_refresh":"0","wp_refresh":"mob_bigbox_4_0","pwt":["mob_bigbox_4_mab_0"]}}'></wp-ad></p></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Of course, efforts to hack Chipotle orders — many with the goal of getting the maximum amount of food for the least money — are practically as old as the company itself, which was founded in 1993 and had spread around the country by the mid-2000s. Its ultra-customizable bowls, burritos and tacos lend themselves to tinkering, after all — which deal-seeking customers have learned to maximize to their own benefit.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Chipotle did not respond to a request for details about its portion policies. But some people have shared images from an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chipotle/comments/zsso59/here_are_the_proper_portioning_sizes_that_should/">employee guidebook</a> showing standard sizes, including four ounces each of meat, rice and beans.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">The chain’s human element has long made it a target, too. Workers take customers’ orders and prepare them on the spot, so each interaction can be seen as a potential for manipulation. Case in point: According to self-described professional food hacker <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@andersonnguyen.official/video/7349321052406795562">Anderson Nguyen,</a> one trick is to ask for toppings one at a time. “If you list out every item you want, the worker is already going to preportion every item in their mind and give you less,” he says in his video titled “Every Chipotle Hack to Maximize Your Order,” which has 9.1 million views on TikTok.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-bHCGeL-isStandardLayoutAd-true article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="cb db dn-ns" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-mobile"><div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-md mt-sm pt-sm pb-sm ad-mobile"><div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"><p class="dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md">Story continues below advertisement</p></div><p class="relative flex flex-column justify-center w-100"><wp-ad id="slug_mob_bigbox_5" class="chromatic-ignore" data-chromatic="ignore" data-slot="/701/wpni.food" aria-hidden="true" data-renderbehavior="never" data-refresh="true" data-json='{"targeting":{"zeus_rendercount":"1","zeus_slot":"slug_mob_bigbox_5.init.dsk","kpi":"ctr","pos":"mob_bigbox_5","ctr":["zeus_mob_bigbox_5"],"wp_ad_refresh":"0","wp_refresh":"mob_bigbox_5_0","pwt":["mob_bigbox_5_mab_0"]}}'></wp-ad></p></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">The chain’s hackers have been at it for years. One canonical truth among them is that the chain’s bowls are the best vehicle for loading up on freebies (just consult <a href="https://www.charismaoncommand.com/6-chipotle-hacks-for-getting-free-chipotle/">this decade-plus-old guide</a>, where it is the No. 2 suggestion, behind offering employees a big smile). But over the years, they’ve resorted not just to psychological trickery, but also to actual science, at least according to a 2015 <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelzarrell/burritoooooo">BuzzFeed story headlined </a>“This Guy Used Science To Get An 86% Bigger Burrito At Chipotle.”</p></div></div></div>

																										<p>General Motors brand Cadillac unveiled its OPTIQ all-electric luxury SUV today, giving more information on specifications, including range, horsepower, starting price, and features.</p>

<p>Cadillac said today that the estimated range of the OPTIQ will be 300 miles, and it will feature a standard dual motor all-wheel-drive powertrain.</p>
<p>“Cadillac has always defined American luxury, and OPTIQ is an example of how our bold, innovative spirit is propelling us into the EV future,” Vice President of Cadillac Global, John Roth, said. “Over the past five years, Cadillac has welcomed approximately 1 million new customers<sup> </sup>to the family globally, while our percentage of younger buyers has increased 5% in the U.S. OPTIQ will be an important gateway to attract luxury EV intenders to Cadillac as we look to offer a fully electric portfolio by the end of the decade.”</p>

Additionally, 300 miles of range will be what Cadillac estimates to be standard at a full charge, and DC fast charging will give 79 miles in about ten minutes.</p>

<p>It will also feature Regen on Demand, which is described as “a driver-controlled braking feature that allows the driver to slow down or stop the OPTIQ with a dedicated, pressure-sensitive paddle located on the steering wheel.”</p>
<p>With One-Pedal Driving, the OPTIQ will be able to convert kinetic energy back into the battery pack, giving more range to the vehicle through normal driving behavior.</p>

<p>GM describes the four pillars of its unique exterior design:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Roof Encompassing Glasswork: </b>The fixed-glass roof enables a seamless transition from glass to sheet metal.</li>
<li><b>Black Crystal Grille:</b> OPTIQ’s signature black crystal grille incorporates the Cadillac vertical signature lighting and includes a laser-etched pattern within the grille that offers an understated, high-tech feel.</li>
<li><b>Rear-Quarter Panel:</b> OPTIQ’s rear quarter panel window design is achieved through a Cadillac-first precision pattern in acoustic laminate glass. The graphic pattern is found throughout OPTIQ and aligns with the Mondrian crest in a nod to classic Cadillac styling.</li>
<li><b>Signature Lighting Choreography: </b>When the driver approaches or exits the vehicle, their key fob begins a choreographed lighting sequence to greet them.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interior Features</h3>

<p><b>“</b>OPTIQ’s bold design leverages the Cadillac standard for luxury while remaining youthful, sporty, and innovative. Its expressive detailing, integrated technology and welcoming interior gives drivers a true immersive experience,” Executive Director of Cadillac Design, Bryan Nesbitt, said.</p>
<p>The already-mentioned segment-best in cargo capacity and second-row spaciousness comes to the forefront.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the OPTIQ will feature a 33-inch diagonal LED display with 9k resolution and over 1 billion colors, Super Cruise driver assistance tech as a standard, advanced radar, camera, and ultrasonic sensor technology, standard safety features like adaptive cruise control, Blind Zone Steering Assist, and Enhanced Automatic Parking, Google built-in compatibility, and standard 19-speaker AKG Audio System and Dolby Atmos.</p>
<h3>Trims and Pricing</h3>
<p>Luxury and Sport trims will be available, both offering two distinct looks that the driver can decide on. Pricing will start at $54,000, but Cadillac strictly states that the dealer will set the final price.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>AT&amp;T (T)</strong> is a high-yield dividend stock with a 6.3% forward yield, making it a smart buy today. The company is expected to produce $18 billion in free cash flow in 2024, which can easily cover its approximately $8 billion annual dividend payments.</li>
<li><strong>Altria (MO)</strong> is another high-yield dividend stock with an 8.6% dividend yield. The company has raised its dividend payout 58 times in the past 54 years and has a long history of dividend growth and reliability.</li>
<li><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> has a loyal customer base, generating dependable cash flow and allowing it to reduce debt and strengthen its balance sheet. The company's 5G wireless and high-speed fiber internet customers are growing, contributing to its solid cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Altria</strong> has offset declining smoking rates through population growth and price hikes, allowing it to maintain its dividend payments. The company's total return to shareholders, including share price gains and dividends, has tracked its long-term growth in free cash flow over the past decade.</li>
<li><strong>Both AT&amp;T and Altria</strong> offer attractive dividend yields, making them attractive options for income investors. At current prices, AT&amp;T's shares trade at around 7x this year's projected cash flow, while Altria's shares offer a dividend yield of 8.6%.</li>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>If you're looking for dividend-paying companies that can help you earn more passive income, you've come to the right place. Here are three high-yield dividend stocks that are smart buys today.</p><h2>No. 1 high-yield stock to buy: AT&amp;T</h2><p>For more than 140 years, <strong>AT&amp;T</strong> <span class="ticker">(NYSE: T)</span> has helped people connect. Today, the telecommunications giant provides vital wireless and internet services to over 100 million people and almost 2.5 million businesses.</p><p>High customer loyalty rates allow AT&amp;T to generate dependable cash flow. Moreover, the company continues to gain 5G wireless and high-speed fiber internet customers at a solid clip. Combined with management's cost-cutting initiatives, these customer wins have AT&amp;T on pace to produce as much as $18 billion in <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/f/free-cash-flow/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=cef281f4-9dc9-417d-a9fb-2efead5a8aad" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free cash flow;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="0">free cash flow</a> in 2024.</p><p>This bountiful cash production can easily cover AT&amp;T's approximately $8 billion in annual dividend payments to investors. Management is prudently using some of the excess cash to pay down the company's debt. By strengthening its balance sheet, AT&amp;T is reducing the risks for shareholders.</p><p>Better still, you could scoop up the telecom leader's stock at an attractive price today. AT&amp;T's shares change hands at about 7x this year's projected cash flow. This bargain-priced dividend stock's forward yield stands at a lucrative 6.3%.</p><h2>No. 2 high-yield stock to buy: Altria</h2><p>Yield-focused investors might also want to consider <strong>Altria Group</strong> <span class="ticker">(NYSE: MO)</span>. The tobacco leader's <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/d/dividend-yield/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=cef281f4-9dc9-417d-a9fb-2efead5a8aad" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dividend yield;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0">dividend yield</a> currently checks in at a whopping 8.6%. Income investors who value dividend growth and reliability will also appreciate that the company has raised its cash payout 58 times over the past 54 years.</p><p>Population growth and price hikes enabled Altria to offset falling smoking rates. In turn, its total return to shareholders, which includes share price gains and dividends, has roughly tracked its long-term growth in free cash flow over the past decade.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">MO Total Return Price Chart</figcaption></p></figure><p>Cigarette sales should continue to produce sizable profits for Altria in the coming years. Yet the company's future growth will likely be derived from two major sources: smoke-free products and cannabis.</p><p>Shipments of Altria's On! tobacco-leaf-free oral nicotine pouches surged by 32% in the first quarter. The company spent $2.8 billion to expand its smoke-free offerings when it bought vaping products supplier NJOY Holdings in June. Management expects these fast-growing businesses and other investments to help Altria earn $5 billion in smoke-free revenue by 2028, up from $2.7 billion in 2023.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Altria has another intriguing opportunity in cannabis. The tobacco king has a roughly 40% stake in Canadian cannabis company <strong>Cronos Group</strong>.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department and other federal agencies recently took steps to reclassify marijuana as a lower-risk drug, and these efforts could make it easier and more profitable for cannabis companies to operate in the U.S. Altria's vast tobacco distribution network could help it capture a significant portion of a U.S. cannabis industry that might be worth as much as $100 billion, according to <strong>Tilray</strong> CEO Irwin Simon.</p><p>Yet right now, Altria's stock can be had for less than 9x its earnings guidance for 2024, and management seems to think that's quite a bargain. Altria sold $2.4 billion worth of its stake in beer titan <strong>Anheuser-Busch InBev</strong> in March and used the cash to buy back its own shares.</p><h2>No. 3 high-yield stock to buy: Enterprise Products Partners</h2><p>Don't overlook the energy sector if you want to profit from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Hungry data centers gobble up electricity, which boosts demand for the natural gas transportation services that <strong>Enterprise Products Partners</strong> <span class="ticker">(NYSE: EPD)</span> provides.</p><p>Enterprise's pipelines, processing facilities, and storage sites help to move natural gas, oil, refined products, and petrochemicals across the U.S. Yet it's not as exposed to the commodity price volatility as oil drillers or other energy producers. Instead, Enterprise generates the lion's share of its revenue from volume-based fees. This allows the company to generate consistently strong earnings under most economic conditions.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-1">Image source: Enterprise Products Partners.</figcaption></p></figure><p>As a master limited partnership (MLP), Enterprise must send a sizable portion of these earnings to investors each quarter. The MLP's forward yield stands at a robust 7.3% today. Enterprise also sports a 25-year track record of annual dividend increases.</p><p>These cash distributions should continue to grow steadily. Demand for Enterprise's energy transportation services is predicted to rise along with population growth in the coming decades. Additionally, soaring demand for AI services is creating an urgent need for more electricity. Data centers devour enormous amounts of energy when they train and run AI models and applications.</p><p>With over 50,000 miles of pipelines, Enterprise is well-positioned to transport natural gas to the power plants that will supply these data centers with the electricity they require. The AI revolution, in turn, could be a powerful growth driver for Enterprise -- and its investors' dividends -- in the years ahead.</p><h2>Should you invest $1,000 in Enterprise Products Partners right now?</h2><p>Before you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:</p><p>The <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the <strong><a href="https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=d3cff54f-693a-4564-80e3-f192b7b6141d&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-foolcom-sa-bbn-dyn%3Faid%3D8867%26amp%253Bsource%3Disaeditxt0010895%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D13885&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=cef281f4-9dc9-417d-a9fb-2efead5a8aad" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 best stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy now… and Enterprise Products Partners wasn’t one of them.

Though Fed officials say they expect inflation in those areas to eventually cool, they’ve signaled that they’re prepared to wait as long as it takes.</p><p>Yet the policymakers’ willingness to keep their key rate at a two-decade peak — thereby keeping costs painfully high for mortgages, auto loans and other forms of consumer borrowing — carries its own risks.</p>
    

<p>The Fed’s mandate is to strike a balance between keeping rates high enough to control inflation yet not so high as to damage the job market. While most measures show that growth <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/jobs-hiring-unemployment-economy-inflation-federal-reserve-07a321981752503e5299882805ed36c9">and hiring</a></span> remain healthy, some gauges of the economy have begun to reveal signs of weakness. The longer the Fed keeps its benchmark rate elevated, the greater the risk of causing a downturn.</p>



<p>At the same time, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-poll-survey-economy-trump-election-dca1b60f6749d5eb50bc0e7600814855">with polls showing</a></span> that costlier rents, groceries and gasoline are angering voters as the presidential campaign intensifies, Donald Trump has sought to pin the blame for higher prices squarely on President Joe Biden.</p>
    
<p>The Fed, led by Chair Jerome Powell, raised its benchmark rate by 5 percentage points from March 2022 through June 2023 — the fastest such increase in four decades — to try to drive inflation back down to its 2% target. According to the Fed’s preferred measure, inflation has tumbled from 7.1% in June 2022 <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-election-federal-reserve-rates-economy-f54d6af95e3eef434bddb72d25e3decf">to 2.7% in March</a></span>. </p><p>That same gauge showed, though, that prices accelerated in the first three months of 2024, disrupting last year’s steady slowdown. On Friday, economists expect the government to report that this measure rose 2.7% in April from a year earlier.</p>
    

<p>A separate inflation indicator that the government reported this month suggested that <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-rates-economy-federal-reserve-biden-d86c5a3a91a61687496f4a985e6bf362">prices cooled slightly in April</a></span>. But with inflation remaining stubbornly above the Fed’s target level, Wall Street traders now expect just one rate cut this year, in November. And even that is hardly a slam-dunk, with investors placing the likelihood of a cut in November at 63%, down from 77% a week ago.</p><p>Last week, economists at Goldman Sachs became the latest analysts to give up on a rate cut in July, pushing back their forecast for the first of two cuts they expect this year to September. Oxford Economics made a similar call last month. Bank of America foresees just one Fed rate cut this year, in December. Just months ago, many economists had forecast the first rate cut for March of this year.</p><p>“We will need to accumulate further data over the coming months to have a clearer picture of the inflation outlook,” Loretta Mester, president of Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said this month. “I now believe that it will take longer to reach our 2% goal than I previously thought.” (Mester is among 12 officials who are voting on the Fed’s rate policy this year.)</p>
    

<p>As further data accumulates, so do some signs that the economy is cooling a bit. More Americans, particularly younger adults, are <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/off-charts-credit-card-delinquencies-1eb685347b091ff53361e141d80405ad">falling behind</a></span> on their credit card bills, for example, with the share of card debt 90 days or more overdue reaching 10.7% in the first quarter, according to the Fed’s New York branch. That’s the highest proportion in 14 years. </p><p>Hiring is also slowing, with businesses posting <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/job-openings-unemployment-economy-inflation-federal-reserve-690b95a114189755d66e5d3ed298c0c2">fewer open jobs</a></span>, though job advertisements remain high. </p><p>And more companies, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/target-inflation-prices-4e9012fc88ba509be0fca59e7dabf1ab">including Target</a></span>, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mcdonalds-value-meal-deal-bda434c5a939b610a9c1fc09446a38d1">McDonalds</a></span> and Burger King, are highlighting price cuts or cheaper deals to try to attract financially squeezed consumers. Their actions could help lower inflation in the coming months. But they also underscore the struggles that lower-income Americans face. </p><p>“There’s a lot of signs that consumers are kind of losing some steam and hiring demand is cooling,” said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist who is president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. “You could see more of a slowdown.” </p>
    

<p>But Coronado and other economists also regard the latest trends as a sign that the economy may simply be normalizing after a period of rapid growth. Companies <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/jobs-hiring-unemployment-economy-inflation-federal-reserve-07a321981752503e5299882805ed36c9">are still hiring</a></span>, though at a more modest pace than at the start of the year. And data suggests that Americans traveled in <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/atlanta-travel-airport-tsa-memorial-day-0e6ef3f95510f9ab544c506f380103a6">record numbers</a></span> over the Memorial Day weekend, a sign they’re confident in their finances. </p><p>The Fed’s reluctance to cut rates is likely to set it apart from some of its counterparts overseas in the coming months. Central bankers in <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ecb-eurozone-european-central-bank-lagarde-inflation-interest-rates-52fc8aa232dda6b1127bbcf0069d8872">Europe</a></span> and the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bank-england-interest-rate-inflation-economy-43c776087d42175b447c667f5a769732">United Kingdom</a></span> are expected to reduce borrowing costs as soon as next month, largely because inflation has fallen further in those areas than in the United States. Rising prices in Europe and the U.K. were driven mostly by spiking energy costs stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and those costs have largely receded. </p>
    

<p>The <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-economy-growth-353975276c628ab8e662361a4eac3fe6">U.K.</a></span> and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/eurozone-gdp-economy-growth-europe-germany-ecb-55e193b3da704bc34bcf767773e5c8d6">European</a></span> economies have also fared much worse than the U.S. economy since the pandemic, so inflation has not been as serious a threat. The economies of the U.K. and the 20 countries that use the euro currency actually shrank in the second half of last year before recording mild growth in the first three months of 2024. The U.K. economy has barely grown in the past 12 months. </p><p>In the U.S., a big reason why inflation remains above the Fed’s target is that distortions stemming from the pandemic are still keeping prices elevated in several areas even as much of the rest of the economy has moved past the pandemic. </p><p>Housing costs, led by apartment rents, jumped two years ago after many Americans sought additional living space during the pandemic. Rental costs are now slowing: They rose 5.4% in April on an annual basis, down from 8.8% a year earlier. But they’re still rising faster than before the pandemic.</p><p>Last month, rent and homeownership, along with hotel prices, accounted for two-thirds of the annual rise in “core” inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs. Powell and other Fed officials have acknowledged that they had expected rents to fall more quickly than they have. </p><p>The cost of a new lease, though, has tumbled since mid-2022. A gauge of newly leased apartment rents calculated by the government shows that they rose just 0.4% in the first three months of 2024 compared with a year earlier. Yet it takes time for newer, lower-priced rents to feed into the government’s inflation measure. </p><p>“Market rents adjust more quickly to economic conditions than what landlords charge their existing tenants,” Philip Jefferson, the Fed’s vice chair and a top lieutenant to Powell, said last week. “This lag suggests that the large increase in market rents during the pandemic is still being passed through to existing rents and may keep housing services inflation elevated for a while longer.”</p><p>The <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/video/cars-denver-inflation-colorado-national-01ebbe71bfe942bda6c2f708adc9de53">cost of auto insurance</a></span> has soared nearly 23% from a year earlier, a huge jump that reflects the surge in prices of new and used cars during the pandemic. Insurance companies now must pay more to replace totaled cars and as a result are charging their customers more. </p><p>“This is about stuff that happened in 2021,” said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed economist. “You cannot go back and change that.”</p>

<p>Helen Toner, an AI policy expert from Georgetown University, sat on the nonprofit board that controlled OpenAI from 2021 until she resigned late last year following her role in ousting Altman. After staff threatened to leave en masse, he <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/20/ilya-sutskever-openai-cofounder-deeply-regrets-resign/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/20/ilya-sutskever-openai-cofounder-deeply-regrets-resign/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">returned</a> empowered by a new board with only Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo remaining from the original four plotters. </p>



<p>Toner disputed speculation that she and her colleagues on the board had been frightened by a technological advancement. Instead she blamed the coup on a pronounced pattern of dishonest behavior by Altman that gradually eroded trust as key decisions were not shared in advance.   </p>



<p>“For years, Sam had made it very difficult for the board to actually do that job by withholding information, misrepresenting things that were happening at the company, in some cases outright lying to the board,” she told <em><a href="https://www.ted.com/podcasts/the-ted-ai-show" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.ted.com/podcasts/the-ted-ai-show" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">The TED AI Show</a></em> in remarks published on Tuesday. </p>



<p>Even the very launch of ChatGPT, which sparked the generative AI frenzy when it debuted in November 2022, was withheld from the board, according to Toner. “We learned about ChatGPT on <a href="https://fortune.com/company/twitter/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/twitter/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Twitter</a>,” she said.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>







<p>Toner claimed Altman always had a convenient excuse at hand to downplay the board’s concerns, which is why for so long no action had been taken. </p>



<p>“Sam could always come up with some kind of innocuous-sounding explanation of why it wasn’t a big deal, or it was misinterpreted or whatever,” she continued. “But the end effect was that after years of this kind of thing, all four of us who fired him came to the conclusion that we just couldn’t believe things that Sam was telling us and that’s a completely unworkable place to be in as a board.”</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>OpenAI did not respond to a request by <em>Fortune</em> for comment.</p>



<p>Things ultimately came to a head, Toner said, after she co-published a <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/decoding-intentions/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/decoding-intentions/" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">paper</a> in October of last year that cast Anthropic’s approach to AI safety in a better light than OpenAI, enraging Altman.</p>



<p>“The problem was that after the paper came out Sam started lying to other board members in order to try and push me off the board, so it was another example that just like really damaged our ability to trust him,” she continued, adding that the behavior coincided with discussions in which the board was “already talking pretty seriously about whether we needed to fire him.”</p>







<p>Taken in isolation, those and other disparaging remarks Toner leveled at Altman could be downplayed as sour grapes from the ringleader of a failed coup. The pattern of dishonesty she described comes, however, on the wings of similarly <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/17/openai-researcher-resigns-safety/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/17/openai-researcher-resigns-safety/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">damaging accusations</a> from a former senior AI safety researcher, Jan Leike, as well as Scarlett Johansson. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Attempts to self-regulate doomed to fail</h2>



<p>The Hollywood actress said Altman approached her with the request to use her voice for its latest flagship product—a ChatGPT voice bot that users can converse with, reminiscent of the fictional character Johansson played in the movie <em>Her</em>. When she refused, she suspects, he may have blended in part of her voice, violating her wishes. The company disputes her claims but agreed to <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/21/scarlett-johansson-new-chatgpt-bot-sam-altman-openai/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/21/scarlett-johansson-new-chatgpt-bot-sam-altman-openai/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">pause its use</a> anyway.</p>







<p>Leike, on the other hand, served as joint head of the team responsible for creating guardrails that ensure mankind can control hyperintelligent AI. He left this month, saying it had become clear to him that management had no intention of <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/21/openai-superalignment-20-compute-commitment-never-fulfilled-sutskever-leike-altman-brockman-murati/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/21/openai-superalignment-20-compute-commitment-never-fulfilled-sutskever-leike-altman-brockman-murati/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">diverting valuable resources</a> to his team as promised, leaving a scathing rebuke of his former employer behind in his wake. (On Tuesday he joined the same OpenAI rival Toner had praised in October, Anthropic.)</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>Once key members of its AI safety staff had scattered to the wind, OpenAI disbanded the team entirely, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/openai-new-safety-board-sam-altman/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/openai-new-safety-board-sam-altman/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">unifying control</a> in the hands of Altman and his allies. Whether those in charge of maximizing financial results are best entrusted with implementing guardrails that may prove a commercial hindrance remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Although certain staffers were having their doubts, few outside of Leike chose to speak up. Thanks to<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/17/24158478/openai-departures-sam-altman-employees-chatgpt-release" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/17/24158478/openai-departures-sam-altman-employees-chatgpt-release" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL"> reporting</a> by Vox earlier this month, it emerged that a key motivating factor behind that silence was an unusual nondisparagement clause that, if broken, would void an employee’s vesting equity in perhaps the hottest startup in the world.</p>







<p>This followed earlier statements by former OpenAI safety researcher Daniel Kokotajlo that he voluntarily sacrificed his share of equity in order not to be bound by the exit agreement. Altman later <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1791936857594581428" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/sama/status/1791936857594581428" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">confirmed</a> the validity of the claims.</p>



<p>“Although we never clawed anything back, it should never have been something we had in any documents or communication,” he posted earlier this month. “This is on me and one of the few times I’ve been genuinely embarrassed running OpenAI; I did not know this was happening and I should have.”</p>



<p>Toner’s comments come fresh on the heels of her <a href="https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2024/05/26/ai-firms-mustnt-govern-themselves-say-ex-members-of-openais-board" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2024/05/26/ai-firms-mustnt-govern-themselves-say-ex-members-of-openais-board" rel="noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">op-ed</a> in the <em>Economist</em>, in which she and former OpenAI director Tasha McCauley argued that no AI company could be trusted to regulate itself as the evidence showed.</p>







<p>“If any company could have successfully governed itself while safely and ethically developing advanced AI systems it would have been OpenAI,” they wrote. “Based on our experience, we believe that self-governance cannot reliably withstand the pressure of profit incentives.”</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the future of business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/eye-on-ai?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=eye_on_ai" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/eye-on-ai?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=eye_on_ai" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>
