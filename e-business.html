<li><strong>Fed Governor Chris Waller believes interest rates should stay put</strong>: Waller, a member of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, believes that interest rates should remain unchanged due to sticky inflation and a lack of significant progress in reducing inflation.</li>

<li><strong>Core inflation rate rises 3.6% year over year</strong>: The core Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.6% year over year in April, a cooling from the 3.8% increase seen in March, but still above the Fed's 2% inflation target.</li>
<li><strong>Fed officials demand more data before considering rate cut</strong>: Waller and other Fed officials, including Vice Chairs Philip Jefferson and Michael Barr, are seeking more evidence of cooling inflation before considering a rate cut.</li>
<li><strong>September rate cut now considered unlikely</strong>: As a result of the Fed's cautious stance, a first-rate cut in September is now considered unlikely, with Waller indicating that more than three inflation reports are needed before the Fed would be confident in lowering rates.</li>

<ol>
<li>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller believes that further interest rate increases are unlikely, citing a series of data indicating that inflation is easing.</li>
<li>Waller points to flattening retail sales, cooling manufacturing and services sector growth, and signs of loosening in the labor market as evidence that the Fed's higher rates have helped ease demand and drive down inflation.</li>
<li>Despite this, Waller is not ready to support interest rate cuts, saying he needs to see several more months of good inflation data before he would be comfortable supporting a loosening of monetary policy.</li>
<li>The April Consumer Price Index showed inflation running at a 3.4% rate from a year ago, down slightly from March, which Waller considers a "welcome relief" but still not enough to support rate cuts.</li>
<li>Waller's comments suggest that the pace of rate hikes may slow down, but markets have had to recalibrate their expectations for monetary policy this year, with traders initially pricing in multiple rate cuts that are no longer expected.</li>

<p>Disaggregation is so 2010s, so Comcast, facing intense pressure from streaming services, is bringing back the old bundle-it-up playbook. Its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/comcast-hemorrhaging-subscribers-to-bundle-apple-tv-netflix-peacock-cable/">previously announced bundle</a> of Netflix, Peacock, and Apple TV+, only to Comcast/Xfinity cable or broadband subscribers, will cost $15 per month. It's a big discount on paper, but the fine print needs reading.</p>
<p>The "<a href="https://www.xfinity.com/learn/digital-cable-tv/streaming-services" rel="nofollow" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://www.xfinity.com/learn/digital-cable-tv/streaming-services" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-xid="fr1716323078741jcc" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1716323078741jcc">StreamSaver" bundle</a> is considered a "companion to broadband," Comcast's CEO David Watson said at a conference today, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/comcast-prices-peacock-netflix-apple-tv-streaming-bundle-15-month-2024-05-21/">according to Reuters</a>. It cuts more than 30 percent off the separate price of certain tiers of each service and can be bundled with Comcast's own "<a href="https://www.xfinity.com/nowtv" rel="nofollow" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://www.xfinity.com/nowtv" data-ml-id="1" data-ml="true" data-xid="fr1716323078741ibb" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1716323078741ibb">NOW TV</a>," which has 40 other cable channels streaming. The service is due out May 29 in the US.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>Take note that Comcast's bundle gives you Netflix's "<a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926">Standard with ads</a>" plan (which also locks you in at "Full HD" resolution and two devices), Peacock's "<a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/" rel="nofollow" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://www.peacocktv.com/" data-ml-id="2" data-ml="true" data-xid="fr1716323078741bie" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1716323078741bie">Premium</a>" (which also has ads), and Apple TV+, which has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/24/23614183/apple-tv-plus-ads-ad-supportied-tier-hire">made some recent moves</a> toward an advertising infusion. The things that people liked about streaming—being able to pick and choose TV and movie catalogs, pay to avoid advertisements, and not be beholden to their cable company for entertainment—are effectively countered by StreamSaver. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/comcast-hemorrhaging-subscribers-to-bundle-apple-tv-netflix-peacock-cable/">The lines get blurrier</a>, and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/08/the-tv-streaming-apps-broke-their-promises-and-now-theyre-jacking-the-price/2/">prices go up</a>.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>If you were already set on paying for the cheapest versions of each service and don't mind not being able to cancel any one of them once you're tired of it, $15 is indeed a savings. Doing the math earlier this month, Ars' Scharon Harding totaled up all three networks at $39.47 per month with no advertising, or $24.97 per month with ads.</p>
<p>Tacking streaming services onto your Comcast subscription would help the company out, as would signing up, especially for StreamSaver. Comcast lost nearly 500,000 cable TV subscribers <a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/static-files/889d3a3d-bc17-495a-a31c-452689268006">in Q1 2024</a>, down to 13.6 million subscribers, compared to 16.1 million at the end of 2022. Peacock, the streaming service it owns, has not made money since its 2020 launch and lost $2.7 billion in 2023.</p>

<li>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to approve spot Ethereum ETFs as soon as this week, with several asset managers submitting amended filings.</li>

<li>Staking became a core component of Ethereum's security model with the network's shift to a proof-of-stake consensus model in 2022.</li>
<li>The removal of staking language from the filings is seen as a temporary concession to appease the SEC, which has recently expressed concerns about staking and other issues.</li>

<p>DENVER (<a href="https://kdvr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KDVR</a>) — A new report found 150 of the best cities to live in, and two Colorado cities were named among the top 10.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.usnews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. News and World Report</a> released its annual <a href="https://realestate.usnews.com/places/rankings/best-places-to-live?src=usn_pr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Best Places to Live in the U.S.”</a> list for 2024-25 on Tuesday.</p>



<p>In order to <a href="https://realestate.usnews.com/places/methodology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create this ranking</a>, U.S. News used data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the FBI, the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. News’ own internal resources. Each city was then ranked on the following indexes: Affordability, happiness, healthcare quality, retiree taxes, desirability and job market. </p>





<p>Two Colorado cities made the top 10 and had an overall score above 6.5.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">No. 3 – Colorado Springs</h2>



<p>Colorado’s second-largest city was picked as the third-best place to live in the entire country with an overall score of 7/10.</p>



<p>U.S. News and World Report described <a href="https://realestate.usnews.com/places/colorado/colorado-springs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colorado Springs</a> as a city that “blends colorful nature with rugged history and metropolitan spoils.”</p>





<p>The report found that the Springs has a population of over 500,000 with a median home price of nearly $395,000.</p>



<p>While housing prices in Colorado Springs are higher than the national average, U.S. News said the Springs is continuing to grow in population as it still offers an affordable alternative to the more expensive Denver area.</p>



<p>While Colorado Springs was the third-best state to live in, it ranked 94th for the best place to retire.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">No. 10 – Boulder</h2>



<p>The second Colorado city to make the top 10 was Boulder with an overall score of 6.7/10.</p>





<p>U.S. News and World Report placed Boulder at 10th for its beautiful views, wellness opportunities and jobs that attract young professionals, families, academics, scientists and transplants from both coasts.</p>



<p>Boulder has a smaller population of a little more than 122,000 people, but its median home price exceeds the nation’s average. According to U.S. News, the median home in Boulder costs $854,424.</p>



<p>Known as the “Boulder Bubble,” the cost of living comes at a steep price.</p>



<p>However, Boulder is home to 45,000 acres of open space, a lively downtown and a well-known university. </p>
<p class="civic-science-article-container" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-305934525" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"></p>




<p>While Boulder made the top 10 best places to live, it placed 132nd for best places to retire.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Other Colorado cities among the best to live in</h2>



<p>Colorado Springs and Boulder weren’t the only Centennial State cities to make the list of 150, two others were named.</p>







<p>According to U.S. News and World Report, the best place to live in the nation is Naples, Florida. To see the <a href="https://realestate.usnews.com/places/rankings/best-places-to-live?sort=overall&amp;high_to_low=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full list, click here.</a> </p>

<li>Red Lobster has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is undergoing restructuring under new CEO Jonathan Tibus.</li>
<li>The previous CEO, Paul Kenny, made the decision to make the "Endless Shrimp" promotion a permanent $20 item on the menu, which was seen as a "nail in the coffin" for the brand.</li>
<li>This decision cost Red Lobster $11 million and left the company with "burdensome supply obligations" related to a business deal with Thai Union, which acquired a 49% stake in the company in 2016.</li>

    </div><div class="content article-descr news-text">
    <div><p>The new CEO at seafood chain Red Lobster said an endless shrimp deal was a nail in the coffin for the brand, which filed for <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/20/red-lobster-bankruptcy-chapter-11-endless-shrimp-closures-asset-sale-lenders/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/20/red-lobster-bankruptcy-chapter-11-endless-shrimp-closures-asset-sale-lenders/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">bankruptcy this week</a>. </p><div class="paywall paywallActive">



<p>While restaurants for the crab, lobster, and seafood brand remain open, incoming CEO Jonathan Tibus—a restructuring advisor—is <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/21/endless-lobster-red-lobster-2024/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/21/endless-lobster-red-lobster-2024/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">picking over the decisions of his predecessor</a> and appears to be left unimpressed.</p>



<p>Tibus, who is also managing director at consulting firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal’s North America division, called out Red Lobster’s former boss Paul Kenny for <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/red-lobster-closing-48-stores-auction/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/red-lobster-closing-48-stores-auction/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">marketing and operational “missteps.”</a> </p>



<p>In a Chapter 11 declaration seen by Fortune, Tibus wrote: “Certain operational decisions by former management have harmed the debtors’ [Red Lobster] financial situation in recent years. Historically, the debtors’ Ultimate Endless Shrimp (“UES”) promotion was utilized as a limited-time promotion. In May 2023, however, Paul Kenny, the debtors’ former CEO, made the decision to add UES as a permanent $20 item to the menu despite significant pushback from other members of the company’s management team.”</p>



<p>The decision cost the Florida-based brand $11 million and also saddled the business with <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/11/04/us-seafood-aquaculture/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2021/11/04/us-seafood-aquaculture/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">“burdensome supply obligations” </a>relating to one business in particular: Thai Union, which acquired a 49% stake in the company in 2016.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>Thai Union is a producer of seafood products, supplying ambient, frozen, and and chilled seafood to clients <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/15/ai-make-business-better-restaurants/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/15/ai-make-business-better-restaurants/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">through retail channels like restaurants</a>, and wholesalers.</p>



<p>Even at the time, Thai Union said it knew the business wouldn’t make much money from the promotion. During an earnings call last year, Thai Union CFO Ludovic Garnier said: “On this promotion, we don’t earn a lot of money. At $22 we don’t. The idea was to bring some traffic.” Some revisions upward of the $20 price tag to $25 stemmed some of the flow but, according to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/29/business/red-lobster-endless-shrimp-deal/index.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/29/business/red-lobster-endless-shrimp-deal/index.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">CNN</a>, Garnier added: “We need to be much more careful regarding, what is the entry point? And what is the price point we’re offering for this promotion.”</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>Even hiking the prices on the popular but ill-fated promotion couldn’t bandage the wound. <a href="https://www.thaiunion.com/en/newsroom/press-release/1675/thai-union-group-announces-intention-to-pursue-exit-of-minority-investment-in-red-lobster" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.thaiunion.com/en/newsroom/press-release/1675/thai-union-group-announces-intention-to-pursue-exit-of-minority-investment-in-red-lobster" rel="noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">In January</a> this year, Thai Union announced its intention to cut ties with Red Lobster, saying “Red Lobster’s ongoing financial requirements no longer align with our capital allocation priorities.”</p>



<p>In the first nine months of 2023—during the time Red Lobster’s UES offer became permanent—Thai Union recorded a share of loss from the chain worth $19 million.</p>



<p>Tibus seems unimpressed by Kenny’s decision tying a sinking Red Lobster deal to a seafood supplier which, conveniently, held a lot of sway in the boardroom. The UES promotion, according to Tibus, also got an “atypical” amount of promotion regarding the deal, which in turn led to “supply issues resulting in major shortages of shrimp with restaurants often going days or weeks without certain types of shrimp.”</p>



<p>Thai Union and Red Lobster did not immediately respond to <em>Fortune</em>‘<em>s</em> request for comment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fishy business</h2>



<p>But the restructuring expert is also picking through other choices made under Kenny’s leadership in relation to an increasing dependence on Thai Union supply. </p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>The shareholder—which had a market cap of approximately $1.9 billion at the time of writing—had an “outsized influence on the company’s shrimp purchasing,” the new CEO has alleged.</p>



<p>This influence was made clear through a number of decisions, Tibus claims. In 2023, for example, Kenny directed Thai Union to continue producing shrimp for Red Lobster in levels which “did not flow through the traditional supply process or bid cycle or adhere to the company’s demand projections.”</p>



<p>Thai Union products also <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/04/10/lukes-lobster-seafood-delivery-supply-chain-brainstorm-reinvent/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2021/04/10/lukes-lobster-seafood-delivery-supply-chain-brainstorm-reinvent/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">began appearing more widely</a> in Red Lobster restaurants after two breaded shrimp suppliers previously used by the chain were axed, which Tibus claimed happened “under the guise of a ‘quality review.'” The dismissal of these two suppliers led to an exclusive deal for Thai Union and higher costs for the restaurant brand.   </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Outside factors</h2>



<p>While a multimillion-dollar shrimp debacle may not have helped Red Lobster’s outlook, the brand did say in its Chapter 11 filing it had liabilities between $1 billion and $10 billion—an amount too large to be laid entirely at the feet of any all-you-can-eat seafood promotion.</p>



<p>In its extraction from Red Lobster, Thai Union said the brand was battling aftereffects from the pandemic as well as “sustained industry headwinds, higher interest rates and rising material and labor costs.”</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>Indeed, the analysis Tibus and his team has produced since March paints a picture of a business drowning in problems. Among the issues he outlines in his declaration is a falling customer count, down 30% since 2019 with only a “marginal” bounce back after COVID.</p>



<p>On top of that is a factor blighting the industry more widely: inflation. Consumers are less likely to want to eat out at the moment, Tibus wrote, adding that this drop in customer revenue has been coupled with higher labor costs on account of increasing minimum-wage bills.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the boss added, the company is spending eye-watering sums on leasing stores which aren’t making a return on investment. He wrote: “In 2023, the company spent approximately $190.5 million in lease obligations, over $64m of which relate to underperforming stores.”</p>



<p>This situation may have already changed. Per <em><a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/05/14/red-lobster-closed-restaurant-locations-list/73683118007" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/05/14/red-lobster-closed-restaurant-locations-list/73683118007" rel="noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">USA Today</a>, </em>87 restaurants across 27 states on the Red Lobster website—which is not functioning at the time of writing—were shown as “temporarily closed.”</p>

The approach will create a competitive bidding process that ensures gasoline can flow into local retailers ahead of the July 4 holiday and sold at competitive prices, the Energy Department said. </p><p>The move, which the department said is intended to help “lower costs for American families and consumers,″ follows a mandate from Congress to sell off the 10-year-old Northeast reserve and then close it. The language was included in a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-government-shutdown-congress-budget-spending-853b90ae025108be4ee98b939facd913">spending deal Congress approved in March</a></span> to avert a partial government shutdown.</p><p>The Energy Department said the sale of 1 million barrels, about 42 million gallons, was timed to provide relief for motorists as the summer driving season begins.</p>




    

<p>Gasoline prices average about $3.60 per gallon nationwide, up 6 cents from a year ago, according to AAA. Tapping gasoline reserves is one of the few actions a president can take by himself to try to control inflation, an election year liability for the party in control of the White House. </p><p>“The Biden-Harris administration is laser-focused on lowering prices at the pump for American families, especially as drivers hit the road for summer driving season,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement. “By strategically releasing this reserve in between Memorial Day and July 4th, we are ensuring sufficient supply flows to the tri-state and Northeast at a time hardworking Americans need it the most.”</p>
    
<p>White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said release of gas from the Northeast reserve builds on actions by President Joe Biden “to lower gas and energy costs — including historic releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the largest-ever investment in clean energy.″</p>
    

<p>Biden <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-biden-business-europe-3e1808077371b88ae043c86584763afd">significantly drained the Strategic Petroleum Reserve</a></span> in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, dropping the stockpile to its lowest level since the 1980s. The election year move helped stabilize gasoline prices that had been rising in the wake of the war in Europe but drew complaints from Republicans that the Democratic president was playing politics with a reserve meant for national emergencies.</p><p>The Biden administration has since <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/oil-biden-strategic-petroleum-reserve-aee28f8c2ee5c33a81f08529f676e42b">begun refilling the oil reserve</a></span>, which had more than 367 million barrels of crude oil as of last week. The total is lower than levels before the Russia-Ukraine war but still the world’s largest emergency crude oil supply.</p><p>The Northeast sale will require that the 42-million-gallon reserve is transferred or delivered no later than June 30, the Energy Department said. </p><p>Congressional Republicans have long criticized the Northeast reserve, which was established by former President Barack Obama, saying any such stockpile should have been created by Congress. A 2022 report by the Government Accountability Office said the gasoline reserve, which has never been tapped, would provide minimal relief during a severe shortage. The reserve costs about $19 million a year to maintain.</p>
    

<p>Patrick De Haan, an analyst for GasBuddy, said sale of the Northeast reserve would have little impact on gasoline prices nationally, although there “may be a slight downward pressure on prices” in the Northeast. The million-barrel reserve only amounts to about 2.7 hours of total U.S. gasoline consumption, he said.</p><p>“As an analyst, this reserve never really made a whole lot of sense to have,’' De Haan said in an Associated Press interview. The reserve is very small and must be frequently rotated, “because gasoline has a shelf life,’' De Haan said. “That’s why there’s really no nation that has an emergency stockpile of gasoline’’ other than the U.S.</p><p>The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has vastly more quantities of oil needed in an emergency, he said.</p><h2>__</h2><p>AP Radio reporter Shelley Adler in Fairfax, Virginia, contributed to this story.</p>

    <div><div class="group"><p>Driven by the work-from-home dynamic, as well as by new migration patterns, both single-family and multifamily rent prices were red-hot during the first years of the pandemic.</p><p>Now different drivers are pushing some rents higher — and throwing cold water on others.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>Multifamily rents in April were 0.8% lower than they were in the same month last year, according to Apartment List. Rents cooled because a massive amount of new supply entered the market, with still more in the pipeline.</p><p>Apartment rents did rise for the third straight month, but the growth, at 0.5%, is very small. Rents usually begin to rise in the spring, and the gain this year is not only smaller than usual but smaller than the previous month’s gain. The national median rent in April was $1,396.</p><p>“This is typically the time of year when rent growth is accelerating heading into the busy moving season, so the fact that growth stalled this month could be a sign that the market is headed for another slow summer,” according to the Apartment List report.</p><p>Apartment vacancies are also climbing, hitting 6.7% as of March, marking the highest reading since August 2020. New multifamily building permits are slowing down, but the number of units currently under construction is near a record high, and last year saw the most new apartments hit the market in over 30 years.</p><p>Single-family rents are much stronger, up 3.4% in March year over year, according to a new report from CoreLogic. That annual increase, however, continues to shrink as more supply comes onto the market from build-for-rent companies.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>Roughly 18,000 single-family, built-for-rent homes were started during the first quarter, a 20% increase from the first quarter of 2023, according to an analysis of Census data by the National Association of Home Builders. Over the last four quarters, 80,000 such homes began construction, representing a nearly 16% jump from the prior four quarters.</p><p>“U.S. single-family rent growth strengthened overall in March, though some weaknesses are revealed in the latest numbers,” said Molly Boesel, principal economist for CoreLogic. “Overbuilt areas, such as Austin, Texas, continued to soften, decreasing by 3.5% annually in March.”</p><p>The continued strength overall in single-family rents indicates that potential homebuyers who are priced out of the home-purchase market are choosing to rent similar alternatives, according to Boesel. Mortgage rates have risen back into the 7% range, and home prices continue to rise, making it harder to buy a home.</p><p>Of the nation’s 20 largest cities, Seattle saw the highest year-over-year increase in single-family rents at 6.3%, followed by New York at 5.3% and Boston at 5.2%. Those leading the declines were Austin, Texas, down 3.5%; Miami, down 3.2%; and New Orleans, down 1.4%.</p><p>For the first time in 14 years, however, single-family attached properties, namely townhomes, posted a year-over-year rent decline.</p><p>“The decrease in the attached segment is being driven by a subset of markets, mostly in Florida, but including Austin and New Orleans. As multifamily apartments are being completed, some markets are gaining rental supply, which competes with the attached segment of the single-family rental market,” Boesel added.</p></div></div>

    <div><p>In July 2023, OpenAI unveiled a new team dedicated to ensuring that future AI systems that might be more intelligent than all humans combined could be safely controlled. To signal how serious the company was about this goal, it publicly promised to dedicate 20% of its then-available computing resources to the effort.<br><br>Now, less than a year later, that team, which was called Superalignment, has been disbanded amid staff resignations and accusations that OpenAI is prioritizing product launches over AI safety. According to a half-dozen sources familiar with the functioning of OpenAI’s Superalignment team, OpenAI never fulfilled its commitment to provide the team with 20% of its computing power.</p><div class="paywall paywallActive">



<p>Instead, according to the sources, the team repeatedly saw its requests for access to graphics processing units, the specialized computer chips needed to train and run AI applications, turned down by OpenAI’s leadership, even though the team’s total compute budget never came close to the promised 20% threshold.<br><br>The revelations call into question how serious OpenAI ever was about honoring its public pledge, and whether other public commitments the company makes should be trusted. OpenAI did not respond to requests to comment for this story.</p>



<p>The company is currently facing a backlash over its use of a voice for its AI speech generation features that is <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/20/openai-says-chatbot-voice-is-not-an-imitation-of-scarlett-johansson-but-belongs-to-a-different-professional-actress-its-still-working-to-pause-i/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/20/openai-says-chatbot-voice-is-not-an-imitation-of-scarlett-johansson-but-belongs-to-a-different-professional-actress-its-still-working-to-pause-i/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">strikingly similar to actress Scarlett Johansson’s</a>. In that case questions have been raised about the credibility of OpenAI’s public statements that the similarity between the AI voice it calls “Sky” and Johansson’s voice is purely coincidental. Johansson says OpenAI cofounder and CEO Sam Altman approached her last September, when the Sky voice was first debuted, asking permission to use her voice. She declined. And she says Altman asked again for permission to use her voice last week, just before a closely watched demonstration of its latest GPT-4o model, which used the Sky voice. OpenAI has denied using Johansson’s voice without her permission, saying it paid a professional actress, whose name it says it cannot legally disclose, to create Sky. But Johansson’s claims have now cast doubt on this—with some speculating on social media that OpenAI in fact cloned Johansson’s voice or perhaps blended another actress’s voice with Johansson’s in some way to create Sky.<br><br>OpenAI’s Superalignment team had been set up under the leadership of Ilya Sutskever, the OpenAI cofounder and former chief scientist, whose departure from the company was announced last week. Jan Leike, a longtime OpenAI researcher, co-led the team. He announced his <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/15/openai-sam-altman-ilya-sutskever-jan-leike/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/15/openai-sam-altman-ilya-sutskever-jan-leike/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">own resignation</a> Friday, two days after Sutskever’s departure. The company then told the remaining employees on the team—which numbered about 25 people—that it was being disbanded and that they were being reassigned within the company.<br><br>It was a swift downfall for a team whose work OpenAI had positioned less than a year earlier as vital for the company and critical for the future of civilization. Superintelligence is the idea of a future, hypothetical AI system that would be smarter than all humans combined. It is a technology that would lie even beyond the company’s stated goal of creating artificial general intelligence, or AGI—a single AI system as smart as any person.<br><br>Superintelligence, the company <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-superalignment/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://openai.com/index/introducing-superalignment/" rel="noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">said when announcing the team</a>, could pose an existential risk to humanity by seeking to kill or enslave people. “We don’t have a solution for steering and controlling a potentially superintelligent AI, and preventing it from going rogue,” OpenAI said in its announcement. The Superalignment team was supposed to research those solutions.<br><br>It was a task so important that the company said in its announcement that it would commit “20% of the compute we’ve secured to date over the next four years” to the effort.<br><br>But a half-dozen sources familiar with the Superalignment team’s work said that the group was never allocated this compute. Instead, it received far less in the company’s regular compute allocation budget, which is reassessed quarterly. <br><br>One source familiar with the Superalignment team’s work said that there were never any clear metrics around exactly how the 20% amount was to be calculated, leaving it subject to wide interpretation. For instance, the source said the team was never told whether the promise meant “20% each year for four years” or “5% a year for four years” or some variable amount that could wind up being “1% or 2% for the first three years, and then the bulk of the commitment in the fourth year.” In any case, all the sources <em>Fortune</em> spoke to for this story confirmed that the Superalignment team was never given anything close to 20% of OpenAI’s secured compute as of July 2023. <br><br>OpenAI researchers can also make requests for what is known as “flex” compute—access to additional GPU capacity beyond what has been budgeted—to deal with new projects between the quarterly budgeting meetings. But flex requests from the Superalignment team were routinely rejected by higher-ups, these sources said.<br><br>Bob McGrew, OpenAI’s vice president of research, was the executive who informed the team that these requests were being declined, the sources said, but others at the company, including chief technology officer Mira Murati, were involved in making the decisions. Neither McGrew nor Murati responded to requests to comment for this story.</p>



<p>While the team did carry out some research—it released <a href="https://openai.com/index/weak-to-strong-generalization/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://openai.com/index/weak-to-strong-generalization/" rel="noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">a paper</a> detailing its experiments in successfully getting a less powerful AI model to control a more powerful one in December 2023—the lack of compute stymied the team’s more ambitious ideas, the source said. <br><br>After resigning, Leike on Friday published a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) in which <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/17/openai-researcher-resigns-safety/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/17/openai-researcher-resigns-safety/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">he criticized his former employer</a>, saying “safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.” He also said that “over the past few months my team has been sailing against the wind. Sometimes we were struggling for compute and it was getting harder and harder to get this crucial research done.”<br><br>Five sources familiar with the Superalignment team’s work backed up Leike’s account, saying that the problems with accessing compute worsened in the wake of the pre-Thanksgiving showdown between Altman and the board of the OpenAI nonprofit foundation. <br><br><a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/18/who-is-ilya-sutskever-openai-leadership-shakeup-ai-safety/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/18/who-is-ilya-sutskever-openai-leadership-shakeup-ai-safety/" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">Sutskever</a>, who was on the board, had voted to fire Altman and was the person the board chose to give Altman the news. When OpenAI’s staff rebelled in response to the decision, Sutskever subsequently posted on X that he “deeply regretted” his participation in Altman’s firing. Ultimately, Altman was rehired, and Sutskever and several other board members involved in his dismissal stepped down from the board. Sutskever never returned to work at OpenAI following Altman’s rehiring but had not formally left the company until last week.<br><br>One source disputed the way the other sources <em>Fortune</em> spoke to characterized the compute problems the Superalignment team faced, saying they predated Sutskever’s participation in the failed coup, plaguing the group from the get-go. <br><br>While there have been some reports that Sutskever was continuing to co-lead the Superalignment team remotely, sources familiar with the team’s work said this was not the case and that Sutskever had no access to the team’s work and played no role in directing the team after Thanksgiving.<br><br>With Sutskever gone, the Superalignment team lost the only person on the team who had enough political capital within the organization to successfully argue for its compute allocation, the sources said. </p>



<p>In addition to Leike and Sutskever, OpenAI has lost at least six other AI safety researchers from different teams in recent months. One researcher, Daniel Kokotajlo, told news site Vox that he “gradually lost trust in OpenAI leadership and their ability to responsibly handle AGI, so I quit.” </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>In response to Leike’s comments, Altman and cofounder Greg Brockman, who is OpenAI’s president, posted on X that they were “grateful to [Leike] for everything he’s done for OpenAI.” The two went on to write, “We need to keep elevating our safety work to match the stakes of each new model.”<br><br>They then laid out their view of the company’s approach to AI safety going forward, which would involve a much greater emphasis on testing models currently under development than trying to develop theoretical approaches on how to make future, more powerful models safe. “We need to have a very tight feedback loop, rigorous testing, careful consideration at every step, world-class security, and harmony of safety and capabilities,” Brockman and Altman wrote, adding that “empirical understanding can help inform the way forward.”<br><br>The people who spoke to <em>Fortune</em> did so anonymously, either because they said they feared losing their jobs, or because they feared losing vested equity in the company, or both. Employees who have left OpenAI have been forced to sign separation agreements that include a strict non-disparagement clause that says the company can claw back their vested equity if they criticize the company publicly, or if they even acknowledge the clause’s existence. And employees have been told that anyone who refuses to sign the separation agreement will forfeit their equity as well.<br><br>After Vox <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/17/24158478/openai-departures-sam-altman-employees-chatgpt-release" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/17/24158478/openai-departures-sam-altman-employees-chatgpt-release" rel="noopener" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">reported</a> on these separation terms, Altman posted on X that he had been unaware of that provision and was “genuinely embarrassed” by that fact. He said OpenAI had never attempted to enforce the clause and claw back anyone’s vested equity. He said the company was in the process of updating its exit paperwork to “fix” the issue and that any past employee concerned about the provisions in the exit paperwork they signed could approach him directly about it and it would be changed. </p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the future of business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/eye-on-ai?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=eye_on_ai" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/eye-on-ai?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=eye_on_ai" class="sc-bec953bd-0 gsodiL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Data is the lifeblood of artificial intelligence, which is why companies specializing in data management and processing are faring well right now.

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But most data is unstructured, and AI systems find it difficult to use such data off the bat. It needs to be labeled, which is a resource-intensive endeavor, especially with large datasets. Scale AI provides companies with data that has been correctly annotated and primed for training models. It also specializes for different industries with different needs — a self-driving car company will likely need labeled data from cameras and lidar, whereas natural language processing (NLP) use cases will need annotated text.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company’s customers include Microsoft, Toyota, GM, Meta, the U.S. Department of Defense and, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/openai-partners-with-scale-ai-to-allow-companies-to-fine-tune-gpt-3-5/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/openai-partners-with-scale-ai-to-allow-companies-to-fine-tune-gpt-3-5/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="8" mrfobservableid="7d5d0c88-b4c7-4feb-9930-f08ac570a0dd">as of last August</a>, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which is tapping Scale AI to let companies fine-tune its GPT-3.5 text-generating models.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Scale AI says it will use the new cash to help accelerate the “abundance of frontier data that will pave our road to artificial general intelligence.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“Data abundance is not the default — it’s a choice,” Scale AI’s CEO and co-founder, Alexandr Wang, said in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240521674964/en/Scale-AI-Raises-1-Billion-Series-F-to-Push-The-Frontier-of-AI-Data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-mrf-link="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240521674964/en/Scale-AI-Raises-1-Billion-Series-F-to-Push-The-Frontier-of-AI-Data" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="9" mrfobservableid="e4f14795-4f5f-459b-8d78-128223708288">press release</a>. “It requires bringing together the best minds in engineering, operations, and AI. Our vision is one of data abundance, where we have the means of production to continue scaling frontier LLMs many more orders of magnitude. We should not be data-constrained in getting to GPT-10.”</p>

<p>A Tesla shareholder group yesterday urged other shareholders to vote against Elon Musk's $46 billion pay package, saying the Tesla board is dysfunctional and "overly beholden to CEO Musk." The group's <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000121465924009597/o520243px14a6g.htm">letter</a> also urged shareholders to vote against the reelection of board members Kimbal Musk and James Murdoch.</p>
<p>"Tesla is suffering from a material governance failure which requires our urgent attention and action," and its board "is stacked with directors that have close personal ties to CEO Elon Musk," the letter said. "There are multiple indications that these ties, coupled with excessive director compensation, prevent the level of critical and independent thinking required for effective governance."</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>Tesla shareholders approved Elon Musk's pay package in 2018, but it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/elon-musks-56-billion-pay-plan-voided-as-shareholders-beat-tesla-in-court/">nullified by a court ruling</a> in January 2024. After a lawsuit filed by a shareholder, Delaware Court of Chancery Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled that the pay plan was unfair to Tesla shareholders and must be rescinded.</p>
<p>McCormick wrote that most of Tesla's board members were beholden to Musk or had compromising conflicts and that Tesla's board provided false and misleading information to shareholders before the 2018 vote. Musk and the rest of the Tesla board subsequently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/tesla-asks-shareholders-to-approve-texas-move-and-restore-elon-musks-56b-pay/">asked shareholders</a> to approve a transfer of Tesla's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas and to reinstate Musk's pay package. Votes can be submitted before Tesla's <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000110465924053355/tm2326076d21_defa14a-gen.pdf">annual meeting on June 13</a>.</p>
<p>The pay package was previously estimated to be worth $56 billion, but the stock options in the plan were more recently <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/tesla-hits-the-road-to-persuade-shareholders-to-pay-elon-musk-46-billion-6ea31ea5">valued at $46 billion</a>.</p>
<p>                                            </p>
                                                        <p></p>
<h2>“Tesla has clearly lagged”</h2>
<p>From March 2020 to November 2021, Tesla's share price rose from $28.51 to $409.71. But it "has since fallen to $172.63, a decline of $237.08 or 62 percent from its peak," the letter opposing the pay package said.</p>
<p>"Over the past three years, and especially over the past year, Tesla has clearly lagged behind its competitors and the broader market. We believe that the distractions caused by Musk's many projects, particularly his decision to buy Twitter, have played a material role in Tesla's underperformance," the letter said.</p>
<p>Tesla's reputation has been harmed by Musk's "public fights with regulators, acquisition of Twitter, controversial statements on X, and his legal and personal troubles," the letter said. The letter was sent by New York City Comptroller Brad Lander and investors including Amalgamated Bank, AkademikerPension, Nordea Asset Management, SOC Investment Group, and United Church Funds.</p>
<p>Musk has taken advantage of lax oversight in order "to use Tesla as a coffer for himself and his other business endeavors," the letter said. It continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2022, Musk admitted to using Tesla engineers to work on issues at Twitter (now known as X), and defended the decision by saying that no Tesla Board member had stopped him from using Tesla staff for his other businesses. More recently, Musk has begun poaching top engineers from Tesla's AI and autonomy team for his new company, xAI, including Ethan Knight, who was computer vision chief at Tesla.</p>
<p>This is on the heels of Musk's post on X that he is "uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI &amp; robotics without having ~25% voting control," a move widely seen as a threat to push Tesla's Board to grant him another mega pay package.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Tesla board "continues to allow Musk to be overcommitted" as he devotes "significant amounts of time to his roles at X, SpaceX, Neuralink, the Boring Company and other companies," the letter said.</p>
