Posts still appear to show how many likes they have — but the author will be the only person who can see a list of those who liked it.</p>

But none comes close to the $46 billion pay deal Tesla shareholders appear to be on the verge of handing over to CEO Elon Musk. </p><p>The results of the shareholder vote, which concludes today, will be announced on Thursday during Tesla's annual meeting, which will be livestreamed <a href="https://www.tesla.com/2024shareholdermeeting" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> at 4:30 p.m. Eastern. But Musk has <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-tesla-stockholders-56-billion-pay-package-wide-margins/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">already declared victory,</a></span> writing late Wednesday on his social media platform X that shareholders were voting to approve the pay package by "wide margins."</p><p>The pay package has become a lightning rod over executive pay, with some critics calling the package "<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-shareholders-advised-to-reject-elon-musk-56-billion-pay/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">excessive</a></span>." Supporters argue that such a deal is necessary to tether Musk to Tesla and ensure he doesn't decamp to start another business. Along with Tesla, the billionaire currently owns five additional businesses including X (formerly Twitter), Neurolink and SpaceX, the latter of which he is also CEO. </p>    
  <p>With Musk trumpeting his apparent win ahead of the final tally, shareholders sent the stock up 4% in Thursday morning trading, indicating that many view the pay package as essential to ensuring Musk's future at the company. </p><p>"It is a pop-the-champagne moment for Musk and Tesla shareholders," noted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives in a Thursday research note about the preliminary vote results. "[L]arge shareholders at the end of the day knew that voting no would risk Musk potentially eventually leaving as CEO." </p>

    </p>
<p>Ives said he believes Musk is now likely to pledge to remain CEO of Tesla for another three to five years, given the apparent approval of his pay package. </p><h2>Why does the pay package need to be voted on?</h2><p>The vote on Musk's payout stems from a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-55-billion-pay-package-delaware-judge-ruling/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">court ruling</a></span> in January that struck down his previous pay deal, worth more almost $56 billion earlier this year. The value has since declined due to a slide in Tesla's share price. </p><p>That package, approved in 2018 by Tesla shareholders, sparked a shareholder lawsuit that accused Musk and Tesla's board of directors of breaching their duties and unjustly enriching the billionaire. A Delaware judge ruled that Musk and his his company failed to prove that the massive payout was fair.</p><p>Because that initial pay deal was struck down, Tesla <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-elon-musk/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">said in April</a></span> that it would once again take the issue to its shareholders, asking them to re-ratify the package. </p>

    </p>
<h2>How much does Musk earn from Tesla? </h2><p>Tesla hasn't paid Musk a base salary since 2019, according to the company's regulatory filings. Instead, his compensation has been paid through "performance awards" of stock options that are based on Tesla hitting certain milestones, such as vehicle production or increasing the company's market value. </p><p>After the pay package was struck down by the Delaware court, Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000110465924048040/tm2326076d13_pre14a-gen.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a> to shareholders that they should re-ratify the package as "Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value."</p><p>Denholm described the situation as "fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it."</p><p>However, Musk is hardly without financial resources: He owns almost 13% of Tesla shares, worth $73 billion. He also has stakes in SpaceX, worth $71 billion, and multiple other businesses, giving him a total net worth of $203 billion, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/elon-r-musk/?sref=sBMxP0gT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according</a> to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That makes him the world's third richest person.</p><h2>Why are some shareholders supporting the pay package? </h2><p>According to Ives, some shareholders are concerned that Musk might decamp for another business or start a rival company if he isn't richly rewarded for working at Tesla. That's a threat that Musk himself has issued, stating in a post on X in January that he <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-elon-musk-25-percent-control-ai-what-it-means/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">wanted 25% voting control </a></span>of Tesla or he might leave. </p><p>Tesla chairwoman Denholm echoed those sentiments, writing in a June shareholder letter, "If Tesla is to retain Elon's attention and motivate him to continue to devote his time, energy, ambition and vision to deliver comparable results in the future, we must stand by our deal."</p><h2>Are some shareholders voting against the pay deal?</h2><p>Yes, some shareholders have spoken publicly against the package, most notably the California's State Teachers Retirement System. </p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'>
    </p>
<p>The large pension fund said Tuesday that it would vote against Musk's pay "based on its sheer magnitude, and because the award would be extremely dilutive to shareholders. We also have concerns with the lack of focus on profitability for the company."</p><p>Tesla's top five institutional shareholders — Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, Geode Capital and Capital Research — either said they don't announce their votes or wouldn't comment. They control about 17% of the votes.</p><h2>How is Elon Musk's pay package structured?</h2><p>The pay deal is structured to deliver several rounds of stock options that will allow Musk to buy about 304 million shares of Tesla stock. Musk is able to receive each round of options after the company hits certain milestones — such as when Tesla reached a market value of $100 billion, and then at every $50 billion mark beyond that. (Currently, Tesla's market cap is about $580 billion.)</p><p>Based on today's stock price, the value of the pay package stands at about $46 billion. </p><p>The package also includes a requirement that Musk hold onto the shares for five years after he exercises the options, <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000110465924048040/tm2326076d13_pre14a-gen.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according</a> to regulatory filings.</p><h2>Do large payouts ensure better CEO performance? </h2><p>The underlying question of the debate over Musk's payout is whether such grandiose packages actually make a difference in CEO performance. In other words, do CEOs actually outperform when they are given larger-than-normal packages? And if they don't receive such jaw-dropping deals, do they underperform? </p><p>Generous CEO pay packages don't actually guarantee better results, according to a 2017 study from investment research firm MSCI. In fact, the <a href="https://www.msci.com/documents/1296102/7330587/Research_Insight_Out_of_Whack.pdf/46baa603-a503-42c1-91c0-d0ef19b754b2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">analysis</a> found that the companies with the smallest equity incentive awards outperformed those with the heftiest packages by almost 39% on average over a 10-year period. </p>

<li>Christy Goldsmith Romero, a lawyer with expertise in rooting out fraud, has been chosen to lead the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) by President Biden.</li>
<li>The selection comes as the current FDIC chair, Martin Gruenberg, has resigned amid reports of widespread workplace abuse and harassment at the agency.</li>
<li>Goldsmith Romero's path to the job is uncertain, as Republicans have already begun to criticize her candidacy, with one Representative calling her "reckless" and stating that she lacks the necessary banking experience.</li>
<li>Goldsmith Romero's background is in investigating fraud and abusive practices in the banking industry, having served as the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) after the 2008 financial crisis.</li>
<li>The Biden administration sees Goldsmith Romero's experience as particularly relevant for the top FDIC job, given the agency's recent scandals and the need for a strong leader to reform the organization's culture.</li>

In a statement emailed to reporters on Thursday, Mr. Barr called the choice “reckless” and said that Ms. Goldsmith Romero was not qualified to lead the bank regulator.</p></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">“Our financial institutions deserve a leader with substantial, direct experience in banking, not a politicized choice whose background is misaligned with the demands of this role,” Mr. Barr said.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The bulk of Ms. Goldsmith Romero’s work with banks has been in her role as special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the roughly $450 billion operation put in place to stabilize the banking industry after the financial crisis. Ms. Goldsmith Romero and her staff investigated how banks were using their aid funds and whether they were following rules on home foreclosures and other consumer relief efforts related to the bailout. </p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Officials in the Biden administration see her work as especially important for the top F.D.I.C. job given the current state of the regulator, where reports by The Wall Street Journal and an outside law firm have described as having a widespread culture of harassment and abuse by senior managers against women and junior employees. Leaders in the Senate, including Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/20/business/fdic-gruenberg-replace.html" title="">declared</a> Mr. Gruenberg unfit for the role of rooting out the abuse and improving the agency’s culture and its employees’ morale.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">If she is confirmed, Ms. Goldsmith Romero would be the first person in roughly 20 years who got the job without first serving as an aide in the Senate working on banking issues, a role viewed by some members of the banking industry as essential for developing a deep familiarity with bank regulatory policy. Mr. Gruenberg was a senior counsel on the banking committee’s staff for more than a decade before he joined the agency. And its most recent Republican chair, Jelena McWilliams, was also a staff member on the committee.</p></div></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The producer price index (PPI), which measures inflation at the wholesale level, fell 0.2% in May, the largest drop since October. This suggests that price pressures within the US economy are loosening their grip.</li>
<li>On an annual basis, PPI prices remain up 2.2%, unchanged from last month and the highest level since April 2023. However, this is lower than the 2.5% increase forecast by LSEG economists.</li>
<li>Core prices, which exclude the more volatile measurements of food and energy, were flat for the month, lower than the 0.3% estimate and the 0.5% gain recorded the previous month. This suggests that core prices are also easing.</li>
<li>The decline in PPI is seen as a sign of continued progress on inflation, keeping the prospect of a rate cut alive in 2024. Clark Bellin, president and chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth, noted that the data keeps the prospect of a rate cut alive in 2024.</li>
<li>Despite the decline in PPI, inflation remains a significant challenge for most US households, particularly lower-income Americans who tend to spend more of their paycheck on necessities and have less flexibility to save money.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Jobless claims unexpectedly jumped</strong>: The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits increased by 13,000 to 242,000 in the week ending June 8, the highest level in 10 months, exceeding the 2019 pre-pandemic average of 218,000.</li>
<li><strong>Labor market cooling</strong>: The unexpected jump in jobless claims suggests that the labor market is starting to cool in the face of high interest rates, which could have major implications for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.</li>
<li><strong>Fed's interest rate decision</strong>: The weaker-than-expected jobless data could keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates in September, as policymakers have signaled a willingness to hold rates at elevated levels until inflation is conquered.</li>
<li><strong>Labor market slow-down</strong>: The data suggests that the labor market is slowing down, with white-collar workers facing challenges in finding jobs as the labor market slows. Experts warn that the number of high-paying job opportunities is dwindling.</li>
<li><strong>Fed's inflation fight</strong>: The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates in 2022 and 2023 to combat high inflation, and is expected to keep rates elevated until inflation is under control. The latest jobless data may nudge the Fed closer to cutting rates in September.</li>

(NYSE: PFE) today announced that CIFFREO, a Phase 3 global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the investigational mini-dystrophin gene therapy, fordadistrogene movaparvovec, in ambulatory patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) did not meet its primary endpoint of improvement in motor function among boys 4 to 7 years of age treated with the gene therapy compared to placebo. The primary endpoint in the final analysis was assessed by change in the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) at one year after treatment. Key secondary endpoints, including 10-meter run/walk velocity and time to rise from floor velocity, also did not show a significant difference between participants treated with fordadistrogene movaparvovec and placebo.</p><p>The overall safety profile of fordadistrogene movaparvovec in the CIFFREO trial was manageable, with mostly mild to moderate adverse events, and treatment-related serious adverse events generally responding to clinical management.</p><p>“We are extremely disappointed that these results did not demonstrate the relative improvement in motor function that we had hoped. We plan to share more detailed results from the study at upcoming medical and patient advocacy meetings, with the goal of ensuring that learnings from this trial can help improve future clinical research and development of treatment options that can improve care for boys living with Duchenne muscular dystrophy,” said Dan Levy, MD, PhD, Development Head for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Pfizer. “We are grateful for the boys, their families, advocates, and the investigators who have participated in this research and the continuing effort to advance treatment options for this debilitating disease.”</p><p>Pfizer will continue to closely monitor all participants enrolled in the study and is evaluating appropriate next steps for the program.</p><p><strong>About the Fordadistrogene Movaparvovec Clinical Program</strong></p><p>CIFFREO is a Phase 3 global, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of fordadistrogene movaparvovec investigational gene therapy in ambulatory male participants, aged 4 to 7 years, with a genetic diagnosis of DMD who are on a stable daily regimen of glucocorticoids. The primary endpoint of the study is a change from baseline to one year in the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score.

Pfizer is actively working to gather additional information on the event to understand the potential cause.</p><p><strong>About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</strong></p><p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a serious genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. Symptoms usually manifest in early childhood between the ages of 3 and 5. The disease primarily affects boys. Muscle weakness can begin as early as age 3, first affecting the muscles of the hips, pelvic area, thighs, and shoulders, and later the skeletal (voluntary) muscles in the arms, legs, and trunk. By their early teens, patients typically lose their ability to walk and the heart and respiratory muscles are also affected, ultimately resulting in premature death. DMD is the most common form of muscular dystrophy worldwide with an incidence of 1 in every 5,000 live male births.<sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ Lives</strong></p><p>At Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The holdings of GameStop Corp. call options purportedly owned by Keith Gill, also known as "Roaring Kitty", has shrunk significantly amid late trading on Wednesday and Thursday. This suggests that he may have sold part of his position.</li>
<li>The volume of GameStop $20 calls expiring on June 21 surged to 93,266 contracts on Wednesday, making it the most-active option. This increased trading volume and the decrease in outstanding contracts imply that Gill may have sold some of his position.</li>
<li>Gill had earlier claimed to have bought 120,000 contracts of the $20 calls, but the number of outstanding contracts dropped by 34% to 111,818 by Wednesday's session. This discrepancy has raised questions about the accuracy of Gill's claims.</li>
<li>The surge in trading as GameStop's shareholder meeting was scheduled to take place, which was later postponed due to technical difficulties. This sudden increase in trading activity has led some analysts to speculate that Gill may have sold some of his position.</li>
<li>While the exact intentions of Gill's actions remain unclear, analysts believe that his decision to sell his position may not have a significant impact on GameStop's shares. The company's recent capital raise and the company's fundamentals may be more influential in determining the stock's price.</li>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- Holdings of the GameStop Corp. call options Keith Gill — known online as ‘Roaring Kitty’ — purported to own shrank amid a flurry of late trading Wednesday and Thursday, suggesting that he may have sold some of the position.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>Volume of GameStop $20 calls expiring on June 21 surged to 93,266 contracts on Wednesday, mostly in the last half hour of trading, making it the most-active option. On Thursday morning, volume picked up again shortly after 11:30 a.m., with most large transactions at or near the bid, signaling selling pressure. By midday, the contract was again the most popular, having changed hands 41,230 times.</p><p>Through Wednesday’s session, the number of outstanding contracts dropped 34% to 111,818, fewer than the 120,000 Gill alleged in a social media post earlier this month to have bought. A subsequent post showed as of June 10 he still held the position.</p><p>The $20 calls, which closed at $6.40 Wednesday, traded between $6 and $8.50 early Thursday as shares rose as much as 11%. That leaves the options still above his purported average purchase price of $5.6754.</p><p>The surge in trading comes as GameStop was scheduled to hold a shareholder meeting on Thursday. The meeting was postponed due to technical difficulties with the live stream, according to the company.</p><p>Wednesday’s high volume of trading and change in outstanding positions “suggest that Gill, assuming he is in fact the holder of those calls, sold to close” at least part the position, according to Christopher Jacobson, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna International Group.</p><p>News of his position sent shares nearly doubling to over $45 this month, before retreating. The company capitalized on the rally to sell $2.14 billion of shares. With expiration approaching, the question has remained whether Gill would exercise the contracts to receive shares, or close out the position.</p><p>As of Thursday morning, Gill had yet to address the recent trades or his holdings, despite rampant speculation that he had exited the unverified position. What — if anything — that might mean for shares remains unclear.</p><p>“Whichever direction that shares move today, it’s not going to be because they’re blaming Keith Gill,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, referring to retail traders. “I don’t think it will be negative. They’ll say: good for him.”</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>(Updates with latest trading, meeting postponement starting in second paragraph.)</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gamestop's highly-anticipated shareholder meeting was adjourned due to a technical problem causing many investors to be unable to log on to the livestream.</li>
<li>The technical issue was caused by "unprecedented demand" from shareholders trying to access the meeting, according to Computershare, the company hosting the webcast.</li>
<li>The meeting was originally slated to begin at 11 a.m. ET, but those attempting to access the link found it wouldn't load or received an error message.</li>
<li>Despite the technical issue, Gamestop's shares were still up over 6% by Thursday afternoon, indicating that the company's stock performance remains resilient.</li>
<li>The article highlights the significance of Gamestop's resurgence, citing the impact of the "meme stock craze" and the renewed interest in the company following the return of Keith Gill, aka "Roaring Kitty", who has expressed confidence in the company's potential for turnaround.</li>
