<p><strong>Musk is one of the wealthiest people in the world</strong>, with a net worth of $203 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This has led some to question the need for such an excessive pay package for the Tesla CEO.</p>

<p class="article_paragraph_2"></p><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light">
<p><abbr class="drop-cap color-accent font-accent">“I</abbr>owe Columbia a lot,” says Robert Kraft, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots, who announced in April he would stop donating to his alma mater amid <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesfarrell/2024/04/23/columbia-says-its-grateful-to-robert-kraft-after-billionaire-pulled-funding/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesfarrell/2024/04/23/columbia-says-its-grateful-to-robert-kraft-after-billionaire-pulled-funding/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesfarrell/2024/04/23/columbia-says-its-grateful-to-robert-kraft-after-billionaire-pulled-funding/" aria-label="the student protests">the student protests</a> spreading across college campuses. “Columbia gave me a full scholarship when I really needed it, and I’m loyal. But the [protesters] are not held accountable for their words or actions, and the university is letting them get away with it.”</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p>Columbia might lose millions from Kraft’s decision, considering he has given at least $8 million to the university over his lifetime. Luckily, the New York City school has plenty of other deep-pocketed alumni, including cable magnate Rocco Commisso, who tells <em>Forbes</em> he doesn’t plan to sit on his wallet. “I think now is the time to give more, not less,” says Commisso. “As alumni and wealthy people, we should commit ourselves to help Columbia grow. This is a school that gave me money and opportunity.”</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p>Commisso and Kraft are two of 11 billionaires who got an undergraduate degree from Columbia, making it one of the most elite schools in the world when it comes to educating billionaires. America’s richest people hail from colleges all across the country—from small liberal arts schools like Hobart and William Smith Colleges, where Fidelity Investments CEO Abigail Johnson studied art history, to major public research universities like Indiana University Bloomington, where Mark Cuban graduated with a business degree. But a quarter of the 813 American citizens on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#89ff9203d788" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#89ff9203d788" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#89ff9203d788" aria-label="Forbes’ billionaires list"><em data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#89ff9203d788">Forbes</em>’ billionaires list</a> got their undergraduate degree from one of just a dozen schools. This elite group includes two major California private colleges, two state schools and seven of the eight Ivies, including the University of Pennsylvania, by far the school with the most billionaire undergraduates, with 36, about two-thirds of whom studied at the esteemed Wharton School.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>
<p>Such deep-pocketed alumni networks can mean big bucks for a school’s endowment and big benefits for students. The late hedge fund billionaire Jim Simons and his wife Marilyn pledged $500 million in unrestricted funds through The Simons Foundation to Stony Brook University’s endowment last year. And Michael Bloomberg gave the largest single donation to any U.S. college or university in 2018, with a $1.5 billion gift to Johns Hopkins University, earmarked for undergraduate financial aid. Billionaire names adorn everything from New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business, to Harvard’s Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts &amp; Sciences, to the University of Oregon’s Phil and Penny Knight Campus.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p>

<p class="article_paragraph_7"></p><p>Of course fundraising from the ultra-wealthy can also place schools’ budgets at the whims of a small group of donors. Charlie Munger (d. 2023) donated $200 million to the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2016—with the requirement that the school construct a dorm using his design, which lacked windows and <a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2023/08/university-california-abandons-windowless-dorm-munger-hall/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.archpaper.com/2023/08/university-california-abandons-windowless-dorm-munger-hall/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.archpaper.com/2023/08/university-california-abandons-windowless-dorm-munger-hall/" aria-label="stirred controversy before the gift was scrapped">stirred controversy before the gift was scrapped</a>. When Charles and David Koch endowed a professorship at George Mason University as far back as the 1990s, their foundations got a seat on the board that chooses nominees for the position. And when billionaires are displeased with how a school is run, they might just pull their checkbooks altogether. Kraft isn’t the only wealthy donor halting his giving these days—so are others, such as hedge fund billionaire <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/10/26/billionaire-leon-cooperman-cutting-off-donations-to-columbia-over-student-protests-of-israel-hamas-war/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/10/26/billionaire-leon-cooperman-cutting-off-donations-to-columbia-over-student-protests-of-israel-hamas-war/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/10/26/billionaire-leon-cooperman-cutting-off-donations-to-columbia-over-student-protests-of-israel-hamas-war/" aria-label="Leon Cooperman">Leon Cooperman</a>, real estate investor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/business/sterlicht-brown-university-donor.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/business/sterlicht-brown-university-donor.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/business/sterlicht-brown-university-donor.html" aria-label="Barry Sternlicht">Barry Sternlicht</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/12/21/harvards-claudine-gay-under-fire-now-billionaire-blavatnik-pauses-donation/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/12/21/harvards-claudine-gay-under-fire-now-billionaire-blavatnik-pauses-donation/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/12/21/harvards-claudine-gay-under-fire-now-billionaire-blavatnik-pauses-donation/" aria-label="Len Blavatnik">Len Blavatnik</a>, who got his wealth from both chemicals and the music industry.</p>
<p>Here are the universities with the most American billionaire undergraduate alumni.

<p>With more than three dozen billionaire alumni, the Philadelphia institution educated the likes of Tesla’s Elon Musk, former president Donald Trump, and Apollo cofounders Marc Rowan and Josh Harris. Penn is also in the blood of the heirs to the Estée Lauder fortune, with Leonard Lauder, William Lauder, Aerin Lauder and Ronald Lauder all attending over the span of four decades. Leonard and Ronald Lauder helped to establish Penn’s Lauder Institute, providing joint MBA and Master’s degrees in international studies, and Leonard Lauder gave $125 million to the university in 2022 to create a tuition-free nursing program. Though many CEOs—from Comcast’s Brian Roberts to Bilt Rewards’ Ankur Jain—studied business at Wharton, it’s not the only school within the university to turn out wealthy alumni. Designer Tory Burch got an art history degree from Penn, while film producer Dick Wolf studied English. Wolf and Rowan were among the university’s wealthy donors who called for former president <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/willskipworth/2023/12/09/penn-president-liz-magill-resigns-after-backlash-over-antisemitism-hearing-testimony/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/willskipworth/2023/12/09/penn-president-liz-magill-resigns-after-backlash-over-antisemitism-hearing-testimony/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/willskipworth/2023/12/09/penn-president-liz-magill-resigns-after-backlash-over-antisemitism-hearing-testimony/" aria-label="Liz Magill to resign">Liz Magill to resign</a> last year following her testimony during a congressional hearing on the rise of antisemitism on college campuses.</p><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-45 bleedright" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text"><small>David Madison/Getty Images</small></p></figcaption></figure>

<p>The Silicon Valley school has helped mold plenty of tech billionaires, from Andy Fang and Stanley Tang, who were students when they cofounded food delivery app DoorDash, to Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, two fraternity brothers who created the project that became Snapchat. Several banking and finance moguls graduated with a bachelor’s degree from the institution, including Charles Schwab, Capital One’s Richard Fairbank and Scott Crabill, managing partner at private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Then there’s Jerry Yang, who completed his undergraduate and masters studies at Stanford, then cofounded Yahoo after dropping out of a Ph.D. program at the school. Yang now chairs the university’s board.</p><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-46 offset" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text"><small>Maddie Meyer/Getty Images</small></p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Harvard College has educated Natalie Portman, Neil deGrasse Tyson, six U.S. presidents—and more than two dozen current U.S. billionaires. That includes Citadel’s Ken Griffin, who installed a satellite dish on his dorm roof to get real-time stock quotes, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Airbnb cofounder Nathan Blecharczyk. Some alumni are Boston legends, including Jim Koch, the creator of Sam Adams beer, and Tom Werner, whose Fenway Sports Group owns the Boston Red Sox, Fenway Park and a big stake in New England Sports Network. Just as famous as the school’s graduates, however, are its dropouts. Bill Gates, for example, left to launch Microsoft in 1975, while Mark Zuckerberg left in 2004 to pursue Facebook full-time. He and his wife Priscilla Chan, who met at Harvard, announced in 2021 they would give $519 million to the university through The Chan Zuckerberg Foundation to launch and operate the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence, named after Zuckerberg’s mother.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-1"><p id="article-0-topx-1"></p></fbs-ad><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-47 bleedright" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text"><small>Plexi Images/GHI/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty Images</small></p></figcaption></figure>

<p>FedEx founder Fred Smith famously wrote an economics paper while an undergraduate at Yale that later became the basis for the $90 billion (revenue) company. Three heirs behind candy company Mars, Inc. are all Bulldogs, too, as are oil tycoons Lee, Edward, Robert and Sid Bass. Other notable Yalies include Blackstone chairman and CEO Stephen Schwarzman, who gave $150 million to the university in 2015 to create a new student center, as well as Ben Silbermann and Paul Sciarra, who cofounded photo bookmarking site Pinterest.</p><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-48 bleedleft" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text"><small>Cornell University</small></p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Known for its School of Cinematic Arts, USC was the launching point for filmmaker George Lucas, who graduated in 1967 and who gave $175 million to the film school in 2006. Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO of software giant Salesforce graduated from USC’s Marshall School of Business, meanwhile. And Scott Cook, cofounder of Intuit, studied economics at the university. Some of California’s biggest real estate moguls also call USC their alma mater, including former LA mayoral candidate Rick Caruso, Edward Roski Jr. and two heirs behind storage company Public Storage, Tamara Gustavson and B. Wayne Hughes Jr.</p>
<p>When real estate developer Igor Olenicoff first arrived on campus as a transfer student in the 1960s, he didn’t have any friends. Olenicoff, whose family immigrated to the United States at the age of 15 from Iran, said pledging a fraternity at USC was the first chance for him to make real connections—relationships that he continues to use in business.</p>
<p>“When I needed a large unsecured line of credit to do early real estate projects, I could go back to people I knew at USC in the banking world.” Olenicoff tells <em>Forbes</em>. “Having friends in the business world was very helpful after graduating. That’s truly what USC provided.”</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-2"><p id="article-0-topx-2"></p></fbs-ad><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-51 bleed" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text"><small>RINCETON UNIVERSITY, OFFICE OF COMMUNICATIONS</small></p></figcaption></figure>

<p>With the second richest person in the country, Jeff Bezos, as an alumnus, Princeton’s combined billionaire net worth trumps that of any other college. Bezos and his billionaire ex-wife Mackenzie Scott are both graduates, though they didn’t meet until after they separately left the university and took jobs at hedge fund D.E. Shaw. Princeton is also the jumping off point for several other tech fortunes. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, an alum, and his wife Wendy established a $25 million endowment in 2009 to fund “risk-taking projects” in natural sciences and engineering. And, in 2002, former eBay CEO Meg Whitman gave $30 million to Princeton to help expand its student body. Among the alumni are also notable names in finance, such as investor Carl Icahn, Cerberus Capital CEO Stephen Feinberg and Michael Novogratz, the founder of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital.</p><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-43" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text"><small>Simon Simard/Bloomberg</small></p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Best known for its engineering and physical science programs, MIT has helped mold several notable healthcare and tech billionaires. That includes Drew Houston, who cofounded Dropbox with MIT classmate Arash Ferdowsi, and Lisa Su, the CEO of semiconductor firm AMD. The school named its nanoscience research building after Su in 2022, after she donated an undisclosed sum. Other alumni include founder of analytics software firm MicroStrategy and Bitcoin investor Michael Saylor, and technology-focused venture capital investor Philippe Laffont. Koch Industries co-CEO Charles Koch and his brother William Koch both studied engineering at MIT. The Institute’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research is named after their late brother David (d. 2019), also an alum, who gave $100 million to MIT in 2007 to build the facility.</p>
<p>“I spent my early years believing I was destined for a career in engineering, but it became clear at MIT that I would be a lousy engineer,” says Charles Koch in a statement to <em>Forbes</em>. “But MIT helped me develop a problem-solving mindset and the ability to see the bigger picture.”</p><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-42 bleedleft" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text"><small>Bing Guan/Bloomberg</small></p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Almost all of Dartmouth’s billionaire alumni got rich in private equity. Leon Black, cofounder of Apollo Global Management, studied philosophy and history at Dartmouth and was a trustee of the college from 2002 to 2011. Black and his wife Debra gave $48 million to the Black Family Visual Arts Center there. (A college spokesperson stated there were no plans to rename the center after Black was sued by a woman in 2023 alleging Black raped her in 2002 at the home of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein; Black has denied the allegations.) Others include Thoma Bravo managing partner Holden Spaht; Jim Coulter, co-CEO of TPG; and Nvidia board member Tench Coxe, whose wealth largely stems from his stake in the chipmaker but who has served for more than three decades at VC firm Sutter Hill Ventures. Stephen Mandel Jr., founder of hedge fund outfit Lone Pine Capital, is the third generation of his family to graduate from Dartmouth and served as chair of the college’s board of trustees from 2010 to 2014.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-3"><p id="article-0-topx-3"></p></fbs-ad><hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"><figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-53 offset" role="presentation"><figcaption><p class="color-body light-text"><small>gregobagel/getty images</small></p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Nvidia stock has soared to about $1,200 a share — up 287% since the chip designer’s boffo May 2023 earnings report kindled generative AI fever.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p>With the stock set to drop to about $120 per share Monday — when the company’s 10-for-1 split goes into effect — will its stock price ever return to $1,200?</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p class="article_paragraph_2"></p>
<p>Here are four reasons that could happen by 2026 — the first is new, and the last three are still valid since my May <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2024/05/25/nvidia-stock-tops-1000-blackwell-could-aid-10-fold-rise-by-2026/?sh=2db3622a4956" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2024/05/25/nvidia-stock-tops-1000-blackwell-could-aid-10-fold-rise-by-2026/?sh=2db3622a4956" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2024/05/25/nvidia-stock-tops-1000-blackwell-could-aid-10-fold-rise-by-2026/?sh=2db3622a4956" aria-label="Forbes"><em data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2024/05/25/nvidia-stock-tops-1000-blackwell-could-aid-10-fold-rise-by-2026/?sh=2db3622a4956">Forbes</em></a> post:</p>

 <li>Governments are afraid of falling behind in the race to master generative AI. Their chip purchases have added to Nvidia’s revenue, according to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidias-new-sales-booster-the-global-push-for-domestic-ai-champions-6d005ab7?mod=hp_lead_pos5" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidias-new-sales-booster-the-global-push-for-domestic-ai-champions-6d005ab7?mod=hp_lead_pos5" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidias-new-sales-booster-the-global-push-for-domestic-ai-champions-6d005ab7?mod=hp_lead_pos5" aria-label="Wall Street Journal"><em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidias-new-sales-booster-the-global-push-for-domestic-ai-champions-6d005ab7?mod=hp_lead_pos5">Wall Street Journal</em></a>;</li>
 <li>Nvidia’s great performance and prospects;</li>
 <li>Nvidia’s successful growth investments; and</li>
 <li>CEO Jensen Huang’s leadership — which could also be Nvidia’s biggest investment risk should he leave the job without a more capable successor.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>One other risk is business leaders’ bipolar attitude towards generative AI.</p>
<p>How so? CEOs host competing fears. They are afraid of being left behind the generative AI boom even as the potential for AI hallucinations could savage their company’s corporate reputations.</p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"><p id="article-0-inread"></p></fbs-ad>

<p>Without that, demand for Nvidia’s technology could be difficult to sustain.</p>

<p>Were Nvidia stock — in an optimistic scenario — to keep rising at the 287% annual rate it enjoyed between May 2023 and last Friday, the company’s post-split shares could top $1,200 sometime in 2026, according to my analysis.</p>

<p>Here is a new source of growth to fuel that rise: Governments in Asia, the Middle East, Europe and the Americas are buying GPUs en masse as they build domestic computing facilities for artificial intelligence, noted the <em>Journal</em>.</p>
<p>What is driving this spending? The desire by countries to develop sovereign AI by training large language models in their own language with citizens’ data. Underlying this imperative is “a quest for more strategic self-reliance amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China,” the <em>Journal</em> wrote.</p>
<p>Nvidia expects sovereign AI spending to account for $10 billion in 2024 revenue, the company said last month. If demand by countries to build their own generative AI capabilities continues to expand, such spending could help Nvidia to diversify its revenue sources.</p>
<p>Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, said this revenue stream could help Nvidia continue to profit from the AI boom. “The question has been, how can they continue this momentum?” he told the <em>Journal</em>. “Sovereign AI is a new lever out there in terms of generating higher revenue.”</p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Three Nvidia Growth Drivers</h2>
<p>In addition to sovereign AI demand for Nvidia chips, other drivers of Nvidia’s growth, about which I wrote in my May <em>Forbes</em> post, include:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Expectations-beating first-quarter results and forecast. </strong>In the first quarter of the company’s fiscal year 2025, Nvidia beat expectations for 237% revenue growth by $1.78 billion and reported a higher-than-expected gross margin of 78.4%, noted <em>Yahoo! Finance</em>. The company also forecast 197% revenue growth for the current quarter — exceeding analysts’ expectations, the <em>Journal </em>wrote.</li>
 <li><strong>Nvidia’s growth investments.</strong> Nvidia’s aggressive pace of new product introductions will drive future growth. Examples include Blackwell chips which Huang said would generate “alot of revenue” for Nvidia in 2024 along with the company’s fast-growing InfiniBand line, as I wrote in May. Nvidia’s 427% increase in revenue from cloud service providers — which accounted for $22.6 billion in revenue, noted the <em>New York Times, </em>could slow down in the future. Fortunately for Nvidia, demand from sovereign AI customers could help offset the inevitable maturation of GPU demand from cloud services providers.</li>
 <li><strong>Huang’s world-class leadership talent. </strong>Huang is at the top of a very elite class of leaders who founded a company that went public and maintained control more than three years after the company’s IPO, I noted in May. His ability to introduce and sell industry-leading GPUs while surfing new waves of demand is exceptionally valuable. The company’s ability to sustain expectations-beating growth depends on him remaining CEO — and ultimately appointing a successor at least as talented as Huang.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Can Companies Find High Payoff Generative AI Applications?</h2>
<p>Based on my interviews with dozens of business leaders, generative AI in companies is caught in a bipolar battle, <em>Brain Rush noted. </em></p>
<p>Peer pressure forces CEOs to tell Wall Street how generative AI will transform their business. At the same time, CEOs are terrified the AI chatbots will hallucinate — thus damaging their company's reputation.</p>
<p>This fear is based in reality. For instance, Google’s AI advised people to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/05/31/google-ai-glue-to-pizza-viral-blunders/?sh=2dc458b575cc" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/05/31/google-ai-glue-to-pizza-viral-blunders/?sh=2dc458b575cc" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/05/31/google-ai-glue-to-pizza-viral-blunders/?sh=2dc458b575cc" aria-label="add glue to pizza.">add glue to pizza.</a> And <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/air-canada-chatbot-refund-policy/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.wired.com/story/air-canada-chatbot-refund-policy/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.wired.com/story/air-canada-chatbot-refund-policy/" aria-label="Air Canada's AI chatbot made up">Air Canada's AI chatbot made up</a> a refund policy for a customer — and a Canadian tribunal forced the airline to issue a real refund based on its AI-invented policy.</p>
<p>This bipolar battle has significant implications for business. Of 200 to 300 generative AI experiments companies are developing, they have rolled out only 10 to 15 internally, and released perhaps one or two to customers and other stakeholders, according to my June 3 interview with Liran Hason, CEO of Aporia, a Manhattan-based startup offering guardrails to protect companies from AI hallucinations.</p>
<p>Unless high payoff applications emerge from this process of generative AI experimentation, the wave of demand for Nvidia’s GPUs could taper off over the long run.</p>
<p>In the meantime, business and political leaders’ fear of falling behind in the generative AI race could drive high demand for Nvidia’s chips — and the company’s stock.</p>

    <div><p>Economists are divided over how many interest-rate cuts Federal Reserve officials will signal for 2024 at their policy meeting next week, following a pop in recent inflation figures.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>Policymakers are likely to back away from a longstanding forecast for three rate reductions this year, but it’s a close call on whether they will still pencil in two or not. A 41% plurality of economists expect the “dot plot” to show two cuts, while 41% expect the forecasts to show just one or no cuts at all, according to a Bloomberg survey.</p>



<p>The Federal Open Market Committee, which has held its benchmark rate at a two-decade high since last July, was encouraged by a sharp decline in inflation in the second half of 2023 to pencil in a gradual reduction in rates for this year. But those plans have been pushed back following a lack of progress to start 2024.</p>



<p>“The Fed is waiting for a string of data that strengthens its confidence that inflation is on sustained path toward its 2% target,” Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a survey response. “The balance of risks to our forecast for inflation are still weighted to the upside.”</p>



<p>Officials are all but certain to keep the rate steady in a 5.25% to 5.5% range for a seventh consecutive meeting next week. Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues will update their economic and rate projections at the June 11-12 meeting for the first time since March.</p><p></p>



<p>Fewer cuts would indicate a later start to reductions. That could have implications for the presidential election in November, though Fed officials uniformly say their decisions are based solely on economic considerations.</p>



<p>Fed watchers expect the first cut to happen at the central bank’s September policy meeting, the final gathering before voters head to the polls on Nov. 5. They also see policymakers slightly raising their 2024 inflation estimates, while reiterating their forecasts for growth in US gross domestic product at an annual rate of 2.1% and a year-end unemployment rate of 4%.</p>



<p>The poll of 43 economists was conducted from May 31 to June 5.</p>



<p>The vast majority of those surveyed said the Fed will cut rates in response to lower inflation, rather than some shortfall in the labor market or economic shock. None of the economists said there is much likelihood that the next rate move will be higher — an outcome occasionally mentioned as a possibility by officials such as Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari.</p>



<p>A host of Fed leaders have suggested in recent weeks they see no rush to cut rates, with inflation more persistent and the outlook for growth staying solid. Inflation by the Fed’s preferred measure was 2.7% in the year through April, and economists expect relatively little progress toward the central bank’s 2% goal in the second half of the year when compared to low monthly figures in late 2023.</p><p></p>



<p>Prior to a self-imposed quiet period, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the central bank might consider lowering rates “at the end of this year,” a view echoed by Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic. Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester said she wants to see “a few more months of inflation data that looks like it’s coming down,” while the Boston Fed’s Susan Collins said “patience really matters.”</p>



<p>Almost all respondents expect the Fed to maintain its May 1 guidance that no reduction would be appropriate until the central bank has more confidence inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. The economists are split on how the FOMC will characterize inflation, with a plurality expecting the committee to repeat that there has been a lack of recent progress.</p>



<p>“The FOMC is likely to say there has been some encouraging data, but that it needs to see more evidence for confidence to return,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>On the second day of next week’s meeting, the government will report the May consumer price index. While the Fed focuses on a separate measure of prices, the CPI is expected to show continued cooling of inflation.</p>



<p>“The CPI print is likely to impact the tone of the FOMC,” said Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research. “While we expect a tame print, a number below 0.30% could be seen as further evidence of slowing inflation.”</p><p></p>



<p>The Fed staff has been forecasting a soft landing for the economy since last July. Economists themselves have become increasingly optimistic about the growth outlook. Just 3% of respondents are forecasting a recession in the next 12 months, far below the 58% seen last July. </p>



<p>While Fed leaders have been vague on exactly what set of economic metrics would prompt a rate cut, 60% of the economists said an important catalyst would be three consecutive positive core inflation reports. Inflation figures from January to March disappointed, and economists say an equal number of good reports would set the stage for a rate cut.</p>



<p><a href="https://fortune.com/company/overstock-com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/overstock-com/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Beyond</a> that, “clear evidence of a slowdown in the labor market” might prompt reductions in rates, said Elisabet Kopelman, US economist for Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB.</p>



<p>The government’s May jobs report, published Friday, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/us-payroll-gains-and-unemployment-rate-both-pick-up-at-same-time" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/us-payroll-gains-and-unemployment-rate-both-pick-up-at-same-time" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">showed a mixed picture</a> with regard to the state of the labor market. Growth in payrolls and wages accelerated, though the unemployment rate ticked higher and labor force participation fell.</p>



<p>Traders read the jobs data as likely to push back the timing of rate cuts on net, and now anticipate about 1.5 quarter-point reductions this year, according to futures contracts.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

            The company said the issue stems from a defective anti-lock braking system, which in turn deactivates the stability control system. The system is a critical safety feature in many vehicles which prevents a loss of steering capabilities in emergency situations when the driver loses control of the vehicle, like on icy or flooded roads.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kia America is recalling over 450,000 Telluride SUVs due to an issue with the front power-seat motor, which could overheat and cause a fire, increasing the risk of injury.</li>
<li>The recall affects 462,869 vehicles manufactured between 2020 and 2024, and owners are advised to park their vehicles outside and away from structures and other vehicles until the recall repair is completed.</li>
<li>The issue is caused by the power-seat slide knob getting stuck, which can cause the motor to overheat and potentially catch fire. Dealers will install a bracket for the power-seat switchback covers and replace the seat slide knobs free of charge.</li>
<li>Kia has confirmed that there has been one localized underseat fire and six localized melting of a power-seat motor, but no crashes, injuries, or fatalities have been reported.</li>
<li>Owners of affected vehicles will begin receiving notices on July 30, instructing them to take their vehicle to a Kia dealer for the free repair. Kia's Customer Car Care Center can be reached at 800-333-4542 or local Kia dealers for any questions or concerns.</li>

</div><p>Virgin Galactic on Saturday successfully completed its last spaceflight before heading into a two-year pause on commercial operations to upgrade its fleet, as the space tourism company seeks to finally turn a profit.</p>


										      
																																	<p>"Galactic07 is back on terra firma, now as astronauts!" the company said on X, formerly Twitter, referring to a team of two pilots and two passengers. "Our pilots, crew and spaceship have landed safely at Spaceport America, New Mexico."</p>
<p>A huge carrier plane took off from the runway at 8:31 am Mountain Time and climbed to an altitude of some 44,500 feet (13,500 meters) over approximately 50 minutes.</p>
<p>After that, it released from under its wings a spaceplane that soared at supersonic speed to the edge of space, where the passengers were able to enjoy a few minutes of weightlessness and admire the Earth's curve.</p>
<p>It landed on the same runway at 9:41 am, having accelerated to Mach 2.96, almost three times the speed of sound.</p>
<p>One of the private was Tuva Atasever, a Turkish space agency astronaut whose seat was contracted through another space company, Axiom, while the names of the other three were revealed only after landing.</p>
<p>They were Anand "Andy" Harish Sadhwani, a propulsion engineer at SpaceX, New York real estate developer and airplane pilot Irving Izchak Pergament and Italian investment advisor Giorgio Manenti.</p>
<p>During the flight, Atasever wore custom headgear with <a href="https://phys.org/tags/brain+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag">brain activity</a> monitoring sensors to collect physiological data, a dosimeter, and two commercially available insulin pens to examine the ability to administer accurate insulin doses in microgravity, Virgin said in a statement.</p>

<p><b>Last flight before pause</b></p>
<p>It was the seventh commercial flight for the company founded in 2004 by British tycoon Richard Branson, in an emerging suborbital tourism market where its main competitor is Blue Origin, owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>It was also the final <a href="https://phys.org/tags/flight/" rel="tag" class="textTag">flight</a> for its current spaceplane called VSS Unity, which it intends to replace with two next-generation "Delta class" ships, currently under construction in Arizona, with test flights due in 2025 before commercial operations in 2026.</p>
<p>The future of the company is at stake as it seeks at long last to get into the black. Virgin is burning through cash, losing more than $100 million in each of the past two quarters, with its reserves standing at $867 million at the end of March.</p>
<p>It also laid off 185 people, or 18 percent of its workforce, late last year. Its shares are currently trading at 85 cents, down from $55 in 2021, the year Branson himself flew, garnering global headlines.</p>
<p>While similar in appearance to Unity, the Delta ships will carry six passengers, compared to the current four. Seat prices will be set at $600,000 and up to 125 flights are projected per year, the company says, hoping to turn around its fortunes.</p>
<p>Some are skeptical, however.</p>
<p>"Virgin Galactic investors can look forward to owning a stock generating essentially zero revenue for the next 18 to 30 months—and that's if everything goes as planned, and the Delta program doesn't get delayed," The Motley Fool wrote in a note to investors this week.</p>
<p>Blue Origin, which launches on a small suborbital rocket, resumed crewed flights in May after its own hiatus of nearly two years, though it experienced an anomaly with one of the three landing parachutes failing to fully inflate, which could delay the next mission.</p>

<p>I've read far too many books on ChatGPT and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_1"></p>
<p>Almost all of them are a waste of time when it comes to applying them to education.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p class="article_paragraph_2"></p>
<p>But, there are five books educators on LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook have recommended. And it's these five books I recommend to every educator exploring AI.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_3"></p>
<p>I've authored a best-seller for educators on artificial intelligence, "<a href="https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" aria-label="The AI Classroom: The Ultimate Guide to Artificial Intelligence in Education">The AI Classroom: The Ultimate Guide to Artificial Intelligence in Education</a>," and I'm currently working on a practical guide for leaders on AI strategy. Being deeply immersed in the world of AI books for educators, I can confidently say that whether you are new to AI, experimenting with it, or already incorporating it into your practices, these are books worth your time:</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_4"></p>


<p>AI for Educators is a readable guide that translates AI through a teacher lens.</p>
<p>It offers practical ideas you can use in class right away. It unlocks powerful ways to streamline teaching, save time and paints a picture of the future our students will face, providing questions you can help them grapple with.</p><fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" class="inread-active" display-called=""></fbs-ad>
<p>Dana Leonardo, a technology integration educator from Gilbert, Arizona, praises the book for its clarity and practical advice: "Miller's book gets at the heart of what educators need to know about AI, including practical applications, benefits, and cautions. This text brilliantly explains how and why we need to use AI as a tool, while leveraging our most valuable asset—our humanity."</p>








<p>Salman Khan, the visionary behind Khan Academy, explores how AI and GPT technology will transform learning.</p>
<p>Khan offers a road map for teachers, parents and students to navigate this exciting new world. Beyond technology, Khan delves into the ethical and social implications of AI, providing insights on how administrators, guidance counselors and hiring managers can harness AI to build a more accessible education system.</p>

<p>Kevin Soli, a homeschooling parent from Papua New Guinea, highlights the book's value: "I homeschool my children so this book is very encouraging for me as a parent. ChatGPT is like your tech-buddy—not just to answer your prompts but to prompt you too, asking probing questions that challenge assumptions, clarify concepts and encourage deeper dialogue."</p>

<p>Furze explores the opportunities and challenges of AI in education.</p>
<p>He offers insights into its workings and ethical considerations. The book guides readers through the construction and ethics of generative AI, navigates policy landscapes and provides practical strategies. It has detailed sections on text and image generation and preparations for multimodal technologies like video, audio and 3D generation.</p>
<p>Al Kingsley, chair of Hampton Academies Trust in the UK, emphasizes the book’s approach: “This is an excellent book. It’s highly accessible, evidence informed and structured to step you through AI basics, ethics and assessment.”</p>

Edward Watson</h2>
<p>Bowen and Watson present emerging and powerful research on the seismic changes AI is already creating in schools and the workplace, providing invaluable insights into what AI can accomplish in the classroom and beyond.</p>
<p>Dr. Heather M. Brown, an instructional designer from Virginia, shared, “The book resonates with me because it adopts a holistic view of AI's potential, challenging us to embrace this revolution as an opportunity to reimagine education.”</p>

<p>The key to successfully integrating any digital tool, according to Clark, is to focus on the deep learning and masterful pedagogy teachers can achieve amidst educational shifts.</p>
<p><em>The AI Infused Classroom</em> emphasizes that AI will bring about changes, but it does not replace the need for well-trained and highly qualified teachers in the classroom. Students need educators’ guidance now more than ever to prepare for the world of AI. With the right mindset, questions and strategies, educators can use AI to create and broaden meaningful learning experiences for every student.</p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Bonus</h2>
<p><a href="https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://a.co/d/1gguLDe" aria-label="The AI Classroom">The AI Classroom</a> and most of the books listed above tackle the issues of ethics and equity in AI education. But educators always welcome more guidance on this topic. That's why I’m looking forward to the upcoming book, "The Promises and Perils of AI in Education" by Ken Shelton and Dee Lanier. It’s not published yet, but it should be available soon.</p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">One Reminder Before You Go</h2>
<p>Reading is great, but applying what you read is better.</p>
<p>Reading books on AI in education feels productive. And it is! Until a certain point. Then, it turns into procrastination disguised as "research." How do you avoid falling into this trap?</p>
<p>Easy—start integrating AI into your educational practices every day.</p>

Here’s what you should know:</p><h2>WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I’M AT RISK OF DELINQUENCY?</h2><p>Bruce McClary, senior vice president at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, says that anyone at risk of delinquency should reach out as soon as possible for help from a nonprofit credit counselor, some of whom can be <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nfcc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found through his organization</a></span>. The consultation is free, and a non-judgmental counselor can give guidance towards a long-term solution.</p>
    

<p>Nonprofits can also help create debt management plans that have lower interest rates, no late fees, and a single payment each month, McClary said. These plans may come with maintenance fees, which vary, but the fees are offset by the overall savings on the debt. McClary urged borrowers to be careful of scammers and for-profit debt consolidation companies, which often charge much higher fees than nonprofit organizations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-credit-counseling-en-1451/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a helpful breakdown comparing the two</a></span>.</p>



<p>Martin Lynch, president of the Financial Counseling Association of America, echoed this advice.</p>
    
<p>“Taking that first step and contacting a counselor is difficult for many people,” Lynch said. He emphasized that consumers in debt should do their best to “first, relax,” and then to be as forthcoming as possible about their circumstances with the counselor.</p>
    

<p>“You’ll be talking to someone for free, who will listen to you describe your situation,” he said. “You can share your concerns without being judged for falling into difficulty.” </p><h2>WHAT ABOUT NEGOTIATING WITH CREDITORS?</h2><p>Both Lynch and McClary urge borrowers to reach out directly to credit card companies to negotiate interest rates, fees, and long-term payment plans, noting that it’s in the companies’ best interests if you pay before the debt goes into collections.</p><p>“The best thing to do is to reach out, give an honest assessment of your ability to pay over time, and ask what options are available to you both ‘on and off-the-menu,’” McClary said. This kind of phrasing can give creditors an opening to offer more flexibility, he said. </p><p>McClary and other experts stress that most credit card companies and other lenders have hardship programs available for cases like these. Such options gained visibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, when more companies publicly advertised that consumers facing difficulty may skip or defer payments without penalties. </p><h2>WHY ARE DELINQUENCIES INCREASING?</h2><p>The average annual interest rate on a new credit card is 24.71%, according to LendingTree, the highest since the company began tracking in 2019. That’s in part because the Federal Reserve has raised its key interest rate rate to a 23-year high to combat <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-rates-economy-federal-reserve-biden-d86c5a3a91a61687496f4a985e6bf362">the highest inflation</a></span> in four decades, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. </p>
    

<p>Simultaneously, pandemic-era aid such as stimulus payments, the child tax credit, increased unemployment benefits, and a moratorium on student loan payments has ended. Wage gains haven’t all kept up with inflation, which hits lower-income consumers harder, and rent increases have eaten into savings some consumers may have built up during the early years of the pandemic. </p><p>Silvio Tavares, CEO of VantageScore, a credit score modeling and analytics company, said that delinquencies have now exceeded their pre-pandemic levels, and that <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/affordable-housing-rent-eviction-price-harvard-congress-f5411012e10fa78d0257c137e60c1be3">renters are especially vulnerable to falling behind</a></span>.</p><p>“Younger and less affluent people are experiencing challenges,” he said. “And high interest rates are having an effect.”</p><p>Tavares said the most important thing a borrower can do is to know their credit score and keep up with payments to avoid paying additional interest on revolving balances and debt. He cautioned consumers not to over-extend themselves with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/buy-now-pay-later-holiday-loans-3d66d38295868c03b686577dff85f912">“buy now, pay later” loans</a></span>, which are increasingly available “at every checkout.”</p>
    

<h2>HOW WORRISOME IS THE INCREASE IN DELINQUENCIES?</h2><p>Credit cards only make up about 6.5% of consumer debt, according to a Bank of America Global Research report, but the increase in delinquencies appears to be outpacing <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/jobs-hiring-unemployment-economy-inflation-federal-reserve-d1d73005dbc40b081a555850a44e73d1">income growth</a></span>. </p><p>According to McClary, there’s also likely a large group of consumers paying minimum balances and staying out of delinquency for now but who are too financially stressed to pay their balances in full. A worsening of the economy could push those consumers into severe delinquency, he said.</p><p>On top of increasing credit card delinquencies, retail spending stalled in April. Walmart has said its customers are spending more on necessities and less on discretionary goods. Starbucks lowered its sales expectations, and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mcdonalds-value-meal-deal-bda434c5a939b610a9c1fc09446a38d1">McDonald’s is offering</a></span> more deals as people cut back.</p>

<li>Celebrity chef Andrew Gruel has decided not to open any new businesses in California and will instead "franchise out of the state" due to the rising cost of doing business in the state.</li>
<li>Gruel attributed the struggling restaurant industry in California to various state policies, including crime and excessive regulations, which have "ripped apart the social fabric" and affected businesses.</li>
<li>The restaurant industry is also struggling with the implementation of a new minimum wage law, which has led to layoffs among workers in the industry.</li>

The national rate of homelessness is approximately 19.4 people per 10,000. The top three states with the largest homeless populations are California, New York, and Florida. These states have a combined total of over 315,000 homeless individuals, which accounts for nearly half of the total homeless population in the US.</p><p>With approximately 181,399 homeless people, California has the<strong> highest number of homeless individuals in the country.</strong> The state's high cost of living, particularly in cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, contributes to its<strong> large homeless population</strong>.

Too high rents and excessive living expenses push a lot of low-income families into homelessness.</p><p>Tennessee State University's Dr. Ken Chilton conducted research on how REITs affected the housing market. In low-income neighborhoods, REITs frequently take the role of landlords, raising rents to 50%–70% of inhabitants' wages and contributing to an increase in homelessness.

																										<p>The top U.S. safety regulator has officially launched more relaxed fuel economy standards, following a similar move from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made a few months ago.</p>

<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has officially announced new fuel standards requiring an average fleet fuel economy of 50.4 mpg by 2031 for the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules, as detailed in a report from <a href="https://www.autonews.com/regulation-safety/504-mpg-cafe-standard-new-vehicles-2031-finalized" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Automotive News</i></a>. The new standard is down from the original requirement, which stated that vehicles and light trucks to reach a fuel economy average of 58 mpg by 2032.</p>
<p>In addition, the new standards require just a 2 percent improvement in fuel efficiency per year for cars, while light trucks will need to see a 4 percent improvement between the 2027 and 2032 model years.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The NHTSA rule shift comes as a means to accommodate and comply with recent standard changes from the EPA, which doesn’t require as many <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/u-s-bev-sales-milestone-2023-state-adoption-rates/">electric vehicles (EVs) sold</a> as the previous rules. Under the <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/biden-administration-pulls-back-rule-ev-mileage-rating/">new EPA rules, which went into effect in March</a>, EVs must now make up between 30 and 56 percent of automakers’ light-vehicle sales between 2030 and 2032, coming down from the previous proposal of reaching 67 percent by 2032.</p>
<p>The EPA is typically able to set stricter standards than the NHTSA, given that the latter agency is not allowed to use the fuel economy of EVs when determining maximum possible standards for a given year, though it does have to use them when figuring out compliance.</p>
<p>“Because we have a market that has an increasing number of electric vehicles, it just becomes more difficult for NHTSA to set standards that are as strong as EPA’s emission standards,” said Chris Harto, Consumer Reports Senior Policy Analyst.</p>
<p>The Alliance for Automotive Innovation has argued that the newly revised standards bring the NHTSA’s rules into alignment with those from the EPA.</p>
<p>“Should an automaker be considered in violation of CAFE rules (and subject to billions of dollars in civil penalties) if it complies with the standards established by EPA’s new greenhouse gas rules? No, they shouldn’t,” said alliance CEO John Bozzella. “And … at first glance, the final CAFE rule seems to say as much!”</p>
<p>The alliance also notes that as the automotive industry moves toward EVs, fuel economy standards will become increasingly irrelevant.</p>
<p>“CAFE’s a relic of the 1970s — a policy to promote energy conservation and energy independence by making internal combustion vehicles more efficient,” Bozzella adds. “But those vehicles are already very efficient. And EVs? They don’t combust anything. They don’t even have a tailpipe.”</p>
<p>The NHTSA says the new regulations were developed alongside the EPA, with the two agencies working in tandem to “optimize the effectiveness of its standards while minimizing compliance costs.”</p>

<ul>
<li><em>SEC’s Final Rule regarding disclosure requirements vacated by U.S Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</em></li>
<li><em>Ripple expects XRP ETF launch and new stablecoin amidst an ongoing legal battle with the SEC</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In a recent turn of events, the court has ruled in favor of private fund managers, deciding that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s enhanced regulation for private fund advisers should not be enforced. </span></p>
<p><span>In a recent <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/roJyXmBs5wWI/v0" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">filing</a>, the SEC adopted a rule to enhance the regulation of private fund advisers to protect investors and prevent fraud. This “Final Rule,” published on August 23, 2023, was set to be codified in the Code of Federal Regulations. </span></p>
<p><span>However, it was challenged by several private fund manager associations and ultimately canceled by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. </span></p>
<h2>Impact on the crypto market</h2>
<p><span>The “Final Rule” could have had a major impact on the SEC’s ability to enforce disclosure requirements on crypto firms as well.</span></p>
<p>SEC Chair Gary Gensler, in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/05/sec-chair-gary-gensler-on-new-t-1-settlement-cycle-market-manipulation-and-crypto-regulation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">CNBC,</a> commented on the importance of the disclosure and said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“What President Roosevelt did is he created this Commission to oversee that you the investors get the disclosure. And in the crypto markets, they are not giving you that disclosure.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He went on to say,</p>
<blockquote><p><span>“But the disclosure doesn’t necessarily protect a bad actor if they are manipulating a market.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Commenting on the same, expressing his discontentment with the SEC’s attempt to widen its overreach in the crypto market, <span><a href="https://x.com/s_alderoty/status/1798747814115389546" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Stuart Alderoty</a>, Ripple’s CLO, took to X and noted, </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“I am once again asking how many tax dollars have been wasted through failed efforts by Gensler’s SEC to expand its jurisdiction beyond what the law allows?”</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Here, it’s worth remembering that this update comes at a time when Ripple is already expecting a court decision in their case against the SEC.</p>
<h2>XRP ETF next in line?</h2>
<p><span>Despite the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, rumors are circulating about the potential launch of XRP ETFs.</span></p>
<p><span> With the SEC approving Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Ethereum ETFs nearing launch too, many believe the SEC might be adopting a more favorable stance towards cryptocurrencies now. </span></p>
<p>Echoing similar sentiments, Ripple CTO <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/xrp-solana-cardano-etfs-are-all-inevitable-ripples-garlinghouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Brad Garlinghouse</a> recently noted,</p>
<blockquote><p><span>“An XRP ETF is just simply inevitable.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p>That’s not all either, with Ripple’s President <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W1O4d6GPb8" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Monica Long</a> claiming that the company’s highly anticipated stablecoin is likely to debut this year too.</p>
