<li>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating a Boeing 737 Max 8 flown by Southwest Airlines that rocked side to side while in the air, a potentially dangerous movement known as a Dutch roll.</li>
<li>Separately, the FAA is also probing an issue where Boeing reported learning of potentially falsified documents used to certify titanium in its planes. The agency has confirmed that the issue is "industry-wide", involving shipments from a limited set of suppliers.</li>
<li>Boeing has said that the titanium issue is not a safety concern, and that tests performed so far indicate that the correct alloy was used, despite the false documentation. The company is removing affected parts on airplanes prior to delivery and believes that the in-service fleet can continue to fly safely.</li>
<li>The issue was first reported by The New York Times, which found that a supplier to Spirit AeroSystems, which makes parts for Boeing and Airbus, had started looking into the issue after noticing holes from corrosion. Spirit had alerted the two manufacturers to the problem earlier this year.</li>
<li>The FAA has issued a bulletin to suppliers to be on the alert for counterfeit records, and the agency is probing the scope of the issue. The Canadian transportation safety officials are also working with foreign regulators to determine a co-ordinated approach to the titanium issue.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keith Gill, known as Roaring Kitty, has been accumulating GameStop stock and options, with his portfolio peaking at over $550 million in value.</li>
<li>The unusual trading activity has raised concerns about market manipulation and the definition of "free and fair markets".</li>
<li>The original 2021 GameStop rally shook the short-selling market, and the latest rally is raising questions about whether posting a "meme" or a trading strategy can be considered market manipulation.</li>
<li>Keith Gill's trading activity is being scrutinized, with some followers questioning whether he is engaging in a pump-and-dump scheme or simply executing a successful trading strategy.</li>
<li>Gill's brokerage account snapshots showed him unwinding an earlier position of 120,000 call options, which has led to speculation and concern about his trading activities.</li>

    <div><div class="paywall">



<p>The notion was hardly far-fetched. Over the course of two weeks, Gill had been posting images of a massive stake in GameStop and its call options in a portfolio that peaked at more than $550 million on June 6. Though he’s added even more stock since then, the dollar value of his holdings has dropped along with the company’s shares.</p>



<p>With the stock little changed since the early days of its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-13/gamestop-surges-as-roaring-kitty-return-adds-fuel-to-rally" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-13/gamestop-surges-as-roaring-kitty-return-adds-fuel-to-rally" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">latest mania</a>, a new kind of anxiety is building among Wall Street and retail traders alike.</p>



<p>The original 2021 GameStop rally shook the idea of short-selling to its core — eroding the appeal of betting against a floundering company when you can wind up feeling the wrath of Redditors. This time around, the existential question is about what counts as market manipulation. </p>



<p>Does posting a <a href="https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1789807772542067105" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1789807772542067105" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">meme</a>, potentially delivering an instant profit, violate the spirit of free and fair markets? Has the David versus Goliath nature of meme stocks shifted? What if Roaring Kitty <em>is </em>the Goliath? And how exactly did he build a position bigger than <a href="https://fortune.com/company/charles-schwab/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/charles-schwab/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Charles Schwab</a> Corp.’s?</p><p></p>



<p>“The original meme stock craze was us versus them, with ‘them’ being the guys who would short-sell millennials’ favorite companies like GameStop,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “But I’m not sure who ‘them’ is anymore.” </p>



<p>Gill didn’t reply to a request for comment. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Losing Charm</h3>



<p>The populist ringleader of a short squeeze that shook Wall Street in the original 2021 meme-stock rally, Gill is losing his folksy charm, at least for some followers. Trading firms and even some former fans are eying Gill with more suspicion, as Redditors pose questions like: “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1crttc4/how_is_roaring_kitty_coming_back_not_a_basic_pump/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1crttc4/how_is_roaring_kitty_coming_back_not_a_basic_pump/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">How is Roaring Kitty coming back not a basic pump and dump scheme</a>?”</p>



<p>By Thursday, Gill’s brokerage account snapshots suggested he’d unwound an earlier position of 120,000 call options and added more GameStop, upping his portfolio to about 9 million shares of the video game retailer, worth more than $262 million. (Gill’s final post of 2021 showed he had 200,000 shares worth more than $30 million; GameStop did a four-for-one stock split in July 2022.)</p>



<p>As Gill’s actions sent the price soaring again, GameStop seized on the volatility to sell more than $2 billion worth of stock. </p><p></p>



<p>All told, anyone who bought shares over the past month and held was about as likely to lose money as profit. To some, one major difference is hedge funds and other sophisticated investors have adapted from three years ago and are likely to come out ahead — at the expense of Gill’s retail-trading fans. </p>



<p>“Some of the quantitative managers have models to look at the trends in price and those models are extremely quick to get out of the stock if they see significant downside volatility,” said Don Steinbrugge, chief executive officer of Agecroft Partners, which helps hedge funds raise money. “At some point retail investors are going to wise up and realize there’s a lot of danger.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Manipulation Concerns</h3>



<p>The episode brought to the fore questions of what constitutes market manipulation. The Wall Street Journal reported Morgan Stanley-owned brokerage E*Trade was considering barring Gill from its platform over such concerns, after previously banning other popular personalities like Dave Portnoy, the Barstool Sports founder who streams as Davey Day Trader and said he got kicked off of the brokerage.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>A spokesman for E*Trade declined to comment.</p>



<p>What’s singular about Gill’s case is that market manipulation typically involves pushing a price higher to profit off the stock movement, said Craig Marcus, a partner and co-chair of the capital markets group at law firm Ropes &amp; Gray. If Gill’s snapshots are real, that hasn’t obviously been the case, he said. </p><p></p>



<p>“You can disagree with his thesis about the value of the stock, but if all he’s doing is executing on his thesis and not doing manipulative things to profit,” it’s difficult to prove ill intent, Marcus said in an interview.</p>



<p>To be sure, Gill was accused of using his clout to manipulate prices even three years ago when he first arrived on the public stage. In 2021, a lawsuit against Gill and MassMutual alleged he was manipulating markets with his outsize influence on certain stocks. </p>

<p>“Three years ago this was funny,” said Peter Atwater, an adjunct professor of economics at William &amp; Mary. “People have become more bothered by this than amused by it, and that to me is an indication that it is unlikely that this behavior will be allowed to continue.”</p>



<p>When Gill scheduled a highly anticipated return to <a href="https://fortune.com/company/youtube/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/youtube/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">YouTube</a> on June 6 without details of what he’d talk about, the stock shot up nearly 50%, adding $16 billion to its market value in a matter of hours. </p><p></p>



<p>In the livestream, which garnered hundreds of thousands of viewers, Gill vamped for about an hour against the backdrop of GameStop’s violently fluctuating share price. He seemed to sense the possibility he’d draw more scrutiny from fans, regulators and trading professionals. </p>



<p>“Do I have to be careful what I say here?” he asked.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tesla shareholders have approved CEO Elon Musk's 10-year compensation package, valued at $44.9 billion, which is the largest award to a CEO of a US public company.</li>
<li>The package, which was originally approved in 2018, had been deemed "deeply flawed" by a Delaware judge in January, who ruled that Musk controlled the company's board and shareholders weren't fully informed.</li>
<li>Despite the reruling, Musk won't receive the stock options just yet, as Tesla plans to ask the judge to revisit the decision and, if necessary, appeal the ruling to Delaware's Supreme Court. The process could take months.</li>
<li>The median pay package for an S&amp;P 500 CEO in the US last year was $16.3 million, which means Musk's earnings would be 275 times greater if his package were multiplied by 10.</li>
<li>Musk's package is significantly larger than the largest compensation package given to another CEO, Hock Tan of Broadcom Inc., who received a package valued at $162 million, which is only a fraction of Musk's potential haul of $45 billion.</li>

                    <p>Even though the median U.S. CEO pay package last year was nearly 200 times more than a worker in the middle of their company pay scales, Elon Musk’s record-setting Tesla compensation dwarfs them by comparison.</p>
<p>Tesla shareholders on Thursday voted overwhelmingly in favor of restoring Musk’s 10-year pay plan, valued by the company in April at $44.9 billion. It was worth more early in the year, but Tesla’s stock value has fallen about 25 percent since then.</p>

<p>The all-stock package, approved by the board and shareholders in 2018, rewards Musk for hitting milestones that include raising Tesla’s market value, pretax income and revenue.</p>
<p>It had been tossed out by a Delaware judge in January who said the process for approving it was “deeply flawed.” The court ruled that Musk controlled the company’s board, and shareholders weren’t fully informed.</p>
<p>But the company said Musk deserves the pay because he turned Tesla into the top-selling electric vehicle maker in the world, increasing its market value by billions.</p>
<p>Even with the reapproval vote, Musk won’t get access to the stock options just yet. Tesla is expected to ask the judge to revisit her decision in light of the vote, and if she doesn’t, the company probably will appeal the ruling to Delaware’s Supreme Court. The whole process could take months.</p>
<p>No matter the outcome, Musk’s package — the largest award to a CEO of a U.S. public company — is far above what’s been granted to other chief executives. Here’s how the package compares:</p>
<h2>With the median CEO pay</h2>
<p>The median pay package for an S&amp;P 500 U.S. CEO last year was $16.3 million, according to <a href="https://www.equilar.com/reports/110-equilar-associated-press-ceo-pay-study-2024.html">data analyzed for The Associated Press by Equilar</a>. If you multiply that by 10 to get $163 million for a decade of work, Musk’s earnings still would be 275 times greater.</p>
<p>In her January ruling that struck down the package, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick wrote that Musk’s package, then worth about $56 billion, was 250 times larger than the median peer CEO’s pay plan.</p>
<h2>With individual CEOs</h2>
<p>The top earner in the AP’s survey was Hock Tan, CEO of artificial intelligence company Broadcom Inc. His package, mostly consisting of stock awards, was valued at about $162 million, when given to Tan at the start of fiscal 2023. Thanks to a surging stock price, Broadcom in March valued Tan’s pay package, plus older options he hadn’t yet cashed in, at $767.7 million. That’s an amount easily eclipsed by Musk’s potential haul of 304 million shares worth almost $45 billion.</p>
<p>Other CEOs at the top of AP’s survey are William Lansing of Fair Isaac Corp, ($66.3 million); Tim Cook of Apple Inc. ($63.2 million); Hamid Moghadam of Prologis Inc. ($50.9 million); and Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix ($49.8 million).</p>
<p>Technically, Musk got no compensation last year because he didn’t get any stock options. But he stands to get even richer if his pay package goes through.</p>
<h2>With Tesla workers</h2>
<p>It’s difficult to calculate what Musk’s annual pay would have been last year. The company says he got nothing. But if his compensation package makes it through the courts, his pay will be in the billions. According to the company’s proxy filing this year, the median annual pay of a non-CEO Tesla employee last year was $45,811.</p>

<li><strong>Housing affordability is shot</strong>: Home prices have skyrocketed by 45% since the pandemic, making it difficult for people to afford homes.</li>
<li><strong>Renting may be cheaper than buying</strong>: Despite predictions that renting will be cheaper than buying, $300,000 homes should have been attainable, but the pandemic-fueled housing boom has made it harder to build affordable homes.</li>
<li><strong>Number of affordable homes has decreased</strong>: A Realtor.com report found that the number of homes under $200,000 has decreased from half of all sales to less than a quarter of sales in 2023, indicating a decline in affordability.</li>

<p>“We’re creating, inadvertently, a renter society not because of choice but because of force,” Wolf said. Rent isn’t cheap either, even though some predict <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/03/26/renting-cheaper-than-buying-home-prices-all-time-highs/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/03/26/renting-cheaper-than-buying-home-prices-all-time-highs/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">renting will be cheaper than buying</a> for years. Even so, in Wolf’s mind, $300,000 homes should have been attainable. But everything from the cost of building materials to land availability to the lack of housing to regulation made it so much harder to build affordable homes—and a lot of it stemmed from the pandemic-fueled housing boom.</p>



<p>A Realtor.com <a href="https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/cities-with-the-most-homes-under-200000/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/cities-with-the-most-homes-under-200000/" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">report</a> released Thursday seemed to confirm the fall-off in the number of affordable homes. “Over the past several years, the number of homes under $200,000 has gone from around half of all sales to less than a quarter of sales in 2023,” it said, calling the statistic, “stark proof of shrinking affordability across the country.” </p>



<p>Affordability is shot, that’s no secret; this is just one more indicator of that trend. Home prices skyrocketed during the pandemic: They’re 45% higher now than they were before, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/lock-in-effect-mortgage-rates-home-prices-housing-market-zillow-redfin/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/lock-in-effect-mortgage-rates-home-prices-housing-market-zillow-redfin/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">according to</a> <a href="https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Zillow</a>, and the typical monthly mortgage payment is 115% higher since that time. And, since there’s not enough homes to go around, prices haven’t really fallen. (There are <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/12/housing-market-outlook-hot-metros-pandemic-crashing-cooling-demand/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/12/housing-market-outlook-hot-metros-pandemic-crashing-cooling-demand/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">some metropolitan areas</a> where home prices have declined from a year earlier, but it’s less than a handful—nationally, home prices hit their <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/housing-market-outlook-home-prices-all-time-high-case-shiller/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/28/housing-market-outlook-home-prices-all-time-high-case-shiller/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">ninth all-time high</a> in the past year). In any case, the median sales price of houses sold in the country is $420,800, and the average weekly 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.95%. </p>



<p><strong>‘Where all the $200k homes are hiding’ </strong></p><p></p>



<p>There are some signs that home-price appreciation is slowing, and mortgage rates are coming down, but it might not feel fast enough for anyone who wants to buy a home. Still, Realtor.com analyzed listing data from the first week of this month and compiled a list of what it called “affordability havens…where all the $200k homes are hiding.” Let me tell you, not a single one is in sunny California—or even Texas, its cheaper, and sometimes more popular, counterpart. </p>



<ul><li><strong>Lauderdale Lakes, Florida</strong></li></ul>

<p>Here’s the thing, though: These starter homes might not be $200,000 forever. “These are still some of the most affordable places in the country, but they’ve seen a lot of price growth over the last year or so,” Hannah Jones, a Realtor.com senior economic analyst, said in the report. </p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

<li><strong>Inheritance is becoming a major source of wealth</strong>: A third of the people on Forbes' billionaire list inherited all or most of their wealth, up from just 5% in the 2001 ranking. This trend is shifting the way people accumulate wealth, with inheritances becoming a major factor.</li>
<li><strong>Younger workers are struggling to amass wealth</strong>: Many younger workers are having a harder time accumulating wealth, with fewer opportunities to start their own businesses or invest in the stock market. This is leading to a concentration of wealth among older generations.</li>
<li><strong>Aging millionaires are not passing down their wealth</strong>: Many older millionaires are not passing down their wealth to younger generations, or they are doing so much later in life. This is leading to a concentration of wealth among older generations.</li>
<li><strong>The average age of millionaires is increasing</strong>: The average age of millionaires has increased from around 57 years old in 1992 to around 61 years old in 2022, as younger millionaires are not joining their ranks at the same rate.</li>
<li><strong>This trend has implications for the economy and power dynamics</strong>: The growing concentration of wealth among older generations could have significant implications for the economy and power dynamics, with a small group of older individuals holding a disproportionate amount of wealth and influence.</li>

The release landed the morning of the Fed’s decision.</p><p>Issuance of catastrophe bonds just hit a record high, as the market braces for a rough hurricane season with the potential to do substantial damage. Sales of so-called cat bonds are 38% higher this year through May than over the same five-month period in 2023, which was already a record, according to Artemis, a compiler of data on insurance-linked securities.</p><p>Asia</p><p>The Bank of Japan’s decision Friday to stand pat on interest rates was widely expected, but traders were surprised by it just flagging a cut in debt purchases without laying out any figures or a timeline. Given that more than half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected the central bank to begin cutting its purchases in June, the announcement was viewed by many analysts and investors as a delay in the normalization of policy that’s vital to the recovery of the currency.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="32" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>South Korea’s labor market showed signs of cooling in May as employment growth slowed to its slowest pace in more than three years, a weak outcome that may support the case for authorities to consider adjusting policy.</p><p>Europe</p><p>The euro slid to its lowest in a month against the dollar after French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz were trounced by far-right parties. The concern is that the outcome of the elections has also darkened the longer-term outlook for the world’s second-most traded currency, as it throws into question the prospects for greater integration and a united Europe.</p><p>Britain’s economic recovery ground to a halt in the run-up to the general election, a setback for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who has campaigned on evidence the economy is turning the corner.</p><p>Euro-zone industrial production unexpectedly fell at the start of the second quarter, casting a shadow over the economy’s pickup this year from its poor performance in 2023. The outcome leaves the euro-zone economy leaning more heavily on services to continue its recovery after a growth spurt in the first quarter.</p><p>Emerging Markets</p><p>Israel’s worst armed conflict in half a century has set off an inflationary chain reaction that’s finally coming into view. “Help, We Are Out of Air, We Are Collapsing,” blared a headline on the popular news website Walla in June — an appeal for help against inflation as the public outcry grows.</p><p>World</p><p>The German government is working to prevent the European Union’s new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles from coming into force — or at least soften them should a full halt not be possible, according to people familiar with the matter. Brussels decided to impose additional tariffs on electric cars shipped from China as certain automakers were accused of distorting the market through state subsidies and violating WTO rules.</p><p>After the 2011 Fukushima disaster, nuclear energy was once again too scary, and uranium, the delicate and deadly fuel that powers the reactors, became a sleepy backwater in the global commodities market. But as climate change intensified and governments across the world were drawn anew to the steady carbon-free power generated by nuclear plants, interest in uranium deposits picked up — slowly at first and then, after Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, at a frantic pace.</p><p>Outside the Fed and BOJ, Thailand, Peru, Taiwan and Uzbekistan also held interest rates steady. Ukraine’s central bank delivered a third straight cut to borrowing costs as policymakers weigh the economic impact of Russian attacks on the nation’s energy sector. Pakistan, Serbia and Botswana also lowered rates.</p><p>--With assistance from Galit Altstein, Irina Anghel, Arne Delfs, Toru Fujioka, Sumio Ito, Vassilis Karamanis, Sam Kim, Kamil Kowalcze, Jacob Lorinc, Jonnelle Marte, Geoffrey Morgan, Gautam Naik, Tom Rees, Augusta Saraiva, Zoe Schneeweiss, Craig Stirling and Naomi Tajitsu.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>

<li>Microsoft President Brad Smith apologized for the company's cybersecurity failings in a congressional hearing, accepting responsibility for the "avoidable errors" that allowed Chinese hackers to steal sensitive emails from US government officials' inboxes.</li>

<li>Smith faced criticism for deflecting tough questions about Microsoft's code security and its failure to do its job of securing its code, despite being paid millions of dollars by the government to do so.</li>

<p><span class="label">Feature</span> Microsoft president Brad Smith struck a conciliatory tone regarding his IT giant's repeated computer security failings during a congressional hearing on Thursday – while also claiming the Windows maker is above the rule of law, at least in China.</p>
<p>He answered nearly three hours of questions from US House reps about Microsoft's infosec shortcomings. Now it's time for the White House and Congress to do their job and ensure we don't learn about yet another Redmond blunder exploited by a foreign government six months from now.</p>
<p>And the US government has several tools at its disposal, from executive orders to federal spending, to avoid another Microsoft-connected security breach.</p>

    

<p>Smith kicked off his testimony before Congress this week by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/14/brad_smith_microsoft_hearing/">accepting</a> "responsibility for each and every one of the issues" cited in a recent Homeland Security report that blasted Microsoft for a series of "avoidable errors." These errors, the investigation found, allowed Beijing-backed cyberspies to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/28/chinese_hackers_stole_60000_state/">steal</a> tens of thousands of sensitive emails from the Microsoft-hosted Exchange Online inboxes of high-ranking US government officials.</p>

        


        

<p>That theft was enabled by China <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/06/microsoft_stolen_key_analysis/">stealing</a> a cryptographic key from a crash dump file that had been left on Microsoft's internal internet-connected corporate network; the key should not have made it out of the mega-corp's isolated production environment.</p>
<p>Despite this major security intrusion by China, Smith defended Microsoft's business in the Middle Kingdom. National intelligence laws in China can be used to force companies operating there to provide snooping services for the government, or hand over proprietary code if pressured to do so. But Microsoft doesn't have to comply with that, Smith claimed, to some unbelieving members of Congress.</p>
<h3 class="crosshead">Mea culpa, then deflect</h3>
<p>He gets an A for presentation, but a D for content. Smith issued a mea culpa, but also deflected some of the lawmakers' tough questions about China, and why Microsoft isn't doing a very important job (securing its code, which in this case is also a national security issue) that the government is paying it millions of dollars to do. </p>
<p>Smith also said he hadn't read a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/microsoft-solarwinds-golden-saml-data-breach-russian-hackers">ProPublica report</a> that came out ahead of the Homeland Security subcommittee hearing and was the subject of several questions to the executive. That investigative report cited a now-ex-Microsoft whistle-blowing engineer who claimed he had repeatedly warned bosses as far back as 2017 about an authentication flaw that left Microsoft users and their work accounts vulnerable to compromise.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote">

<p>If anything like this happened with us ... it would not only destroy our product in the marketplace but the government would just kick us out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That flaw, which we're told involves exploiting weaknesses with Microsoft's Active Directory Federation Service and SAML, was allegedly used by the Russian government snoops behind the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/29/solarwinds_sec_lawsuit/">SolarWinds</a> backdoor.</p>
<p>According to the whistle-blower, the Kremlin spies used the SAML-based authentication flaw to gain full access to organizations' files and messages after sneaking into those victims' IT networks via the backdoored SolarWinds software. In other words, this was a post-exploitation vulnerability.</p>

        

<p>It was further alleged Microsoft refused to fix this years-old problem because in doing so, the corporation would have to admit that its Active Directory software was faulty, which could have cost it billions of dollars as the biz was vying for a massive IT contract with the US federal government at the time.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Exchange Online intrusion, all of Microsoft's pledges to do better on security, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/10/microsoft_president_brad_smith_summoned/">overhaul its entire security culture</a>, are either voluntary or - with ideas like tying top exec pay to security performance - are going to be really hard to measure.</p>
<p>"If it was any other vendor, if anything like this happened with us, where we had such a gaping security hole that foreign governments could come into our cloud environment it would not only destroy our product in the marketplace because we have no credibility, but the government would just kick us out," Trellix CTO Karan Sondhi told <em>The Register</em>.</p>

<p>The repeated intrusions by both <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/08/microsoft_confirms_russian_spies_stole/">Russian</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/21/microsoft_key_skeleton/">Chinese</a> cyber-spies highlight the national security risks of Uncle Sam's increasing reliance on a single technology vendor, Sondhi told us. </p>
<p>Specific to Microsoft and America: The US government uses everything from the super-corp's cloud infrastructure to its operating system and productivity tools, and then also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/24/microsoft_security_addons/">adds on</a> Redmond's security products, which Trellix and other infosec vendors say discourages competition in the marketplace.</p>

        

<p>"We're just saying to the government: Have an independent evaluation of security tooling," Sondhi said. "Measure the security tools' effectiveness, independent of the bundle that Microsoft offers, and pick your favorite. If it's us, great. If it's CrowdStrike, more power to you. If it's Sentinel One, great."</p>
<p>Microsoft, he added, "should be fixing vulnerabilities in their products. They should be squarely focused on that instead of trying to sell you security tools."</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote">

<p>Microsoft ... should be fixing vulnerabilities in their products. They should be squarely focused on that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When asked during the congressional hearing about Microsoft's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/04/microsoft_bundles/">bundling practices</a>, which may dissuade the government and other customers from selecting a third-party vendor for security, Smith responded: "I'm not aware of any so-called practices that limit what our customers can do in terms of cybersecurity protection."</p>
<h3 class="crosshead">No real incentive to change</h3>
<p>As long as federal dollars keep <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/05/microsoft_government_contracts/">pouring into</a> Microsoft's coffers, there's no real incentive to change. US government data showed at least $498 million of payments to Microsoft in 2023 alone.</p>
<p>In a May 29 letter to US Department of Defense CIO John Sherman, Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Eric Schmitt (R-MO) questioned why the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/04/pentagon_doubling_down_on_microsoft/">Pentagon is "doubling down"</a> on its investment in Microsoft products despite the IT giant's serious failings.</p>
<p>This, after the Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Safety Review Board's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/03/cisa_microsoft_exchange_online_china_report/">slammed</a> Microsoft's "cascade" of security snafus that made China's digital intrusion into government inboxes possible.</p>

<p>"What should the government do? Probably not give a $10 billion DoD contract to Microsoft for a commercial, off-the-shelf product," said Cory Simpson, CEO of the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology and a senior advisor to the Cyberspace Solarium Commission.</p>
<p>"You have one entity responsible for national security saying here's an entity that poses a risk, and then you have DoD, another entity responsible for national security, doubling down on Microsoft," Simpson told <em>The Register</em>. "We've got to have that conversation, and it needs to be with the White House." </p>
<p>The first thing that needs to happen, according to Simpson, is triage, which needs to come from a White House Executive Order. Later, there's long-term care, which comes from Congress. </p>
<p>While the administration doesn't control the government's purse strings, it could put a pause on future Microsoft integrations while the government explores other vendors' security products, he explained. "That could be done with an executive order," Simpson noted.</p>
<p>The White House Office of the National Cyber Director declined to comment for this story.</p>
<p>The long-term care, on the other hand, involves Congressional action to codify best security practices and even simpler ones, such as requiring Microsoft products to be <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/24/wyden_government_interoperability/">interoperable</a> with those from its peers.</p>
<p>"The two ends of the continuum are a decoupling of Microsoft, and at the other end doing nothing," Simpson said. "And there's a range of options in between."</p>
<h3 class="crosshead">Time for Biden administration to 'walk the talk'</h3>
<p>Under President Joe Biden's leadership, the administration has touted its commitment to shoring up the nation's networks. This included releasing the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/03/us_national_cybersecurity_strategy/">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a> in March 2023.</p>
<p>Part of the strategy centers around holding software makers liable for security flaws in their products, thus shifting IT defense away from the end users of technology and onto the providers. It also says the administration will work with Congress and the private sector to develop legislation around secure software and services.</p>

<p>Plus, this is the focus of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/09/68_tech_firms_sign_cisas/">secure by design pledge</a>, signed by nearly 70 software companies - including Microsoft - at last month's RSA Conference.</p>
<p>Another piece of the strategy involves investing in longer-term security practices at the government and enterprise level, rather than relying on short-term fixes, such as patches and more temporary solutions to problems.</p>
<p>"You can't accomplish both of those things with minimum regulation," Simpson said. "The best way to do that is to fully leverage the government as the largest consumer in the world. It's about purchasing power. If they don't change procurement practices, shame on them. They have to walk the talk of their strategy." ®</p>

<ul>
<li><em>NOT followed TON’s price direction as demand pushed the volume to $1.37 billion</em></li>
<li><em>Token seemed overbought, pointing to a possible fall to $0.016 on the charts</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Notcoin [NOT] defied the broader market “red period” as the price climbed by 7.22% in the last 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap, this happened at a time when <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/category/bitcoin-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin [BTC]</a> slid to $65,103 before slightly recovering above $66,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://ambcrypto.com/category/ethereum-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum [ETH]</a> also registered a decline to $3,381 around the same time. The performance underscores Notcoin’s next-to-nothing correlation with the top two cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>At press time, NOT changed hands at $0.020. On 14 June, however, the token had initially tapped $0.022 on the price charts.</p>
<h2>NOT sentiment bullish, goes with TON</h2>
<p>However, Notcoin is not alone in its rise as fellow Telegram-linked project <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/the-open-network-price-prediction" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Toncoin [TON]</a> joined in too. A few weeks ago, AMBCrypto had <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/notcoin-down-55-since-launch-did-toncoin-suffer-as-a-result/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> how NOT did not follow the same trend as TON.</p>
<p>On the back of the latest price hike, it would seem now that the two have aligned.</p>
<p>From an on-chain perspective, we also found that sentiment around Notcoin has been incredibly bullish. Using the Weighted Sentiment metric, for instance, AMBCrypto <a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/O-VWSNTS__sCl" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">observed</a> that the reading was 0.178 on 13 June. However, at press time, the same metric had hit 0.617.</p>
<p>The notable hike within a short period implies that online comments about NOT were much more positive than those that were bearish about the token.</p>

<p>Apart from the price hike and bullish sentiment, Notcoin’s volume surpassed the $1 billion mark. The increase in volume constituted a 131% hike in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Trading volume is crucial for a cryptocurrency’s price and direction. It indicates if market participants are interested in a token.</p>
<p>Heavy movement of the volume, alongside a <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/notcoin-rises-45-enters-top-100-can-it-break-0-01-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">price increase,</a> suggests an increase in buying pressure. On the other hand, if the spike comes with a price fall, it implies a hike in selling pressure.</p>
<h2>Notcoin’s price may go down later</h2>
<p>For NOT, it was the former. However, it is unlikely that NOT’s volume would hit $4 billion like it did when the price hit an all-time high of $0.029 on 2 June.</p>
<p>Evidence of this was reflected in the Relative Strength Index (RSI).  The RSI is an oscillator that measures speed and changes in price movements.</p>
<p>A value of over 70 indicates that an asset is overbought. When it is less than 30, it means that it is oversold. In Notcoin’s case, the RSI on the daily chart had a reading of 74.27.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Colorectal cancer is a significant health issue</strong>: Each year, approximately 50,000 people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the US, and more than 50,000 people will die from the disease. One in 24 people will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in their lifetime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Early detection is crucial</strong>: The five-year survival rate for colorectal cancer is 90% if caught early. However, only about 40% of colorectal cancers are detected at the early stage, indicating a need for more effective screening methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Current screening methods have drawbacks</strong>: Traditional screening methods, such as colonoscopies and occult blood tests (FITS), have limitations. Colonoscopies can be unpleasant and require lengthy intestinal cleansing, while FITS can only detect bleeding stages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mainz Biomed's ColoAlert is a revolutionary screening solution</strong>: Colorectal cancer diagnostic company Mainz Biomed is addressing these limitations with ColoAlert, a molecular genetics-based screening test that detects bleeding and non-bleeding tumors through tumor DNA analysis. It has shown to detect 85% of colorectal cancer cases, often in the early stages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Early detection can dramatically impact treatment and prevention</strong>: By detecting colorectal cancer in its early stages, ColoAlert has the potential to significantly improve treatment and prevention outcomes. The company's test can potentially prevent the development of cancer by detecting and removing polyps before they become cancerous.</p>

But if it’s caught early, the survival rate after five years is </p><a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/detection.html">90%</a><p>. Despite those favorable odds, only about four in 10 colorectal cancers are spotted at the early stage.  There are several reasons why more people aren't getting screened for this devastating cancer. Some aren't aware that regular testing can save their lives, many can't afford it, while others don't have access. Colonoscopies done at ten-year intervals and occult blood tests (FITS) performed annually or biannually are the two forms of screenings, but both have disadvantages. Colonoscopies, while very precise, involve an unpleasant procedure and lengthy intestinal cleansing. Occult blood tests are more widely accepted, but they can only provide indirect evidence of disease and often only in later, bleeding stages To be effective, cancer screening has to be simple, readily available and affordable, which is where </p><strong>Mainz Biomed </strong><span class="ticker" data-ticker="MYNZ" data-exchange="NASDAQ">MYNZ</span><p> comes in. The </p><a href="https://mainzbiomed.com/">molecular genetics diagnostic company</a><p> specializing in the early detection of cancer is revolutionizing the colorectal cancer testing industry with </p><a href="https://mainzbiomed.com/coloalert/">ColoAlert</a><p>, its flagship product ColoAlert is an early detection screening that spots bleeding and non-bleeding tumors through tumor DNA analysis, offering what the company says is better early detection than fecal occult blood tests. That's important since almost all colorectal cancers develop from polyps that grow over time. The longer the polyps are present, the higher the risk of them becoming cancerous, which is why early screening has the potential to dramatically impact treatment and prevention By analyzing tumor DNA, Mainz says ColoAlert detects 85% of colorectal cancer cases – often in the very early stages of the disease. That is a key differentiator, given the company says </p><a href="https://www.coloalert.com/pages/about-crc">71% of the diagnoses</a><p> made are in the later stages of the disease</p></div></div>

Apparently, of the big banking groups, Wells Fargo was the kindest in requiring people return to corporate buildings. Most employees have to be in the office three days a week. None of the reports we've read clarify if the people let go were working from home or in the office. </p><p id="bordeaux-slot_static_6-hook_8" class="bordeaux-slot"></p><p>Apparently, the investment management unit at Wells Fargo has a history of bad behavior. In 2016, a number of advisers fled the company taking lucrative clients with them, according to Bloomberg. In 2018, Wells Fargo fired a number of employees who were exploiting the expense policy in attempts to get the bank to pay for "ineligible" dinners.</p><p id="bordeaux-slot_static_6-hook_9" class="bordeaux-slot"></p><p id="bordeaux-slot_static_5-hook_0" class="bordeaux-slot"></p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"><span>More from Tom's Guide</span></h3><aside class="hawk-nest hawk-processed" data-model-name="Vaydeer Undetectable Mouse Jiggler,Liberty Mouse Mover,Tech8 USA Mouse Mover,Vaydeer Dual Turntable Mouse Mover" data-widget-type="review" data-render-type="editorial" data-viewports="tablet" data-widget-id="fcda814a-0994-4249-8932-39edd7e23433" data-result="rendered"><div class="hawk-master-widget-hawk-main-wrapper"><div class="hawk-main-editorial-container"><p class="hawk-title-container">Today's best Vaydeer Undetectable Mouse Jiggler, Liberty Mouse Mover, Tech8 USA Mouse Mover and  Vaydeer Dual Turntable Mouse Mover deals</p></div></div></aside>
