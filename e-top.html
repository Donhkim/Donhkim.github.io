<li><strong>Trump's enthusiasm</strong>: Trump has expressed enthusiasm for the debates, saying he's "ready to rumble" and emphasizing his willingness to participate in the debates.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy behind the debates</strong>: Both candidates believe they have an advantage in a head-to-head showdown, with Trump's team aiming to highlight Biden's age and competence, while Biden's team hopes to underscore Trump's divisive rhetoric.</li>

<p>“Trump says he’ll arrange his own transportation,” Biden wrote on X, working in a jab about the perks of incumbency. “I’ll bring my plane, too. I plan on keeping it for another four years.”</p>

<p>The presidential debates, always a critical moment on the political calendar, could be particularly important in a year when voters are underwhelmed with their choices and have expressed concerns about the candidates’ advanced ages — Biden is 81 and Trump 77.</p>
    
<p>Sprightly on social media, the rivals traded barbs — each claiming victory the last time they faced off in 2020.</p>
    

<p>“Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020, since then he hasn’t shown up for a debate,” Biden said in a post on X. “Now he’s acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal.”</p><p>Trump, for his part, said Biden was the “WORST debater I have ever faced - He can’t put two sentences together!”</p><p>The June debate is likely to cap a busy and unsettled stretch, following the likely conclusion of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-criminal-trial-hush-money-stormy-daniels-5fdc819697a76536ed83cbf28d4a523c">Trump’s criminal hush money trial in New York</a></span>, foreign trips by Biden to France and Italy, the end of the Supreme Court’s term, and the expected start of two criminal trials for the president’s son, Hunter Biden.</p><p>CNN said that its debate would be held at 9 p.m. ET in its Atlanta studios with no audience present in a break from recent precedent. Moderators will be anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, CNN said. ABC did not offer details on where its event would be held, but the network said it would be moderated by anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. Disagreements about moderators and rules were some of the questions that prompted the formation of the Commission on Presidential Debates in 1987.</p>
    

<p>The two campaigns and television networks had held weeks of informal talks on ways to circumvent the commission’s grip on presidential debates following years of complaints and perceived slights, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke about internal discussions on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Biden’s campaign had proposed excluding third-party candidates, such as <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/who-is-robert-f-kennedy-jr-rfk-097ac973a32ddf2e8e4edecd6a8f3153">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a></span>, from the debates outright. Under the debate commission’s rules, Kennedy or other third-party candidates could qualify if they secured ballot access sufficient to claim 270 Electoral Votes and polled at 15% or higher in a selection of national surveys.</p><p>Both CNN and ABC announced the same qualification threshold, saying candidates will need to reach at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet their standards.</p>
    

<p>In response, Kennedy accused Biden and Trump of “trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.” He said, “Keeping viable candidates off the debate stage undermines democracy.” </p><p>The debates will be the first televised general election matchups to be hosted by individual networks. The 1960 debates, which helped show the power of the medium to influence public opinion, were hosted jointly by the leading networks of the day. Before the commission was formed in 1987, the presidential debates of 1976, 1980 and 1984 were organized by the League of Women Voters. </p><p>Plans for a vice presidential debate have yet to be announced. </p><p>Trump has been pushing for more and earlier debates, arguing voters should be able to see the two men face off well before early voting begins in September. He has even <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://youtu.be/hGDMG0MM6F4?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed a debate</a></span> outside the Manhattan courthouse where he is currently on trial. He also has been taunting Biden with an empty lectern at some of his rallies.</p>
    

<p>In a memorandum to Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon on Wednesday, Trump senior campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles challenged Biden to agree to at least two additional debates, suggesting one be held each month, with events in June, July, August and September, in addition to a vice presidential debate.</p><p>“Additional dates will allow voters to have maximum exposure to the records and future visions of each candidate,” they wrote.</p><p>Trump later posted on Truth Social that he had agreed to a third debate, this one hosted by Fox.</p><p>“Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that I hereby accept debating Crooked Joe Biden on FoxNews. The date will be Wednesday, October 2nd. The Hosts will be Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. Thank you, DJT!” he wrote.</p><p>O’Malley Dillon responded with a statement accusing Trump of having “a long history of playing games with debates: complaining about the rules, breaking those rules, pulling out at the last minute, or not showing up at all.”</p><p>“No more games. No more chaos, no more debate about debates. We’ll see Donald Trump on June 27th in Atlanta – if he shows up,” she wrote.</p><p>In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Wednesday morning, Trump had raised his own doubts about whether Biden would show, and offered his own suggestions. He said the debates “should go two hours” with both men standing, and he also pushed for larger venues.</p><p>“It’s just more exciting,” he said.</p><p>Biden’s campaign has long held a grudge against the nonpartisan commission, accusing it of failing to evenly apply its rules during the 2020 Biden-Trump matchups — most notably when it <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-donald-trump-joe-biden-health-campaigns-0f7315791a3ead1919842c894bedb68f">didn’t enforce its COVID-19 testing rules on Trump</a></span> and his entourage.</p><div class="AudioEnhancement" data-separate-event="audioModule" data-separate-value="AP AUDIO: Biden and Trump agree on debates in June and September, but working out details could be challenging" data-module="" data-gtm-region="AP AUDIO: Biden and Trump agree on debates in June and September, but working out details could be challenging" data-align-center="" data-module-number="4" data-main-module-number="4">

            The attack took place after an off-site government meeting in the central Slovak town of Handlova. The suspected gunman was among a small crowd of people waiting to greet the prime minister on the street outside the cultural center, where the meeting took place, local media reported.

            The country has seen weeks of largely peaceful protests over his coalition government’s controversial domestic reforms. The government is also trying to shut down public service broadcaster RTVS and plans to replace it with a new national broadcaster, which would be under tighter control of the government.

            In what was a stunning comeback for the controversial politician, Fico won a third term as Slovakian prime minister last October after running a campaign that criticized western support for Ukraine. As prime minister, he made a major U-turn in Slovakia’s foreign policy and its previously staunch support for Ukraine: Fico had pledged an immediate end to Slovak military support for Ukraine and promised to block Ukraine’s NATO ambitions.

            Ahead of the election, Fico made no secret of his sympathies towards the Kremlin and blamed “Ukrainian Nazis and fascists” for provoking Vladimir Putin into launching the invasion, repeating the false narrative Russia’s president has used to justify his invasion.

            Domestically, his coalition government is also pushing controversial reforms that have prompted weeks of large-scale peaceful protests. Attempts to overhaul the criminal justice system have been particularly controversial, as the government seeks to reduce penalties for corruption and has already abolished Slovakia’s special prosecutor’s office, which was tasked with investigating serious and politically sensitive corruption cases, including some that involved people connected to Fico and his party SMER (“Direction – Social Democracy”).

            “This ruling is a short-term win for Black voters in Louisiana, and, thus, Democrats, but a long-term expansion of a deeply controversial approach to how federal courts handle election-year voting cases – which is a big part of why the justices seem to all have ended up in unpredictable positions here,” said Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

            “Rather than wading in now, I would have let the District Court’s remedial process run its course before considering whether our emergency intervention was warranted,” Jackson wrote.

            “One of the biggest criticisms of Purcell is that it’s deeply subjective with regard to how close to an election federal courts should stay their hand,” Vladeck said. “Today’s ruling only compounds that critique, because it expressly applies it more than five months before an election without any explanation for why. That will make Purcell both broader and more malleable in lower courts going forward.”

Those voters argued their “personal dignity” was injured because the new map with two majority-Black districts “racially stigmatizes,” “racially stereotypes” and “racially maligns” them.

            Caught in the middle was a group of Black voters who felt the new map, while imperfect, was at least better than the one used in the 2022 midterm elections that included only a single majority-Black district. Two years ago, the Supreme Court allowed that map to be used in the midterm even though a lower court said it was likely illegal.

            The Black voters and Republican Louisiana officials both urged the Supreme Court to step in and pause the lower court proceedings – arguing the state needed an answer on which map to use by today. But the White voters said there was plenty of time for the state legislature or the lower court to draw a new map.

            “Our fight for a fair congressional map has carried on for years,” Michael McClanahan, president of the NAACP Louisiana State Conference, said in a statement Wednesday. “Today, we celebrate our communities’ opportunity to have a voice in this year’s elections, that can lead to the representation we need to make positive change in the years ahead. This is a day for hope.”

            The attorneys for the voters who challenged the map with the two Black-majority districts said they are confident they ultimately will prevail if the Supreme Court agrees to hear an appeal on the merits of the case.

            “The state of Louisiana enacted a brutal racial gerrymander that segregates its voters based on their race,” Edward Greim and Paul Hurd said in a joint statement. “As a result, their constituents may well vote in November 2024 districts segregated by race.”

                                        <p>KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Fresh from a day of delivering optimistic prognoses about how Ukraine would fare in the war with Russia despite gloomy news from the front lines, U.S. Secretary of State and amateur musician Antony Blinken may have thought he had the perfect upbeat song to perform with a Kyiv bar band on his fourth visit to the capital since the conflict began in 2022.</p><p>“I know this is a really, really difficult time,” <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/video/kyiv-ukraine-e89102243e964f62abe8361ddce57d8e">Blinken told a packed crowd</a></span> in the subterranean club Barman Dictat on Tuesday night.</p><p>“Your soldiers, your citizens, particularly in the northeast in Kharkiv, are suffering tremendously,” he said. “But they need to know, you need to know, the United States is with you, so much of the world is with you. And they’re fighting not just for a free Ukraine but for the free world, and the free world is with you, too.”</p><p>With those words and strumming a red guitar, Blinken and the local group 19.99 launched into Neil Young’s hit <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/video/kyiv-ukraine-e89102243e964f62abe8361ddce57d8e">“Rockin’ in the Free World,”</a></span> ostensibly to encourage Ukrainians to keep up the fight against Russia and hold to their Western aspirations, despite numerous battlefield setbacks that led President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a day later to cancel all his upcoming foreign trips.</p>
    

<p>With its refrain “Keep on rockin’ in the free world,” Young’s 1989 song sounds like it should be an homage to the glory of living in the West, uncompromised by communism or authoritarianism. In fact, as numerous social media critics noted, the tune is a lament about despair and misery caused by homelessness, drug addiction and poverty in the celebrated free world.</p>



<p>A charitable interpretation might be that Blinken chose to perform the song to underscore the importance of overcoming adversity by sticking to ones’ dreams of peace and freedom. After all, that had been the general theme of his remarks at events in Kyiv since his nearly pre-dawn arrival after an overnight train trip from Poland and it would continue to be on Wednesday.</p>
    
<p>“I’ve come to Ukraine with a message: You are not alone,” <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-blinken-us-military-aid-41df75260903f6b9527fbf3a1a44c815">Blinken had told an audience</a></span> of students and educators at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute shortly before taking to Barman Dictat’s basement stage.</p>
    

<p>“Never bet against Ukraine,” he said at a Wednesday news conference with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. </p><p>But as Blinken sang the “keep on rockin’ in the free world” chorus, which is repeated 12 times in the 4-minute 40-second song, Russian troops were advancing near and around Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, and Zelenskyy was in the process of deciding to put off a planned trip to Spain and Portugal later this week to deal with the crisis.</p><p>Thus, any intended musical encouragement — in both content and venue — left at least some observers scratching their heads.</p><p>Kyiv-based analyst Oleksandr Kraiev, director of the North America program at the Ukrainian Prism think tank, said Blinken’s visit was welcome but pointed out that he and many Ukrainians were puzzled by his two-day stay, including his stop at Barman Dictat, which was seen as inappropriate by some, given the current fraught wartime climate.</p>
    

<p>“From my point of view, and generally speaking from the point of view of common Ukrainians, it was not a very appropriate sign to go to the bar to have a small song with our band,” he said, noting that Ukrainian military recruitment officers are known to go to bars and nightclubs to check documents and catch draft dodgers.</p><p>“So (for the) secretary of state of the United States also to go to a bar, to have a small concert for people who are blamed for not enlisting in the Ukrainian army,” Kraiev said, “it’s not, let’s say, a catastrophe, it’s not a faux pas, but it’s something that is not very desirable from the point of view of common Ukrainians.”</p><p>U.S. officials with Blinken shrugged at the online criticism the secretary was receiving about his song choice and decision to sing at a bar. They also said he wouldn’t have done the event if he had thought it was inappropriate.</p><p>More broadly, the possible disconnect between the week’s battlefield developments and Blinken’s optimism was reflected in his activities and the size of his delegation.</p>
    

<p>Unlike on all of his three previous wartime trips to Kyiv, Blinken brought a full complement of staff and press with him. And while security was tight, he spent a good deal of time away from meetings with government officials, engaging with university students, civic leaders, local businesspeople and, of course, bar-goers. And, unlike on all of his previous visits except his last visit in September, he chose to spend the night in the city.</p><p>Yet, it may be “Rockin’ in the Free World,” its chorus and opening stanza — “There’s colors on the street; Red, white and blue; People shufflin’ their feet; People sleepin’ in their shoes; But there’s a warnin’ sign; on the road ahead; There’s a lot of people sayin’; we’d be better off dead.” — that the visit is remembered for.</p><p>As the band hit the opening notes, Blinken commented wryly: “I don’t know if we can pull this off.” And, then, according to the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-music-drop-by/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official State Department transcript</a></span>: “(Music was played.)”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Samya Kullab contributed.</p>

<h2>Text messages with Colin Albert</h2><p>Earlier in the day, Lally asked to submit text messages between Allie McCabe and Colin Albert as evidence. Defense attorney David Yannetti objected, leading to questioning without jurors present.</p><p>With jurors out of the room, Yannetti asked if Allie McCabe was aware it is possible to change time stamps on messages. She said she did not know that.</p><p>Judge Beverly Cannone allowed the text messages into evidence. With jurors back in the room, Lally displayed the messages. </p><p>At 11:54 p.m. on January 28, 2022, Colin Albert texted "U can get me now. If easier." Allie McCabe replied a minute later, saying "ok i am driving ppl home now." Colin Albert replied, "Word" followed by "Get me after." </p><p>At 12:10 a.m. on January 29, 2022, Allie McCabe messaged "here" and Colin Albert replied "Ok." Colin Albert said he came outside about 30 seconds later.</p><p>Lally then displayed photographs of Colin Albert that were taken about two weeks after O'Keefe's death.

<p>Julie Nagel had testified that initially she called her brother to come pick her up, but when he arrived in his friend's truck she told him she was going to stay a bit longer.</p><p>Ryan Nagel said that he and two friends arrived on Fairview Road around the same time as a black SUV. Read was driving a black Lexus SUV at the time of O'Keefe's death.</p><p>According to Ryan Nagel, he noticed the brake lights on the SUV, but not parking lights. He said he never saw anyone get out of the vehicle or go into the house.</p><p>Ryan Nagel testified that after his sister went back inside the home, the group pulled around the SUV and drove off.</p><p>He said he saw a woman behind the wheel with her hands on the steering wheel. </p><p>On cross-examination, defense attorney Alan Jackson asked the witness if he noticed any damage to the SUV.</p><p>"I mean I had been drinking, I wasn't looking for damage on her car. I just noticed brake lights," Ryan Nagel said, testifying earlier that he had 5-8 beers at a nearby bar before coming to the house.</p>

              </figcaption></figure><h2>Dog DNA expert takes stand</h2><p>Teri Kun from the University of California, Davis veterinary genetics lab, took the stand Wednesday morning. Prior to Kun taking the stand, Cannone warned jurors that sometimes witnesses must be called out of order due to their schedule.</p>

<p>Kun said her lab received two swabs to be tested related to Read's murder trial. </p><p>Read's defense attorneys have argued that during an alleged fight inside Brian Albert's home, O'Keefe was attacked by the family's dog Chloe. Brian Albert and his wife Nicole Albert testified that the German Shepherd mix was rehomed after an unrelated attack in May 2022.</p><p>According to Kun, the lab was asked to test the swabs to determine a species from the sample.</p><p>"We did not see any canine DNA," Kun said. </p><p>Kun said the samples did test positive for pig DNA, which she testified can come from food. Defense attorneys pointed out that pig DNA could also have come from dog treats.</p><p>On cross-examination, Jackson focused on the collection of the samples and the techniques used. Kun said she was not on hand when the samples were collected. </p><p>"I have no idea how the agency collected the swabs," Kun said.</p>

<p>Kun said that during one of the tests, dirt and blood can be inhibitors. </p><p>"Were you told in this instance that these swabs were taken from a garment with blood?" Jackson asked. </p><p>"No," Kun replied, answering follow-up questions saying that garment dye can also be an inhibitor. </p><h2>What has happened this week in the Karen Read case?</h2><p>On Tuesday, <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-murder-trial-day-11/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Julie Nagel</a></span>, a friend of Brian Albert Jr.'s took the stand. She testified that while leaving 34 Fairview Road, the home owned by her friend's father, she saw "something out of the ordinary … like a black blob on the ground." Julie Nagel said she saw the object in the area where O'Keefe's body was later found, but she didn't know what it was. </p><p>Julie Nagel was still on the stand when Tuesday's proceedings ended for the day. She returned to the stand briefly on Wednesday to complete her testimony.</p><p>Jackson said after court that it was a "made-up story."</p><p>"Their case is falling down around their feet. Every day it seems to crumble that much more," Jackson said.</p>

    <div><p>At Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, this year’s commencement ceremony brought a remarkable twist: The 136-year-old, historically Black public school was getting a $238 million gift. </p><div class="paywall paywallActive">



<p>But the money wasn’t coming from a wealthy captain of industry, a deep-pocketed philanthropist or even an alumnus. It wasn’t in the form of cash or publicly traded shares, but rather illiquid stock. </p>



<p>The man behind the gift was Gregory Gerami, 30, who the school initially described as a “champion of sustainable agriculture and biodegradable hemp products in Texas.” He had no prior connection to Florida A&amp;M and there was little public information to back his status as a multimillionaire able to write one of the largest philanthropic checks ever in higher education.  </p>



<p>Now, Florida A&amp;M is contending with questions about lax internal controls. The university, which initially backed the authenticity of the gift, is severing ties with Gerami, after putting the donation on hold. The board of trustees unanimously approved a third-party investigation into the issue during an emergency board meeting Wednesday afternoon.</p>



<p>“I wanted it to be real and ignored the warning signs along the way,” Florida A&amp;M President Larry Robinson said at the meeting. “The public announcement at commencement was premature and vast, and I apologize to all who witnessed it.”</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>Gerami didn’t respond to multiple messages and phone calls.</p>



<p>“This should not have happened,” said Deveron Gibbons, vice chair of the university’s board, who learned about the gift the morning of the graduation ceremony.</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>Shawnta Friday-Stroud resigned from the office of advancement, which handles the gifts the university receives, but remained as dean of its business school.</p>



<p>Gerami has also been tied to a $95 million pledge to Coastal Carolina University a few years ago, a deal that collapsed months after it was announced. CCU terminated that agreement, a university spokesperson said, without mentioning Gerami. The Myrtle Beach Sun News <a href="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/local/education/article276367116.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/local/education/article276367116.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">identified</a> him as the donor.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">HBCU Donations</h3>



<p>Florida A&amp;M, also known as FAMU, is one of the top-ranked historically Black colleges and universities in the country. The school traces its roots to October 1887, when a predecessor institution was formed thanks to state legislation that a Black lawmaker pushed for. Alumni include former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and movie producer Will Packer.</p>



<p>Based in Tallahassee and serving about 10,000 students, FAMU is one of about 100 HBCUs, a group that includes Howard University and Spelman College. </p>



<p>Spelman <a href="https://www.spelman.edu/about-us/news-and-events/news-releases/2024/01/18/spelman-college-receives-historic-%24100-million-donation" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.spelman.edu/about-us/news-and-events/news-releases/2024/01/18/spelman-college-receives-historic-%24100-million-donation" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">unveiled </a>a $100 million gift from a trustee in January, and HBCUs have also won support in recent years from wealthy donors such as MacKenzie Scott and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BX:US" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BX:US" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">Blackstone Inc.</a>’s Jon Gray. But many of the schools have been underfunded and major gifts remain rare. </p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>While the wealthiest Ivy League universities and flagship public schools boast investment portfolios in the tens of billions of dollars, the majority of HBCUs manage <a href="https://www.pgim.com/HBCU" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.pgim.com/HBCU" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">less than $100 million</a> in assets, if they have any endowment at all, according to PGIM. </p>



<p>“We are always working as hard as we can to make sure that there is a good donor base that we work with on a regular basis to help students get through their everyday lives and be successful,” Gibbons said. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Endowment Boost </h3>



<p>Gerami’s $238 million gift would nearly triple FAMU’s endowment, in what would be an act of charity comparable to the $300 million Ken Griffin doled out to Harvard last year. But there’s reason to ask whether FAMU will ever see the money.</p>



<p>In its statement, FAMU said Gerami deposited shareholdings into the university’s account last month, without saying what backed up the valuation of the assets. The school said the gift came from Gerami and a family trust that has him as a trustee.</p>



<p>At a board <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL3iC7vgMkE" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL3iC7vgMkE" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">meeting</a> last week of the FAMU Foundation, which serves as a custodian of donations to the school, the stocks were described as private illiquid investments issued by Batterson Farms Corp., a closely-held hemp company Gerami created in 2021. </p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>Over the course of the roughly two-hour <a href="https://fortune.com/company/zoom/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/zoom/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">Zoom</a> meeting, the university’s top brass acknowledged that it didn’t conduct an independent analysis of how much the shares were worth and cited the nondisclosure agreement in explaining why it hadn’t informed board members. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Texas Business</h3>



<p>Gerami <a href="https://www.battersonfarmscorp.com/about-us#GregoryBIO" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.battersonfarmscorp.com/about-us#GregoryBIO" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">describes himself</a> as a self-made businessman, “the youngest African American producer and seed seller” in the Texas industrial hemp industry. In an online company bio, he said he entered foster care at just 10 days old with fetal alcohol syndrome and a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. </p>



<p>A Texas producer’s license was issued for his hemp farming business, Batterson Farms, as of at least December 2023. The Texas Secretary of State’s website lists a small, single-story home in suburban San Antonio as the company’s address. </p>



<p>Gerami says his company has offices in San Antonio and Van Horn, Texas, a town of 2,000 people about 120 miles east of El Paso. At an impromptu press conference FAMU put together last week, he declined to answer questions on his net worth or to provide specific figures for his business.</p>



<p>Gerami claimed Batterson Farms employs 7,000 workers, including contractors. A <a href="https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">LinkedIn</a> search shows him as the sole employee. The firm’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/battfarmscorp?igsh=MWxnMnUwb2kwZnB6dw==" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.instagram.com/battfarmscorp?igsh=MWxnMnUwb2kwZnB6dw==" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-330a5589-0 gPJZJS">Instagram</a> account advertises jewelry and teas. </p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>Last year, Batterson Farms promised to build the largest commercial hydroponic hemp warehouse site in West Texas, in the city of Muleshoe. The project “has not come to fruition,” said City Manager Ramon Sanchez. </p>



<p>Tillery Timmons-Sims, a board member for the Texas Hemp Growers Association, said she isn’t familiar with Gerami’s business. She said the margins in the agriculture business are thin and the hemp industry is not known for creating major sources of wealth.</p>



<p>Chekesha Kidd, a board member at the FAMU Foundation, is advocating for broader reform. At the meeting last week, she argued in favor of revising the procedures involving gifts from major donors.</p>



<p>“We all believe and understand that there was positive intent here,” she said at the meeting. “But if that doesn’t signal that we need to take a step back and look at getting our own house in order, I don’t know what else does.”</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li><strong>Georgia's parliament passes "foreign agent" law</strong>: Georgia's parliament has passed a law that critics see as a threat to media freedom and a step towards the kind of draconian laws that have quashed political dissent in neighboring Russia.</li>
<li><strong>Protests against the law</strong>: Tens of thousands of protesters shut down a major intersection in Tbilisi on Tuesday, and protests continued outside the parliament, despite the parliamentarians backing the law.</li>
<li><strong>The law's impact</strong>: The law requires media, NGOs, and nonprofits to register as "pursuing the interests of a foreign power" if they receive more than 20% of funding from abroad, effectively silencing independent voices and restricting freedom of speech.</li>
<li><strong>President's veto</strong>: President Salome Zourabichvili has vowed to veto the law, but the ruling Georgian Dream party has a majority to override her veto.</li>
<li><strong>Protestors' resistance</strong>: Despite the passage of the law, the opposition promises to continue protesting against the law until it is repealed, emphasizing that it is a threat to democracy and freedom of speech in Georgia.</li>

    </p>
<p>The governing party says the law is necessary to stem what it deems as harmful foreign influence over Georgia's political scene and prevent unidentified foreign actors from trying to destabilize it.</p><p>The opposition denounces it as "the Russian law" because Moscow uses similar legislation to stigmatize independent news media and organizations critical of the Kremlin. Opposition lawmakers have accused the governing party of trying to drag Georgia into Russia's sphere of influence.</p><h2><strong><strong>What are Georgia's relations with Russia?</strong></strong></h2><p>Russia-Georgia relations have been strained and turbulent since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and Georgia's departure from its role as a Soviet republic.</p><p>In 2008, Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which had made a botched attempt to regain control over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Moscow then recognized South Ossetia and another separatist province, Abkhazia, as independent states and strengthened its military presence there. Most of the world still considers both regions to be parts of Georgia.</p>

<p>Tbilisi cut diplomatic ties with Moscow, and the two regions' status remains a key irritant even as Russia-Georgia relations have improved in recent years.</p><p>The opposition United National Movement accuses Georgian Dream, which was founded by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister and billionaire who made his fortune in Russia, of serving Moscow's interests — an accusation the governing party denies.</p><h2><strong><strong>What is the EU's position?</strong></strong></h2><p>EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell described the parliament's decision as "a very concerning development" and warned that "final adoption of this legislation would negatively impact Georgia's progress on its EU path." </p><p>Borrell earlier said the law was "not in line with EU core norms and values" and would limit the ability of media and civil society to operate freely.</p><p>European Council President Charles Michel said after the law was passed that "if they want to join the EU, they have to respect the fundamental principles of the rule of law and the democratic principles."</p>

It is the leadership's responsibility to do the right thing for the country at all costs."</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Mr Gallant said that the defence establishment, over which he presides, had presented a war plan to the cabinet as early as the night when Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza began last October. He said the plans included proposals “to establish a local, non-hostile Palestinian governing alternative.”</p><p id="dotcom-mpu_mid" class="dotcom-ad lazy" data-ad-slot="{}"></p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 esMqKN"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-83607862-1 ijYvQn"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/516b/live/1efa80d0-12ec-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/516b/live/1efa80d0-12ec-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/516b/live/1efa80d0-12ec-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/516b/live/1efa80d0-12ec-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/516b/live/1efa80d0-12ec-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/516b/live/1efa80d0-12ec-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/516b/live/1efa80d0-12ec-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/516b/live/1efa80d0-12ec-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Gallant speaking with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza earlier this month" class="sc-83607862-0 jvrVsN"><span class="sc-83607862-2 jPBxZH">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 cvIHve"><figcaption class="sc-d523993f-0 ibDkCb">Gallant met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza earlier this month</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">The day after Hamas, he said, would “only be achieved by Palestinian entities taking control of Gaza, accompanied by international actors.”</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">He said these proposals were never debated, nor were any alternatives presented.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Mr Gallant said the failure to set out a plan was leading Israel towards a “dangerous course” involving Israeli military and civilian rule over Gaza. </p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">He described that prospect as “a negative and dangerous option for the State of Israel strategically, militarily, and from a security standpoint.”</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">“I must reiterate: I will not agree to the establishment of Israeli military rule in Gaza.

<p>The notice said Amra is about 6 feet tall, has wavy brown hair, dark brown eyes and a beard.</p><p>The violence of the attack shocked France. Prison workers held moments of silence Wednesday outside prisons in Paris and elsewhere to commemorate the officers who were killed.</p><p>Darmanin, speaking Wednesday on RTL radio, expressed hope that Amra could be caught "in the coming days." Without giving full details about the extent of the manhunt, he said 450 officers had been deployed in the region of the attack in Normandy in northern France to search for the assailants and clues about their whereabouts.</p><p>"The means employed are considerable," he said. "We are progressing a lot."</p>

<p>The attack appeared to have been carefully prepared. The convoy was transporting Amra back to jail in the Normandy town of Évreux after a hearing with an investigator in Rouen when it was ambushed on the A154 freeway.</p><p>The prison van and another prison escort vehicle had just gone through a toll booth on the freeway when the van was rammed head-on by a car. The Paris prosecutor's office said the car had been stolen and had gone through the toll booth a few minutes ahead of the prison convoy and then waited there.</p><p>Another car followed behind the convoy, seemingly boxing it in. Assailants sprang from the cars and opened fire, spraying the prison vehicles, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said.</p><p>The assailants and Amra then fled. Two burned cars were subsequently found which investigators are examining, Beccuau said.</p><p>One of the officers killed was a 52-year-old captain in the prison service, where he had worked for nearly 30 years, and a father of two, Beccuau said. The other officer killed, aged 34, was a married father-to-be, she said.</p><p>Amra, 30, has a long criminal record, with at least 13 convictions for robbery and other crimes, the first when he was just 15, she said.</p><h2>Escaped convict has history of violent crime</h2><p>Amra has a long history of convictions for violent crimes that started when he was only 15, according to judicial sources.</p>
