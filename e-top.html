    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have agreed to hold two campaign debates in June and September, hosted by CNN and ABC respectively.</li>
<li>The debates are unprecedented in that neither Biden nor Trump will have formally accepted their party's nomination by the time of the first debate on June 27.</li>
<li>The debates were agreed upon after Biden's campaign announced that he would not participate in the fall presidential debates sponsored by the nonpartisan commission that has organized the debates for over three decades.</li>
<li>Biden and Trump have agreed to take part in the debates despite Trump's initial insistence that he would debate Biden at "anytime and anyplace". Biden had previously stated that his campaign would propose that media outlets directly organize the debates.</li>
<li>The swiftness with which the debates were agreed upon reflects the desire of both candidates to get the upper hand in the election, with Trump's team hoping to cast doubt on Biden's age and competence, while Biden's team believes Trump's rhetoric will highlight his own divisive nature.</li>

<p>“Trump says he’ll arrange his own transportation,” Biden wrote on X, working in a jab about the perks of incumbency. “I’ll bring my plane, too. I plan on keeping it for another four years.”</p>

<p>The presidential debates, always a critical moment on the political calendar, could be particularly important in a year when voters are underwhelmed with their choices and have expressed concerns about the candidates’ advanced ages — Biden is 81 and Trump 77.</p>
    
<p>Sprightly on social media, the rivals traded barbs — each claiming victory the last time they faced off in 2020.</p>
    

<p>“Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020, since then he hasn’t shown up for a debate,” Biden said in a post on X. “Now he’s acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal.”</p><p>Trump, for his part, said Biden was the “WORST debater I have ever faced - He can’t put two sentences together!”</p><p>The June debate is likely to cap a busy and unsettled stretch, following the likely conclusion of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-criminal-trial-hush-money-stormy-daniels-5fdc819697a76536ed83cbf28d4a523c">Trump’s criminal hush money trial in New York</a></span>, foreign trips by Biden to France and Italy, the end of the Supreme Court’s term, and the expected start of two criminal trials for the president’s son, Hunter Biden.</p><p>CNN said that its debate would be held at 9 p.m. ET in its Atlanta studios with no audience present in a break from recent precedent. Moderators will be anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, CNN said. ABC did not offer details on where its event would be held. Disagreements about moderators and rules were some of the questions that prompted the formation of the Commission on Presidential Debates in 1987.</p>
    

<p>The two campaigns and television networks had held weeks of informal talks on ways to circumvent the commission’s grip on presidential debates following years of complaints and perceived slights, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke about internal discussions on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Biden’s campaign had proposed excluding third-party candidates, such as <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/who-is-robert-f-kennedy-jr-rfk-097ac973a32ddf2e8e4edecd6a8f3153">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a></span>, from the debates outright. Under the debate commission’s rules, Kennedy or other third-party candidates could qualify if they secured ballot access sufficient to claim 270 Electoral Votes and polled at 15% or higher in a selection of national surveys.</p><p>Both CNN and ABC announced the same qualification threshold, saying candidates will need to reach at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet their standards.</p><p>In response, Kennedy accused Biden and Trump of “trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.” He said, “Keeping viable candidates off the debate stage undermines democracy.” </p>
    

<p>The debates will be the first televised general election match-ups to be hosted by individual networks. The 1960 debates, which helped show the power of the medium to influence public opinion, were hosted jointly by the leading networks of the day. Before the commission was formed in 1987, the presidential debates of 1976, 1980 and 1984 were organized by the League of Women Voters. </p><p>Plans for a vice presidential debate have yet to be announced. </p><p>Trump has been pushing for more and earlier debates, arguing voters should be able to see the two men face off well before early voting begins in September. He has even <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://youtu.be/hGDMG0MM6F4?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed a debate</a></span> outside the Manhattan courthouse where he is currently on trial. He also has been taunting Biden with an empty lectern at some of his rallies.</p>
    

<p>In a memorandum to Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon on Wednesday, Trump senior campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles challenged Biden to agree to at least two additional debates, suggesting one be held each month, with events in June, July, August and September, in addition to a vice presidential debate.</p><p>“Additional dates will allow voters to have maximum exposure to the records and future visions of each candidate,” they wrote.</p><p>Trump later posted on Truth Social that he had agreed to a third debate, this one hosted by Fox.</p><p>“Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that I hereby accept debating Crooked Joe Biden on FoxNews. The date will be Wednesday, October 2nd. The Hosts will be Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. Thank you, DJT!” he wrote.</p><p>O’Malley Dillon responded with a statement accusing Trump of having “a long history of playing games with debates: complaining about the rules, breaking those rules, pulling out at the last minute, or not showing up at all.”</p><p>“No more games. No more chaos, no more debate about debates. We’ll see Donald Trump on June 27th in Atlanta – if he shows up,” she wrote.</p><p>In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Wednesday morning, Trump had raised his own doubts about whether Biden would show, and offered his own suggestions. He said the debates “should go two hours” with both men standing, and he also pushed for larger venues.</p><p>“It’s just more exciting,” he said.</p><p>Biden’s campaign has long held a grudge against the nonpartisan commission, accusing it of failing to evenly apply its rules during the 2020 Biden-Trump matchups — most notably when it <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-donald-trump-joe-biden-health-campaigns-0f7315791a3ead1919842c894bedb68f">didn’t enforce its COVID-19 testing rules on Trump</a></span> and his entourage.</p><div class="AudioEnhancement" data-separate-event="audioModule" data-separate-value="AP AUDIO: Biden and Trump agree on debates in June and September, but working out details could be challenging" data-module="" data-gtm-region="AP AUDIO: Biden and Trump agree on debates in June and September, but working out details could be challenging" data-align-center="" data-module-number="4" data-main-module-number="4">

</div><p>O’Malley Dillon on Wednesday sent a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates to say that Biden’s campaign objected to its proposed debate dates in the fall, which would come after some Americans begin to vote, repeating a complaint also voiced by the Trump campaign. She also voiced frustrations over past rule violations and the commission’s insistence on holding the debates before a live audience. </p><p>“The debates should be conducted for the benefit of the American voters, watching on television and at home — not as entertainment for an in-person audience with raucous or disruptive partisans and donors,” she wrote.</p><p>There also was little love lost for the commission from Trump, who objected to technical issues at his first debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 and was upset when a 2020 debate with Biden was canceled after the Republican came down with COVID-19. The Republican National Committee had already promised not to work with the commission on the 2024 contests.</p><p>The Trump campaign issued a statement on May 1 that said of the debate schedule offered by the commission: “This is unacceptable.”</p><p>The commission said in a Wednesday statement, “The American public deserves substantive debates from the leading candidates for president and vice president.” It said its mission is “to ensure that such debates reliably take place and reach the widest television, radio and streaming audience.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow the AP’s coverage of the 2024 election at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024">https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024</a></span>.</p>

            Louisiana specifically asked the Supreme Court last week to rely on a legal doctrine <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/21/politics/purcell-election-supreme-court/index.html">known as the Purcell principle</a>, which it sometimes invokes to stay out of last-minute election lawsuits.

            “This ruling is a short-term win for Black voters in Louisiana, and, thus, Democrats, but a long-term expansion of a deeply controversial approach to how federal courts handle election-year voting cases – which is a big part of why the justices seem to all have ended up in unpredictable positions here,” said Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

<p>The collision caused a spill of vacuum gas oil, which can be used to make transportation fuels and other byproducts, according to the Galveston Office of Emergency Management.

<p>Colin Albert, a key witness in the controversial and closely-watched <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/tag/karen-read/">Karen Read</a> murder trial, took the stand Wednesday afternoon to testify about what he remembers about the events on the night that Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe died.</p>

<p>Albert is the son of Canton Select Board member Chris Albert and his wife Julie Albert, and the nephew of retired Boston Police Officer Brian Albert, who owned the home where O'Keefe was found on the morning on Jan. 29, 2022.</p>

<p>Read is charged with second-degree murder in the death of O'Keefe, her boyfriend. He was found in the snow outside retired Brian Albert's home in Canton. Prosecutors say Read hit O'Keefe with her SUV, while Read says she has been framed in a wide-ranging coverup, claiming the Albert family and the state's lead investigator, a family friend, put the blame on Read. </p>


<p>Read has pleaded not guilty and is free on bond.  </p>

<p>Here's a closer look at Wednesday's testimony:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Julie Nagel returns to the stand</h2>

<p>Nagel returned to the stand Wednesday morning, a day after testifying that she saw a black SUV outside the Albert home and a "black blob" on the lawn as she left the house on Jan. 29, 2022, the day of O'Keefe's death.</p>

<p>But she only wound up testifying for a few minutes, answering questions on redirect from Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally. She spoke again about the dark object she saw on the front lawn, again describing it as 5-6 feet long, and said she wasn't expecting to see anything in that part of the yard.</p>

<p>She said if she had realized the object was a body, she would have called 911 and told everyone else in the car as well.</p>

<p>Nagel said she only realized the next day that it might have been a body.</p>

<p>Defense attorney David Yannetti followed up by asking why, if Nagel realized that it might have been a body the next day, she didn't call 911 or police at that point. And she also acknowledged that her testimony Tuesday -- 2-1/2 years after she saw it -- was the first time she ever mentioned that the object she saw was 5-6 feet long.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Forensic scientist Teri Kun takes the stand</h2>

<p>Wednesday's second witness was Teri Kun, a forensic scientist with the University of California, Davis. She testified about how DNA samples are collected and stored and explained that she worked on the Read case. She also testified about a DNA sample that Lally said was taken from O'Keefe's shirt.</p>

<p>She said the only DNA result that was positive was for pig, and mentioned that could have come from food, like cooked bacon. There was no dog DNA on the samples she tested.</p>

<p>On cross-examination, defense attorney Alan Jackson asked if Kun got any clothing or other items to test, only the two swabs sent to her by Massachusetts State Police. Jackson said the quality of the testing is only as good as the swabs sent to her.</p>

<p>"I only have the swabs to test. That's the only thing I can talk about," Kun acknowledged. "It's dependent on the agency sending it in... I wasn't there to see the swabs being collected, so I have no idea."</p>

<p>Jackson also asked Kun if blood evidence should be stored in plastic cups, since previous police testimony had showed that frozen blood samples retrieved from the scene where O'Keefe was found were kept in red plastic Solo cups in a paper Stop &amp; Shop bag.</p>

<p>"Would you put biological material in plastic containers?" Jackson asked.</p>

<p>"No," Kun replied.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't use a Solo cup?" Jackson said.</p>

<p>"What?" Kun responded, before Lally objected.</p>

<p>Jackson also asked Kun if the pig DNA could have come from a dog treat, and Kun said that is possible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Ryan Nagel testifies</h2>

<p>The third witness of the day was Ryan Nagel, Julie's brother. Lally asked where Nagel was on Jan. 28, 2022. </p>

<p>Nagel said he went to C.F. McCarthy's bar in Canton with his now ex-girlfriend and another friend that night to meet up with his sister Julie.</p>

<p>Later that night, he said he was at the Hillside Pub in Canton when he got a text from his sister asking him to pick her up at the Albert home on Fairview Road.</p>

<p>He said his friend drove them to the Albert home, and while they were in front of the house he said he saw a black SUV pull up to the house. But he said he didn't see anyone get out of it at any point.</p>

<p>Nagel said he waited for his sister for a couple minutes, at which time she came out of the house from a side door near the garage, crossing the lawn on the way.</p>

<p>He said he opened the door of the truck to let his sister in. She invited the group into the house, but they declined because they had already been out for a long time and were ready to call it a night.</p>

<p>Julie Nagel told her brother that she wanted to stay a little longer, and she went back into the house. </p>

<p>Lally then asked Ryan Nagel about the black SUV again. Nagel said he noticed the brake lights were on, and saw the vehicle move up at one point. He said he didn't notice any damage on the vehicle.</p>

<p>As they left the home, Nagel said they drove around the black SUV and he saw a person in the vehicle.</p>

<p>"I observed that there was a person inside the car with a interior light on," he said. "They were in the driver's seat. It was a woman. She had long hair."</p>

<p>Nagel said it seemed like the woman was looking straight ahead with her hands at "10 and 2 on the steering wheel."</p>

<p>He said he didn't see anyone else in the vehicle at the time.</p>

<p>During cross-examination, Jackson established that Nagel had an interview with state police. During that interview, Nagel said he told investigators that two other people were in the truck with him on that night.</p>

<p>Jackson also asked about Nagel's sister, and when she came out the side door of the home. He also had Nagel go over the conversation with his sister, and her decision to ultimately stay at the house. Nagel said he watched his sister return to the house as the truck he was in pulled away from the house.</p>

<p>Jackson asked if all of the taillights on the black SUV he saw were intact.</p>

<p>Nagel said he did notice the brake lights were on, and he didn't notice any damage. But he also said he had had several drinks at that point. </p>

<p>Jackson also asked if Nagel noticed the SUV reverse and back up, and if he saw it hit a pedestrian, or if he saw anyone standing or lying on the lawn. Nagel said he did not.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Heather Maxon testifies</h2>

<p>The day's fourth witness was Heather Maxon, Ryan Nagel's ex-girlfriend. She was in the vehicle with Nagel when they went to the Alberts' home on Fairview Road on the night of Jan. 28, 2022.</p>

<p>She testified to many of the same details that Nagel had earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Maxon testified that as they approached the Albert home, they saw a black SUV in front of them with a female driving and a male in the passenger's seat. She is now the third person to testify about seeing the black SUV, but the first to say that she saw a man in the vehicle.</p>

<p>She also said that when they arrived at the Albert home, the black SUV was parked outside the house, just a couple feet in front of where they parked their vehicle. But she said she never saw anyone get out of the SUV.</p>

<p>When they left the house, Maxon said the black SUV was still in front of the house, and was running, with its exterior and interior lights on. She also testified that she saw a woman in the driver's seat of the SUV. She said she did not see anyone else in the vehicle.</p>

<p>After they left the house, Maxon said they went back to Ryan Nagel's house, where she spent the night. She said she didn't remember what time they arrived back at Nagel's residence.</p>

<p>Jackson then cross-examined Maxon about when she was first contacted by investigators in the Read case -- approximately 18 months after O'Keefe's death.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Richard "Ricky" D'Antuono testifies</h2>

<p>The next witness up was Richard "Ricky" D'Antuono. He was the driver of the truck that Ryan Nagel and Heather Maxon were riding in on the night on Jan. 28, 2022, when they went to the Albert house.</p>

<p>He also testified about the two Canton bars the trio went to that night before getting the call from Julie Nagel to come pick her up at the Albert home on Fairview Road.</p>

<p>D'Antuono said when he arrived at the Albert home, there was a black SUV parked about 10-20 yards in front of him. He said he observed no damage to the vehicle.</p>

<p>He said he never saw anyone get out of the vehicle or saw the vehicle move.</p>

<p>Under cross-examination, Yannetti asked if D'Antuono saw the black SUV strike anyone or if he heard anyone arguing. D'Antuono said he did not.</p>

<p>D'Antuono also said he was not interviewed by investigators until the following year. The first statement he gave in the case was about a year ago, on May 16, 2023, and it was not to the district attorney's office or state police who were investigating the Read case. He didn't say who interviewed him.</p>

<p>Yannetti appeared to be trying to show that by the time D'Antuono was interviewed, his recollection might not have been as fresh as if he were interviewed in the immediate aftermath of O'Keefe's death.</p>

<p>D'Antuono said he was focused on driving and he did not look inside the SUV as he drove away from the house to see who was inside. He also said he never saw anyone standing outside the SUV or sitting or lying on the lawn outside the vehicle.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Allison McCabe testifies</h2>

<p>Just before the lunch break, Allison McCabe, the daughter of Jennifer and Matthew McCabe, was called by the prosecution to testify.</p>

<p>She said she was a senior in high school on Jan. 28, 2022, and she had been out with friends that night when she received a call or a text around midnight from Colin Albert asking if she could pick him up at the Alberts' home on Fairview Road and drive him home. Allison McCabe said she and Colin Albert are close friends.</p>

<p>Brian and Nicole Albert are Allison McCabe's aunt and uncle, and Colin Albert is their nephew on Brian's side of the family.</p>

<p>Allison McCabe testified that she picked Colin Albert up at the Albert home on Fairview Road and dropped him off at his house before going to her own home.</p>

<p>Court adjourned for lunch around 12:50 p.m. and is expected to resume around 2 p.m.</p>

<p>After the lunch break, McCabe continued her testimony, telling Lally that she dropped Colin Albert off at his house about seven minutes away from Fairview Road and saw him go inside before she left. She returned to her house sometime before 12:30 p.m., and said her parents were not yet home.</p>

<p>She also testified that state police investigators at some point asked for the contents of her phone, including text messages between McCabe and Colin Albert on the evening of Jan. 28, 2022.</p>

<p>Lally entered a text exchange between McCabe and Colin Albert into evidence. </p>

<p>Two texts from Colin Albert sent at 11:54 p.m. on Jan. 28, 2022, said, "U can get me now. If easier."</p>

<p>"ok I am driving ppl home now," McCabe replied a minute later.</p>

<p>"Word. Get me after," Colin Albert said</p>

<p>"kk," McCabe replied, and then around 12:10 a.m. on Jan. 29, 2022 said "here."</p>

<p>Colin Albert then texted "OK."</p>

<p>Several photos were also entered into evidence from a party about two weeks later, on Feb. 11, 2022, at the home of Brian and Nicole Albert to celebrate a family member returning home from military service. One photo showed Colin and his aunt Nicole Albert and another showed Colin and someone else who is blacked out.</p>

<p>On cross-examination from Yannetti, Albert acknowledged that Colin Albert is "one of my best friends."</p>

<p>Yannetti also asked if the text exchange between McCabe and Colin Albert on Jan. 28 and 29, 2022, was ever requested by investigators in the Read case. McCabe said it was not, and she didn't turn over the screen shot until sometime during the summer of 2023, about a year and a half or more after O'Keefe's death. By that time, McCabe said she had already upgraded her phone.</p>

<p>The defense also presented McCabe with information from the Life360 app her family used showing that she had left her house in the early-morning hours on Jan. 29, 2022, and gone to Canton High School, though she had previously said she had returned home and stayed home. But McCabe said she didn't recall any of that.</p>

<p>While being questioned by Lally about the harassment she and her family have faced in connection with the Read case, McCabe became emotional, her eyes filling with tears.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Colin Albert testifies</h2>

<p>The next witness up was Colin Albert, the son of Chris and Julie Albert. He testified that he left his parents' home in Canton on the night of Jan. 28, 2022, and went to a friend's  house about 7-8 minutes away. While there, he said he drank several Bud Lights before getting a ride to his uncle Brian Albert's house on Fairview Road, where his cousin Brian Albert Jr. was celebrating his birthday with friends.</p>

<p>He said the mood in the house was "happy" when he arrived around 10:30 or 11 p.m. that night.</p>

<p>Albert said he stayed at the house for about 90 minutes, and then texted his friend Allison McCabe to get a ride home. When she arrived, he said he came out of the side door of the house and saw his uncle Brian Albert and aunt Nicole, who were arriving at the house.</p>

<p>"I just said, 'I'm going home. My mom wants me home. I love you guys, bye,'" Colin Albert said.</p>

<p>He said Allison McCabe drove him straight home, and when he arrived there, his parents and his brother were there. He said he told his parents he was home and then went to sleep.</p>

<p>Lally asked Colin Albert if he was familiar with O'Keefe. He said he knew him because his parents were friendly with him. He said he never had any animosity toward O'Keefe or had any arguments with him, describing him as a nice guy.</p>

<p>Colin Albert was also asked if he saw O'Keefe at his uncle's house on the night of Jan. 28, 2022, and he said he didn't.</p>

<p>He was also asked if he knew Read, and he said he knew of her, knew she was dating O'Keefe, and had seen her and waved to her on several occasions.</p>

<p>Colin Albert also acknowledged that at some point he was interviewed by state police, and provided them with a screenshot of a text communication between him and Allison McCabe. Lally then displayed the same text exchange shown during McCabe's previous testimony, where the two of them discussed McCabe picking Colin Albert up at the Fairview Road home. He also again showed the photos from the Feb. 11 party.</p>

<p>The final question from Lally focused on whether Colin Albert saw anyone else other than his aunt and uncle when he left the Fairview Road home on Jan. 28, 2022. He said he did not.</p>

<p>Court adjourned shortly before 4 p.m., and testimony is expected to pick up Thursday morning with the defense cross-examination of Colin Albert. Thursday will be a half-day of testimony.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The cargo ship Dali experienced two blackouts while moored in the Port of Baltimore before it collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge.</li>
<li>The blackouts occurred on March 25, and the ship's crew switched to a different transformer and set of breakers after the blackouts.</li>
<li>The new equipment was only installed the day before the ship left the port, and the head of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) suggested that the switch may have impacted the ship's operations.</li>
<li>The NTSB chair, Jennifer Homendy, testified before a congressional committee that switching breakers is not unusual, but may have affected the ship's operations the next day on the accident voyage.</li>
<li>The testimony provides additional context to the NTSB investigation into the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which occurred on March 26.</li>

            The cargo ship Dali experienced two blackouts while moored in the Port of Baltimore a day before its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/14/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-ntsb-report/index.html">catastrophic collision with the Francis Scott Key Bridge</a>, and efforts to resolve those blackouts may have impacted the ship’s operations, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said in a congressional hearing Wednesday.
    </p>

            After the two in-port blackouts on March 25, the ship’s crew switched to a different transformer and set of breakers from those that had been in use for several months, according to NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy. That may have impacted the ship’s operations when it left the port a day later, she said.
    </p>

            “Switching breakers is not unusual but may have affected operations the very next day on the accident voyage,” Homendy said.

            The comments, which add further context to the focus of the NTSB investigation, came during a hearing for the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure reviewing and analyzing the federal response to the collapse of the Key bridge on March 26.

            On Tuesday, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/14/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-ntsb-report/index.html">NTSB released a 24-page preliminary report</a> detailing investigators’ early factual findings. The Dali struck the bridge with enough force to bring down the 1.6-mile-long steel structure, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/27/us/baltimore-key-bridge-collapse-victims/index.html">killing six construction workers</a> on the bridge and severing access to critical shipping routes in and out of the Port of Baltimore.

            The report found the Dali was just three ships’ lengths from the bridge when it suffered a pair of catastrophic electrical failures, which caused several pumps required for the ship’s propeller and rudder to stop working. The emergency generator activated but was not configured to power the ship, the report said.
    </p>

            At Wednesday’s hearing, Homendy described the ship as “essentially drifting” before crashing into the bridge.

        <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> – Today, <strong>U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee</strong>, led the chairs of foreign affairs committees in the parliaments of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, the European Union, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom in issuing a statement following the Georgian parliament’s adoption of a Russian-style foreign agent law, which requires organizations that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from international sources to register as an “organization serving the interests of a foreign power.”<br><br>“Despite repeated expressions of concern from friends and allies, the Georgian parliament has taken an alarming and repressive step that undermines democracy and contradicts its stated goal of Western integration. As Euro-Atlantic legislators, we understand that a parliament’s role is to reflect the will of its people, and Georgians have unequivocally rejected this Kremlin-inspired law as incompatible with their identity, European values, and democratic principles. Simply put, this so-called ‘foreign agent’ law mirrors the policies of Vladimir Putin, who continues to illegally occupy 20 percent of Georgia’s territory.<br><br>“Respected Georgian organizations such as Transparency International (TI Georgia), the International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy (ISFED), and the Georgian Young Lawyers’ Association (GYLA), are playing pivotal roles in Georgia’s path towards Euro-Atlantic integration. This law flies in the face of such worthy efforts and serves as a direct assault on civil society and independent media— elements fundamental to any democracy. The United States and Europe will continue to support them as their leadership and vision for Georgia exemplify true patriotism, in stark contrast to the 84 members of Parliament who aligned themselves with Russia in yesterday’s vote.<br><br>“We will never abandon the Georgian people who have bravely displayed their steadfast commitment to democratic values through peaceful resistance, nor will we hesitate to hold accountable those responsible for enacting this Russian-style law and for the brutal targeting of nonviolent demonstrators, including by Bidzina Ivanishvili and his cronies. To the Georgian people, we declare: You are not alone.”</p>

            “This was a good report in the context of three hotter-than-expected [CPI] reports, and it makes it look like potentially those were bumps in the road rather than a really stagnant inflation environment,” Tyler Schipper, economics professor at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, told CNN in an interview.

            A closely watched underlying measurement of inflation showed even more progress. Core CPI, which strips out the more volatile categories of energy and food, slowed from 3.8% to 3.6%, its lowest rate since April 2021. From the month before, core CPI ticked up by 0.3%, its slowest pace since the end of last year.

            For those to leap higher at a time when goods prices are seeing disinflation (in some cases, outright deflation), could be a reflection of broader trade problems globally and a potential issue for consumers — and incumbents — later this year, Schipper said.

            The Federal Reserve has been wanting to see meaningful process on inflation before it starts trimming back interest rates. Those rates are at a 23-year high following an aggressive, yearslong rate-hiking campaign by the central bank to throw water on smoldering demand and tame decades-high inflation.

            “Potentially, that’s an indication of consumers getting tapped out,” Sedunov said. “At the end of the day, that retail softening is an indicator that maybe there’s going to be less pressure on prices in certain areas going forward, which could have a continuing moderating effect on inflation.”
