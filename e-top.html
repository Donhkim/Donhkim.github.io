            The decision to host Trump and Kennedy has brought outsize media attention to the Libertarian Party at a time when it has struggled to maintain its relevance. Four years after Johnson’s historic finish, the party’s candidate earned fewer than 2 million votes and wasn’t a factor in Biden’s victory.

<ol>
<li>Despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordering Israel to halt its military operation in Rafah, Israel has continued its attacks on the area.</li>
<li>The ICJ ruling cited the "immense risk" to over 1.4 million Palestinians taking shelter in Rafah, and ordered a halt to the offensive to alleviate a humanitarian crisis.</li>
<li>Since May 7, over 800,000 Palestinians have been forced to flee Rafah, and nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, with vast swaths of Gaza flattened by Israeli carpetbombing.</li>
<li>Israel has given no indication that it plans to change course, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticizing the ICJ ruling and calling charges of genocide brought by South Africa "false, outrageous and morally repugnant".</li>
<li>The UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories has called for sanctions against Israel, including an arms embargo and suspension of diplomatic relations, to pressure Israel to cease its assault on Gaza.</li>

<p>The Shaboura camp and areas close to the <a href="/news/2024/5/8/hospitals-in-south-gaza-running-out-of-fuel-who-warns">Kuwaiti Hospital</a> in Rafah on Saturday were targeted, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said. Several people who have been injured in the bombardment have been transferred to the hospital, he said.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 3 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>The hospital renewed its appeal for fuel deliveries “to ensure its continued operation”, saying it was the only one in <a href="/opinions/2024/5/16/the-evacuation-of-rafah-is-yet-another-form-of-israeli-torture">Rafah governorate</a> still receiving patients.</p>
<p>The ICJ ruling, the third of its kind this year, ordered Israel to halt its offensive, citing “immense risk” to some 1.4 million Palestinians taking shelter in Rafah, the southernmost part of Gaza. More than 800,000 Palestinians have been forced to flee Rafah since Israel launched the current offensive on May 7.</p>
<p>The UN’s top court seeks to rein in the mounting death toll of Palestinians since October, while also alleviating a continuing humanitarian crisis resulting from the internal displacement and severe hunger trailing most of Gaza’s 2.3 million people. Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed and vast swaths of Gaza have been flatted by Israeli carpetbombing.</p>
<p>Israel gave no indication it was preparing to change course, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticising the ICJ ruling, calling the charges of genocide brought by South Africa as “false, outrageous and morally repugnant”.</p>
<p>The UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories called on Saturday for sanctions against Israel for defying the court.</p>
<p>“Be sure: Israel will not stop this madness until WE make it stop. Member states must impose sanctions, arms embargo and suspend diplo[matic]/political relations with Israel till it ceases its assault,” Francesca Albanese posted on X.</p>
<h2 id="stepped-up-attacks-in-northern-gaza">Stepped up attacks in northern Gaza</h2>
<p>Israel also hit a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza’s as-Saftawi neighbourhood in Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to Al Jazeera journalists on the ground, citing medical sources.</p>
<p>The Palestinian news agency, Wafa, confirmed that at least 10 people were killed and 17 others injured in the series of attacks on the neighbourhood located just south of Jabalia.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>Israeli forces stepped up attacks on <a href="/news/2024/5/13/palestinians-flee-as-israeli-forces-re-enter-jabalia-in-northern-gaza">Jabalia camp</a> on Saturday, pushing already displaced people to flee the area anew.</p>
<p>Israeli warplanes also bombed a house located in another northern Gaza city of Beit Hanoon, killing 10 people, including women and children, according to Wafa.</p>
<p>In Gaza City, an Israeli attack targeting a family home in the Sabra neighbourhood, killed a woman and injured other people. An unspecified number of people were also reported killed by an Israeli air attack on a residential building in the Daraj neighbourhood, according to Wafa.</p>
<p>Other neighbourhoods of Gaza City, including Sheikh Ajlin, Tal al-Hawa and Zeitoun, also came under heavy artillery shelling, Wafa added, but there were no immediate details on casualties.</p>
<p>As casualties continue to mount in northern Gaza, Israeli troops continue to surround <a href="/news/2023/12/5/northern-gaza-hospital-overwhelmed-by-horror-as-israeli-army-lays-siege">Kamal Adwan Hospital</a>, according to Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, the head of the paediatrics department.</p>
<p>He said that the hospital is unable to treat incoming patients due to the continuous siege. Some patients and premature babies are still inside the hospital, he added.</p>
<p>Abu Safiya said he contacted the Red Cross and UNICEF, but did not get any assurance that anything would be done to end the Israeli siege of the hospital.</p>
<p>		</p>

<h2 id="deaths-in-wadi-gaza">Deaths in Wadi Gaza</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Israeli quadcopters also fired on Palestinians congregating in Wadi Gaza, killing at least six people, according to Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>Palestinians desperate for aid often gather in Wadi Gaza to try and reach aid trucks coming from the floating pier near Gaza City. Part of the floating pier built by the US has been washed away, according to videos shared on social media on Saturday.</p>
<p>Also in central Gaza, an Israeli air attack on an apartment building in the Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza killed at least four people.</p>
<p>Israeli troops also took over the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, further slowing sporadic deliveries of aid for Gaza’s 2.3 million people. Earlier this week, the UN refugee agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) announced it would suspend food distribution in Rafah, citing a lack of supplies and the lack of security in the densely populated city.</p>
<p>On Friday, UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said on social media site X that the situation had reached “a moment of clarity”.</p>
<p>“At a time when the people of Gaza are staring down famine … it is more critical than ever to heed the calls made over the last seven months: Release the hostages. Agree a ceasefire. End this nightmare.”</p>

<ol>
<li>The families of the 19 fourth-graders and 2 teachers killed in the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas, have filed two lawsuits against Instagram, the publisher of "Call of Duty" video game, and a manufacturer of semiautomatic rifles.</li>
<li>The lawsuits accuse the companies of "grooming" the 18-year-old gunman who committed the massacre, by regularly interacting with him leading up to the shooting and potentially perpetuating harmful content.</li>
<li>The gunman had purchased the AR-15-style rifle used in the shooting just days before the event, as soon as he was legally able to do so.</li>
<li>The lawsuits focus on the companies' alleged role in enabling the shooter's actions, rather than the police response, which has been criticized for its flaws in the aftermath of the shooting.</li>
<li>The lawsuits were filed on the second anniversary of the shooting, highlighting the ongoing impact of the tragedy on the families of the victims and the need for accountability from companies and individuals who may have contributed to the event.</li>

Parts of the affected area are only accessible via helicopter.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But a group of rescuers succeeded in reaching the region, humanitarian agency Care Australia said. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The landslide buried hundreds of homes in the highlands of Enga, in the north of the island nation in the south-west Pacific, at around 03:00 local time on Friday (17:00 GMT on Thursday).</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It remained unclear how many people were trapped under the rubble. The UN Resident Coordinator's Office in Papua New Guinea told the BBC that the local emergency response team had so far retrieved three bodies.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It added that the team had also provided emergency medical assistance to six survivors, including one child.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Up to 60 homes were completely destroyed, according to Care Australia. "At present, all the members of these households remain unaccounted for," it added.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There are nearly 4,000 people living in the area where the landslide occurred. But the agency warned that the number affected was "likely to be higher" because of an influx of people escaping tribal conflicts in neighbouring areas. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It added that other villages could also be at risk "if the landslide continues down the mountain". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Amos Akem, an Enga province MP, told the Guardian that based on reports from the ground, "the landslide buried more than 300 people and 1,182 houses".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He said rescue efforts had been hampered by a blocked road connecting the affected Yambali village and the capital.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There is only one highway into Enga Province. The landslide created debris up to 8m deep, affecting more than 200sqkm (77 sq miles) of land "including 150m of the main highway into Enga Province", Care Australia said.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">UN official Serhan Aktoprak told the AP news agency that the area affected by the landslide covered the size of three to four football fields.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Some houses in the village were spared by the landslide, Mr Aktoprak said, but "given the scale of the disaster" the death toll could reach over 100.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"

<p>“Our focus is on rescue operations and saving lives. We will ensure strict action is taken against the people who are responsible for this incident,” Mayor Nayana Pedhadiya said.</p>
<p>More than 300 people were in the two-storey structure at the TRP amusement and theme park when the blaze broke out as it was a holiday weekend, Rajkot fire officer Ilesh Kher told reporters.</p>
<p>“People got trapped as a temporary structure at the facility collapsed near the entrance, making it difficult for the people to come out,” he said.</p>
<p>“The flames spread rapidly because of its flammable material,” he added.</p>
<p>Television images showed a massive fire engulfing the TRP game zone and thick clouds of smoke emanating from the site. The entire structure was gutted in the blaze.</p>
<p>A police official at the local civil hospital said some of the bodies were also charred beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the district’s chief fire officer, IV Kher, said firefighters had almost brought the fire under control.</p>
