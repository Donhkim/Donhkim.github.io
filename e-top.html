                                        <p>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Hunter Biden’s daughter Naomi testified Friday in his federal gun trial about visiting her father while he was at a California rehab center, telling jurors that he seemed to be improving in the weeks before he bought the revolver in 2018.</p><p>“I hadn’t seen my dad in a long time, and I knew he was in a rehab facility there. He reached out,” she told jurors softly, explaining that they met at a coffee shop, along with his “sober coach.” As she was dismissed from the stand, she paused to hug her dad before leaving the courtroom.</p><p>The defense began calling witnesses shortly after federal prosecutors wrapped up their case. Hunter Biden’s attorney Abbe Lowell started by calling another gun store clerk who was there when the gun was purchased, raising questions about what he saw as inconsistencies on the form.</p><p>He also questioned the owner of the shop who allowed the sale to go through using Hunter’s passport, though it did not include an address as required.</p>
    

<p>Then he called Hunter’s daughter. In October 2018, the month Hunter Biden bought the gun, Naomi traveled from Washington to New York in her father’s truck to move her boyfriend’s belongings. Hunter drove Joe Biden’s Cadillac to New York later that month to retrieve his truck, leaving the Cadillac with Naomi. She told jurors she didn’t see any drug paraphernalia or evidence of drug use.</p>



<p>“He seemed great. He seemed hopeful,” she said.</p>
    
<p>But prosecutors showed Naomi texts where he didn’t respond to her for hours after she messaged him about switching cars. At 2 a.m., Hunter texted Naomi asking where the keys to his truck were and whether her boyfriend could meet and swap vehicles.</p><p>“Right now?” she responded.</p><p>“Do you know what your father was doing at two o’clock in the morning and why he was asking you for the car then?” prosecutor Leo Wise asked.</p><p>“No,” she said.</p><p>Wise read out to her a text message from the time, where she responded: “I’m really sorry dad I can’t take this.”</p>
    

<p>When court broke for lunch, and as Hunter Biden prepared to leave, he motioned to the first row that was full of his family members, including first lady Jill Biden, who traveled back from France for the proceedings. The first lady took Hunter’s hand and held it until they got to the door.</p><p>Jurors were sent home for the afternoon after the defense had no more witnesses, and Lowell said he was weighing who else to call, though previously he said the president’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-impeachment-james-biden-fbi-informant-b5116eb6d686750b75b944a12eed5a9e">brother James</a></span> would take the stand, and he was in court. The trial will resume Monday.</p><p>The week’s proceedings have been largely dedicated to highlighting the seriousness of Hunter Biden’s drug problem through highly personal testimony, all in an effort by prosecutors to prove that the president’s son lied on a mandatory gun-purchase form when he said he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs.</p><p>Jurors heard earlier in the week from Hunter Biden’s ex-wife and a former girlfriend who testified about his habitual crack use and their failed efforts to help him get clean. They saw images of the president’s son bare-chested and disheveled in a filthy room, and half-naked holding crack pipes. And they watched video of his crack cocaine weighed on a scale.</p>
    

<p>Prosecutors say the evidence is necessary to prove that Hunter, 54, was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied when he checked “no” on the form that asked whether he was “an unlawful user of, or addicted to” drugs.</p><p>Lowell has argued Hunter did not think of himself as an “addict” when he bought the gun and did not intend to deceive anyone.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Joe Biden worked to walk the line between president and father, telling ABC in an interview that he would accept the jury’s verdict and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-pardons-drug-crime-nonviolent-clemency-54e18f290702f510745178bc5abaf993">ruling out a pardon for his son</a></span>. Earlier this week, he issued a statement saying: “I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.” </p><p>Biden is in France this week for <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-dday-80th-anniversary-france-b868fe789d2fe95b776c24c17543b510">D-Day anniversary events.</a></span> Jill Biden, who attended court most of the week, will return to France for a state dinner.</p>
    

<p>Hunter Biden has been charged with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-gun-charge-investigation-e5c8ded90ea8c22d2e2e7cb09804b747">three felonies</a></span>: lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.</p><p>He has pleaded not guilty. He had hoped to resolve the gun case and another separate tax case in California with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-plea-deal-taxes-gun-drugs-690d38f1ffae4dfce2c171d21e7d3594">a plea deal last year</a></span>, the result of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings. The deal had him pleading guilty to lower-level charges that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. It fell apart after Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was appointed by Donald Trump, questioned unusual aspects of the proposed agreement, and the lawyers couldn’t resolve them. </p><p>Hunter Biden said he got charged because the Justice Department bowed to pressure from Republicans who argued the Democratic president’s son was getting special treatment, and who have escalated their attacks on the criminal justice system <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0">since Donald Trump’s recent conviction in New York City</a></span> in a hush money case. </p>
    

<p>It’s unclear yet whether Hunter Biden will testify. But jurors have already heard his voice. Prosecutors played lengthy audio excerpts in court of his <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-ukraine-firm-memoir-beautiful-things-40d98f7edf2e72f84ba2f12856327c5e">2021 memoir “Beautiful Things,” in which he wrote</a></span> about his lifelong addiction issues and spiraling descent after death of his brother Beau in 2015. The book, written after he got sober, covers the period he had the gun but doesn’t mention it specifically.</p><p>Lowell has said Hunter Biden’s state of mind was different when he wrote the book than when he purchased the gun, when he didn’t believe he had an addiction. He pointed out to jurors that some of the questions on the firearms transaction record are in the present tense, such as “are you an unlawful user of or addicted to” drugs.</p><p>And he’s suggested Hunter Biden might have felt he had a drinking problem at the time, but not a drug problem. Alcohol abuse doesn’t preclude a gun purchase.</p><p>The reason law enforcement raised any questions about the revolver is because Hallie Biden, Beau’s widow, found it unloaded in Hunter’s truck on Oct. 23, 2018, panicked and tossed it into a garbage can at Janssen’s Market, where a man inadvertently fished it out of the trash. She testified about the episode Thursday. </p><p>She eventually called the police. Officers retrieved the gun from the man who inadvertently took the gun along with other recyclables from the trash and retrieved it. The case was eventually closed because of lack of cooperation from Hunter Biden, who was considered the victim.</p><p>If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it’s unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.</p><p>He also faces a separate trial in September on <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-federal-tax-case-california-bb2e2eb41eb2cd30206a47c40ba6044e">charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes</a></span>.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Long reported from Washington. </p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow the AP’s coverage of Hunter Biden at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/hunter-biden">https://apnews.com/hub/hunter-biden</a></span>.</p>

<li>The US Coast Guard offloaded approximately 4,800 pounds of cocaine, worth over $63 million, in Florida on Thursday. The cocaine was seized during two operations off the coast of Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, in collaboration with the Royal Netherlands Navy.</li>

<li>The US Coast Guard and Dutch authorities suspended search efforts for the three suspected smugglers on Tuesday evening, with no reported injuries to the Dutch and US officers involved in the incident.</li>
<li>The cocaine seizure is the latest in a series of high-profile busts by the US Coast Guard, including a separate haul of $468 million worth of cocaine offloaded in San Diego just a week prior.</li>

mounting speculation that Israel may be considering launching a substantial operation against Hezbollah in the coming months, despite having been dissuaded by Washington from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/us/politics/biden-israel-hezbollah-war.html" data-link-name="in body link">a similar move at the beginning of the war against Hamas eight months ago</a>.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Tensions have increased notably in the past week as a procession of senior Israeli figures have visited the north of their country to talk up preparations for a war in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Lebanon</a> after images of widespread wildfires in the region sparked by Hezbollah fire.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The chief of the armed forces suggested “preparations” were complete and that a decision to launch an offensive might be imminent. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, warned of the possibility of an “intense campaign”.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The far-right security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has visited the largely deserted northern town of Kiryat Shmona <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/ben-gvir-calls-for-destroying-hezbollah-in-lebanon-amid-fires-in-northern-israel/3239860" data-link-name="in body link">to call for the “destruction of Hezbollah.”</a></p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">That the flurry of high-profile visits to the north may be more than political posturing was underlined by the announcement last week that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Israel</a> is once more increasing the cap on the number of reservists it can call up by an additional 50,000.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">What is clear amid all the speculation is that the situation on Israel’s northern front has rapidly become as problematic as Gaza, where the Israel Defense Forces have become bogged down.</p><figure id="40f264c8-2dca-43ef-88c8-597f672aee08" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":8,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"What is Hezbollah’s role and influence in Lebanon?","elementId":"40f264c8-2dca-43ef-88c8-597f672aee08","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/17/what-is-hezbollahs-role-and-influence-in-lebanon"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"display":0,"theme":0,"design":0}}' config='{"renderingTarget":"Web","darkModeAvailable":false,"updateLogoAdPartnerSwitch":true,"assetOrigin":"https://assets.guim.co.uk/"}' data-island-status="hydrated"></gu-island></figure><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">While Israel’s leaders went into the war determined to forge a new strategic hold over Gaza, the length of the conflict and IDF’s continuing failures against Hamas has imposed its own reality.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">In a grand irony of history, Israel – which has sought in various ways to create a security buffer zone in southern Lebanon since the 1980s either through war, occupation and diplomacy – has now woken up to the fact that since the war began Hezbollah has created a security zone of sorts in Israel’s north.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Tens of thousands of Israelis have quit the north, either under evacuation orders from the areas closest to the border or voluntarily from a wider area.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Some 40% of those who have left have wondered about a future in a region whose economy has been hard hit.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">While much of the focus of Israeli criticism of the government’s handling of the wider war has been on its inability to meet its professed war aims in Gaza, the situation in the north has come into increasingly sharp relief.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Israel has tried to manage the conflict on the northern border as contingent on the continued fighting in Gaza, but the sheer length of the conflict has created its own dynamics.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">While Israel’s strategic doctrine for the last decade envisaged fighting very short, intense and decisive wars against Hezbollah and Hamas, the current conflict has been neither short nor decisive.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Hezbollah considers the conflict thus far as a success, despite IDF claims to have inflicted damage on the Lebanese militant movement.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The militant group’s losses have been relatively low for the scale of the impact on Israel it has achieved. And while tens of thousands of Lebanese have been displaced from their side of the border, the political consequences have not been symmetric.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Equally worrying for Israel is that Hezbollah, long-regarded as an effective and highly adaptable military force, has been able to use the war to test and fine-tune its capabilities.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">In 2006, it used anti-tank missiles effectively against Israeli armour. In the current conflict Hezbollah has made increasingly effective use of small kamikaze drones, including twice in the last week, in ways that appear able to outsmart Israel’s extensive countermeasures on the border.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">All of this appears to have led to a growing realisation in the IDF and in Israel’s political leadership that they are being boxed into a long-term trap.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Short of a comprehensive negotiated deal over the northern border – which Hezbollah has said it is open to in the long run – the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/17/fears-grow-of-all-out-israel-hezbollah-war-as-fighting-escalates-lebanon" data-link-name="in body link">failure of a UN-mandated ceasefire agreement from 2006</a> that envisaged a pull-back by Hezbollah from the border, means that even if the war in Gaza were to stop the threat has been transformed in the north.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">In recent days the Israeli media, both left and right, has focused increasingly on the prospect of a war with Hezbollah: what that would look like and whether it is now inevitable.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“The focus on the southern theatre diverts attention from the truly troubling theatre – Lebanon,” wrote Yoav Limor in the rightwing Israel Hayom on Friday.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">In the leftwing Haaretz, the columnist Amos Harel offered an equally grim prognosis, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-06-07/ty-article/.premium/waning-intl-legitimacy-an-exhausted-army-and-war-in-lebanon-will-push-israel-to-the-edge/0000018f-ef1b-d3f3-a7ff-ff3b7db00000" data-link-name="in body link">warning that an “exhausted” Israel is on “brink of multi-dimensional failure”</a> even as it risks widening the conflict.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Israel is likely to find itself in a war without international legitimacy … without solid US support and with a burned out, weary army that is struggling to maintain orderly supplies of munitions and spare parts.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Whether the talk of widening war is real or not – or simply a distraction amid threats by the Israeli minister Benny Gantz to quit Netanyahu’s wartime coalition by the weekend and the unresolved ceasefire talks around Gaza – the risks, on the eight-month anniversary of Hamas’s 7 October attack – continue to increase.</p></div></div>

<p>The move had already caused anger and disbelief in Britain and represented another major miscalculation in Sunak's faltering election campaign.</p>

            Also in attendance was Labour leader Keir Starmer, who was filmed speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the event. Labour was quick to condemn Sunak’s decision to skip the events, and the gaffe dominated British news coverage of the election on Friday.

            Speaking to reporters on Friday, Sunak said that his leaving early was a “mistake,” but added that “it’s important though, given the enormity of the sacrifice made, that we don’t politicize this.”

            Sunak’s campaign began with a rain-soaked speech outside Downing Street and has been beset by questionable decision-making and optically damaging events, all while failing to shift a cavernous poll deficit – but Thursday’s D-Day error felt like the most perplexing and detrimental moment of the campaign so far.

            He was already batting back accusations from Labour that he lied about the cost of the opposition party’s tax plans – a topic in the debate he filmed with ITV on Thursday night. The UK Treasury flatly contradicted Sunak’s claim in a TV debate Tuesday that its impartial officials had calculated Labour plans would “put up everyone’s taxes by £2,000.” Labour’s policy manifesto has not yet been published, and the party says its agenda is fully costed.

            ITV News said its team had not specifically requested to speak to the prime minister on Thursday, and that the date was in fact put forward by Sunak’s team, despite it falling on the anniversary of D-Day.

            “Yesterday’s D-Day commemorations were about remembering the bravery of all those who serve our country,” Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s Shadow Paymaster General, said Friday<strong>﻿</strong>. “In choosing to prioritise his own vanity TV appearances over our veterans, Rishi Sunak has shown what is most important to him.”

            In recent days his efforts were dealt a further blow when Nigel Farage, an architect of Brexit and a populist thorn in the side of numerous Conservative leaders, announced he would lead the Reform Party’s campaign, directly appealing to right-leaning Tory backers to abandon Sunak and vote for his insurgent group.

            Farage also leapt on Sunak’s lapse in judgment, writing on X that the Prime Minister “could not even be bothered to attend the international event above Omaha Beach.” In another post, he added: “Patriotic people who love their country should not vote for him.”

svelte-urmhfi">Narendra Modi set a lofty goal for an election he hoped would send him to a legacy-defining third term as prime minister: winning a majority so staggering that his party would cement itself as the only plausible option to lead India for years to come.</p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi">To do that, his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., aimed to expand on its deep support across the so-called cow belt in India’s populous north, while also making significant inroads in the country’s south, which has been more resistant to the party’s Hindu-nationalist agenda.</p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi">But little went to plan for Mr. Modi when the election results arrived on Tuesday. His party did not just fall well short of its goal of winning more than 400 of the 543 parliamentary seats. It took such a steep dive — losing more than 60 seats — that it no longer had a majority in Parliament.</p><figure class="g-wrapper svelte-13ig1yh g-needs-margin-block" role="group">   </figure><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi">To stay in office, the powerful Mr. Modi is now forced to do something that does not come naturally to him: work with others, in a political coalition. That alliance, known as the National Democratic Alliance, or N.D.A., will face a reinvigorated political opposition, led by the Congress party, that significantly improved its performance since the previous election, in 2019.</p><figure class="g-wrapper svelte-13ig1yh g-needs-margin-block" role="group" aria-label="graphic"><div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline"><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><p class="g-wrapper_hed g-text-align-left svelte-1so50ue"><h3 class="g-heading svelte-1so50ue">Modi’s N.D.A. alliance lost swaths of territory in this election</h3> </p></div></div>   </figure><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi">The B.J.P.’s losses were sprinkled around the country, from Maharashtra in the west to West Bengal in the east. But Mr. Modi’s biggest setback came where it was least expected: the northern belt where his party was well entrenched and its Hindu-nationalist ideology had strong backing.</p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi">It appeared that some of Mr. Modi’s tactics had backfired in this region, perhaps because his party’s candidates there were seen as incumbents without much to offer after a decade in power. Those losses were offset in part however by gains in stretches of the south, where the B.J.P. — as a new entrant that has had little footprint there in the past — found better reception to its messages.</p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi">In Uttar Pradesh, India’s largest state, with a population of 240 million, the B.J.P. won just 33 seats, down from 62 in the previous election. It was in this Northern state that Mr. Modi in January inaugurated the lavish Ram temple, seen as one of his biggest offerings to his Hindu support base. But the B.J.P.’s chest-thumping over its Hindu-first policies turned off many lower-caste voters more concerned with issues like unemployment, inflation and social justice.</p><figure class="g-wrapper svelte-13ig1yh g-needs-margin-block" role="group">   </figure><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi">One of the biggest surprises was in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/03/world/india-election-results#modis-party-may-lose-ayodhya-where-he-opened-a-giant-hindu-temple">the city of Ayodhya</a>, the site of the Ram temple. The B.J.P. lost the seat in the city and other seats in its neighboring districts.</p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi">In the important state of Maharashtra, home to India’s business and entertainment capital, Mumbai, the B.J.P. won only nine seats, down from 23 in the last election. The party’s coalition partners suffered even worse losses.</p><figure class="g-wrapper svelte-13ig1yh g-needs-margin-block" role="group">   </figure><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi">The vote was seen as a verdict on the B.J.P.’s heavy-handed ways of reshaping the state’s political map. The B.J.P. had used pressure by government agencies and enticements of cash and power to split both of the state’s two largest parties. A faction within each of the two split parties then aligned with the B.J.P. The move backfired, however: In what was viewed as a sympathy vote, the original factions from the two parties outdid the B.J.P. allies by large margins.</p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi">The B.J.P. did have some good news: It continued to expand its support in the south, where it has struggled to establish a lasting foothold. It won a seat for the first time in the left-dominated state of Kerala and several seats in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/03/world/india-election-results#modis-party-tried-to-woo-more-voters-in-indias-south-with-mixed-results">state</a> of Telangana.</p><figure class="g-wrapper svelte-13ig1yh g-needs-margin-block" role="group" aria-label="graphic"><div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-1jrfrvl g-margin-inline"><div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-1jrfrvl"><p class="g-wrapper_hed g-text-align-left svelte-1so50ue"><h3 class="g-heading svelte-1so50ue">N.D.A. alliance gained territory in the east and south</h3> </p></div></div>   </figure><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi">The party’s most impressive gains came in the state of Odisha in the east. That state is part of the “tribal belt,” which weaves across central India and is the only part of the country where the B.J.P. has unified support. Its relatively poor communities have been skillfully targeted by the B.J.P.’s Hindu-first politics and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/world/asia/india-welfare-modi.html">welfare benefits</a>.</p><p class="g-text svelte-urmhfi">But the party’s progress in eastern and southern India was far from enough to make up for its losses in the north. Now, with Mr. Modi deprived of the landslide victory he had sought, the country will see how he responds. Some of the strains in India’s democracy might be mended as Mr. Modi is forced to consult with coalition partners who could restrain his more authoritarian tendencies. Or he could crack down more fiercely than ever, worried about losing more ground to a revived opposition.</p> <p id="svelte-announcer" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></p></div>
