    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on Donald Trump as he enters court for another day of Michael Cohen’s testimony.</p>
    
</div>
    

<p>Prosecutors have tried to blunt the defense attacks on their star witness by getting him to acknowledge at the outset his past crimes, including a guilty plea for <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-d08fc20ad50f432886351beaff7bfc7e">lying to Congress</a></span> about work he did on a Trump real estate deal in Russia.</p><p>But the cross-examination underscored the risk of prosecutors’ reliance on Cohen, who was peppered repeatedly with questions about his criminal history and past lies. Cohen also testified that he lied under oath when he pleaded guilty to federal charges, including tax fraud, in 2018.</p>



<p>“It was a lie? Correct?” Blanche asked Cohen about whether he lied to the late U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III at a court hearing about not feeling pressured into pleading guilty.</p><p>“Correct,” Cohen said.</p><p>The defense also attacked Cohen’s motivations and elicited testimony designed to support the defense’s argument that the Daniels deal was essentially a shakedown of Trump, rather than a plot to keep voters in the dark. Cohen acknowledged telling a former prosecutor that he felt Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump in seeking the $130,000 payment to keep quiet about her claim of a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.</p>
    

<p>“Yes, I recall making a statement like that … that they were extorting Mr. Trump,” Cohen told jurors.</p><p>He’s by far prosecutors’ most important witness, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-cohen-hush-money-stormy-daniels-735aadfd1ce015e05ba955c203a96f1b">placing Trump directly at the center</a></span> of the alleged scheme to silence women who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies the women’s claims. Cohen told jurors that Trump promised to reimburse him for the money he fronted and was constantly updated about behind-the-scenes efforts to bury potentially detrimental stories.</p><p>Cohen also matters because the reimbursements he received form the basis of 34 felony counts charging Trump with falsifying business records. Prosecutors say the reimbursements were logged, falsely, as legal expenses to conceal the payments’ true purpose.</p><p>Trump, who insists the prosecution is an effort to damage his campaign to reclaim the White House, says the payments to Cohen were properly categorized as legal expenses because Cohen was a lawyer. The defense has suggested that he was trying to protect his family, not his campaign, by squelching what he says were false, scurrilous claims.</p>
    

<p>“The crime is that they’re doing this case,” Trump told reporters Thursday before entering the courtroom, flanked by a group of congressional allies that included <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/matt-gaetz-donald-trump-proud-boys-daed52f145929eefc8deaf2bfee32e47">Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.;</a></span> Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.; and Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., the chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus.</p><p>The hard-right Republican lawmakers stood outside the courthouse and railed against a “kangaroo court” and the case, amplifying the former president’s attacks on the judicial system as they were heckled but also cheered by the crowd. The former president has been joined at the courthouse in recent days by a slew of conservative supporters, including some considered potential vice presidential picks and others angling for future administration roles.</p>
    

<p>Among those at the courthouse Thursday were Republican members of the House Oversight Committee, which delayed a hearing on an <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-robert-hur-classified-documents-justice-department-edf67af3810ab877c7c195956b49b3a6">effort to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress</a></span> so the lawmakers could appear alongside Trump in Manhattan.</p><p>Blanche confronted Cohen with profane social media posts, a podcast and books he wrote about the former president, getting Cohen to acknowledge that he has made millions of dollars off slamming Trump.

            Abbott’s decision comes after the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted unanimously Thursday to recommend a full pardon and the restoration of firearm rights for Perry, who was sentenced last year to 25 years in prison. Shortly after he was pardoned, Perry was released from Texas Department of Criminal Justice custody, a spokesperson for the agency told CNN.

            Abbott asked the board to conduct an investigation in April 2023, and <a href="https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/bpp/Sgt_Perry_PR.pdf" target="_blank">in a statement on Thursday</a>, the board said its “investigative efforts encompassed a meticulous review of pertinent documents, from police reports to court records, witness statements, and interviews with individuals linked to the case.”

            Perry faced between five and 99 years in prison for fatally shooting 28-year-old Air Force veteran Garrett Foster at an Austin, Texas, racial justice rally two months after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

            Shortly after Perry’s conviction in April 2023, Abbott said he wanted to pardon Perry and issued an unusual request for the state Board of Pardons and Paroles to expedite a review of the case before a sentence was handed down.
    </p>

            “Among the voluminous files reviewed by the Board, they considered information provided by the Travis County District Attorney, the full investigative report on Daniel Perry, plus a review of all the testimony provided at trial,” Abbott said in a statement.

            “Texas has one of the strongest ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws of self-defense that cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive District Attorney. I thank the Board for its thorough investigation, and I approve their pardon recommendation,” Abbott said.
    </p>

            Doug O’Connell, an attorney for Perry, said in a statement his client is “thrilled” to be free and thanked Abbott and the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole.

            “I spoke with Daniel this afternoon. He is thrilled and elated to be free. Daniel is also optimistic for his future,” O’Connell said in a statement obtained by CNN. “He wishes that this tragic event never happened and wishes he never had to defend himself against Mr. Foster’s unlawful actions. At the same time, Daniel recognizes that the Foster family is grieving. We are anxious to see Daniel reunited with his family and loved ones.”

            Prosecutors said Perry, who was stationed at Fort Hood, initiated the fatal encounter when he ran a red light and drove his vehicle into a crowd gathered at the protest. Foster was openly carrying an assault-style rifle – legal in Texas – and approached Perry’s car and motioned for him to lower his window, at which point Perry fatally shot him with a handgun, prosecutors said.

            “Today, a convicted murderer will walk the streets of Texas. Texas Republicans have once again proven that they cannot keep the public safe, they are not the party of ‘tough on crime,’ and they are not the party of ‘law and order,’” Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement responding to the pardon.

            “He has made us all less safe. Daniel Perry texted his friends about plans to murder a protestor he disagreed with,” she said. “After a lengthy trial, with an abundance of evidence, 12 impartial Texans determined he that he carried out that plan, and murdered the love of my life.”

            “With this pardon, the Governor has desecrated the life of a murdered Texan, impugned that jury’s just verdict, and declared that citizens can be killed with impunity as long as they hold political views that are different from those in power,” Mitchell said.

            During Perry’s sentencing hearing last May, the prosecution asked that he be sentenced to at least 25 years in prison. They highlighted a stream of racist and inflammatory social media posts Perry wrote prior to the shooting and the defense’s own analysis of his mental disorders and mindset.

            The family had pursued a civil case against Perry but dropped the case after he was convicted last year, satisfied with the jury “holding him accountable,” Brogdon said, adding the family will be considering any possible legal avenues but the prospects are “grim.”

            “It’s hard to believe that the issuance of this pardon does not have some kind of political motivation,” Brogdon said, citing Abbott’s involvement in the case after conservative commentators criticized Perry’s conviction last year.

<li><strong>Major victory for Biden administration and Democrats</strong>: The ruling is seen as a major victory for the Biden administration and Democrats, who have championed the CFPB as a tool to protect consumers from financial abuses.</li>

A second vote was scheduled for later Thursday with the House oversight committee. But the timing of any action by the full House, and the willingness of the U.S. attorney’s office to act on the referral, remained uncertain. </p><p>“The department has a legal obligation to turn over the requested materials pursuant to the subpoena,” Rep. Jim Jordan, the GOP chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said during the hearing. “Attorney General Garland’s willful refusal to comply with our subpoena constitutes contempt of Congress.”</p>
    

<p>The rapid sequence of events Thursday further inflamed tensions between House Republicans and the Justice Department, setting the stage for another round of bitter fighting between the two branches of government that seemed nearly certain to spill over into court. </p>



<p>If House Republicans’ efforts against Garland are successful, he will become the third attorney general to be held in contempt of Congress. The White House slammed Republicans in a letter earlier Thursday, dismissing their efforts to obtain the audio as purely political. </p>
    
<p>“The absence of a legitimate need for the audio recordings lays bare your likely goal — to chop them up, distort them, and use them for partisan political purposes,” White House counsel Ed Siskel wrote in a scathing letter to House Republicans ahead of scheduled votes by the two House committees to refer Garland to the Justice Department for <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-classified-documents-congress-garland-contempt-7db112d63dd1e8159593c32981caa85d">the contempt charges.</a></span></p>
    

<p>“Demanding such sensitive and constitutionally-protected law enforcement materials from the Executive Branch because you want to manipulate them for potential political gain is inappropriate,” Siskel added.</p><p>Garland separately advised Biden in a letter made public Thursday that the audio falls within the scope of executive privilege, which protects a president’s ability to obtain candid counsel from his advisers without fear of immediate public disclosure and to protect confidential communications relating to official responsibilities.</p><p>The attorney general told reporters that the Justice Department has gone to extraordinary lengths to provide information to the committees about special counsel Robert Hur’s investigation, including a transcript of Biden’s interview with Hur. But, Garland said, releasing the audio could jeopardize future sensitive and high-profile investigations. Officials have suggested handing over the tape could make future witnesses concerned about cooperating with investigators.</p><div class="AudioEnhancement" data-separate-event="audioModule" data-separate-value="AP AUDIO: White House blocks release of Biden’s special counsel interview audio, says GOP is being political" data-module="" data-gtm-region="AP AUDIO: White House blocks release of Biden’s special counsel interview audio, says GOP is being political" data-align-center="" data-module-number="3" data-main-module-number="3">

    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">Speaking with reporters, Attorney General Merrick Garland says the audio from President Biden’s special counsel interview that Republicans have requested will not be released.</p>
    
</div><p>“There have been a series of unprecedented and frankly unfounded attacks on the Justice Department,” Garland said. “This request, this effort to use contempt as a method of obtaining our sensitive law enforcement files is just most recent.” </p>
    

<p>The Justice Department warned Congress that a contempt effort would create “unnecessary and unwarranted conflict,” with Assistant Attorney General Carlos Uriarte saying, “It is the longstanding position of the executive branch held by administrations of both parties that an official who asserts the president’s claim of executive privilege cannot be held in contempt of Congress.”</p><p>Siskel’s letter to lawmakers comes after <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-hur-garland-classified-documents-836b99fe9cbef9ba7d32602f4928efec">the uproar from Biden’s aides</a></span> and allies over <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/joe-biden-special-counsel-report">Hur’s comments about</a></span> Biden’s age and mental acuity, and it highlights concerns in a difficult election year over how potentially embarrassing moments from the lengthy interview could be exacerbated by the release, or selective release, of the audio. </p><p>Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson slammed the White House’s move, accusing Biden of suppressing the tape because he’s afraid to have voters hear it during an election year.</p>
    

<p>“The American people will not be able to hear why prosecutors felt the President of the United States was, in Special Counsel Robert Hur’s own words, an ‘elderly man with a poor memory,’ and thus shouldn’t be charged,” Johnson said the during a press conference on the House steps.</p><p>House Democrats defended Biden’s rationale during the back-to-back hearings on Thursday, citing the massive trove of documents and witnesses who have been made available to Republicans as part of their more than yearlong probe into Biden and his family. </p><p>Rep. Jerry Nadler, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said on Thursday that Republicans want to make it seem like they’ve uncovered wrongdoing by the Justice Department.</p><p>“In reality, the Attorney General and DOJ have been fully responsive to this committee in every way that might be material to their long dead impeachment inquiry,” the New York lawmaker said. “Sometimes, they have been too responsive, in my opinion, given the obvious bad faith of the MAGA majority.”</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico was the target of an assassination attempt on May 15, leaving him in a stable but serious condition. The suspect has been arrested, but a motive has not been determined.</li>
<li>The attack is significant not only for Slovakia but also for the European Union, given the rarity of such violent attacks on high-level politicians in Western Europe.</li>
<li>Fico, a centre-left politician, has been accused of populism and nationalism, and his party, Smer, has been criticized for its rightward drift. His government has also been accused of being pro-Russian and anti-Ukrainian.</li>
<li>Russian media outlets have seized on the opportunity to accuse Ukraine of being behind the assassination attempt, but there is no evidence to support these claims, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has personally condemned the attack.</li>
<li>The attack is likely to have domestic and regional implications, including increased tensions in Slovakia and potentially affecting the country's political landscape.</li>

    <p>The assassination attempt on Slovakian prime minister <a href="https://theconversation.com/who-is-robert-fico-slovakias-controversial-prime-minister-in-stable-but-serious-condition-after-assassination-attempt-230219">Robert Fico</a> on May 15 has sent a shockwave through Europe. Unfortunately political assassinations are not unheard of in this part of the world – indeed, Slovakia itself continues to reverberate from the 2018 assassination of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak, an act which led to the collapse of a previous Fico-led government.</p>

<p>However, attacks of this manner on politicians are rare (outside of post-Soviet countries). There has not been an attack on a figure as high-level as Fico in several decades. The suspect in the shooting has been arrested, but it remains far too early to speculate about a possible motive. With that said, it is virtually certain that this will have a massive impact on Slovak, and even European Union, politics.</p>

<p>Even before the events of May 15, the political atmosphere in Slovakia has been quite fraught. Fico and his Smer party have largely dominated the political scene in the country since the 2000s. Before his current term, which began in 2023, he led the government from 2006 to 2010, and from 2012 to 2018.</p>

<p>Fico is ostensibly a centre-left politician. But in many ways his populist and nationalist politics more closely resemble those of Viktor Orbán, the far-right authoritarian prime minister of Hungary. Smer is a member of the Party of European Socialists in the European Parliament but its membership was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/european-socialists-suspent-robert-fico-smer-hlas-party/">suspended</a> in late 2023 because of its rightward drift.</p><p class="slot clear" data-id="17"></p>

<p>Notably (again alike Orbán), Fico is considered one of the most pro-Russian political leaders in Europe. He ran his 2023 election campaign on a platform of ending Slovakia’s financial and military support for Ukraine.</p>

<p>Russian media outlets have immediately seized on this to accuse Ukraine of masterminding the assassination attempt against Fico. Margarita Simonyan, the editor of RT, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/05/15/slovakia-prime-minister-robert-fico-shot/">claimed Ukraine “should be blamed”</a> for the shooting. Importantly, no evidence has currently been uncovered linking Ukraine to the attack. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has <a href="https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1790749897022472677">personally condemned the attack</a> and expressed his hope for Fico’s recovery – and solidarity with the people of Slovakia.</p>

<p>There are both domestic and regional implications in the wake of this attack. For Slovakia, it is likely that tensions in the country will be ratcheted up. Election campaigns have increasingly been fought in charged environments since the first time Fico came to power in 2006 in a coalition with two illiberal and nationalist parties, the Slovak National Party and the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.</p>

<p>This was particularly the case in the 2023 elections, where the alignment of Slovakia on the Russia-Ukraine War was a principal concern. In a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/700966318/Eurobarometer-Standard-100-Autumn-2023-factsheet-SK-en-1">Eurobarometer</a> survey around that time, the war was rated as the most important issue facing the country, but with nearly 50-50 splits in support for either providing or opposing assistance to Ukraine.</p>

<p>This polarisation has already begun to play out in the way politicians – both on the side of the government and in opposition – have responded to the attempted assassination.</p>

<p>Interior minister Matúš Šutaj-Eštok alleged that the attack was clearly “politically motivated” and that the country stood on the brink of “civil war”. Worryingly, in a country with a recent history of violence towards journalists, both Šutaj-Eštok and his colleague <a href="https://www.icij.org/news/2024/05/are-you-satisfied-now-slovak-politicians-blame-media-for-assassination-attempt-on-pm/">Lubos Blaha</a> have blamed the country’s “liberal media” for sowing “hatred”.</p>

<figure class="align-center ">
            
            <figcaption>
              <span class="caption">Interior minister Matus Sutaj Estok and defence minister Robert Kalinak hold a press conference at the hospital where Fico is being treated.</span>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Given these comments, and the parlous state of media freedom throughout the Visegrad region – which contains the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – it would not be surprising to see some form of crackdown.</p>

<p>Before the attack, Fico was already rolling out plans to place the Slovak national broadcaster under governmental control, sparking protests from the public. There will also rightly be concerns about the potential for Slovak democracy to come under pressure. Again, here, Fico had been engaged in a war of words with the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/threat-judge-journalist-slovakia-spiral-eastward-robert-fico/">nation’s supreme court</a> before the attack, and had warned that he was monitoring the body closely. </p>

<p>Outside of Slovakia, the attack is very likely to become another front in the ongoing information war between Russia on one side and the EU and Ukraine on the other.</p>

<p>The truth or accuracy of Russia’s accusations about Ukraine involvement may effectively prove to be irrelevant. In the contemporary atmosphere, disinformation has been proven to be stubbornly difficult to challenge and rebut.</p>

<p>Coming as it does amidst both a major Russian offensive in the east of Ukraine and the campaigns for European Parliament elections, the attack on Fico has the potential to add a greater sense of instability to an already contentious environment.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Labour's election pledges</strong>: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has outlined six key policies that the party would implement first if it wins the general election. These policies aim to deliver "economic stability", improve the NHS, and provide clean energy.</li>
<li><strong>Six "first steps"</strong>: The six policies are billed as "first steps" towards Labour's bigger plans. They include sticking to tough spending rules, setting up a publicly owned clean energy company, and cutting NHS waiting lists.</li>
<li><strong>Economic stability</strong>: One of the key policies is to stick to tough spending rules to deliver economic stability. This means that Labour would aim to balance the budget and reduce borrowing.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare reform</strong>: Another key policy is to provide 40,000 more hospital appointments each week to cut NHS waiting lists. This is intended to improve healthcare services and reduce waiting times for patients.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term plans</strong>: While the "first steps" policies are focused on the short-term, Labour's long-term plans include making the UK the fastest-growing major economy by the end of a first term in government and achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2030.</li>
