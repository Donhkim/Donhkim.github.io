<ol>
<li>President Joe Biden has defied calls from critics in his own party to exit the 2024 presidential race, instead pivoting to warnings about a second Donald Trump term and vowing to continue running for reelection.</li>
<li>Biden spoke to a raucous crowd in Detroit, where he thanked supporters for making him the nominee and emphasized his commitment to finishing his term, despite pressure from lawmakers, donors, and the electorate.</li>
<li>Biden's speech also focused on criticizing Trump's policy agenda, which he described as a "far-right" and "expansive" plan, and highlighted his own proposals for the first 100 days of his second term.</li>
<li>The president's team has been working to convince skeptical voters and party leaders that he is still capable of being president at the age of 81, with a series of campaign events, interviews, and a rare solo news conference.</li>
<li>Despite these efforts, the angst within the party about Biden's candidacy and his prospects against Trump in November remains, with some critics continuing to call for him to step aside and make way for a different candidate.</li>

Biden lambasted an <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-project-2025-biden-9d372469033d23e1e3aef5cf0470a2e6">expansive far-right policy agenda</a></span> crafted by conservative think tanks that Trump has scrambled to distance himself from, while ticking off several items on his own wish list for the first 100 days of his second term. </p><p>At the same school where, four years ago, then-candidate Biden positioned himself as a bridge to the next generation of Democratic leaders, the embattled president, who has been under pressure for more than two weeks to step aside, made it clear he was going nowhere. </p>
    

<p>“You made me the nominee, no one else — not the press, not the pundits, not the insiders, not donors,” Biden said, to cheers. “You, the voters. You decided. No one else. And I’m not going anywhere.” </p>



<p>The show of force from Biden at the evening rally was part of his team’s relentless sprint to convince fretting lawmakers, nervous donors and a skeptical electorate that at the age of 81, he is still capable of being president. But a spate of travel to battleground states, interviews with journalists and a rare <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-president-trump-election-2024-democrats-9e1781a17b3313f525ef70f8a00c310a">solo news conference</a></span> have done little to tamp down the angst within the party about Biden’s candidacy and his prospects against Trump in November. </p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know about the 2024 Election Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020.

</div>
<p>So far, one Democratic senator and roughly 20 House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to step aside. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has indicated Biden still has a decision to make on whether to run. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-house-democrats-withdraw-42b672357eec827b5cd2f97c03cf3e7d">House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries</a></span> told Democrats he had met privately with Biden after the news conference, sharing the “full breadth” of views from lawmakers about the path forward in the president’s campaign for reelection.</p>
    
<p>But the support Biden retains among Democrats was clear among the hundreds of supporters at the rally, who waved signs that read “Motown is Joetown” and enthusiastically cheered the president’s remarks — and jeered at any mention of Trump. </p>
    

<p>“He inherited millions of dollars only to squander it. He’s filed for bankruptcy six times,” Biden said. “He even went bankrupt running a casino. I didn’t think that was even possible. Doesn’t the house always win in a casino?”</p><p>He also singled out Project 2025, a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-conservatives-trump-heritage-857eb794e505f1c6710eb03fd5b58981">massive proposed overhaul</a></span> of the federal government drafted by longtime allies and former officials in the Trump administration that Trump has insisted he knows “nothing” of. </p><p>“You heard about it? It’s a blueprint for a second Trump term that every American should read and understand,” Biden said, accusing his opponent of trying to distance himself from the plan “just like he’s trying to distance himself from overturning Roe vs. Wade because he knows how toxic it is. But we’re not gonna let that happen.” </p>
    

<p>Biden’s campaign has indirectly acknowledged that Biden’s route to the White House is narrowing, saying the so-called “blue wall” of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania is now the “clearest pathway” to victory even while insisting other battleground states like Arizona and Nevada are not out of reach.</p><p>That strategy is reflected in how Biden is redoubling his efforts in the Midwestern states, hitting Detroit nearly one week after he campaigned in Madison, Wisconsin; Philadelphia; and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Rallying enthusiasm in Detroit and among its sizable Black population could prove decisive for Biden’s chances of winning Michigan, which Biden reclaimed in 2020 after Trump won it four years prior by just over 10,000 votes. </p><p>Campaign aides underscored the enthusiasm for Biden after his news conference at the conclusion of this week’s NATO summit. Communications director Michael Tyler said donations “exploded” during Thursday night’s session with reporters, describing it as a sign that support for the president remains strong “across our coalition.”</p>
    

<p>“We have close to 40,000 donations last night alone,” Tyler told reporters traveling to Detroit with Biden. He said the donations came in at a clip that was seven times the average.</p><p>And South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, one of the president’s most influential allies, said in an NBC interview Friday morning that chatter about whether Biden should stay in the race needs to stop: “He’s earned that right.”</p><p>But at a critical juncture when Biden needs to consolidate support, key Democratic leaders in the state were notably absent at Friday’s event. </p><p>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is co-chair of Biden’s campaign, was out of the state. Sens. Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow, and Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who is vying for Michigan’s open Senate seat, were also absent. United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, whom Biden actively courted during last year’s strikes and who met with him and other union leaders Wednesday, was traveling for a conference. </p>
    

<p>Rep. Hillary Scholten, who is seeking reelection in a battleground district in western Michigan, joined a growing list of national Democrats who have called on Biden to step aside. </p><p>Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, one of the more prominent Democratic leaders appearing with Biden on Friday, refused to say whether she believed Biden should still be the party’s presidential nominee.</p><p>“I’m just focused on making sure people know what’s at stake this year. And know how to exercise their vote,” Benson said when asked whether she still believed he should be the nominee.</p><p>But in a swing state that he won by close to 3 percentage points in 2020, Biden continues to command support. Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, Rep. Haley Stevens, Rep. Shri Thanedar and AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler accompanied Biden on Air Force One from Washington to Detroit, in Biden’s fourth trip to the state this year. Also attending was Academy Award-winning actress Octavia Spencer. And over a dozen Detroit-area state lawmakers signed onto a joint letter Thursday “to express our unwavering support” for Biden.</p><p>As she waited for Biden to arrive at the evening rally, Donna Harper, 71, said she was disappointed by his debate performance, but encouraged by his Thursday press conference. </p><p>“Let him just be Joe,” she said. “And I saw more of that last night.”</p><p>In his return to Michigan, Biden aimed to reignite the energy felt in March 2020 when appearing at Detroit’s Renaissance High School. During that appearance, Biden had locked hands with Harris, Whitmer and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker.</p><p>“I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,” Biden said. “There’s an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.”</p><p>In 2016, Trump won Michigan by a thin margin attributed in part to reduced turnout in predominantly Black areas like Detroit’s Wayne County, where Hillary Clinton received far fewer votes than Barack Obama did in previous elections.</p><p>Biden reclaimed much of that support four years ago, when he defeated Trump in Michigan by a 154,000-vote margin, but he has work to do. Detroit, which holds a population that is nearly 78% Black, saw a 12% turnout in the Feb. 27 primary, almost half that of the 23% total turnout in the state.</p><p>Key parts of Biden’s coalition in Michigan are also upset with him over Israel’s offensive following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. Michigan holds the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the nation, contributing to over 100,000 people voting “Uncommitted” in Michigan’s Democratic primary in February.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Cappelletti reported from Lansing, Michigan, and Kim reported from Washington.

            Rudy Giuliani is no longer entitled to<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/rudy-giuliani-bankruptcy/index.html"> bankruptcy protection</a>, a judge decided Friday, making it possible for creditors to immediately pursue his assets within days.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyj3a7ua00003b6ks8dasiu7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The former mayor of New York sought bankruptcy protection after a jury awarded two Georgia election workers $148 million because <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/15/politics/rudy-giuliani-verdict-pay-defamed-election-workers/index.html">Giuliani defamed them</a> after the 2020 election. The judge’s decision Friday, to end his bankruptcy, paves the way for Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, as well as other creditors, who are trying to collect on the more than $150 million Giuliani owes.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyj3gumc00083b6k1ca0tazq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Judge Sean Lane of the federal bankruptcy court in New York made the decision partly because of Giuliani’s lack of transparency after he filed for bankruptcy more than six months ago.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyj3gx9h000a3b6ky657lyo5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Lane highlighted in his 22-page opinion that Giuliani hadn’t provided any insight whatsoever into the books of companies he solely owns, and that have taken in thousands of dollars in wire transfers in recent weeks. The judge also said Giuliani hasn’t been fully transparent with his creditors – such as by not fully explaining on time an upcoming book contract he has, or keeping his personal earnings from a radio show and podcast coming into one of the corporate accounts.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyj3gx9h000b3b6kqjq3ui5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “Mr. Giuliani has failed to provide an accurate and complete picture of his financial affairs in the six months that this case has been pending,” Lane wrote in his decision Friday. “The lack of financial transparency is particularly troubling given concerns that Mr. Giuliani has engaged in self-dealing and that he has potential conflicts of interest that would hamper the administration of his bankruptcy case.”
    </p>

            Giuliani – once Time magazine’s Person of the Year and a fixture in New York society – says he is now worth about $10.6 million, with nearly all of that wealth in the value of two apartments he owns, in New York City and in Palm Beach, Florida.
    </p>

            In a statement provided by a spokesman, Giuliani cast himself Friday as a man being punished for his role in politics in recent years.
    </p>

            “We will continue to pursue justice and we are confident that—in the long run—our system of justice will be restored and the mayor will be totally vindicated,” Giuliani’s spokesman Ted Goodman said in the statement.
    </p>

            Giuliani’s attorneys have indicated he plans to appeal the defamation jury verdict in favor of Moss and Freeman and that he may fight them in state court on any liens they seek.
    </p>

            In addition to the $6 million, three-bedroom co-op apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and the $3.5 million condo on the Intracoastal Waterway in Florida, Giuliani’s creditors will also be able to try to seize his bank accounts, a Mercedes-Benz sports car, his collection of 26 luxury watches, three World Series championship rings for the New York Yankees, and other baseball memorabilia, like a signed Joe DiMaggio shirt he claims to own.
    </p>

            The worth of those other assets is unclear, as creditors accuse Giuliani of downplaying or not disclosing complete estimates of the value of what he owns. The creditors believe one World Series ring alone would sell for nearly $30,000, according to court filings in his bankruptcy case.
    </p>

            Giuliani also says in bankruptcy filings that the state of California owes him more than $10,000 related to overpaid taxes from his appearance on the TV singing game show “The Masked Singer,” according to bankruptcy filings.
    </p>

            Giuliani also said in filings in recent weeks that he expects to be paid tens of thousands of dollars from various ventures: coffee beans being marketed with his name and image, and a documentary that’s been in the works for years.
    </p>

            The court decision on Friday, announced by Lane in White Plains, New York, marks a long, slow decline for Giuliani, largely related to his work as a lawyer for former President Donald Trump after the 2020 election.

He is also fighting criminal charges in Arizona and Georgia related to Trump’s efforts to undermine his electoral loss. Giuliani has pleaded not guilty in both cases.

            Giuliani agreed to end his bankruptcy proceedings, after Freeman and Moss suggested that approach earlier this week. They and other creditors had become furious with the lack of transparency he provided into his assets.

            The creditors argued to the judge in recent days that Giuliani was exploiting the bankruptcy system to avoid having to pay his debts, and was acting in bad faith. That accusation prompted outbursts from Giuliani in court, claiming he was the one being defamed.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit in Washington has been overshadowed by the shadow of former US President Donald Trump, who was a Nato-sceptic.</li>
<li>Current US President Joe Biden has attempted to project a message of unity among the 32 member countries, but Trump's views have added an element of urgency and anxiety to the conversations.</li>
<li>Trump's Nato-scepticism has left a lasting impact, with one Eastern European diplomat commenting that "Trump hangs over every conversation here."</li>
<li>The article suggests that the diplomatic relationships at the summit feel fragile at times, with leaders struggling to balance their public displays of unity with the concerns and doubts raised by Trump's actions.</li>
<li>The meeting of the world's most powerful military alliance is trying to find ways to "Trump-proof" their alliance, but it remains unclear whether it is possible to fully mitigate the impact of Trump's unpredictable behavior on global politics.</li>

Trump “hangs over every conversation here", said one Eastern European diplomat who asked to remain nameless. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Republican's election as president in November "could change everything”, the diplomat said. The fact that Mr Biden has been trying to fend off a political crisis over his frailty has only sharpened the sense that a second Trump term could bring far-reaching changes to an alliance forged in the ashes of the World War Two and still reliant on hard US military power to deter adversaries.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">So does Nato need to “Trump-proof” itself - as some describe it -  and if so, is it possible? </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There is a lot of evidence of efforts by Nato allies to reach out already to those in  Trump’s political orbit to try to manage relationships and limit what they would see as the potential damage of a second term. But others suggest something more unmanageable.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Camille Grand, a French former official who was one of Nato’s deputy leaders throughout the Trump administration, described himself as “much more worried” than colleagues who think a second term may be “Trump [term] one on steroids” but ultimately workable for the alliance. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“He doesn't have the same sort of guardrails, he doesn't have the same sort of adults in the room. And he has around him a team that is trying to turn his instinct into policy,” said Mr Grand, who is now a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Four members of visiting delegations, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC their concern was not necessarily that a Trump administration would withdraw entirely from Nato, as he has threatened before.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Rather it is a fear that the US commitment to the alliance's core principle of collective security - "all for one and one for all", meaning any ally under attack can expect defence from the others - could wane.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Trump’s positions on Nato have veered erratically from outright hostility - portraying the alliance as a bunch of freeloading Europeans surviving off protection paid for by US taxpayers - to suggesting his outbursts are simply part of a cunning negotiating tactic to compel more of Nato’s members to meet its defence spending targets. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He has frequently tried to rally crowds of supporters with attacks on the organisation. As the summit began, he posted to his Truth Social network that when he started as president most Nato members were “delinquent” until they “paid up” due to his pressure. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"></p></div><figure><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">The Ukraine war was the big topic at the summit</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">By the end of Trump’s presidency, four more Nato countries had hit the alliance’s guidelines of spending at least 2% of national income on defence. So far during President Biden’s term, another 13 countries have reached the target.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">That progress is frequently touted by the Biden administration and its backers, although in reality much of the increase was triggered by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">At a February campaign rally in South Carolina, Trump said he would let Russia “do whatever the hell they want” to Nato countries that did not spend enough. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">That sparked outrage from some quarters in Washington, but privately his threats are said to have gone further. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">At a panel event in January,  European Union commissioner Thierry Breton  described a meeting he had attended in 2020 between Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“Donald Trump said to Ursula: ‘You need to understand that if Europe is under attack, we will never come to help you and to support you. And by the way, Nato is dead. And we will leave, we will quit Nato.’ </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"It was the president of the United States of America,” recalled Mr Breton. “He may come back."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"></p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"></p></div><figure></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"></p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Trump’s campaign has been approached by the BBC with a request to confirm whether the account was accurate. Evelyn Farkas, a former senior official at the Pentagon in the Obama administration, believes there remains a real concern even over Nato’s existence under Mr Trump. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“I think there is a danger with Trump that he tries to pull us out of Nato. I won't sugarcoat that,” said Dr Farkas, now executive director at public policy think tank the McCain Institute. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“The reality is Trump is dangerous to the alliance in that America is still the strongest economic, political, military power and Nato is stronger if Nato has the United States inside the alliance."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But one of those familiar with the thinking in Trump’s political orbit, Dan Caldwell from the right-wing think tank Defence Priorities, believes the former president's priority is to push European nations to invest more in their own militaries.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"> “I don't think he wants to withdraw from Nato, but he has said that the United States should re-evaluate its role and the purpose of Nato going forward,” he said. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“Not only the former president but more and more national security experts on the right believe the United States has really no choice but to do less in Europe. So I think that there's some larger forces at play, that will eventually force the next president, regardless of who it is… to substantially pull back from Nato."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The most detailed account of policy positions that might influence a second Trump term comes from an initiative being brought up by supporters and detractors of Trump alike. Overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation, “Project 2025” is a 900-page detailed blueprint for a Republican president to usher in a sweeping overhaul of the executive branch. </p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dOZXmm"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-13b8515c-1 bbjeKz"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0bf2/live/4b570680-405f-11ef-96a8-e710c6bfc866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0bf2/live/4b570680-405f-11ef-96a8-e710c6bfc866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0bf2/live/4b570680-405f-11ef-96a8-e710c6bfc866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0bf2/live/4b570680-405f-11ef-96a8-e710c6bfc866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0bf2/live/4b570680-405f-11ef-96a8-e710c6bfc866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0bf2/live/4b570680-405f-11ef-96a8-e710c6bfc866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0bf2/live/4b570680-405f-11ef-96a8-e710c6bfc866.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0bf2/live/4b570680-405f-11ef-96a8-e710c6bfc866.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Presidents Trump and Xi in 2017" class="sc-13b8515c-0 hbOWRP"><span class="sc-13b8515c-2 iuvLSH">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Trump sees China as the greatest threat to US</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The initiative says a future president should “transform Nato” so that America’s role is primarily for its nuclear deterrent, while other members should field “the great majority” of conventional forces required to deter Russia. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">This is in keeping with the project’s foreign policy position, seeing the main threat to US primacy as China and therefore calling for the next president to “bring resolution to the foreign policy tensions” sparked by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Trump himself has equivocated over the war but has said he would end it in “24 hours”. He favours brokering a deal between Russia and Ukraine on terms that many Nato allies would see as surrender for Kyiv. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Trump has partially disavowed Project 2025, saying he does not know who is behind it but many of his former officials had a hand in writing it, including a former acting defense secretary. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Since Trump left office, the increase in the number of Nato members spending at least 2% of their income on defence has better insulated the alliance for the future, said Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Asked about "Trump-proofing", he said Congress had also moved to shield America's membership of Nato from the whims of the White House, in a law passed last year. “We clarified no president can unilaterally withdraw from Nato without a vote of approval from the Senate,” Mr Coons told the BBC. </p></div><figure></figure><p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dKljgB"><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">More on the US election</h2></p><figure></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He also highlighted the $60bn military assistance package for Ukraine finally passed in April in a bipartisan effort following nine months of paralysis, after allies of Trump blocked passage of the bill through Congress. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"It is my hope that we will continue to be a counterweight and a counterbalance to the president should we, I think, make the tragic mistake of moving forward with a second Trump term.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But Trump has repeatedly challenged current levels of US military provision for Ukraine, again arguing he could negotiate the war’s end with Russia. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Another possible attempt to future-proof US support for Ukraine is by moving more co-ordination for arms supply to Nato itself - taking it further out of reach of a future American president. Such a move has been pitched by Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg as a way to "shield" Ukraine's supply of aid “against the winds of political change", officials told The Financial Times. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">At the summit the alliance agreed to launch a new program in which Nato will supplement, but not replace, a 50-nation “contact group” that co-ordinates delivery of weapons. Camille Grand, the former Nato official, thinks the summit may have “raised the cost” for a future President Trump to roll back the "messaging” from Nato, but in the end, he said, Trump-proofing was impossible. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“If the US, as the biggest shareholder in the alliance, decides to be tough on the alliance, on Ukraine, there is no nothing in the [summit agreement] and previous summits that prevent it from doing that. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“But I think it's sending an important message to Trump and his team, which is that the Europeans have turned the corner when it comes to [increased] spending.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský reiterated that, telling me that any future president of the US that wanted to change things on Nato had the power to do so. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The real work of “Trump-proofing” at this summit has instead felt like Nato supporters pitching the alliance to conservative Americans to try to change their view. This found its most striking moment when President Zelensky appeared at the Reagan Institute for an on-stage conversation with Fox News host Bret Baier. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Zelensky repeatedly raised the memory of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan, quoting Cold War lines on deterring enemies through working with allies.  </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Reagan is a favoured reference for Democrats trying to expose Republican divisions and what they see as the maverick isolationism of Trump. The subtext is: Reagan would turn in his grave at Trump’s Nato-sceptic stance. But it's a message that may fall flat with those who Mr Zelensky thinks need to hear it.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><i id="additional-reporting-by-bernd-debusmann-jr-from-the-nato-summit." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog">Additional reporting by Bernd Debusmann Jr from the Nato summit.</i></p></div></article></div>

<p>Hours after his campaign issued a new strategy memo announcing a renewed focus on three pivotal Midwestern states — the so-called “Blue Wall” that has long been must-win for Democrats — one of the campaign’s field organizers in Wisconsin quit.</p><p>The lower-level staffer’s departure, announced during an internal staff conference call Thursday, was attributed directly to post-debate frustration, according to two people familiar with the matter granted anonymity to share details of the private discussion. A Biden campaign spokesperson confirmed the staff departure.</p><p>While one person leaving a campaign of more than 1,000 people isn’t proof of a larger exodus, other signs of trouble continued to pop up. </p><p>One lawmaker, Rep. Mike Levin of California, told Biden directly on Friday that he should step down in a virtual call hosted for members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting. </p>
    

<p>The call began with Biden soliciting feedback on how to appeal to the Hispanic vote and what campaign events he should join over the next few months. When the call was opened to questions, Levin raised his hand to give Biden a talk about his Southern California district, with voters telling him that the president should not be on top of the party’s ticket for 2024. </p><p>Levin, according to two of the people, then encouraged the president to listen to those constituents and step down.</p><p>“I have deep respect for President Biden’s five-plus decades of public service and incredible appreciation for the work we’ve done together these last three and a half years,” the lawmaker said in a statement. “But I believe the time has come for President Biden to pass the torch.”</p><p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued a letter to his caucus on Friday describing a private meeting he had the night before with Biden. Notably, he did not include any endorsement of the president in the brief letter.</p>
    

<p>“In my conversation with President Biden, I directly expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward that the caucus has shared in our recent time together,” Jeffries wrote.</p><p>A private debate is playing out among the party’s donor class in particular, which is far from united on whether Vice President Kamala Harris should inherit the nomination should Biden ultimately step aside, according to conversations with more than a half-dozen donors granted anonymity to discuss private conversations.</p><p>Some donors believe Biden still offers the best chance of defeating Trump, despite Democratic voters expressing widespread doubts in polling about his age and readiness. </p><p>That’s even as fundraisers are being canceled and some larger donors refuse to fund any Democratic campaigns until Biden is no longer the nominee. Others are putting money behind political action committees aimed at supporting down-ballot candidates who have openly called for Biden to step aside.</p>
    

<p>Others would prefer an open convention that would allow hundreds of delegates gathered in Chicago next month to select the nominee from a collection of top-tier prospects that also includes California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, among others. </p><p>But Harris, who is the first woman, Black woman and person of Asian descent to serve as vice president, commands deep loyalty from key Democratic constituencies. Even if donors persuaded someone to run in a potential open primary, that candidate would be in a position of challenging and trying to sideline someone who has set those historic firsts.</p><p>The Biden-Harris campaign is in a position of implicitly undercutting Harris’ prospects to protect Biden’s. </p><p>Biden’s campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon released a memo Thursday conceding “increased anxiety” within the party, although she suggested that movement against the president, “while real, is not a sea-change in the state of the race.”</p><p>And O’Malley Dillon wrote that there is “no indication that other Democratic candidates would outperform the president against Trump.”</p><p>Salazar, the DNC member from Colorado, declined to say whether there was an organized effort among delegates to rally behind another presidential nominee when asked. But he criticized DNC leadership in Washington for declining to answer key logistical questions about how or when delegates could nominate a Biden replacement should they wish to.</p><p>Biden’s nomination could be sealed in a matter of days due to a virtual roll call that would make him the nominee well before the convention opens Aug. 19. The DNC originally set up the virtual roll call to preempt an Ohio ballot requirement that could have kept Biden off the ballot there. </p><p>Ohio has since changed its law. But despite numerous inquiries from The Associated Press and other media, the DNC won’t say whether it will keep the virtual roll call or when it will hold it. </p><p>The virtual vote to make Biden the nominee could be as soon as July 19, Salazar said, although a DNC spokesperson said the vote could not take place before July 21.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump’s fundraising is surging. And the presumptive Republican nominee has only just begun to spend on television advertising, while Biden has poured tens of millions of dollars into battleground-state advertising in recent months. </p><p>Biden’s allies are hoping for a respite in the coming days with the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-rnc-what-to-expect-702139084873df3d633ee19d1b82e5f0">Republican National Convention</a></span> opening Monday in Milwaukee. </p><p>Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley said the GOP was prepared to win this fall regardless of whether Biden steps out of the race or not. </p><p>“I think if Kamala Harris steps in, she is going to run on the exact same platform that Joe Biden has been running on, and it is a failed platform based on failed policies that have really hurt American families,” he said. “The Democratic Party is in complete disarray.” </p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Farnoush Amiri, Will Weissert, Brian Slodysko, Mike Balsamo and Colleen Long in Washington contributed. </p>

<p>Ambani, Asia’s richest person, is famous for hosting lavish parties, especially for his three children Akash, Isha and Anant. International artists perform and a host of Bollywood stars usually attend the gatherings, whose price tag runs into the millions.</p>
<p>This promises to be the most extravagant of Ambani’s galas so far, although it is not known how much was spent.</p>
<h2>‘Ostentatious expenditure’</h2>
<p>Some, such as opposition politician Thomas Isaac, have called the amount of spending “obscene”.</p>
<p>“Legally it may be their money, but such ostentatious expenditure is a sin against mother earth and [the] poor,” he said in a post on X.</p>
<p>The wedding functions have been deemed a public event, leading to traffic restrictions in a key Mumbai business district for four days, also raising public ire.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>With access limited and details closely guarded, information meted out to the eager public has been done partly through Reliance’s official Facebook page, which has 2.3 million followers.</p>
<p>The account shared video clips of dance performances and photographs to give a peek into the private celebrations.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://fb.watch/tgUEmAHxFE/" target="_blank">post</a> on Reliance’s Facebook account this week, which received 54,000 likes, showed the Ambani family at a private music function, dancing to a Bollywood song, a common practice in Indian marriages. It was promoted with hashtags such as #ARWeddingCelebrations.</p>
<p>Media access to the wedding venue was restricted on Friday night, with only a limited number of photographers and TV crew allowed to capture incoming guests.</p>
<p>Onlookers stood with umbrellas in the rain outside the venue, some clicking pictures, with the sound of Bollywood audible from inside.</p>
<p>A foreign company executive in India, who is due to attend the Ambani wedding function this weekend, told Reuters that the function organisers will likely put tape on the phone camera of entering guests to ensure no pictures are taken.</p>
<p>Most of Ambani’s celebrations are closely guarded.</p>
<p>The wedding events started in March with a three-day pre-wedding party with 1,200 guests and a performance by superstar Rihanna, followed by a European luxury cruise with 800 guests in May.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>Days later, several Bollywood actresses posted photos on Instagram, sporting luxury designer labels, to their millions of followers, without any details of the Ambani cruise celebrations.</p>
<p>Such is the interest, that Indian TV news channels are tracking the wedding minute-by-minute.</p>
<p>“The world descends … Guest list to what’s there to eat. Every minute detail on Times Now,” the TV news channel’s tickers said on Friday evening.</p>

                                        <p>DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Civil defense workers on Friday dug bodies out of collapsed buildings and pulled them off rubble-covered streets, as they collected dozens of Palestinians killed this week by an Israeli assault in a district of Gaza City.</p><p>The discovery of the bodies came after Israeli troops reportedly pulled out of parts of the Tal al-Hawa and Sinaah neighborhoods following days of bombardment and fighting there. The Israeli military launched an incursion into the districts earlier this week to fight what it said were Hamas militants who had regrouped.</p><p>The grisly scenes of the dead underscored the horrifying cycle nine months into the Gaza war.</p>



<p>After invading nearly every urban area across the tiny territory since October, Israeli forces are now repeatedly re-invading parts as Hamas shifts and maintains capabilities. Palestinians are forced to flee over and over to escape the changing offensives – or to remain in place and face death. Cease-fire negotiations push ahead, nearing but never reaching a deal.</p>
    

<p>Videos circulating on social media showed civil defense workers wrapping bodies, including several women, in blankets on the rubble-strewn streets of Tal al-Hawa and Sinaah. A hand poked out of the smashed concrete where workers dug into a collapsed building. Other video showed burned-out buildings.</p><p>About 60 bodies have been found so far, including entire families who appeared to have been killed by artillery fire and airstrikes as they tried to flee, said Mahmoud Bassal, the director of civil defense in Gaza. Some bodies had been partially devoured by dogs, others burned inside homes and others remained unreachable in rubble, he said.</p>
    
<p>The director of nearby Al-Ahli Hospital, Fadel Naem, said at least 40 bodies found in the districts had been brought to the facility, though he didn’t have a precise number.</p><p>The Israeli military said it could not comment on the discovery of the bodies.</p>
    

<p>Israel’s assault on the district began after it issued an evacuation order for the area on Monday. In a statement Friday, the military said its troops targeted the abandoned headquarters of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, where it said Hamas had set up operations.</p><p>UNRWA left the compound in October, early in the war. The military said Friday that troops had battled Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters in the compound and discovered material for building drones and stashes of weapons. It issued photos of some of the discovered material, though the claims could not be independently confirmed.</p><p>On Friday, troops had withdrawn from most of the area, but snipers and drones continued to open fire, said Salem Elrayyes, a resident who fled months ago to the south but spoke to family members still in the neighborhood.</p><p>He said that during the days of the offensive, troops set fire to many homes — including that of one of his uncles — and carried out wide-scale arrests, taking people for interrogation inside the UNRWA compound. At least 11 of his relatives were detained, he said.</p>
    

<p>Two were released after being severely beaten, while the rest are still missing. His family was searching for other relatives still unaccounted for — “some may be detained, and some may have lost communication. Others may be killed,” Elrayyes said.</p><p>A day earlier, civil defense workers said they found dozens of bodies in Shijaiyah, another Gaza City district from which Israeli troops withdrew in recent days after a two-week offensive.</p><p>Most of the population of Gaza City and the surrounding areas in the north <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-displacement-israel-war-900c4bacf70080249ea8e62f818c410f">fled earlier in the war</a></span>. But the U.N. estimates that some 300,000 people remain in the north. With each new assault, people often flee to other parts of the north, since so far Israel has not allowed those who flee south to return to the north.</p><p>An airstrike early Friday hit an aid warehouse in Muwasi, part of an Israeli-declared “humanitarian safe zone” covering parts of south and central Gaza, a U.K.-based aid group Al-Khair Foundation said. Imam Qasim Rashid Ahmad, the group’s director in London, said one of its staffers, an engineer, was killed in the strike along with three staffers from other humanitarian groups using the warehouse. </p>
    

<p>The Israeli military said Husam Mansour, the Al-Khair Foundation member who was killed, was in fact a senior Hamas militant. Israel said he used his position with the humanitarian group to raise money for Hamas.</p><p>Israel launched its campaign in Gaza after <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-rockets-airstrikes-tel-aviv-11fb98655c256d54ecb5329284fc37d2">Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack</a></span> in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250.</p><p>Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 38,300 people in Gaza and wounded more than 88,000, according to the territory’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-casualties-toll-65e18f3362674245356c539e4bc0b67a">Health Ministry</a></span>. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. More than 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes, and most are now crowded into squalid tent camps, facing widespread hunger.</p>
    

<p>Meanwhile in Cairo, U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators continued to push to narrow gaps between Israel and Hamas over a proposed deal for a three-phase cease-fire and hostage release plan in Gaza. </p><p>The U.S.-backed proposal calls for an initial cease-fire with a limited hostage release and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas in Gaza. At the same time, the two sides will negotiate the terms of the second phase. Phase two is supposed to bring a full hostage release in return for a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p><p>But obstacles remain.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel won’t agree to any deal that would prevent it from resuming its military campaign until Hamas is eliminated. On Thursday, he indicated that Israel intends to keep a hold of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, which would contradict a full withdrawal from Gaza.</p><p>Hamas dropped its demand that Israel commit ahead of time to reach a permanent cease-fire. But a Hamas political official told The Associated Press that the group still wants written guarantees from the mediators that negotiations will continue until a permanent cease-fire is reached.</p><p>Otherwise, “Netanyahu can stop the negotiations and thus resume the aggression” at any time, said Ahmed Abdul-Hadi, the head of Hamas’ political office in Lebanon.</p><p>Abdul-Hadi also said that Hamas does not expect to resume its role as the sole ruling party in Gaza after the war but wants to see a Palestinian government of technocrats.</p><p>“We do not want to rule Gaza alone again in the next phase,” he said. Israeli officials have suggested they will demand Hamas’ removal in the talks for the second phase.</p><p>Netanyahu is under growing pressure both domestically and internationally. Relatives of hostages are marching to Jerusalem to demand a deal and the release of their loved ones as Israeli politicians, including Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, call for a broad government investigation into the conduct of Israel’s leaders.</p><p>A risk of regional escalation remains. Israel’s military said Friday that one of its soldiers was killed in northern Israel, where the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israel continue to trade border fire.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Abby Sewell and Sarah El Deeb in Beirut, Sam Metz in Rabat, Morocco, and Jack Jeffery in Ramallah, West Bank, contributed to this report.</p>

<ol>
<li>Delta Air Lines faced backlash after it echoed the sentiment of a social media post that disparaged employees wearing Palestinian flag pins on their uniforms, calling it "not in line with our values".</li>
<li>The initial response was from Delta's own X account, which said that the employees' pins made the writer "terrified" and implied that it was uncomfortable to see workers with symbols of the Palestinian struggle.</li>
<li>The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) criticized Delta's response, calling it "reprehensible" and demanding an apology, citing the airline's failure to educate its employees about anti-Palestinian racism.</li>
<li>Delta later issued an apology, stating that the initial response was "mistakenly" posted and did not align with the airline's values. The company also removed the responsible employee from its social media channels.</li>
<li>Delta announced a new policy limiting uniform pins to U.S. flags only, effective July 15, and stated that the two employees photographed wearing Palestinian flag pins were in compliance with the previous policy and still work for the airline.</li>

    <div><section class="content__body"><p>Delta Air Lines on Friday issued an apology after it echoed the sentiment of a social media post disparaging staffers wearing Palestinian flag pins on their uniforms. </p><p>An X user <a href="https://x.com/iliketeslas/status/1811055398981365831" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">posted images</a> of two Delta employees wearing the pins, suggesting that the imagery made the traveller uncomfortable. "Since 2001 we take our shoes off in every airport because a terrorist attack in US soil. Now imagine getting into a <a href="https://x.com/Delta" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">@Delta</a> flight and seeing workers with Hamas badges in the air. What do you do?" the X user wrote. </p><p>In a since deleted post, Delta responded from its own X account. "I hear you as I'd be terrified as well, personally. Our employees reflect our culture and we do not take it lightly when our policy is not being followed," Delta wrote, according to a <a href="https://x.com/CAIRNational/status/1811172255541633110" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">screenshot</a> of the exchange shared by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). </p>    
  <p>CAIR national deputy director Edward Ahmed Mitchell said Delta's response was reprehensible and called on the airline to issue an apology.  </p><p>"Whether this racist post on Delta's X account was approved or unauthorized, Delta must apologize and take steps to educate its employees about this type of dangerous anti-Palestinian racism. Bigotry against Palestinian-Americans is absolutely out of control in workplaces and at schools – and it must stop," he <a href="https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-calls-on-delta-to-apologize-for-racist-anti-palestinian-twitter-post/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> in a statement. </p>

<h2>"Not in line with our values"</h2><p>Delta, for its part, issued a statement saying its controversial reaction was "mistakenly" posted to X. Delta removed its own comment "because it was not in line with our values and our mission to connect the world," a spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. "The team member responsible for the post has been counseled and no longer supports Delta's social channels. We apologize for this error."</p><p>Delta added that the two employees who were photographed wearing the pins were in compliance with its uniform policy, and that they still work for the airline. </p><p>Moving forward, though, employees will only be permitted to wear U.S. flags on their uniforms, Delta said. The new policy goes into effect July 15. </p><p>"Previously, pins representing countries/nationalities of the world had been permitted," Delta said.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Massive data breach</strong>: AT&amp;T revealed that nearly all call and text message records from tens of millions of its cellphone customers, as well as many non-AT&amp;T customers, were exposed between May 1, 2022, and October 31, 2022.</li>
<li><strong>Scope of the breach</strong>: The compromised data includes telephone numbers of "nearly all" of AT&amp;T's cellular customers, as well as those of wireless providers that use its network.
