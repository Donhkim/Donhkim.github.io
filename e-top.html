                                        <p>BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A jury in Idaho unanimously agreed Saturday that <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/idaho-murder-trial-daybell-vallow-children-killed-4146cf7574e76a619955c63c27e20cb9">convicted killer Chad Daybell</a></span> deserves the death penalty for the gruesome murders of his wife and his girlfriend’s two youngest children, ending a grim case that began in 2019 with a search for two missing children. </p><p>The 55-year-old Daybell, wearing a dress shirt and tie, sat with his hands in his lap at the defense table. He showed no emotion when learning he would face the death penalty for the murders of Tammy Daybell, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua “JJ” Vallow. </p><p>When asked by the judge whether he wanted to make a statement, Daybell declined.</p><p>Jurors found him guilty Thursday and decided on the death sentence after deliberating for just over a day.</p><p>The mother of the children is Lori Vallow Daybell, whom Chad Daybell married shortly after his wife’s death. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/idaho-murder-trial-doomsday-plot-mom-841bacf176c07af61d11696c7e3181f5">Vallow Daybell was convicted</a></span> last year in the three murders and is now awaiting trial in Arizona, charged with murder in connection with the shooting death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. Charles Vallow was JJ’s father.</p>
    

<p>The case began in 2019, when a family member called police. Investigators soon realized both children were missing, and a multistate search ensued. Nearly a year later, their remains were found buried on Chad Daybell’s property. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/idaho-murder-trial-doomsday-plot-mom-4f0733dca0ac3cf1af4522bc3469723a">Tylee’s DNA was later found</a></span> on a pickaxe and shovel in a shed on the property, and JJ’s body was wrapped in trash bags and duct tape, prosecutors have said.</p>



<p>During a nearly two-month-long trial, prosecutors said Chad Daybell, a self-published author who wrote doomsday-laced fiction, promoted <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/idaho-murder-trial-doomsday-plot-mom-4f0733dca0ac3cf1af4522bc3469723a">unusual spiritual beliefs</a></span> including apocalyptic prophecies and tales of possession by evil spirits in order to justify the killings. </p>
    
<p>“This has been a tough case because of its complexity, both in telling the story of an investigation that spanned years and trying to figure out the best way to present it in a way that would make sense to others,” Fremont County Prosecutor Lindsey Blake said outside the Boise courthouse after the sentencing.</p>
    

<p>Relatives of the victims welcomed the jury’s decision.</p><p>“This is the best justice we can possibly get. And again, it doesn’t change the outcome, but it is good news, and it brings closure for everybody that’s been hurt,” Colby Ryan, Vallow Daybell’s oldest child, told reporters.</p><p>Larry Woodcock, JJ’s grandfather, thanked the judge, law enforcement and the people who have followed the case and shared their support over the years.</p><p>“You are family,” he said. “I look at the faces, and I’m going to tell you all: I’m going to miss you.”</p><p>“We saw justice,” he added. “Equal, honest and righteous.”</p><p>Daybell’s defense attorney, John Prior, argued during the trial that there wasn’t enough evidence to tie Daybell to the killings, and suggested Vallow Daybell’s older brother, Alex Cox, was the culprit. Cox died in late 2019 and was never charged, and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/idaho-murder-trial-doomsday-plot-mom-841bacf176c07af61d11696c7e3181f5">Vallow Daybell was convicted</a></span> last year and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/lori-vallow-daybell-doomsday-plot-sentence-1e0a1cfa1f4e67b4dbb7b43cba86156d">sentenced to life in prison without parole</a></span>. </p><p>During the sentencing hearing, Prior asked the jurors to judge Daybell on his life before he met Vallow Daybell, describing her as a bomb that blew him off the trajectory of an otherwise wholesome life. But Daybell also declined to offer any mitigating evidence during the sentencing hearing. Mitigating evidence is often used to encourage jurors to have sympathy for a defendant in an effort to show that a life sentence would be more appropriate than capital punishment. </p>
    

<p>Family members of the victims gave emotional statements to the jurors. JJ Vallow’s grandmother, Kay Woodcock, tearfully described how the 7-year-old would show empathy and compassion to others through soft touches and by frequently asking if those around him were OK. She also said Tylee was a doting big sister, and that it warmed her heart to see them together. </p><p>“I can’t express just how much I wish for more time to create memories,” Woodcock said, beginning to weep.</p><p>Ryan, Vallow Daybell’s oldest child, described what it was like to lose his entire family. His father died years earlier.</p>
    

<p>“My three kids will never know the kindness of Tylee’s heart or JJ’s silly and goofy personality ... The only way I could describe the impact of their lives being lost is like a nuclear bomb dropping,” he said. “It’s not an overstatement to say that I lost everything.”</p><p>To impose the death penalty, the jurors had to unanimously find that Daybell met at least one of the “aggravating circumstances” that state law says qualifies someone for capital punishment. They also had to agree that those aggravating factors weren’t outweighed by any mitigating factors that might have lessened his culpability or justified a lesser sentence.</p><p>The jury decided there were aggravating factors including an utter disregard for human life and the murders being especially heinous and cruel. </p><p>Idaho law allows for execution by lethal injection or firing squad, though firing squad executions have never been used in the state. </p>

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that the conditions for ending <a href="https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-06-01-24/index.html">the country’s war in Gaza</a> “have not changed,” raising questions over a peace proposal <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/biden-middle-east-remarks/index.html">laid out by US President Joe Biden</a> which he said Israel submitted.
    </p>

            During a speech Friday, Biden said Hamas had been degraded to a point where it can no longer carry out the type of attack seen on October 7 that launched the current war. Part of the agreement, he said, would see a truce and hostage exchange while Israel and Hamas negotiate a permanent end to the fighting.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clww9viyy00043b6j3zzxftb7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            It was perhaps the furthest Biden has gone in telling Israel its stated goals for its operation in Gaza have been met, and that the time has arrived to stop the fighting.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clww9t0j800023b6jujwocr89@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The proposal has been welcomed across the international community. The UN, the UK, France, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have all expressed support for Biden’s proposal, while Qatar and Egypt joined the US in calling on Israel and Hamas to “finalize” the proposed ceasefire agreement.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwwco8p5000c3b6jecv2xren@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            For its part, Hamas said it viewed the plan “positively” and is ready “to deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire.”
    </p>

            But a statement from the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office on Saturday said Israel’s goals — “the destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel” — would need to be met before a permanent ceasefire can begin.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clww7b5nh000b3b6jk6ikri85@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “Under the proposal, Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent ceasefire is put in place. The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter,” the statement said.
    </p>

            Saturday’s statement largely reiterated earlier comments from the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) made less than an hour after Biden detailed the peace proposal on Friday, with Netanyahu insisting the country would not end the war until Hamas is defeated and all hostages had been returned.
    </p>

            For all the messaging, however, it is unclear exactly to what degree Israel supports the plan. The earlier PMO statement insisted the “exact outline” of the proposal allows Israel to “maintain” its goals in the conflict.
    </p>

            Netanyahu is facing domestic pressure, both from opposition leaders to get a ceasefire agreement on the table, and from ministers within his own party not to back down on Israel’s original war goals. Families of Israelis being held hostage are meanwhile urging him to accept the proposal.
    </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Ukraine allowed to use Western weapons to hit targets in Russia</strong>: Ukraine is now permitted to use Western-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia, a move that will significantly change the dynamics of the war.</li>
<li><strong>Previous restrictions</strong>: Until now, Western countries had restricted the use of their weapons to military targets located inside Ukraine, including Crimea and occupied territories, to avoid escalating the conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Russian advance in Kharkiv region</strong>: Russia launched a massive ground assault in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, opening a new front and capturing several villages, prompting Kyiv's allies to grant Ukraine permission to strike targets in Russia.</li>
<li><strong>Escalation concerns</strong>: Until now, Western countries were concerned that attacking targets across the internationally recognized border with weapons provided by NATO countries would escalate the conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Deterrent effect</strong>: The new permission for Ukraine to strike targets in Russia aims to deter Russia from further advances and give Ukraine a stronger defense against Russian aggression.</li>

They were concerned that attacking targets across the internationally recognised border with weapons provided by Nato countries would escalate the conflict.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But the latest Russian advance in the north-eastern Kharkiv region convinced Kyiv’s allies that in order to defend itself, Ukraine must be able to destroy military targets on the other side of the border as well.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Last month, Russia launched a massive ground assault in the region, opening a new front and capturing several villages. The Russian advance posed a serious threat to Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, which is just 30km away from the border.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The border in this region is effectively the front line as well, so the ban on using Western weapons to hit targets beyond Ukraine enabled Russian troops to prepare for that operation in a safe environment.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Following the growing pressure from Ukraine and other European states, the US agreed to change its policy and allow Kyiv to strike Russia with Western weapons.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“The hallmark of our engagement has been to adapt and adjust as necessary, to meet what’s actually going on on the battlefield, to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs, when it needs it,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Prague on Friday.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dOZXmm"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-fd6cb93-1 hXQtlW"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c6e2/live/342ea550-2041-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c6e2/live/342ea550-2041-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c6e2/live/342ea550-2041-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c6e2/live/342ea550-2041-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c6e2/live/342ea550-2041-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c6e2/live/342ea550-2041-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c6e2/live/342ea550-2041-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c6e2/live/342ea550-2041-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Aftermath of hit residential area in Kharkiv in May 2024" class="sc-fd6cb93-0 hvRJnO"><span class="sc-fd6cb93-2 iuQLaK">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Multiple residential areas were hit in Russia's latest wave on Kharkiv</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Just a few days before this announcement, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to expand “sanitary zones” in case Western long-range weapons are used to strike the Russian territory. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He said that Nato countries in Europe must remember that they have “states with small territories and dense population”. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“They must take this factor into consideration prior to discussing strikes deep inside the Russian territory,” he added.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Avoiding an escalation is probably the reason why the US didn’t include long-range weapons such as ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) in its permission to strike Russia. These missiles have a range of 300km and could be used to hit military bases and airfields well into Russian territory.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Such limitations leave Ukraine with only the option of focusing on targets near its border.  But this is still a major policy shift by Kyiv’s main allies.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Even with a shorter range - up to 70km - multiple rocket launchers such as HIMARS can significantly disrupt Russian logistics operations and troops movement, which will ultimately slow down any offensive plans.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Now, Ukraine can “strike places where the enemy concentrated its troops, equipment and supply storage facilities that are used to attack Ukraine,” says Yuriy Povkh from the Kharkiv tactical group that co-ordinates military operations in the north-east.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russia was gathering its troops just 90km from Kharkiv for another offensive.  </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And the Institute for Study of War analysed satellite images and confirmed that there were “expanded activities at depots and warehouses” in that area.  So the ability to target those facilities will seriously strengthen the capacity of Ukrainian forces to repel new attacks in the region.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Lifting the ban on Western weapons, however, is unlikely to help to protect Ukraine from Russian glide bombs known locally as KAB. They have a devastating effect and are regularly used to bomb Kharkiv and other border towns.  But to stop such attacks, Ukrainian forces must target planes that drop those deadly KABs.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dOZXmm"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-fd6cb93-1 hXQtlW"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/be2d/live/f2439360-2042-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/be2d/live/f2439360-2042-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/be2d/live/f2439360-2042-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/be2d/live/f2439360-2042-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/be2d/live/f2439360-2042-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/be2d/live/f2439360-2042-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/be2d/live/f2439360-2042-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/be2d/live/f2439360-2042-11ef-9b41-f58b08291af8.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images HIMARS launches rocket  " class="sc-fd6cb93-0 hvRJnO"><span class="sc-fd6cb93-2 iuQLaK">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Ukraine received HIMARS as part of their international military assistance</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The only weapon capable of intercepting those planes that Ukraine has at its disposal at this moment is the US air-defence system Patriot.  However, getting this weapon close to Kharkiv is a huge risk.  Spy drones can quickly spot it and Moscow can launch missiles such as Iskander to destroy this expensive system.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Interestingly, the UK and France, which provide Ukraine with jointly made Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles (or Scalp as they are called in France), haven’t explicitly restricted their use.  And their range can go up to 250km. In fact, French President Emanuel Macron told journalists last week:“We should allow [Ukraine] to neutralise the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And such rhetoric is seen as permission to use Storm Shadows/Scalps, a military aviation officer who prefers to remain anonymous, told the BBC.  So, he says, Ukraine can now hit airfields in the Kursk and Belgorod regions that border Ukraine.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">However, such operations will be limited in terms of what they can achieve. Ukrainian Su-24s that are equipped with these cruise missiles will have to get close to the Russian border in order to launch them, which makes them vulnerable to Russian air defence systems. F-16 jets that are expected by the end of this year are better equipped for such tasks.  But President Zelensky admits that it’s still not clear whether Ukraine’s partners will allow these jets to be used to attack targets in Russia.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“I think that using any weapon, Western kind of weapon, on the territory of Russia is a question of time,” he said at the Nordic summit in Stockholm on Friday.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Ukrainian forces are trying to develop their own weapons to hit targets in Russia’s rear.  Some of their drones have attacked oil depots and military facilities hundreds of kilometres away from the border.  </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The latest attack was on a long-range radar station in the city of Orsk, which is 1800km from the Ukrainian border.</p></div></article></div>

<li><strong>ANC loses parliamentary majority</strong>: The African National Congress (ANC), South Africa's governing party, lost its parliamentary majority of 30 years, with the party receiving 40% of the vote in the May 29 general elections.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of opposition parties</strong>: The Democratic Alliance (DA) received 21.8% of the vote, while the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) received 9.5% of the vote. The uMkhonto weSizwe party, established by former President Jacob Zuma, received 14.6% of the vote.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges facing ANC</strong>: The ANC has been struggling with a range of issues, including declining living standards, chronic power outages, high crime rates, and unemployment. The World Bank has ranked South Africa as the most unequal country in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Political uncertainty</strong>: With the ANC no longer having a majority, the party's leader, Cyril Ramaphosa, will need to negotiate a coalition to retain dominance. This could lead to uncertainty over the country's political direction.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of coalition building</strong>: Unlike Nelson Mandela, who formed a power-sharing coalition in the early years of South Africa's democracy, Ramaphosa will need to build a coalition to maintain his party's power. This could lead to important negotiations and power-sharing agreements in South Africa's political landscape.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Labour's proposal</strong>: Labour plans to introduce a "growth and skills levy" which will give businesses the choice to spend up to half of the money on training existing staff in "high-level technical skills" such as retrofitting or engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Funding</strong>: The levy will be funded through taxes and an "apprenticeship levy" paid by businesses with an annual wage bill of more than £3m. At least 50% of the money will be reserved for apprenticeships.</li>
<li><strong>Increased flexibility</strong>: Businesses will have more flexibility to use the funding for training, including "pre-apprenticeship training" courses to prepare people for full apprenticeships or jobs. They will also be able to offer training in essential skills such as digital and green skills.</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong>: Labour claims that if businesses use just 3% of the additional flexibility, it could generate 150,000 traineeships for young people, creating a "golden age of lifelong learning".</li>
<li><strong>Opposition</strong>: Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has criticized Labour's plans, saying they will halve the number of apprenticeships and disadvantage small and medium-sized businesses.</li>

    <div><p>The Federal Reserve has talked financial markets into creating an easier environment, which paradoxically makes lowering rates a more difficult task for the central bank, a top economist said.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>The Bloomberg US Financial Conditions Index indicates that the availability and cost of credit across money, bond, and equity markets are significantly more favorable today than when the Fed began raising rates in March 2022, according to Apollo Chief Economist Torsten Sløk.</p>



<p>That’s due to the central bank’s pivot in November, when Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that inflation was cooling enough to halt rate hikes and start thinking about when rate cuts could begin. </p>



<p>Wall Street interpreted the comments, incorrectly as it turned out, to mean easing would be imminent and that as many as six cuts would happen in 2024, sparking a massive stock market rally.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.apolloacademy.com/the-fed-cut-reflexivity-paradox/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.apolloacademy.com/the-fed-cut-reflexivity-paradox/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.apolloacademy.com/the-fed-cut-reflexivity-paradox/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">blog post</a> on Wednesday, Sløk estimated that the S&amp;P 500 stock index has added $9 trillion in market cap since then and compared it to the $19 trillion in consumer spending last year.</p><p></p>



<p>“In other words, in a few months, the household sector has experienced a windfall gain corresponding to about 50% of last year’s consumer spending!” he wrote.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the federal government has been spending trillions of dollars on infrastructure, green-energy initiatives, and semiconductor production capacity. </p>



<p>As a result, the economy has remained strong as this fiscal stimulus continues to fuel growth while easier financial conditions offset Fed rate hikes, Sløk noted. </p>



<p>In fact, the economy was so strong earlier this year that inflation readings came in above forecasts and showed signs of reaccelerating. That forced Powell to warn that rates could stay high for “<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/17/jerome-powell-inflation-economy-interest-rates-higher-longer/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/17/jerome-powell-inflation-economy-interest-rates-higher-longer/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/04/17/jerome-powell-inflation-economy-interest-rates-higher-longer/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">as long as needed</a>” because inflation appeared to be taking longer than anticipated to reach the Fed’s 2% target.</p>



<p>Still, he later acknowledged that <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/01/jerome-powell-stagflation-1970s-inflation-economic-growth-interest-rates/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/01/jerome-powell-stagflation-1970s-inflation-economic-growth-interest-rates/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/01/jerome-powell-stagflation-1970s-inflation-economic-growth-interest-rates/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">further rate increases were unlikely</a> and reaffirmed that the Fed’s next move—whenever that will be—is likely a rate cut. </p><p></p>



<p>And that’s precisely the mistake Powell is making, in Sløk’s view. </p>



<p>“Looking ahead, with the stock market hitting fresh all-time highs and fiscal policy still supportive, the expectation in markets should be that the economy will continue to accelerate over the coming quarters,” he wrote. “You can call this the Fed Cut Reflexivity Paradox: The more the Fed insists that the next move in interest rates is a cut, the more financial conditions will ease, making it more difficult for the Fed to cut.”</p>



<p>To be sure, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/economy-gdp-growth-high-interest-rates-1-6/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/economy-gdp-growth-high-interest-rates-1-6/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/economy-gdp-growth-high-interest-rates-1-6/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">GDP growth slowed</a> in the first quarter from the fourth quarter, and was revised down to an annualized rate of 1.3% from a prior reading of 1.6%. The latest report also showed that fiscal stimulus was having a smaller effect. </p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>But consumer spending on services remained strong, and more recent data on jobless claims showed the labor market continues to hold up.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-economy-inflation-minutes-interest-rates/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-economy-inflation-minutes-interest-rates/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/22/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-economy-inflation-minutes-interest-rates/" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">minutes from the Fed’s last policy meeting</a> revealed that the economy’s resilience in the face of rates at 23-year highs had prompted some officials to wonder whether all their tightening was exerting enough pressure on growth. High interest rates “may be having smaller effects than in the past,” the minutes said.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-424e8006-0 lagCOr">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>
