                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court">Supreme Court</a></span> ‘s conservative majority on Thursday preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling that said the district discriminated against Black voters.</p><p>In dissent, liberal justices warned that the court was insulating states from claims of unconstitutional racial gerrymandering.</p><p>In a 6-3 decision, the court held that South Carolina’s Republican-controlled legislature did nothing wrong during redistricting when it strengthened Rep. Nancy Mace’s hold on the coastal district by moving 30,000 Democratic-leaning Black residents of Charleston out of the district. </p><p>“I’m very disturbed about the outcome. It’s as if we don’t matter. But we do matter and our voices deserve to be heard,” said Taiwan Scott, a Black voter who sued over the redistricting.</p><p>President Joe Biden, whose administration backed Scott and the other plaintiffs at the Supreme Court, also criticized the ruling. “The Supreme Court’s decision today undermines the basic principle that voting practices should not discriminate on account of race and that is wrong,” Biden said in a statement.</p>
    

<p>But Mace, reacting to the decision, said, “It reaffirms everything everyone in South Carolina already knows, which is that the line wasn’t based on race.”</p>



<p>The case presented the court with the tricky issue of how to distinguish race from politics. The state argued that partisan politics, not race, and a population boom in coastal areas explain the congressional map. Moving voters based on their politics is OK, the Supreme Court has held.</p>
    
<p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-south-carolina-state-government-hilton-head-island-charleston-9f48c6c7668b7b9404a7a9335d3a195a">A lower court</a></span> had ordered South Carolina to redraw the district after it found that the state used race as a proxy for partisan affiliation in violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. </p><p>Thursday’s decision won’t have a direct effect on the 2024 election. The lower court had previously ordered the state to use the challenged map in the November vote, which could help Republicans as they try to hold on to their narrow majority in the House of Representatives.</p>
    

<p>Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the court, criticized lower-court judges for their “misguided approach” that refused to presume that lawmakers acted in good faith and gave too much credit to the challengers.</p><p>Alito wrote that one weakness of the Black voters’ case was that they did not produce an alternative map, which he called an “implicit concession” that they couldn’t have drawn one. “The District Court’s conclusions are clearly erroneous because it did not follow this basic logic,” he wrote.</p>
    
<p>Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the three liberals, said her conservative colleagues ignored the work of the lower court that found the district had been gerrymandered by race.</p><p>“Perhaps most dispiriting,” Kagan wrote, the court adopted “special rules to specially disadvantage suits to remedy race-based redistricting.”</p><p>Richard Hasen, an election expert at the University of California at Los Angeles law school, agreed with Kagan, writing in a blog post that the decision “makes it easier for Republican states to engage in redistricting to help white Republicans maximize their political power.”</p>
    

<p>Janai Nelson, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said in a statement, “The highest court in our land greenlit racial discrimination in South Carolina’s redistricting process, denied Black voters the right to be free from the race-based sorting and sent a message that facts, process, and precedent will not protect the Black vote.”</p><p>However, Sen. Thomas Alexander, the president of the South Carolina Senate, praised the ruling. “As I have said throughout this process, our plan was meticulously crafted to comply with statutory and constitutional requirements, and I was completely confident we would prevail,” Alexander said.</p><p>The Supreme Court in 2019 ruled that partisan gerrymandering cases could be not be brought in federal courts. Justice Clarence Thomas, who was part of the conservative majority five years ago, wrote separately Thursday to say federal courts should similarly get out of the business of refereeing racial gerrymandering disputes.</p>
    

<p>“It is well past time for the Court to return these political issues where they belong—the political branches,” Thomas wrote. No other justice signed on.</p><p>When Mace first won election in 2020, she edged Democratic incumbent Rep. Joe Cunningham by 1%, under 5,400 votes. In 2022, following redistricting driven by the 2020 census results, Mace won reelection by 14%. She is among <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kevin-mccarthy-republican-lawmakers-house-opponents-33c7d984964916f29d548b5b1dfe508b">eight Republicans</a></span> who voted in October to oust Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as House speaker.</p><p>The case differed from <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-redistricting-alabama-voting-rights-act-114ba2e144d903efc77ad31fe40ee47f">one in Alabama</a></span> in which the court ruled last year that Republican lawmakers diluted Black voters’ political power under the landmark Voting Rights Act by drawing just one district with a majority Black population. The court’s decision led to new maps in Alabama and Louisiana with a second district where Democratic-leaning Black voters comprise a substantial portion of the electorate. </p>
    

<p>In South Carolina, Black voters wouldn’t have been as numerous in a redrawn district. But combined with a substantial set of Democratic-leaning white voters, Democrats might have been competitive in the reconfigured district.</p><p>The high court left open one part of the case about whether the map intentionally sought to dilute the votes of Black residents. </p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court">https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court</a></span>.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Ayanna Alexander and Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.</p>

Storms get names when their wind speeds reach 39 mph or higher.</p><p>Given the near-record warmth in much of the Atlantic Ocean and a strong chance of La Niña conditions, forecasters said there is an 85% chance of an above-normal season along the Atlantic seaboard.</p><p>"All the ingredients are definitely in place to have an active season," said Ken Graham, the director of the National Weather Service.</p><p>Hurricane season begins June 1 and ends November 30. It typically starts to peak in late summer and early fall.</p><p>Global warming increases hurricanes' propensity for damaging effects. A warmer atmosphere makes the storms more likely to rapidly pick up wind speed as they near the shore.

The site has aggregated early hurricane forecasts from 23 centers.</p><p>The NOAA forecast is in line with the aggregate. On average, the services have predicted 23 named storms, 11 hurricanes and five major hurricanes (the designation given to storms that reach Category 3 or higher, based on their wind speeds).</p><p>“When it comes to the number of storms, that would be the third most on record,” said Philip Klotzbach, a meteorologist at Colorado State University who specializes in Atlantic basin seasonal hurricane forecasts.</p><p>In 2020, there were 30 named storms, the most in observed history. Twelve of the storms made landfall in the United States and every mile of the mainland Atlantic coast was placed on a hurricane warning or watch at some point during that season, <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/12/a-look-back-at-the-horrific-2020-atlantic-hurricane-center/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to Yale Climate Connections;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0">according to Yale Climate Connections</a>.</p><p>Last year, 20 named storms formed in the Atlantic, including 7 hurricanes.</p><p>It’s unusual to see record sea surface temperatures coincide with a strong chance of La Niña — a natural climate pattern associated with Atlantic hurricane. The combination strengthens forecasters' confidence that this season could be significant.</p><p>“Last year was an interesting season. It was this clash of the Titans. The Atlantic was stupid hot like it is now, but it had a strong El Niño, which would knock down your big storms,” Klotzbach said.</p><p>But this year, “the Atlantic is still super hot and El Niño is gone, so everything is pulling the same direction,” he added.</p><p>Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami, said it’s hard to find years in the past with comparable conditions.</p><p>“We’ve never had a La Niña with ocean temperatures this warm in the Atlantic before. There’s not a historical year to look back to,” he said. “We’re certainly in uncharted territory. As someone who lives on a fairly hurricane-prone part of the coastline, I’m not too excited about it.”</p><p>Worldwide, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/oceans-record-hot-rcna143179" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sea surface temperatures have remained record hot for more than a year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="0">sea surface temperatures have remained record hot for more than a year</a>. McNoldy said Caribbean temperatures are warmer in May than they are at peak in a typical year. In the tropical east Atlantic, temperatures today are comparable to what's normal for August.</p><p>Record sea surface temperatures could fuel rapid intensification, a phenomenon in which hurricane winds ramp up suddenly as the storm nears shore.

            Democrats brought the measure back up after it failed earlier this year in an attempt to put pressure on Senate Republicans and shift the narrative on border security, but the bill exposed divides among Democrats as some came out against it, threatening to undermine the party’s messaging effort. The vote was 43 to 50.

            As immigration remains top of mind for voters, the White House and top congressional Democrats have discussed a series of moves aimed at strengthening their hand on border security ahead of the first presidential debate next month. Sources say those talks included reviving the stalled border security measure that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/07/politics/senate-border-ukraine-israel-aid-vote/index.html">initially failed after former President Donald Trump told GOP lawmakers to knock it down.</a>

            The Republican National Committee on Thursday accused the US Secret Service of ignoring its security concerns surrounding the party’s July convention in Milwaukee, warning that the agency was putting the event at risk.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwjmtncm00053b6ic3nq27lx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            In a sternly worded letter to Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, RNC counsel Todd Steggerda said the security environment around the convention was “rapidly deteriorating” and demanded action.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwjmtncm00063b6ihf9vaefs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “Rather than dissipating, the overall security climate has worsened significantly over the past month of the USSS’s inaction,” Steggerda wrote, adding that Cheatle’s “failure to act now to prevent these unnecessary and certain risks will imperil tens of thousands of convention attendees.”
    </p>

            CNN has reached out to the Secret Service.

            The RNC has raised concerns over the proximity of planned protest zones to the pathway that convention attendees must walk to access the venue. Steggerda <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/27/politics/rnc-secret-service-republicans-convention-milwaukee/index.html">in a letter last month</a> had asked the Secret Service to create more of a buffer between the routes for attendees and the First Amendment Zone where protesters can gather.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwjmtncn00093b6ifda7hd9h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The party has proposed an alternative location for the First Amendment Zone that would ensure attendees would not have to walk past protesters.
    </p>

            Steggerda cited statements made by organizers for the Coalition to March on the RNC 2024 suggesting protesters may ignore law enforcement orders related to where they can demonstrate.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwjmtncn000b3b6i6jsjmoc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Requests to the Secret Service to meet with RNC leadership have gone unanswered, Steggerda asserted. A number of top Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have reached out to the Secret Service to discuss their concerns, a source familiar with the situation told CNN.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwjmtncn000c3b6iqv048t9d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “With less than two months before the convention and even less time before the USSS finalizes the plan, it is imperative you take personal and immediate steps to fix this unacceptable flaw in the design of the security perimeter,” Steggerda wrote.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is calling for the Senate to investigate reports that a flag associated with the January 6, 2021 riot at the Capitol was flown at the home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito.</li>
<li>Ocasio-Cortez says the reported flying of the flag at Alito's home is an "extraordinary breach of not just the trust and the stature of the Supreme Court, but we are seeing a fundamental challenge to our democracy."</li>
<li>The report of the flag flying outside Alito's home was first reported by The New York Times, which said that a second flag of the same type was displayed at the home, which is owned by Alito.</li>
<li>Ocasio-Cortez has called for Immediate action, saying "There should be subpoenas going out. There should be active investigations that are happening" and that the Senate "has gavels" and needs to take action.</li>
<li>Justice Alito has since clarified that the flag was flown upside down by his wife after an argument with a neighbor, whom his wife found to be insulting and abusive.</li>

She said that Congress did not have to wait to take action against Alito until Democrats had a majority in the House. </p><p>"Samuel Alito has identified himself with the same people who raided the Capitol on Jan. 6, and is now going to be presiding over court cases that have deep implications over the participants of that rally," the progressive "Squad" member said. "And while this is the threat to our democracy, Democrats have a responsibility for defending our democracy. And in the Senate, we have gavels."</p><p>"There should be subpoenas going out. There should be active investigations that are happening," Ocasio-Cortez said. "And I believe that when House Democrats take the majority, we are preparing and ensuring to support the broader effort to stand up our democracy. But I also believe that when Democrats have power, we have to use it. We cannot be in perpetual campaign mode. We need to be in governance mode, we need to be in accountability mode with every lever that we have. Because we cannot take a Senate majority for granted, a House majority for granted or a White House for granted." </p><p>The New York Times reported on Wednesday that a second flag of a type carried by rioters during the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was displayed outside a house owned by Alito. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/alito-wife-displayed-upside-down-flag-argument-insulting-neighbor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ALITO SAYS WIFE DISPLAYED UPSIDE-DOWN FLAG AFTER ARGUMENT WITH INSULTING NEIGHBOR</strong></a></p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Rep.

Alito previously said the inverted American flag was flown by his wife amid a dispute with neighbors, and he had no part in it.</p><p>The white flag with a green pine tree was seen flying at the Alito beach home in New Jersey, according to three photographs obtained by the Times.

Kim Reynolds said Thursday at a news conference. Most were in and around Greenfield. The count does not include businesses or other buildings destroyed or damaged, like Greenfield’s 25-bed hospital.</p>
    

<p>The havoc spun by the tornado now shows on the faces of people still processing how quickly homes and lives were shattered. Kimberly Ergish, who was combing through the debris field that had been their home with her husband, described how she grabbed her children and ran for the basement when the tornado sirens sounded. </p>



<p>“It got really quiet and then really loud and then everything was gone,” she said. “It was like 10 seconds of just pure terror and it felt like it lasted a lifetime.”</p><p>The governor praised FEMA’s response on Thursday as she sought a disaster declaration for multiple counties. After surveying Tuesday’s destruction, the National Weather Service determined that three separate powerful tornados carved paths totaling 130 miles across Iowa, according to Donna Dubberke, the meteorologist in charge in Des Moines.</p>
    
<p>It took just one minute for one of them to cut a path a mile (1.6 kilometers) long through Greenfield, Dubberke said. The town’s center square and neighborhoods outside the tornado’s path were spared.</p>
    

<p>Colton Newbury, 24, was working in Des Moines when the twister hit, nearly 60 miles (97 kilometers) away from his wife and 10-month-old daughter at their home in Greenfield.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

An emergency was declared in Temple, Texas, after powerful storms ripped through the city of more than 90,000. Thousands lost power, Thursday’s classes were canceled and nearby Fort Cavazos reported debris blocking traffic at the Army installation.</p><p>Before Tuesday’s twister in Greenfield, this year’s deadliest tornado was the one that <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/tornado-indiana-ohio-severe-weather-731ed36b02cd521590ac8f5dbc4509f5">killed three people</a></span> in Logan County, Ohio on March 14.

About 90 miles (145 kilometers) away, in Ames, Iowa, Nicole Banner found a yellowed page declaring “This Book is the Property of the Greenfield Community School District” stuck to her garage door.</p><p>Greenfield’s 25-bed hospital was so damaged that at least a dozen injured people had to be taken elsewhere, and hospital officials have said the facility will remain closed — possibly for months — while repairs are made. An urgent care clinic was set up at the elementary school, with primary care services to start there Thursday.</p><p>Roseann Freeland had waited until the last minute to rush with her husband to a concrete room in their basement. Seconds after the twister passed, they opened the door “and you could just see daylight,” Freeland said. “I just lost it.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The families of five female Israeli soldiers held captive by Hamas in Gaza have released video footage showing the soldiers being captured on October 7.</li>
<li>The footage, which was previously classified by the Israeli army, shows the soldiers injured and bound, with some pleading for help in English.</li>
<li>Hamas has denied that the video is real, calling it a "manipulated excerpt" and claiming that the injuries shown are minor and expected in such situations.</li>
<li>The families of the captives released the video in an effort to pressure the government into reaching a ceasefire deal with Hamas that would free their loved ones.</li>
<li>The footage is from the October 7 attack on the Nahal Oz military base, which was part of Hamas' assault on southern Israel that killed 1,139 people and took some 250 others captive.</li>

<p>It is not clear if any parts of it had already been redacted by the Israeli army.</p>
<p>The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the families made the footage public to try to pressure the government into reaching a ceasefire deal with Hamas that would free their loved ones.</p>
<p>In a statement, Hamas said the video was “a manipulated excerpt” that “cannot be verified” and that its release at this time is “part of the occupation’s efforts to distort the image of the resistance”.</p>
<p>The group also said there was “obvious cutting and selection of images that would support the occupation’s claims … that the female conscripts had been assaulted”.</p>
<p>The injuries on the soldiers, the statement said, were minor and “to be expected in such situations”.</p>
<h2 id="chaos-and-confusion">Chaos and confusion</h2>
<p>The footage shows scenes of chaos with the young female soldiers confused and frightened.</p>
<p>Two women who did not speak Arabic could be seen asking if anyone spoke English, their hands bound behind their backs.</p>
<p>The footage was from the attack on the Nahal Oz military base, part of the Hamas-led assault on southern Israel that <a href="/news/2024/4/27/hamas-releases-video-of-two-israeli-captives-held-in-gaza">killed 1,139</a> people and took some 250 others captives.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>Seven female soldiers, who worked as lookouts on the border with Gaza, were taken from Nahal Oz, the Forum said.</p>
<p>The army rescued one of the women at the end of October in a ground operation and said a second was killed amid Israel’s war on Gaza.</p>
<p>“Every new testimony about what happened to the hostages echoes the same tragic truth – we must bring them all back home, now,” the Forum said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The Israeli government must not waste another moment.”</p>
<p>The footage released on Wednesday is roughly three minutes long and has been edited, with some images blurred to censor what the Forum said is especially sensitive material.</p>
<p>In the video, a group of more than a dozen armed fighters are seen binding the women, two of whom had visible bloodstains on their faces.</p>
<p>The video was released amid <a href="/news/2024/4/2/israels-protests-amid-mounting-pressure-on-benjamin-netanyahu-all-to-know">growing domestic pressure</a> on the Israeli government to secure the release of the remaining captives.</p>
<p>Thousands of Israelis, including relatives and other loved ones of those still held in Gaza, have taken to the streets in recent days to demand that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu do more to free them.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>Many have also called on Israel to agree to a ceasefire to bring their relatives home safely.</p>

            President Joe Biden is leaning on the highest trappings of American diplomacy this week to boost ties with the East African nation, including designating Kenya a major non-NATO ally – the first in sub-Saharan Africa – and hosting a sunset state dinner on the White House South Lawn.

            Looming over the pomp and circumstance is China’s expanding role in Africa, which has become a central testing ground for the world’s two largest economies as they jockey for economic and geopolitical influence.

            Senior administration officials acknowledge a central factor in scheduling a state visit with Kenya was the desire to counter China’s influence and financial leverage on the African continent, which has outpaced the United States in direct investment.

            “For many, many years, it was really the Chinese who showed up in Africa and in Kenya,” US Ambassador to Kenya Meg Whitman told CNN in an interview.

            For decades, China has been making high-interest loans to low-income African nations to help them fund development for domestic projects, including some flagship infrastructure projects within China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

            From 2000 to 2022, Beijing lent $170 billion to African nations – including $6.7 billion to Kenya – to fund these initiatives, according to Boston University’s <a href="https://www.bu.edu/gdp/chinese-loans-to-africa-database/" target="_blank">Chinese Loans to Africa database</a>. Those loans saddled Africa with costly debt that countries have been increasingly unable to service, leading many nations to seek relief from their sovereign lenders. Kenya’s debt is projected to reach a level of 74% of its economic output, with the country paying an increasing share of government revenue on rising interest costs.

            During the state visit, the US and Kenya are set to announce the “Nairobi-Washington Vision,” calling on creditor countries – and likely China in particular – to provide grants, budget support and debt suspension to help alleviate the burden.

            And the US has already begun stepping into that opening.

            In his meetings with Biden, Ruto has sought to emphasize Kenya – and the broader African continent – as an area worthy of investment. In a gathering of CEOs on Wednesday at the White House, he told his American counterpart that old perceptions of the continent were changing.
    </p>

            “You’re all past thinking about Africa as a place of war and destruction instead of opportunity, and we’re making that real,” Ruto told the president during the meeting, according to a senior US administration official who paraphrased the leader’s remark.

            Still, Ruto’s visit to Washington comes at a moment of political instability in many African countries. Military coups over the last year have toppled governments and underscored a fragile rule of law, while traditional American allies on the continent have demonstrated new willingness to break from the United States. One of the goals of Thursday’s state visit is to demonstrate the ability of democracies – like Kenya’s – to deliver for their people.

            Biden, who hosted African leaders at the White House for a summit earlier in his term, has been consumed since then by conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.

            “It’s no secret that the world has had a lot going on the last year and a half,” a senior administration official said this week, pointing to a stream of Cabinet secretaries and other senior administration officials who have visited Africa as a sign of the Biden team’s commitment.

            Yet the spate of foreign conflicts has prevented Biden himself from paying a visit, which he vowed to do within a year of the summit. He still intends to travel to Africa as president, his national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday, though he couldn’t say when.

            Kenya has been a key partner for the US in combatting al-Shabab militants in neighboring Somalia and earlier this year joined a US-led international coalition meant to beat back attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes by Houthi rebels in Yemen.

            “Around the world, Kenya and America are also standing united against the terror of ISIS and Al-Shabaab, that they continue to perpetrate in East Africa, the aggression that Russia is inflicting on Ukraine, the violence that has toppled too many democracies across both our regions,” Biden said Thursday as he welcomed Ruto to the White House.

            Kenya is also preparing to deploy 1,000 paramilitary police officers to Haiti in a bid to quell gang violence, a mission largely funded by the United States that is expected to last at least one year, according to Whitman.

            Biden on Thursday defended his administration’s decision not to deploy US troops to Haiti, telling reporters that doing so could raise “all kinds of questions that can be easily misrepresented by what we’re trying to do, and be able to be used by those who disagree with us and against the interests of Haiti and the United States.”

            Biden said the US was instead focused on finding “a partner or partners who would lead that effort that we would participate in, not with American forces, but with supplies and making sure they have what they needed.”

            This week, a delegation of Kenyan “command staff” arrived in Haiti, according to a law enforcement source in the country, ahead of the Kenyan-led multinational security support force. The delegation was expected to assess this week whether equipment and facilities for the foreign police forces are ready – an assessment that will be decisive in determining a timeline for the deployment, a source with knowledge of the preparations told CNN.

            Despite strong support from the US and other regional powers, however, the mission has been mired in uncertainty and legal challenges for months. It was further delayed following the resignation of former Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry in March, until the creation of a transitional governing council.

            “This is not something that is a completely straight line. It is a dynamic operating environment, to say the least, in Haiti, and this is going to require an adaptive, flexible approach but one guided by certain core functions and operations,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House on Wednesday.

                                        <p>SAN PEDRO GARZA GARCIA, Mexico (AP) — The collapse of a stage in heavy winds at a campaign rally in northern Mexico has killed at least nine people, including a child, and injured 121, the governor of Nuevo Leon state said Thursday.</p><p>The collapse occurred during an event Wednesday evening attended by presidential long-shot candidate Jorge Álvarez Máynez, who ran to escape. Videos of the collapse on social media showed people screaming, running away and climbing out from under metal polls. </p><p>The victims “will not be alone in this tragedy,” Máynez told reporters Wednesday night, adding that he had suspended upcoming campaign events. </p><p>Afterward, soldiers, police and other officials roamed the grounds of the park where the event took place while many nearby sat stunned and haunted by the tragedy.</p><p>In a video message, Nuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garcia, a leading member of Máynez’s Citizens Movement party, said 94 of the injured were treated and released, but that 27 remained hospitalized. State health authorities said a lot of the injuries involved skull fractures. Garcia said several victims were undergoing surgery and some appeared to be in critical condition.</p>
    

<p>Garcia said the accident occurred “in a matter of seconds.”</p>

<p>Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said most of the injured were women. He absolved Máynez’s Citizens Movement party — widely viewed as an implicit ally of López Obrador’s Morena party — of blame even before investigations were carried out.</p>
    
<p>“We know that they are not to blame,” the president said Thursday. Condolences poured in from across Mexico, including from the other two presidential candidates.</p><p>Máynez wrote in his social media accounts that he went to a hospital after the accident in the wealthy suburb of San Pedro Garza Garcia, near the city of Monterrey. He said he was in good condition.</p><p>“The only important thing at this point is to care for the victims of the accident,” he wrote.</p>
    

<p>Videos of the accident showed Máynez waving his arm as the crowd chanted his name. But then he looked up to see a giant screen and metal structure toppling toward him. He ran rapidly toward the back of the stage to avoid the falling structure, which appeared to consist of relatively light framework pieces as well as what appeared to be a screen with the party’s logo and theater-style lights.</p><p>In a Facebook post, Alejandra Gamez Escalera wrote that her father and a stepbrother, 11, died in the collapse. She said they had gone to the event to hear a band that was scheduled to play at the campaign rally. </p><p>“If only you had stayed home and not gone to the event, none of this would have happened,” Gamez Escalera wrote.</p><p>Máynez has been running third in polls in the presidential race, trailing both <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-claudia-sheinbaum-elections-d80aa4c5c57805971a739c795c8ca571">front-runner Claudia Sheinbaum</a></span> of the ruling Morena Party and opposition coalition candidate Xóchitl Gálvez.

"Conduct that subverts competition here not only harms the structure of the live music industry and the countless people that work in that industry, but also damages the foundation of creative expression and art that lies at the heart of our personal, social, and political lives."</p>

<p>In 2010, federal regulators, including those at the Justice Department, approved the merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster, which ultimately allowed the promotional, venue and ticketing industries to be brought under the control of one corporation. </p><p>Thursday's lawsuit, however, said the relationship has since hurt American consumers and presents barriers to artists. Senior Justice Department officials alleged that Live Nation and Ticketmaster worked to unlawfully squeeze consumers for money even after artists get paid, through what they characterized as monopolistic intermediaries.</p><p>According to the complaint, Live Nation has strong-armed businesses with financial retaliation if they engage with its competitors and has wielded its control over the market by threatening to pull future events if venues opt not to use Ticketmaster exclusively. </p><p>Such control, the Justice Department said, has meant concertgoers pay more for tickets and touring artists sign long-term agreements to solely perform at venues that use the ticket-selling program. </p><p>In a statement, Live Nation said the suit "won't solve the issues fans care about relating to ticket prices, service fees, and access to in-demand shows." The company said that "[c]alling Ticketmaster a monopoly may be a PR win for the DOJ in the short term, but it will lose in court because it ignores the basic economics of live entertainment," noting that "competition has steadily eroded Ticketmaster's market share and profit margin."</p><p>"We will defend against these baseless allegations, use this opportunity to shed light on the industry, and continue to push for reforms that truly protect consumers and artists," Live Nation said.</p><p>At a Senate hearing in January 2023, artists <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ticketmaster-live-nation-senate-hearing-taylor-swift-tickets-watch-live/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">testified</a></span> about the hold Live Nation had over them. Clyde Lawrence, of the band Lawrence, testified that Live Nation's power lies in the fact that it's the promoter, the venue and the ticket company. </p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'>
    </p>
<p>"Because Live Nation owns the venue, fronts the money for the show and sells the tickets, they have outsized power when negotiating with artists," he told the panel, offering an example: For one show, Lawrence set ticket prices at $30. After Ticketmaster added a 40% fee, fans paid $42 per ticket. And after paying for facility costs, the band made $12 per ticket — about half of which went to covering the costs of touring.</p>
