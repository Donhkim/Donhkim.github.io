                                        <p>DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel on Saturday carried out its largest hostage rescue operation since the latest <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">war with Hamas</a></span> began, taking four to safety out of central Gaza amid the military’s heavy air and ground assault. At least 210 dead Palestinians, including children, were brought to local hospitals, a health official said.</p><p>Israelis were jubilant as the army said it freed Noa Argamani, 26; Almog Meir Jan, 22; Andrey Kozlov, 27; and Shlomi Ziv, 41, in a daytime operation in the heart of Nuseirat, raiding two locations at once while under fire. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-hostages-profiles-80b14cd4a796aa265ebfcc5bb5928477">All were well</a></span>, the military said.

The video of her abduction showed her seated between two men on a motorcycle as she screamed, “Don’t kill me!”</p>
    

<p>Her mother, Liora, has brain cancer and had released a video pleading to see her daughter. Israel’s Channel 13 said Argamani was moved to the hospital where her mother is treated. In a message released by the government, Argamani told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu she was “very excited,” saying she hadn’t heard Hebrew in so long.</p>



<p>Netanyahu in a statement vowed to continue the fighting until all hostages are freed. The operation was “daring in nature, planned brilliantly, and executed in an extraordinary fashion,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said.</p>
    
<p>Israeli aircraft hummed overhead as the bodies of 109 Palestinians including 23 children and 11 women were taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where spokesperson Khalil Degran told The Associated Press more than 100 wounded also arrived. He said that overall, 210 dead had been taken there and to Al-Awda Hospital, saying he had spoken to the director there. Al-Awda’s numbers couldn’t immediately be confirmed.</p>
    

<p>AP reporters saw dozens of bodies brought from the Nuseirat and Deir al-Balah areas, as smoke rose in the distance and armored vehicles rolled by.</p><p>A baby was among the dead. Small children wailed, covered in blood. Bodies were placed on the ground outside, their feet bare, as more wounded were rushed in.</p><p>“My two cousins were killed, and two other cousins were seriously injured. They did not commit any sin. They were sitting at home,” one relative said in the chaos. As Palestinians explored the newly destroyed buildings, a small child sat on a collapsed metal door, overwhelmed.</p><p>Neighboring Egypt condemned “with the strongest terms” Israel’s attacks on the Nuseirat refugee camp, with its foreign ministry calling it a “flagrant violation of all rules of international law.” Neighboring Jordan also condemned it.</p><p>“The bloodbath must end immediately,” the European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on the social platform X, noting reports of civilian deaths.</p><p>Israel’s military said it had attacked “threats to our forces in the area,” adding that one commando died from his wounds.</p>
    

<p>Israel’s Channel 12 said the rescue force went into the heavily populated Nuseirat camp and burst into the two apartments where the hostages were, killing the captors. One getaway vehicle was shot and they came under heavy fire. Additional forces moved in to rescue them, and Israel used heavy fire to get them out.</p><p>A U.S. hostage cell provided advice and support throughout the process of locating and rescuing the hostages, according to a Biden administration official, who was not authorized to comment and requested anonymity. The hostage cells are multi-agency teams.</p><p>Hamas took some 250 hostages during the Oct. 7 attack that killed about 1,200 people. About half were released in a weeklong cease-fire in November. About 120 hostages remain, with 43 pronounced dead. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hamas-gaza-israel-war-hostages-bibas-241fd9eb55ad56e79beac29f8783f634">Survivors include</a></span> about 15 women, two children under 5 and two men in their 80s.</p><p>Saturday’s operation brought the total number of rescued hostages to seven. Two were freed in February and one was freed in the aftermath of the October attack. Israeli troops have recovered the bodies of at least 16 others, according to the government.</p>
    

<p>The latest rescue lifted some spirits in Israel as divisions deepen over the best way to bring hostages home. Many Israelis urge Netanyahu to embrace a cease-fire deal U.S. President Joe Biden announced last month, but far-right allies threaten to collapse his government if he does.</p><p>Netanyahu, whose support has fallen, rushed to the hospital to greet the freed hostages. But thousands of Israelis again gathered Saturday evening for the latest anti-government demonstration and calls for a cease-fire agreement.</p><p>“It’s time to pay the price of a political deal. One deal that will bring them all back without risking soldiers,” said Omri Shtivi, whose brother Idan marked his 29th birthday Saturday while in captivity.</p>

<p>The 46-year-old was “shocked by the incident” on Friday evening in the capital’s Kultorvet square, the office said in an initial statement. Frederiksen had been taken to Rigshospitalet for a medical check-up following the assault. It added the assault caused a “minor whiplash injury”, but that Frederiksen was otherwise unharmed.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 3 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>In a subsequent statement, the prime minister thanked those who offered support, calling it “incredibly touching”.</p>
<p>“I am saddened and shaken by the episode yesterday, but am otherwise safe,” she said. “For once, I need peace. Both for body and soul. I need to be with my family and need to be myself for a bit.”</p>
<p>Danish police said on Saturday a 39-year-old Polish had appeared in front of a judge for preliminary questioning in relation to the incident. He was later remanded in custody for 12 days.</p>
<p>Although the assault came two days before Danes head to the polls to vote in European Union parliamentary elections, prosecutor Taruh Sekeroglu said that a political motivation was not the “guiding … hypothesis” for the attack.</p>
<p>Copenhagen police inspector Trine Moller told Ritzau news agency that the incident was being treated as a “single, spontaneous act”.</p>
<p>Frederiksen has been campaigning with the Social Democrats’ EU lead candidate, Christel Schaldemose. Media reports said the attack was not linked to a campaign event.</p>
<h2 id="strong-push">‘Strong push’</h2>
<p>Two witnesses, Marie Adrian and Anna Ravn, told newspaper BT that they had seen Frederiksen arrive at the square while they were sitting by a nearby fountain just before 6pm (16:00 GMT).</p>
<p>“A man came by in the opposite direction and gave her a hard shove on the shoulder, causing her to fall to the side,” the newspaper quoted the woman as saying.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>They added that while it was a “strong push”, Frederiksen did not hit the ground.</p>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<p>According to the witnesses, the prime minister then sat down at a nearby cafe. They described the man as tall and slim, and said he had tried to hurry away but had not gotten far before being grabbed and pushed to the ground by men in suits.</p>
<p>Another witness, Kasper Jorgensen, told newspaper Ekstra Bladet that he had seen the man after he was tackled to the ground, saying that one of what he presumed to be part of the security service had put a knee on the man’s back.</p>
<p>“They had pacified him, and as he lay there, he looked confused and a little dazed,” Jorgensen told the newspaper.</p>
<p>A resident told the Reuters news agency Frederiksen was escorted away by security following the assault.</p>
<p>“She seemed a little stressed,” Soren Kjergaard, who works as a barista on the square, said.</p>
<h2 id="despicable-act">‘Despicable act’</h2>
<p>News of the assault was received with shock and condemnation by leaders across the political spectrum inside Denmark and abroad.</p>
<p>European Council President Charles Michel said he was “outraged by the assault” while European Parliament President Roberta Metsola urged Frederiksen to “keep strong” while adding in a post on X that “violence has no place in politics”.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also condemned what she called a “despicable act which goes against everything we believe and fight for in Europe”, in a statement to social media.</p>
<p>Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said that “an attack on a democratically elected leader is also an attack on our democracy”, while French President Emmanuel Macron called it “unacceptable” and wished Frederiksen “a speedy recovery”.</p>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<p>In 2019, Frederiksen became Denmark’s youngest prime minister and kept the post after emerging victorious in the 2022 general election.</p>
<p>“I must say that it shakes all of us who are close to her,” Danish Environment Minister Magnus Heunicke said on social media. “Something like this must not happen in our beautiful, safe and free country.”</p>
<p>Violence against politicians has become a theme in the run-up to the EU elections. In May, a candidate from Germany’s Social Democrats was beaten and seriously injured while campaigning for a seat in the European Parliament.</p>
<p>In Slovakia, the election campaign was overshadowed by an <a href="/news/2024/6/5/slovak-pm-robert-fico-says-could-return-to-work-in-several-weeks">attempt to assassinate</a> Prime Minister Robert Fico on May 15, sending shockwaves through the country and Europe.</p>

                                        <p>PARIS (AP) — President <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a></span> said France was America’s “first friend” at its founding and is one of its closest allies more than two centuries later as he was honored with a state visit Saturday by French President Emmanuel Macron aimed at showing off their partnership on global security issues and easing past trade tensions.</p><p>“United we stand, divided we fall,” Macron said in toasting Biden at a state dinner. “Allied we are and allied we will stay.”</p><p>Biden and Macron attended ceremonies marking the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/d-day-france-russia-ukraine-wwii-7b6896a9d891fb2d2f75b29e1cfd67ad">80th anniversary of D-Day</a></span> on Thursday and met separately the following day with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-biden-zelenskyy-a77546e23fa571eb7f6509d4e14b89b3">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris</a></span>. The leaders both used those engagements used to underscore the urgent need to support Kyiv’s fight against Russia’s invasion.</p><p>But Macron and Biden have often chafed at the pace of support for Ukraine, especially as the United States, by far the largest contributor to Kyiv’s defense, was forced to pause aid shipments for months while congressional Republicans held up an assistance package.</p>
    

<p>The state visit began Saturday with a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, including a wreath-laying at France’s tomb of the unknown soldier, and a military parade along the Champs-Élysées leading to the Élysée Palace, where the two held official meetings and delivered public statements. Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, hosted state dinner at the palace for Biden and his wife, Jill.</p>



<p>The American president followed Macron’s toast by saying the U.S. and France have been “unyielding as well as unwavering in our partnership,” adding, “That’s what democracies do.”</p>
    
<p>Biden and Macron put the war in Ukraine at the top of Saturday’s agenda, but it was the strength of the countries’ long alliance, fortified at Normandy 80 years ago but with roots far deeper, that was the centerpiece of the weekend.</p><p>Calling himself a student of French history, Biden said the visit was a “great honor” and he noted that America’s ties to France date to the Revolutionary War.</p>
    

<p>“France was our first friend,” Biden said. “It remains one of our best friends.”</p><p>Macron praised Biden as not just the leader of a world power but also for bringing the “clarity and loyalty of a partner that loves and respects the Europeans.”</p><p>It appeared to be a subtle criticism of former President Donald Trump, whose “America First” foreign policy has shaken European leaders.

<p>Macron expressed hope that when the Group of Seven leaders meet this coming week in Italy they will agree to a $50 billion “solidarity fund” for Ukraine that will be backed by sanctioned Russian assets. </p><p>The two leaders also celebrated the rescue Saturday by Israeli forces of four hostages taken by Hamas. “We won’t stop working until all the hostages come home and a cease-fire is reached,” Biden said as Macron called out the Israeli government for not doing more to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza.</p><p>Macron said he supported a Biden-promoted cease-fire proposal that would allow a surge of humanitarian assistance into the territory and allow for the release of more hostages.

<p>The French leader raised the issue of U.S. trade practices that he has often criticized, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which favors American-made climate technology such as electric vehicles. Macron said the U.S., like China, has “decided not to respect the rules of global trade” by shoring up protections and subsidies while Europe’s industry remains open and is stuck in overregulation.</p><p>As the pair met outside the palace, Biden appeared to suggest to his host that that the U.S. and Europe could “coordinate together,” and he was heard telling Macron about his most recent conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who was objecting to steep U.S. tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.</p>

<li><strong>The criticism was sparked by a TV interview</strong>: The criticism was sparked by an ITV interview with Paul Brand, where Sunak answered questions on tax policy, which was seen as an opportunity for Sunak to be questioned about his decision to miss the commemorations.</li>

But he and his Number 10 advisers had yet to even spot it.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The error seems to have been two-fold. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Firstly, the decision made many weeks back - before the general election was called - that the prime minister could miss a major part of the 6 June D-Day commemorations.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And secondly, never revisiting that decision once the election had been called and considering how bad it might look. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">One Conservative source has told the BBC it just did not occur to anyone at the top of the campaign that it would be a problem, especially with the G7 summit in Italy next week where the prime minister will see all the same leaders.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Sunak took part in an interview with ITV when he returned to London on Thursday afternoon - but I am told the details of that encounter had only been finalised the day before.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">I understand that ITV had asked for an interview later in the week, but were offered Thursday as the only option by Downing Street.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">This means the decision to leave Normandy before the international leaders event was not made specifically to do a TV interview but to do other work.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Even as the interview with ITV's Paul Brand concluded there was no sign the prime minister was regretting his travel plans.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Longstanding security concerns mean Number 10 are always cagey about the prime minister’s movements. Therefore, the fact an ITV interview was even being conducted was not widely known at Westminster.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Because it was being pre-recorded for a programme next Wednesday, the link to the D-Day anniversary may never have come to light.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">However, an ongoing row between Mr Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer over tax policy meant this interview was the first time the PM responded on camera to accusations of “lying”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">That particular answer was clearly time-sensitive in the midst of an election campaign and the broadcaster decided to use the clip immediately.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">At 8.45pm on Thursday, Paul Brand tweeted a video of Mr Sunak’s answer on tax policy.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Within 10 minutes political journalists had made the link between the two events and were asking the Conservative press office when the interview had taken place. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Official Tory sources were almost all silent.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">By 10.30pm, the Labour-supporting Daily Mirror had released its Friday front page: "PM ditches D-Day".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">As anger among Tory candidates grew, aides to the prime minister debated how to respond.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Their conclusion was to apologise fast and at 7.45am today Rishi Sunak tweeted: “On reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer - and I apologise”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Among allies of Mr Sunak there is bafflement about how another campaign blunder came about.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“From one decision to the next I’m absolutely staggered,” one cabinet minister told me. “Who is in charge?”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Another source who knows the Downing Street team well said of Mr Sunak: “He surrounds himself with yes men and women who don’t challenge him.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“They are all young. None of them have run a campaign before aside from Isaac [Levido]", the party’s campaign manager.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Others involved are more sympathetic to the pace and pressure of being on a party political campaign far behind in the polls: “Someone dropped the ball and didn’t realise it.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“They are in the midst of a stressful election, grappling with problems on all fronts. It’s easy to say now that it was an obvious error.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">One senior Conservative told the BBC: “This is catastrophic. Reform will overtake us now [in opinion polls] and we will go into meltdown.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Some Conservative candidates are seething, others seem deflated and resigned.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“We are where we are”, one critic of the PM told me. “I did try to warn them [about Mr Sunak].”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The potency of this gaffe is in its simplicity.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Unlike many political rows which involve complex procedure or political figures you've never heard of, all voters can understand this story.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">As well as prompting questions about the PM‘s judgement, critics will say it jars with his plan to introduce national service and present the Conservatives as the only party that can be trusted with national security.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And like many of the most painful political errors, it was completely self-inflicted.</p></div></div>

    <div><p>Austrian-Canadian auto parts billionaire Frank Stronach was arrested on sexual assault charges spanning decades, police said.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>The 91-year-old was charged Friday with five crimes including rape, indecent assault on a female, sexual assault and forcible confinement, Peel Regional Police said. He was released with conditions and will appear at the Ontario Court of Justice in Brampton, Ontario, at a later date, the police statement said.</p>



<p>Peel Regional Police Constable Tyler Bell said there is more than one accuser but declined to say how many.</p>



<p>“Obviously, this is a high-profile case. Our special victims unit is bound to protect the victims and in doing so that’s why were are being vague,” Bell said. “There is more than one victim but we won’t confirm that number yet.”</p>



<p>Police allege the sexual assaults occurred from the 1980s to as recent as 2023. Bell said they are appealing for people to come forward if they have information or have been victims.</p><p></p>



<p>Stronach didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>He has hired prominent Canadian defense lawyer Brian Greenspan.</p>



<p>“Mr. Stronach categorically denies the allegations of impropriety which have been brought against him,” Greenspan said in an e-mail. “He looks forward to the opportunity to fully respond to the charges and to maintain his legacy both as a philanthropist and as an icon of the Canadian business community.”</p>



<p>Stronach, born in Austria, became one of Canada’s wealthiest people by creating Magna in his garage in 1957 and building it into one of the world’s largest suppliers of auto parts.</p>



<p>He also founded The Stronach Group, a company specializing in horse racing. He made a brief foray into Austrian politics more than a decade ago and has been named to the Order of Canada, one of the country’s highest honors.</p><p></p>



<p>A Magna spokesperson said Stronach has had no affiliation with the company since relinquishing control in 2010.</p>



<p>“We have recently been made aware of the charges filed against Frank Stronach,” Dave Niemiec said in an email Friday evening. “Magna has no knowledge of the investigation or the allegations that have been raised beyond what has been reported in the media.”</p>



<p>Niemiec said the company would not comment further on the ongoing legal matter.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>In 2018, Stronach sued his daughter, two grandchildren and former business associate Alon Ossip for over $500 million in Ontario Superior Court alleging they mismanaged the family’s assets which he wanted to take back control of.</p>



<p>Belinda Stronach, a former Canadian Member of Parliament, countersued her father, saying in a statement of defense that he lost vast sums of money on pet projects.</p><p></p>

Even delegations from ECR to certain degree will not question the absolute essence of the European Union," said Tomasz Kaniecki, Euronews Polls Centre analyst. </p><h2><strong>Germany</strong></h2><p>The EPP in Germany is set to reach a major score of slightly over 30% of votes. The far right is uncomfortably set at the second position, threatened by the slow but steady growth of the Social Democrats of Chancellor Olaf Scholz. </p><p>The AfD has slightly slackened its growth after being hit by the scandals related to the embarrassing statements of sympathy to Nazi Germany's Waffen-SS veterans by its former European elections lead candidate Maximilian Krah and the spy cases with China and Russia that embroiled some of its members at the European Parliament during the electoral campaign. </p><p>The pollsters don't rule out that the SPD's social-democrats (S&amp;D) might surpass the far right. The distance between the AfD and the SPD is still too close to call. </p><p data-ad-id="adzone-outstream_1" data-ad-type="outstream" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label js-adzone outstream"></p><p>The Greens occupy a disappointing fourth position. </p><p>The liberals of the FDP (Renew Europe) have been losing ground, dragged by the average negative trend of other Renew-affiliated parties in Europe. </p><p>However, had these projections to be confirmed after the ballots counting, they would represent rather bitter results for the current so-called "traffic-light" national ruling coalition of the SPD, FDP and the Greens. Only the majority shareholders, the social-democrats, could claim a partially acceptable result thanks to their slow pace of consensus recovery.  </p><p>The result of the CDU-CSU (EPP) could be regarded as a relative and objective reverberating success of the outgoing European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, a historical member of the CDU and former defence minister in Angela Merkel's government.   </p><p>According to a pan-EU projections overview, the moderate forces could prevail over the so-called protest voters. </p><p data-ad-id="adzone-native_1" data-ad-type="native" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label advertising--native js-adzone"></p><p>Yet, on a country-by-country basis, the predictions for the far-right forces are still impressive, as in France.</p><h2><strong>France</strong></h2><p>The National Rally of Marine Le Pen, a member of Identity and Democracy, is expected to win large, taking advantage of the social discontent of the French. </p><p>The RN list, led by Jordan Bardella, is expected to almost double Valérie Hayer's Renaissance liberals of Renew Europe.* President Emmanuel Macron's group at the European Parliament is expected to face an electoral defeat, pollsters forecasted the polls.  </p><p>Macron's popularity is low for national political reasons. The Élysée's group of reference in Strasbourg is Renew Europe. The French MEPs from the Renaissance party have been the backbone of the grand coalition despite its numerical minority size compared with its senior partners, the EPP and the S&amp;D. </p><p><em>Macronisme</em> was regarded by the moderates across Europe as a dynamic political proposal that could have relaunched the EU after the financial crisis and Brexit, but according to the polls, it will hardly be the case again in the new legislature. </p><div class="c-ad c-ad-halfpage u-margin-bottom-3 u-show-for-small-only"><p data-ad-id="adzone-halfpage_2" data-ad-type="halfpage" data-ad-position="2" class="c-ad__adzone advertising js-adzone"></p><div class="c-ad__placeholder"><img class="c-ad__placeholder__logo" src="https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-180x22-grey-6.svg" alt="" loading="lazy" pinger-seen="true"><span>ADVERTISEMENT</span></div></div><p>The French Socialists (S&amp;D) of Raphaël Glucksman, like their pairs in other big European countries, are slowly and gently recovering, and they still hope to overtake <em>Renew</em> and settle in the second position. </p><h2><strong>Italy</strong></h2><p>War and peace and the Ukrainian question are likely to become the most important topics for the next EU legislature. The European Parliament's political forces will be asked to overcome their divisions to tackle this major geopolitical challenge, which is why the results of the European elections in Italy seem relevant for the next legislature. </p><p>There, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's far-right party is set to win big.

So I would rather see the EPP working together with the ECR to negotiate deals with the social democrats and the liberals than these two making deals with identity and democracy."</p><p>Polls predict that the PD (S&amp;D) has increased its ratings to two times that of Salvini's Lega.</p><h2><strong>Spain</strong></h2><p>After Germany, Spain is the other stronghold of the EPP in this election. The PP's moderate-conservatives are to win the elections. Yet, the socialists of Prime Minister Sanchez are right behind them in the polls, and the result is still too close to call. </p><p>The Euronews Super Polls confirm that far-right Vox (ECR) will reach a rather good score, yet not as strong as its leadership and supporters expected.  </p><div class="c-ad c-ad-halfpage u-margin-bottom-3 u-show-for-small-only"><p data-ad-id="adzone-halfpage_4" data-ad-type="halfpage" data-ad-position="4" class="c-ad__adzone advertising js-adzone"></p><div class="c-ad__placeholder"><img class="c-ad__placeholder__logo" src="https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-180x22-grey-6.svg" alt="" loading="lazy" pinger-seen="true"><span>ADVERTISEMENT</span></div></div><p>However, EU voters will clearly shift the balance of the union to the right, reverberating in the EU institutions and affecting the reality throughout the bloc at the national level.</p><h2><strong>Poland</strong></h2><p>Poland is politically peculiar, as pollsters say the centre-left and the left are almost nonexistent. The clash of the giants in the Central European country will be between the Coalition of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, KO (EPP), and the PiS (ECR) ultraconservatives. </p><p>The PiS party is leading the polls over the KO,* yet the projections still suggest a result that is too close to call. </p></div></div>
