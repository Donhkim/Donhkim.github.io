                                        <p>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people.</p><p>The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">war with Hamas</a></span>, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-palestinians-court-ceasefire-01d093d21a1eadaa31af5708cf1cbf38">halt the offensive in Rafah.</a></span></p><p>Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians.</p>




    

<p>Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally.</p><p>“Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.”</p>
    
<p>Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.”</p><p>“We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said.</p><p>At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

<p>In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating.</p><p>An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported.

Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city.</p><p>Elsewhere in Rafah, the director of the Kuwait Hospital, one of the city’s last functioning medical centers, said it was shutting down and that staff members were relocating to a field hospital. Dr. Suhaib al-Hamas said the decision was made after a strike killed two health workers Monday at the entrance to the hospital.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth="">

<p>Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he says are Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries.</p><p>The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel’s strongest supporters.</p><p>The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images” from the strike on Rafah “are heartbreaking.” It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. “There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians.

<p>		</p>
<h2 id="what-will-each-side-argue">What will each side argue?</h2>
<p>Prosecutors have sought to make the case throughout the trial that Trump took part in a hush money scheme aimed at stifling bad press that could have hurt his chances in the 2016 presidential election, which he won.</p>
<p>They have shown the jury financial statements and questioned several witnesses, including <a href="/news/2024/5/9/trumps-lawyer-presses-stormy-daniels-on-day-14-of-hush-money-trial">Stormy Daniels</a>, the adult film star whose alleged affair with Trump is at the centre of the case. Trump has denied any sexual encounter took place.</p>
<p>The prosecution’s star witness, ex-Trump lawyer <a href="/news/2024/5/14/michael-cohen-to-resume-testimony-in-trump-hush-money-trial">Michael Cohen</a>, also <span>testified that the former president was directly involved in the scheme and authorised payments.</span></p>
<p>The defence, for its part, has sought to discredit the witnesses, including by painting Cohen as a serial liar. <a href="/news/2018/8/22/ex-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-pleads-guilty-implicates-president">Cohen pleaded guilty</a> in 2018 to federal charges related to the hush money payments as well as for lying to the US Congress.</p>
<p>But this week, Trump’s team does not have to prove anything or convince jurors of his innocence.</p>
<p>To prevent a conviction, they need to persuade at least one of the 12 jurors that prosecutors have failed to prove Trump’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt – the standard for criminal cases.</p>
<p>The defence may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-jury-being-asked-to-decide">What is the jury being asked to decide?</h2>
<p>While courtroom drama has dominated media coverage of the trial, the case boils down to whether Trump knowingly covered up a <a href="/podcasts/2024/5/22/hush-money-a-gag-order-and-protests-the-trump-stormy-daniels-trial">$130,000 payment to Daniels</a> for her silence in an effort to prevent her claims from derailing his 2016 White House bid.</p>
<p>The jury must decide not only if Trump caused the records of payments to be falsified but also if he did so to cover up another crime – an undeclared campaign donation in this case. Both findings would make the alleged offences felonies under New York state law.</p>
<p>In <a href="/news/2024/4/22/battlelines-drawn-jury-hears-opening-arguments-in-trump-hush-money-case">an interview with Al Jazeera</a> at the outset of the trial, Gregory Germain, a law professor at Syracuse University in upstate New York, summed up “the two essential elements” of the indictment: “Where’s the fraud and where’s the [secondary] crime?”</p>
<p>After each side delivers its closing arguments, the judge overseeing the case, <a href="/news/2024/5/10/five-takeaways-from-day-15-of-donald-trumps-new-york-hush-money-trial">Juan Merchan</a>, will give the jury lengthy instructions on how to interpret the law and evidence during their deliberations. This could happen as early as Wednesday.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<h2 id="how-do-jury-deliberations-work">How do jury deliberations work?</h2>
<p>The deliberations will proceed in secret in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that is intentionally opaque.</p>
<p>During their deliberations, the jurors will have access to all of the evidence and will be able to ask questions of the judge, who will confer with prosecutors and defence lawyers before deciding how to answer.</p>
<p>There is no time limit on how long the jury takes to deliberate. The jurors must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.</p>
<p>To reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it. If the jury is unable to unanimously decide a verdict, it deadlocks, and Merchan would declare a mistrial.</p>
<p>Once jurors inform the court they have reached a verdict, Merchan will summon the parties to the courtroom to hear it read by the jury foreperson. Merchan must still affirm the verdict and enter a final judgement. Either side may ask him to effectively overrule the jury.</p>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-if-trump-is-convicted">What happens if Trump is convicted?</h2>
<p><a href="/news/2024/2/5/how-will-donald-trumps-criminal-trials-affect-his-re-election-bid">If Trump is convicted</a>, it would likely be several weeks or months until he is sentenced.</p>
<p>As a first-time offender of a nonviolent crime, the ex-president and the Republican Party’s 2024 presumptive presidential nominee would likely be released on bond in the meantime.</p>
<p>The maximum sentence for Trump’s crime of falsifying business records is up to four years in prison. But while prison time is a possibility, experts said a fine, probation or community service are all far more likely options.</p>
<h2 id="will-a-conviction-affect-trump-s-election-chances">Will a conviction affect Trump’s election chances?</h2>
<p>That remains unclear.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/6-months-out-tight-presidential-race-trump-biden-poll/story?id=109909175" target="_blank">ABC News/Ipsos poll</a> from early May found that an overwhelming percentage of Trump supporters – 80 percent – said they would back the former president in November even if he is found guilty of a felony.</p>
<p>But 16 percent said they would reconsider their support if he is found guilty while 4 percent said they would withdraw it, the poll showed.</p>
<p>Another poll, published last week by Quinnipiac University, showed that 6 percent of Trump voters said they would be less likely to vote for Trump if he is convicted, 24 percent said they would be more likely to vote for him and 68 percent said it would not affect their choice.</p>
<p>While the percentage of voters who said they would ditch Trump if he is convicted is low, it could nevertheless prove important in a neck-and-neck contest between Trump and Biden.</p>
<p>“Will a conviction sink Trump? The vast majority of his supporters say it would be no big deal. But in an extremely tight race, that 6 percent could tip the balance,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.</p>

            China’s military kicked off two days of exercises last Thursday, sending warships and fighter jets around Taiwan and its outlying islands in what it called “a strong punishment for separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces.” It said the drills were designed to test its ability to “seize power” over the island.

            The vast majority of Taiwanese have no desire to live under Chinese rule. But under Xi Jinping, China’s most authoritarian leader in a generation, Beijing has grown more assertive and ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on its democratic neighbor.

                                        <p>VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran’s attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. </p><p>Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions imposed over the country’s controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-program-raisi-helicopter-crash-diplomacy-27de312812676e698219a38e69bb9233">under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader</a></span>, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that likely won’t change in the wake of last week’s helicopter crash that killed Iran’s president and foreign minister.</p><p>The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency also comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have carried out direct strikes on each other’s territory for the first time last month.</p>
    

<p>The report, seen by The Associated Press, said that as of May 11, Iran has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-iaea-nuclear-quarterly-report-bca494913fbc8ccc1621466fe9c221e6">the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February</a></span>. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.</p>



<p>By IAEA’s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%.</p>
    
<p>Also as of May 11, the report says Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the IAEA’s previous report.</p><p>Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-iaea-nuclear-program-143e3e3c015dbf9c17316ad60ff989da">the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi</a></span>, has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-iran-politics-government-mahmoud-ahmadinejad-6acdb64d36fcbe05b3ee725d8a585d96">to make “several” nuclear bombs</a></span> if it chose to do so.

<p>Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment.</p><p>Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes.</p><p>The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program.</p><p>Monday’s report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.”</p>
    

<p>According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran’s decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.”</p><p>The deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged.</p><p>Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations with IAEA on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran “on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,” the report said.</p><p>The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA’s years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad.</p>
    

<p>It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations” under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog.</p><p>The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data.</p><p>The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”</p>

The billionaire said in a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1720660977786433810" target="_blank">post on X</a> at the time that Grok was being trained by having “real-time access” to information on the site.

            Earlier this month, Google introduced an AI-generated search tool, which summarizes results so that users don’t have to click through multiple links to get quick answers to their questions. But the feature came under fire after it <a href="https://cnn.com/2024/05/24/tech/google-search-ai-results-incorrect-fix/index.html">provided false or misleading information</a>, prompting the company to walk back some factually incorrect results.
