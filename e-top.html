<ol>
<li>The presidents of Northwestern and Rutgers universities testified before the House Education and the Workforce Committee, defending their decisions to end pro-Palestinian encampments through negotiations rather than police force.</li>
<li>Northwestern's president, Michael Schill, stated that the police solution was not available to keep people safe, and it may not have been the wisest solution anyway, after witnessing police responses at other campuses across the country.</li>
<li>The universities' decisions to end the encampments were seen as a way to defuse the danger without ceding ground to protesters, who had been demanding that the universities sever ties with Israel.</li>
<li>On-campus protests have been increasingly prevalent in the United States, with recent incidents at Harvard University, UCLA, and Rutgers, among others. At Harvard, hundreds of students chanted "Free, Free Palestine" during graduation ceremonies, while 13 students who participated in a protest encampment would not receive diplomas alongside their classmates.</li>
<li>Republicans on the House committee accused the university leaders of tolerating antisemitism, particularly towards Northwestern and Rutgers, which had struck deals to end or limit protests without agreeing to meet the protesters' demand to sever ties with Israel.</li>

<p>The committee’s inquiry expanded to large, public universities, UCLA and Rutgers, after earlier hearings largely focused on private, Ivy League colleges. Meantime, at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/harvard-commencement-israel-palestinians-campus-protests-cc75b954538ab2cffa4425e55a26bbdb">Harvard’s commencement</a></span> Thursday, hundreds of students in graduation robes chanted “Free, Free Palestine” as they walked out of the ceremony. The school had announced on Wednesday that 13 students who participated in a protest encampment would not be able to receive diplomas alongside their classmates.</p>



<p>On Capitol Hill, committee Republicans accused the university leaders at the hearing of tolerating antisemitism, with particular scorn for Northwestern and Rutgers, where schools struck deals to end or limit protests.</p>
    
<p>Neither Northwestern nor Rutgers agreed to sever business ties with Israel — one of the protesters’ chief demands. Rutgers agreed to discuss the topic; Northwestern revived a committee on “investment responsibility.”</p>
    

<p>Other terms focused on expanding institutional support for Muslim and Arab students and scholars on campus, and Rutgers promised not to retaliate against those who participated in protests.</p><p>“Each of you should be ashamed of your decisions that allowed antisemitic encampments to endanger Jewish students,” said Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the committee chair. “Mr. Schill and Dr. Holloway, you should be doubly ashamed for capitulating to the antisemitic rule breakers.”</p><p>The presidents considered police action but said it was not necessary.</p><p>“We made a choice — that choice was to engage our students through dialogue as a first option instead of police action,” Holloway said. “We had seen what transpired at other universities and sought a different way.”</p><p>Schill said students were willing to negotiate and reach a compromise that did not include divestment, their main demand. He said agreeing to a space for Muslim students where they could eat and pray, like other faith communities had on campus, was something he supported.</p><p>“We had students who were willing to negotiate and gave up their demands,” Schill said. “We said no, nothing that singles out Israel. Let’s think about what will make the university stronger.”</p>
    

<p>Protesters hailed the agreements as victories. But on Capitol Hill, the presidents said they did not lose any ground.</p><p>“I would never recommend to the Board of Trustees divestment of anything or any academic boycott of Israel,” Schill said.</p><p>Even so, Foxx countered that Schill “created the perception” he would support divestment, “which encouraged other universities to cave on this.”</p><p>Each president denounced the rise of antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war. Schill and Block, who are Jewish, expressed their own disgust at some of the rhetoric and imagery used by protesters.</p><p>Block said public universities are in an especially tough bind as they work to shield students from discrimination while also upholding free speech. Unlike private universities, public universities are bound by the First Amendment. Even hateful speech must be protected, Block said, but UCLA draws the line when it crosses into threats and harassment.</p>
    

<p>He expressed remorse over the handling of a UCLA encampment that was attacked in early May. Counterprotesters threw traffic cones and released pepper spray in fighting that went on for hours before police stepped in, drawing criticism from Muslim students and political leaders. </p><p>“Tragically, it took several hours for law enforcement to quell the violence,” Block said “With the benefit of hindsight, we should have been prepared to immediately remove the encampment if and when the safety of our community was put at risk.”</p><p>On Wednesday, the police chief at UCLA was <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ucla-police-chief-campus-protests-israel-palestinians-432b22d5aba4ce44794ab3d2826fa20d">reassigned</a></span> “pending an examination of our security processes,” according to a statement from the school.</p><p>A new pro-Palestinian encampment appeared on the UCLA campus as Bock testified. “Our safety personnel are on-site and actively monitoring the situation,” Mary Osako, vice chancellor for UCLA Strategic Communications, said in a statement.</p>
    

<p>The encampment was abandoned when law enforcement arrived midday and declared it an unlawful assembly. Lines of officers pushed back a crowd of supporters that had gathered outside the encampment, but there were no clashes like those that occurred when a large camp was cleared three weeks earlier. A small group of demonstrators later staged a sit-in inside a nearby building before officers cleared them out. </p><p>As in previous hearings, Republicans pressed the leaders on discipline. They asked how many students had been expelled and how many faculty had been fired over antisemitic incidents since Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Israel.</p><p>None of the presidents said students had been expelled, though they said there are dozens of ongoing investigations. Four students were suspended at Rutgers, Holloway said.</p><p>Schill said the numbers aren’t a reflection of inaction.</p><p>“The fact that we didn’t have not yet suspended or expelled students does not mean that students have not received discipline,” he said. “There’s a wide range of discipline, and discipline has been meted out to many of those students.”</p><p>Tensions over the Israel-Hamas war have been high on campuses since the fall and spiked in recent weeks with a wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments that led to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-campus-protests-50d754675b710c9b983faf9ec9164d81">over 3,000 arrests</a></span> nationwide. </p><p>After the first congressional hearings in December, an outcry of criticism from donors, students and politicians led to the resignations of the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, who gave <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/harvard-penn-mit-president-congress-intifada-193a1c81e9ebcc15c5dd68b71b4c6b71">cautious, halting answers</a></span> to questions about whether calls for the genocide of Jews would violate their schools’ conduct policies.</p><p>In April, the committee turned its attention to Columbia President Minouche Shafik, who took a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/columbia-president-congress-israel-hamas-antisemitism-3255357b4443c1fb4bae8b8ea5774ee5">more conciliatory approach</a></span> to Republican-led questioning.

But the committee shifted its attention to Northwestern and Rutgers after those colleges struck deals with pro-Palestinian protesters to limit or disband encampments.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Christopher Weber and John Antczak in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Donald Trump held a rally in the Bronx, a famously Democratic area, where he was greeted by a crowd of thousands of supporters.</li>
<li>This was Mr. Trump's first rally in his hometown of New York City in eight years, and he claimed to have "helped build" the city during his presidency.</li>
<li>Mr. Trump took the opportunity to cover his favorite topics, including foreign policy, immigration, and himself, and even joked about being "overdosed" on himself due to his frequent appearances in the media.</li>
<li>The rally was seen as an effort by Mr. Trump to chip away at President Joe Biden's base among minority voters, including in Hispanic and Black neighborhoods like the Bronx.</li>
<li>The rally came just after a big week for Mr. Trump in the US courts, with Manhattan prosecutors resting their case in his high-profile "hush money" trial and a hearing in his classified documents case in Florida devolving into a chaotic shouting match.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Five senior defense figures in Russia have been arrested or detained on corruption charges in less than a month, indicating a purge in the defense ministry.</li>
<li>The latest arrest is that of Lt Gen Vadim Shamarin, deputy chief of the army's general staff and head of the Main Communications Directorate, accused of large-scale bribe-taking and placed in pre-trial detention for two months.</li>
<li>Other senior defense figures arrested or detained include Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov, Lt-Gen Yuri Kuznetsov, head of the defense ministry's personnel directorate, and a senior defense ministry procurement official, Vladimir Verteletsky.</li>
<li>The changes in the Russian defense ministry come after President Vladimir Putin replaced Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu with technocrat economist Andrei Belousov, reportedly an effort to boost efficiency and tackle corruption in the military.</li>
<li>The high-profile arrests reflect poorly on the military leadership, particularly Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of the Russian armed forces, just as Russia continues to be involved in the war in Ukraine.</li>

According to Russia’s Investigative Committee, he’s been charged with abuse of authority in the execution of a state defence order.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The roll-call of Russian defence figures who, within a month, have fallen from grace on corruption charges includes Deputy Defence Minister Timur Ivanov and Lt-Gen Yuri Kuznetsov, head of the defence ministry’s personnel directorate.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There’s also been change at the very top of the ministry. In a recent reshuffle, President Vladimir Putin <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-69000698" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">replaced his defence minister of 12 years, Sergei Shoigu</a>, with technocrat economist Andrei Belousov. The move was widely interpreted as an attempt by the Kremlin to boost efficiency in the Russian military and tackle corruption.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Shoigu was given a new job, that of secretary of the Russian Security Council. As for Vadim Shamarin’s boss, Valery Gerasimov, for now he remains chief of the general staff of the Russian armed forces.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But high-profile arrests in the ministry and the general staff reflect badly on the military leadership that has been directing Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"></p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There is a huge irony in all of this.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Remember Yevgeny Prigozhin? A year ago the leader of the Wagner mercenary group had publicly criticised military chiefs. He’d accused senior figures of incompetence and corruption, and blamed them for failures on the battlefield in Ukraine. Prigozhin had focused his ire particularly on Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov. He had demanded they be replaced.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The very public spat spiralled out of control, leading to a 24-hour mutiny. Wagner fighters took over key military installations in southern Russia and began marching towards Moscow. It was an unprecedented challenge to the Kremlin’s authority. But its principal aim had been to sweep aside the country’s top military brass.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It failed. President Putin sided with his military chiefs. Prigozhin lost his power battle with Mr Shoigu and Gen Gerasimov. And, shortly after, he lost his life in a plane crash.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But, one year on, a Kremlin-backed purge of the army has started.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And this tells us something about Vladimir Putin. The Russian president is averse to acting under pressure. Order him to sack a minister or an army general, and he’s unlikely to agree to it then and there. He won’t be told what to do.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">That doesn’t mean Mr Putin won’t act. At a time of his choosing.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">What isn’t clear is how far this purge of the Russian military will go; how many more senior figures will end up behind bars.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The former commander of Russia’s 58th army, Maj-Gen Ivan Popov, was arrested this week on suspicion of large-scale fraud. Last year he had announced he had been sacked after complaining to military leaders about problems on the front line in Ukraine.</p></div></div>

The company accused of transmitting the calls, Lingo Telecom, faces a $2 million fine, though in both cases the parties could settle or further negotiate, the FCC said. </p><p>Kramer has admitted orchestrating a message that was sent to thousands of voters two days before <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-new-hampshire-democrats-writein-campaign-597a1208e5a8696a3f6b794a91b9fb00">the first-in-the-nation primary</a></span> on Jan. 23. The message played an AI-generated voice similar to the Democratic president’s that used his phrase “What a bunch of malarkey” and falsely suggested that voting in the primary would preclude voters from casting ballots in November.</p>
    

<p>Kramer is facing 13 felony charges alleging he violated a New Hampshire law against attempting to deter someone from voting using misleading information. He also faces 13 misdemeanor charges accusing him of falsely representing himself as a candidate by his own conduct or that of another person. The charges were filed in four counties and will be prosecuted by the state attorney general’s office.</p>

<p>Attorney General John Formella said New Hampshire was committed to ensuring that its elections “remain free from unlawful interference.”</p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know about the 2024 Election Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020.

<p>“I am pleased to see that our federal partners are similarly committed to protecting consumers and voters from harmful robocalls and voter suppression,” said Formella, who was appointed by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu.</p>
    
<p>Lingo Telecom said it strongly disagrees with the FCC’s action, which it called an attempt to impose new rules retroactively. </p><p>“Lingo Telecom takes its regulatory obligations extremely seriously and has fully cooperated with federal and state agencies to assist with identifying the parties responsible for originating the New Hampshire robocall campaign,” the company said. “Lingo Telecom was not involved whatsoever in the production of these calls and the actions it took complied with all applicable federal regulations and industry standards.”</p>
    

<p>The New Hampshire calls falsely showed up to recipients as coming from the personal cellphone number of Kathy Sullivan, a former state Democratic Party chair who helped run the Biden write-in campaign. She said in an email Thursday that she hopes Kramer is learning “there is a steep price for trying to rig an election.”</p><p>“The swift, decisive action by the New Hampshire Department of Justice and the FCC hopefully will deter other bad and/or stupid actors who don’t respect democracy,” she said.</p><p>Kramer, who owns a firm that specializes in get-out-the-vote projects, did not respond to an email seeking comment Thursday.

<p>“Maybe I’m a villain today, but I think in the end we get a better country and better democracy because of what I’ve done, deliberately,” Kramer said in February.</p><p>Voter suppression carries a prison sentence of 3 1/2 to 7 years in prison.

<p>A U.S. soldier assigned to the Gaza pier mission was seriously injured on Thursday and medically evacuated to Israel, two defense officials confirmed to USNI News.<span id="more-110600"></span></p>
<p>The soldier was working on the staging platform two miles off the coast of Gaza, where trucks filled with aid packages are driven from cargo ships onto Army watercraft, the defense officials told USNI News. At the time of the injury, the roll-on roll-off cargo ship MV <em>Benevides</em> was attached to the platform.</p>
<p>Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, the deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, told reporters on Thursday that a total of three service members were injured in non-combat-related incidents at sea.</p>
<p>“Three injuries, two were very minor injuries and those individuals returned to duty. One individual is undergoing care at a local Israeli hospital,” Cooper told reporters during a Thursday Pentagon briefing.</p>
<p>Officials did not mention any attacks or incidents directly targeting the pier or the staging area two miles off the coast.</p>
<p>The pier has been in operation since last week, providing aid to Gaza. The trucks are loaded in Cyprus and sail to the staging area off the coast. From there, the trucks drive on to U.S. Army watercraft and sail to the pier, which is anchored to the beach in Gaza. After arrival, the humanitarian supplies are processed in a marshaling area before going to various warehouses and distribution points.</p>
<p>“In the last several days, we’ve delivered over a million pounds of aid into the hands of Palestinians. We can all feel good about that,” said Cooper.</p>

<p>Cooper and an official with the U.S. Agency for International Development summarized the first week of humanitarian pier operations for Pentagon reporters.</p>
<p>“The maritime corridor is a complex, multi-step process through which aid is moved to humanitarian organizations ready to facilitate its distribution to Palestinian communities throughout Gaza in an independent, neutral and impartial manner,” said Daniel Dieckhaus, USAID’s Levant response management team director.</p>
<p>Cooper emphasized that there are no U.S. personnel on the ground during the ground-based distribution in Gaza, stating that humanitarian workers are “solely” responsible for those phases of the process.</p>
<p>Of the 820 tons of aid delivered to Gaza since Friday, 506 tons have been distributed by the United Nations. However, Dieckhaus emphasized that the multinational humanitarian maritime corridor “does not replace land crossings and it is not intended to do so.” According to Dieckhaus, of the 70 truckloads of assistance delivered to Gaza on Wednesday, 23 came from the pier.</p>
<p>“I just want to be clear that this humanitarian maritime corridor alone is not enough to meet the staggering needs in Gaza, but it is an important addition. It is meant to augment, not replace or substitute for land crossings into Gaza,” said Dieckhaus.</p>
<p>Both officials also pushed back on reports of aid trucks getting looted after leaving the coastal distribution area, with Dieckhaus stating that these incidents “represent a minority of the overall shipments.” According to Cooper, of the 54 trucks sent out from the humanitarian maritime corridor over the last two days, only one had an incident.</p>

<p>Given its location in an active warzone, Cooper and Dieckhaus noted the challenges of the operation.</p>
<p>For example, Cooper said a Hamas drone attack on the Israeli Defense Forces only a few miles away from the pier temporarily paused all humanitarian activities, but did not say for how long. While this attack did not directly impact or target U.S. forces or the pier, it delayed aid convoys.</p>
<p>U.S. forces have dedicated around 1000 personnel and 16 ships to the operation, including the deployment of at least one counter rocket, artillery, and mortar system on the pier itself. While Cooper would not comment on the force protection deployed by U.S. forces, he said the deployment of these systems is “prudent planning.”</p>

<li>Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has called a special legislative session to ensure President Joe Biden appears on the November election ballot in Ohio.</li>
<li>DeWine is taking this step because Ohio is "running out of time" to add Biden to the ballot.</li>
<li>DeWine believes it is "unacceptable" and "absurd" that the situation has reached this point, and he wants to prevent Biden from being left off the ballot.</li>
<li>The special legislative session is necessary because Ohio's election process is complex and has strict timelines for adding candidates to the ballot.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi was interred at the Imam Reza Shrine in Mashhad, where millions of pilgrims visit each year. He died in a helicopter crash along with the country's foreign minister and six others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The funeral procession was attended by hundreds of thousands of people, but it drew smaller crowds compared to the 2020 funeral of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a US drone strike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ceremonies for Raisi have invoked the memory of Soleimani, and it is likely to spark an association between the two men. This could be a sign of the public's feelings about Raisi's presidency, which was marked by a harsh government crackdown on dissent during protests over the death of Mahsa Amini.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The government crackdown on dissent during protests over Amini's death has gone unmentioned in state television and newspapers, as well as Raisi's involvement in the mass executions during the 1988 Iran prison massacres.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iran is facing numerous challenges, including international sanctions, internal unrest, and tensions abroad, which are adding to the country's woes.</p>

                                        <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran interred President Ebrahim Raisi at the nation’s holiest Shiite shrine Thursday, days after he was killed in a helicopter crash that added to the woes of a country already beset by international sanctions, internal unrest and tensions abroad.</p><p>Raisi, who died alongside the country’s foreign minister and six others, was lowered by mourners into a tomb at the Imam Reza Shrine in Mashhad, where Shiite Islam’s eighth imam is buried and millions of pilgrims visit each year. Hundreds of thousands of people dressed in black crowded around the shrine under its iconic golden dome, wailing and beating their chests in sorrow in a sign of mourning common in Shiite ceremonies.</p><p>A hadith, or saying, attributed to the Prophet Mohammad states that anyone with sorrow or sin will be relieved by visiting there. But Thursday’s mass processional offered little salve for Iran and its many challenges.</p>
    

<p>The days of services for Raisi have not drawn the same crowds in this nation of over 80 million people as the 2020 gatherings for <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-ap-top-news-persian-gulf-tensions-tehran-international-news-a3cf7645bfde80e340abecb96338ddf8">Revolutionary Guard Gen.

<p>In Tehran alone, an estimated 1 million people turned out in the streets for Soleimani — something onlookers said they didn’t see at the men’s commemorations Wednesday. Yet the ceremonies have repeatedly invoked the general and included his image, which is likely to spark an association between the men.</p>
    
<p>It’s a potential sign of the public’s feelings about Raisi’s presidency, which included a harsh government crackdown on dissent during protests over <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-mahsa-amini-protests-un-report-366a199119720e69696a123560ef4018">the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini</a></span>, who was detained for allegedly not wearing her mandatory headscarf to authorities’ liking.</p><p>That crackdown, as well as Iran’s struggling economy, have gone unmentioned in the hours of coverage provided by state television and in newspapers. Never discussed was Raisi’s involvement in <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ee0e777abf19424281c363ef1978ac7f">the mass execution of an estimated 5,000 dissidents</a></span> at the end of the Iran-Iraq war. </p>
    

<p>Little information has emerged about the cause of the crash of the aging Bell helicopter that went down in a foggy, mountainous region. The country’s security forces were expected to investigate in the coming days.</p><p>Prosecutors have warned against any public signs of celebration around Raisi’s death, and a heavy security presence has been seen in Tehran since the crash.</p><p>Raisi, 63, had been discussed as a possible successor to Iran’s supreme leader, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-government-future-raisi-khamenei-succession-mojtaba-6d3b970bce0c6d436b25b550d887ceaf">the 85-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a></span>. The next presidential election is set for June 28. For now, there’s no clear favorite for the position among Iran’s political elite — particularly no one who is a Shiite cleric, like Raisi.</p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-mohammad-mokhber-raisi-crash-2cf93c2e6fb11f9c2aff13fed133db41">Acting President Mohammad Mokhber</a></span>, a relatively unknown first vice president until Sunday’s crash, has stepped into his role and even attended a meeting between Khamenei and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Wednesday.</p><p>Mashhad served as a longtime base for Raisi. In 2016, Khamenei appointed Raisi to run the Imam Reza charity foundation, which manages a vast conglomerate of businesses and endowments in Iran, as well as oversees the shrine. It is one of many bonyads, or charitable foundations, fueled by donations or assets seized after Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.</p>
    

<p>These foundations offer no public accounting of their spending and answer only to Iran’s supreme leader. The Imam Reza charity, known as “Astan-e Quds-e Razavi” in Farsi, is believed to be one of the biggest in the country. Analysts estimate its worth at tens of billions of dollars as it owns almost half the land in Mashhad, Iran’s second-largest city, about 750 kilometers (470 miles) east of Iran’s capital, Tehran.</p><p>Raisi is the first top politician in the country to be buried at the shrine, which represents a major honor for the cleric. His father-in-law serves as the city’s Friday prayer leader.</p><p>The deaths of Raisi and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-obit-hossein-amirabdollahian-helicopter-crash-foreign-minister-857a066350eb64709648e1830c34bc23">Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian</a></span> come as Iran continues to back militia groups in the wider Mideast to pressure its enemies, namely Israel and the United States. Mourners have chanted against both nations in the ceremonies.</p>
    

<p>State media circulated photos Thursday showing a meeting between Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard chief and the head of its expeditionary Quds Force and representatives from Hamas, Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels.</p><p>On Thursday morning, thousands of people dressed in black gathered along a main boulevard in the city of Birjand, where Raisi once served as its member on the Assembly of Experts in Iran’s South Khorasan province along the Afghan border. There and in Mashhad, mourners on the streets reached out to a truck carrying his casket, with some tossing scarves and other items against it for a blessing.</p><p>Meanwhile, former Foreign Ministers Mohammed Javad Zarif and Ali Akbar Salehi and other dignitaries paid respects to Amirabdollahian at Iran’s Foreign Ministry, where his casket was put on display. His body later was interred in Shahr-e Rey just outside of Tehran at the Abdol Azim shrine, another final resting place for those famed in Persian history.</p><p>“Give Soleimani our greetings,” a religious singer said as Amirabdollahian’s body was put into its final resting place, referring to the slain general.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writer Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.</p>
