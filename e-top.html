During his tenure, relations continued to deteriorate with the West as Iran enriched uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels and supplied bomb-carrying drones to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">Russia for its war in Ukraine</a></span>.</p>

<p>The crash killed all eight people aboard a Bell 212 helicopter that Iran purchased in the early 2000s, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. Among the dead were Iranian <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-obit-hossein-amirabdollahian-helicopter-crash-foreign-minister-857a066350eb64709648e1830c34bc23">Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian</a></span>, the governor of Iran’s East Azerbaijan province, a senior cleric from Tabriz, a Revolutionary Guard official and three crew members, IRNA said.</p><p>Iran has flown Bell helicopters extensively since the shah’s era. But aircraft in Iran face a shortage of parts because of Western sanctions, and often fly without safety checks. Against that backdrop, former Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif sought to blame the United States for the crash.</p><p>“One of the main culprits of yesterday’s tragedy is the United States, which ... embargoed the sale of aircraft and aviation parts to Iran and does not allow the people of Iran to enjoy good aviation facilities,” Zarif told The Associated Press.</p><p>Ali Vaez, Iran project director with the International Crisis Group, said that while U.S. sanctions have deprived Iran of the ability to renew and repair its fleet for decades, “one can’t overlook human error and the weather’s role in this particular accident.’’</p>
    

<p>Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst and consultant, said Iran likely is tapping the black market for parts to maintain the fleet, but questioned whether Iran has the maintenance skills to keep older helicopters flying safely.</p><p>“Black-market parts and whatever local maintenance capabilities they’ve got — that’s not a good combination,” he said.</p><p>There are 15 Bell 212 helicopters with an average age of 35 years currently registered in Iran that could be in active use or in storage, according to aviation data firm Cirium. </p><p>State TV gave no immediate cause for <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/live/helicopter-iranian-president-crash">the crash</a></span> in Iran’s East Azerbaijan province. Footage released by IRNA showed the crash site, across a steep valley in a green mountain range.</p><p>U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the U.S. continues to monitor the situation surrounding the “very unfortunate helicopter crash” but has no insight into the cause. “I don’t necessarily see any broader regional security impacts at this point in time,” he said.</p>
    

<p>White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Monday the death of Raisi and Amirabdollahian is not expected to have any substantive impact on difficult U.S.-Iran relations.</p><p>He added the U.S. expected the change in leadership would not change Iran’s support of Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Yemen-based Houthi rebels.</p><p>“We have to assume that the supreme leader is the one who makes these decisions and the supreme leader, as he as he did in the last so-called election, made sure to stack the deck with only candidates that met his mandates,” Kirby said. </p><p>For now, Khamenei has named the first vice president, Mohammad Mokhber, as caretaker, in line with the constitution. The election for a successor was to be held on June 28, IRNA said. Raisi’s funeral was to take place in Mashhad, the city where he was born, on Thursday, with other funerals to be held on Tuesday, state TV said.</p>
    

<p>Ali Bagheri Kani, a nuclear negotiator for Iran, will serve as the country’s acting foreign minister, state TV said.</p><p>Condolences <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/92ce7ff3851e632f8d347e253d38143b">poured in</a></span> from neighbors and allies after Iran confirmed there were no survivors. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on the social media platform X that his country “stands with Iran in this time of sorrow.” Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a statement released by the Kremlin, described Raisi “as a true friend of Russia.”</p><p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, China’s Xi Jinping and Syrian President Bashar Assad also offered condolences. Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, said he and his government were “deeply shocked.” Raisi was returning Sunday from Iran’s border with Azerbaijan, where he had inaugurated a dam with Aliyev, when the crash happened.</p><p>The death also stunned Iranians, and Khamenei declared five days of public mourning. But many have been ground down by the collapse of the country’s rial currency and worries about regional conflicts spinning out of control with Israel or even with Pakistan, which Iran exchanged fire with this year.</p><p>“He tried to carry out his duties well, but I don’t think he was as successful as he should have been,” said Mahrooz Mohammadi Zadeh, 53, a resident of Tehran. </p><p>Khamenei stressed the business of Iran’s government would continue no matter what — but Raisi’s death raised the specter of what will happen after the 85-year-old supreme leader either resigns or dies.

            The International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leader in Gaza <a href="https://cnn.com/2023/12/07/middleeast/yahya-sinwar-profile-intl/index.html">Yahya Sinwar </a>and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza, the court’s prosecutor Karim Khan told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview on Monday.
    </p>

            The warrants against the Israeli politicians mark the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. The decision puts Netanyahu in the company of the Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom the ICC issued an arrest warrant over Moscow’s war on Ukraine, and the Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, who was facing an arrest warrant from the ICC for alleged crimes against humanity at the time of his capture and killing in October 2011.

            By applying for the arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders in the same action, Khan’s office risks attracting criticism that it places a terror organization and an elected government on an equivalent footing.

            A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan’s application for the arrest warrants.

            Khan said the charges against Sinwar, Haniyeh and al-Masri include “extermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention.”
    </p>

            “The world was shocked on the 7th of October when people were ripped from their bedrooms, from their homes, from the different kibbutzim in Israel,” Khan told Amanpour, adding that “people have suffered enormously.”
    </p>

            Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people across several locations in southern Israel on October 7 and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. Many of the hostages are still being held in Gaza – Khan told Amanpour this meant crimes continued to be committed against “so many innocent Israelis … that are held hostage by Hamas and families that are waiting for their return.”
    </p>

            Khan told Amanpour his team has a “variety of evidence” to support the application for arrest warrants against Sinwar, Haniyeh and al-Masri, including authenticated video footage and photographs from the attacks as well as evidence from eyewitnesses and survivors.

            Responding to the announcement by Khan, Hamas said in a statement that it “strongly condemns the attempts of the ICC Prosecutor to equate victims with aggressors by issuing arrest warrants against a number of Palestinian resistance leaders without legal basis.”

            “Hamas calls on the ICC Prosecutor to issue arrest warrants against all war criminals among the occupation leaders, officers, and soldiers who participated in crimes against the Palestinian people, and demands the cancellation of all arrest warrants issued against Palestinian resistance leaders,” the group added.

            The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include “causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,” Khan told Amanpour.

            Other Israeli officials echoed his sentiments. Benny Gantz, a member Israel’s war cabinet, criticized Khan’s decision immediately after it was announced, saying that Israel was fighting “with one of the strictest moral codes in history, while complying with international law and boasting a robust independent judiciary.”

            “Drawing parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend itself from despicable terror to leaders of a blood-thirsty terror organisation is a deep distortion of justice and blatant moral bankruptcy,” he said, adding that the decision by the prosecutors “is in itself a crime of historic proportion to be remembered for generation.”

            Monday’s announcement is not the first time that the ICC acted in relation to Israel. In March 2021, Khan’s office launched an investigation into possible crimes committed in the Palestinian territories since June 2014 in Gaza and the West Bank.

            Located in The Hague, Netherlands, and created by a treaty called the Rome Statute first brought before the United Nations, the ICC operates independently. Most countries – 124 of them – are parties to the treaty, but there are notable exceptions, including Israel, the US and Russia.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Donald Trump's unusual behavior</strong>: During a speech at the National Rifle Association's annual meeting in Dallas, Texas, Trump appeared to freeze for more than 30 seconds, suddenly going silent at the lectern.</li>
<li><strong>Long delay for the speech</strong>: Trump kept the crowd waiting for over two hours after the scheduled start time of his speech on Saturday, causing some supporters to speculate about his behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Political implications</strong>: The incident has sparked debate and humor from Trump's political opponents, with some arguing that Trump's freezing moment is evidence that he is mentally unfit for office, given his frequent attacks on President Joe Biden's age and mental acuity.</li>
<li><strong>Context of the speech</strong>: Trump's speech was an address to the NRA, where he praised the state of Texas and its history, citing the bravery of cowboys and pioneers.</li>
<li><strong>Social media reaction</strong>: A clip of the moment was shared on social media, with @BidensWins tweeting "BREAKING: Donald Trump just glitched out and froze at his rally tonight. He is clearly unfit for office. Retweet so every American knows the truth."</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have successfully evacuated around 950,000 Palestinian civilians from the Gaza Strip in just two weeks, despite predictions that the evacuation would be difficult and deadly.</li>
<li>The IDF has taken control of around 30-40% of the city of Rafah, with about 60-70% of the city being completely evacuated. The remaining civilians, estimated to be around 300,000-400,000, are mostly concentrated in the Tel al-Sultan area near the Gaza coast.</li>
<li>The majority of those evacuated have moved to the northwest part of Gaza, with a smaller number relocating to central Gaza. A relatively small number of civilians returned to the Khan Yunis area, which had been considered a possible destination for hundreds of thousands of people.</li>
<li>Despite significant resistance from four Hamas battalions in Rafah, the IDF claims to have mostly taken the battalions by surprise and is now in the process of disarming and capturing them. Hamas's battalions have thus far not put up as hard a fight as they did in previous battles.</li>
<li>The IDF has taken control of most of the Philadelphi Corridor with Egypt, which is a key border crossing point. The military has destroyed many of Hamas's cross-border tunnels, but is still unsure about the number of remaining tunnels that still remain.</li>

There, it said that the civilians were moved in a much shorter time than from Rafah, with warnings issued in the morning, and the invasion starting in the afternoon on the same day.</p><p>The IDF has found additional tunnels in Jabalia and took apart an attempt by Hamas to establish a new command center there for unified fighting.</p><p>Unlike in Rafah, the Hamas fighters in Jabalia are not viewed as having as much of an opportunity to flee, though the IDF still did not give a set timeframe for finishing the latest Jabalia reinvasion.</p><p>If for months, there was reference to one to two Hamas battalions operating in central Gaza, the IDF said that these battalions are also being taken apart, by a mix of airstrikes and targeted invasions.</p><p>A smaller force contingent is needed for these attacks because the central Gaza forces were much smaller than the forces remaining in Rafah, but the bottom line was that the IDF could be converging on a point where all 24 Hamas battalions would be dismantled.</p><p>IDF sources suggested that this would signal achieving the first goal of the war, toppling Hamas as a military organization, even if other goals of the war, removal of Hamas as a political authority and return of the hostages, may still remain open questions.</p><p>According to one prediction, fighting a Hamas insurgency will require significant military resources at a minimum until October of this year, and possibly even somewhat beyond.

And it has ramped up military incursions around Taiwan's waters and airspace since his election win in January. </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Such military incursions by China have become a routine affair in the past few years, triggering fears of conflict. In his speech, Mr Lai called this the "greatest strategic challenge to global peace and stability".</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">But the 64-year-old also stuck closely to the formula used by his predecessor president Tsai Ing-wen, whose legacy will be defined by her cautious but steady handling of Beijing. </p></div><p id="dotcom-mpu_mid" class="dotcom-ad lazy" data-ad-slot="{}"></p><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Mr Lai, a doctor turned politician, won a three-way presidential race in January, securing an unprecedented third term for his. He had served as Ms Tsai's vice-president since 2020, and before that as her premier. In his younger days, he was known to be a more radical politician who openly called for Taiwanese independence, much to Beijing's ire. It labelled him a "troublemaker" ahead of the polls, and Chinese state media even suggested he should be prosecuted for secession. </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">The Chinese government is yet to issue a statement on Mr Lai's inauguration. However, the Chinese embassy in the UK held a press briefing over the weekend, asking the UK government to not endorse it. And earlier last week, a spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office warned that the island's new leader "must seriously" consider the question of whether he wants peaceful development or confrontation.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">And just as Mr Lai was being sworn in, China's Commerce Ministry announced sanctions against several US companies "involved in arms sales to Taiwan".</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">But on Monday, Mr Lai struck a far more conciliatory note. He reiterated he would not do anything to change the status quo - an ambiguous diplomatic status, which doesn't recognise Taiwan as a country despite its constitution and sovereign government. China insists on this and accuses major Taiwan allies such as the US of altering this delicate agreement by supporting the island. </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Vowing peace and stability, Mr Lai also said he would like to see a re-opening of exchanges across the Taiwan straits including Chinese tourist groups coming to Taiwan. But he said people on the island must not be under any illusion about the threat from China and that Taiwan must further strengthen its defences. </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">This too was a continuation of Tsai's policy. Taiwan's former president believed that strengthening defence and earning the support of key allies such as the US and Japan was key to deterring China's plans of invasion. Her biggest critics say this military investment risks provoking China, making Taiwan even more vulnerable. </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Nevertheless, yearly defence spending increased up to about $20bn (£16bn) under Ms Tsai, and Mr Lai has pledged even more funds. Taiwan has purchased new battle tanks, upgraded its fleet of F-16 fighter jets and bought new ones, and has built and launched a fleet of new missile ships to patrol the 100-mile Taiwan strait. Last September came the completion of what Ms Tsai considers the crowning achievement of her military program: Taiwan's first indigenously developed submarine. </p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 esMqKN"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-83607862-1 ijYvQn"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8252/production/_133326333_gettyimages-2153272434-2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8252/production/_133326333_gettyimages-2153272434-2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8252/production/_133326333_gettyimages-2153272434-2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8252/production/_133326333_gettyimages-2153272434-2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8252/production/_133326333_gettyimages-2153272434-2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8252/production/_133326333_gettyimages-2153272434-2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8252/production/_133326333_gettyimages-2153272434-2.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8252/production/_133326333_gettyimages-2153272434-2.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te (C), incoming First Lady Wu Mei-ju (L) and Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim (R) react after his inaugural speech after being sworn into office during the inauguration ceremony at the Presidential Office Building in Taipei on May 20, 2024." class="sc-83607862-0 jvrVsN"><span class="sc-83607862-2 jPBxZH">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 cvIHve"><figcaption class="sc-d523993f-0 ibDkCb">President William Lai (C), First Lady Wu Mei-ju (L) and Vice-President Hsiao Bi-khim (R) dance after the inauguration</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Taiwan's own allies are watching closely too, to see if his rhetoric is likely to aggravate tensions further.
