<li>Judge Juan M. Merchan threatened to remove Robert Costello, a witness for Donald Trump's defense team, from the trial due to his behavior on the stand, which included making comments under his breath and rolling his eyes.</li>
<li>Costello's behavior was "contemptuous" according to Judge Merchan, who noticed that he continued to speak after objections were sustained and made disparaging remarks about the process.</li>

<li>Trump's lawyers also asked Judge Merchan to stop the case from going to the jury and throw out the charges after prosecutors concluded their presentation of evidence. Merchan did not immediately rule on the request.</li>
<li>The judge ordered the jury to leave the courtroom to discuss proper courtroom decorum, telling Costello, "If you don't like my ruling, you don't say 'Jeez,' OK. And then you don't say 'strike it,' because I'm the only one that can strike testimony in the courtroom."</li>

    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP correspondent Julie Walker reports closing arguments are expected next Tuesday according to the judge in Donald Trump’s hush money trial after the prosecution rested their case, but the defense’s case continues.</p>
    
</div><p>The judge appeared unmoved by the argument, asking the defense attorney whether he believed that “as a matter of law, this person’s so not worthy of belief that it shouldn’t even be considered by the jury?”</p><p>“You said his lies are irrefutable,” the judge replied. “But you think he’s going to fool 12 New Yorkers into believing this lie?”</p><p>Cohen was the last witness — at least for now — for prosecutors, who are trying to prove that Trump sought to bury unflattering stories about himself and then falsified internal business records to cover it up as part of a scheme to illegally <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-opening-stormy-daniels-6beee9b99114898ee0dd60185d43bac5">influence the 2016 presidential election</a></span>. The defense has painted Cohen as a media-obsessed liar who is on a revenge mission aimed at taking down Trump.</p>
    

<p>The defense called Costello because of his role as a Cohen antagonist and critic in the years since their professional relationship splintered in spectacular fashion.</p><p>Costello had offered to represent Cohen soon after the lawyer’s hotel room, office and home were raided and as Cohen faced a decision about whether to remain defiant in the face of a criminal investigation or to cooperate with authorities in hopes of securing more lenient treatment.</p><p>Costello testified that Cohen told him Trump “knew nothing” about the $130,000 hush money payment to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-gag-order-d853768fff5fafbdee55623579889140">porn actor Stormy Daniels</a></span> that’s at the center of the case.</p><p>“Michael Cohen said numerous times that President Trump knew nothing about those payments, that he did this on his own, and he repeated that numerous times,” Costello told jurors.</p>
    

<p>Trump lawyer Emil Bove told the judge that the defense does not plan to call any other witnesses after Costello, though they may still call campaign-finance expert Bradley A. Smith for limited testimony. They have not said definitively that Trump won’t testify, but that’s the clearest indication yet that he will waive his right to take the stand in his own defense.</p><p>Back on the witness stand for a fourth day, Cohen told jurors earlier Monday that he stole from the Trump Organization after his 2016 holiday bonus was slashed to $50,000 from the $150,000 he usually received.</p><p>Cohen claimed to have paid $50,000 to a technology firm for its work artificially boosting Trump’s standing in a CNBC online poll about famous businessmen. Cohen said he gave the firm only $20,000 in cash in a brown paper bag, but he sought reimbursement from Trump for the full amount, pocketing the difference.</p>
    

<p>“So you stole from the Trump Organization?” defense attorney Todd Blanche asked.</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Cohen replied. Cohen said he never paid the Trump Organization back. Cohen has never been charged with stealing from Trump’s company.</p><p>Cohen is a key witness but also a complicated one. He admitted on the witness stand to a number of past lies, many of which he claims were meant to protect Trump. Cohen also <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/8b9d39ea54374ae296a9a8401bf58cb8">served prison time</a></span> after pleading guilty to various federal charges, including <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-michael-cohen-74aaf72511d64fceb1d64529207bde64">lying to Congress and a bank</a></span> and engaging in campaign-finance violations related to the hush money scheme. And he has made millions of dollars off critical books about the former president, whom he regularly slams on social media in often profane terms.</p><p>But when pushed by Blanche, Cohen stood by his recollection of conversations with Trump about the hush money payment to Daniels. Cohen testified that he spoke with Trump more than 20 times about the matter in October 2016.</p><p>“No doubt in your mind?” Blanche asked about whether Cohen specifically recalled having conversations with Trump about the Daniels matter. No doubt, Cohen said.</p><p>After more than four weeks of testimony about sex, money, tabloid machinations and the details of Trump’s company record-keeping, jurors could begin deliberating as soon as next week to decide whether Trump is guilty of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-arraignment-hush-money-81225510ef7638494852816878f612f0">34 felony counts of falsifying business records</a></span> in the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president.</p><p>The charges stem from internal Trump Organization records where payments to Cohen were marked as legal expenses. Prosecutors say they were really reimbursements for the payment to Daniels to keep her from going public before the 2016 election with claims of a sexual encounter with Trump. Trump says nothing sexual happened between them.</p><p>Trump has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers say there was nothing criminal about the Daniels deal or the way Cohen was paid.</p><p>“There’s no crime,” Trump told reporters after arriving at the courthouse Monday. “We paid a legal expense. You know what it’s marked down as? A legal expense.”</p><p>Prosecutors will have have an opportunity to call rebuttal witnesses once Trump’s witnesses are done. The judge, citing scheduling issues, said he expects closing arguments to happen May 28, the Tuesday after Memorial Day.</p><h2>____</h2><p>Richer reported from Washington.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The United Nations held a moment of silence on Monday to honor the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, despite his reputation for presiding over human rights abuses.</li>
<li>The request for the moment of silence came from Russia, China, and Algeria, and was honored by the UN Security Council, including the US Deputy Ambassador to the UN.</li>
<li>Israeli UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan slammed the moment of silence, calling it a "disgrace" and criticizing the UN for not doing enough to advance the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.</li>
<li>The State Department's spokesperson, Matt Miller, clarified that the US had previously criticized Raisi's involvement in human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings, but participated in the moment of silence as a matter of protocol.</li>
<li>The State Department pointed to Raisi's involvement in numerous human rights abuses, including the 1988 extrajudicial killing of thousands of political prisoners in Iran.</li>

            Martin Gruenberg, head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, will step down following a scathing independent investigation detailing pervasive sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying at the agency charged with regulating the banking sector.
    </p>

            “In light of recent events, I am prepared to step down from my responsibilities once a successor is confirmed,” Gruenberg said in a statement on Monday. “Until that time, I will continue to fulfill my responsibilities as Chairman of the FDIC, including the transformation of the FDIC’s workplace culture.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwfgwxh40000356ja1183bsj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Gruenberg’s announcement of his intent to resign comes hours after Sen. Sherrod Brown, a top Democrat who leads the Senate Banking Committee, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/20/economy/fdic-chair-gruenberg-senate-banking-committee/index.html">called for “new leadership”</a> at the FDIC. ﻿Gruenberg joined the FDIC board of directors almost two decades ago. He’s served as chair of the agency for nearly 10 of the past 13 years.
    </p>

            President Joe Biden will “soon” announce a new nominee to lead the FDIC, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sam Michel said in a statement on Monday following the news. “We expect the Senate to confirm the nominee quickly,” he added. However, there’s no guarantee that will happen, since confirmation processes have been known to drag on for months or longer, at which point Biden may no longer be in office.
    </p>

            With Gruenberg remaining until a successor is named, there won’t be a situation where Vice Chair Travis Hill, a Republican appointee, automatically becomes chair, leaving the agency deadlocked with one other Republican and two Democratic members on the FDIC’s board of directors.
    </p>

            Sen. Tim Scott, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, slammed Gruenberg’s decision not to resign immediately as well as Democrats for not putting more pressure on him to do so.

            “This draw-it-out strategy makes it clear that this administration is prioritizing their political agenda over protecting workers,” Scott said in a statement.

            The FDIC commissioned a report by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton, which ultimately spurred Gruenberg’s resignation. It confirmed the findings of a November <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/fdic-toxic-atmosphere-strip-clubs-lewd-photos-boozy-hotel-12c89da7?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal investigation</a> revealing a long-standing problematic culture. It did not find that Gruenberg alone was responsible for the issues described in depth in the report based on interviews with over 500 employees.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwfgngf9000t3b6jp7nhedjj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            However, it documented several instances where Gruenberg lashed out at subordinates “particularly when being delivered bad news or conveyed views with which he disagrees.” That caused staffers to delay delivering news they feared would upset him. Gruenberg’s temperament “may hinder his ability to establish trust and confidence in leading meaningful culture change,” the report added.
    </p>

            Gruenberg testified before lawmakers last week in a previously scheduled hearing with other top financial regulators, saying he takes “full responsibility” for the findings of the report. “I also acknowledge my own failures as Chairman, both in failing to recognize how my temperament in meetings impacted others and for not having identified deeper cultural issues at the FDIC sooner,” he said.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwfgpaou000x3b6jpmpscvgk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The FDIC declined to comment beyond Gruenberg’s statement on Monday.
    </p>

            While most Democrats stopped short of calling for Gruenberg to resign or be replaced, many expressed outrage at the mid-May hearings in the House and Senate that Gruenberg testified at.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwfgrv6700133b6j6ikg9hgn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “I’m pissed off… If it was me in my office, I’d probably be run out,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat during the hearing. “It just saddens me greatly,” he added, referring to the findings of the independent report.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwfgs1t900153b6jze78i6vi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            However, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren labeled the calls Gruenberg received to resign “purely political exercise.”
    </p>

            “Your resignation would do nothing to improve the culture of the FDIC but it would give Republicans a veto over bank policy,” she said at the Senate hearing where Gruenberg testified. For her, it appeared it would be sufficient for him to see through implementing all the recommendations of the report, which he said he would.

            The warrants against the Israeli politicians mark the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. The decision puts Netanyahu in the company of the Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom the ICC issued an arrest warrant over Moscow’s war on Ukraine, and the Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, who was facing an arrest warrant from the ICC for alleged crimes against humanity at the time of his capture and killing in October 2011.

            “The world was shocked on the 7th of October when people were ripped from their bedrooms, from their homes, from the different kibbutzim in Israel,” Khan told Amanpour, adding that “people have suffered enormously.”

            Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people across several locations in southern Israel on October 7 and took some 250 hostages into Gaza.

            Other Israeli officials echoed his sentiments.

            The ICC announcement on Monday is separate from the case that is currently being heard by the the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/11/middleeast/south-africa-israel-genocide-icj-hague-day-one-intl/index.html">accusation from South Africa</a> that Israel was committing genocide in its war against Hamas following the October 7 attacks.

            Monday’s announcement is not the first time that the ICC acted in relation to Israel. In March 2021, Khan’s office launched an investigation into possible crimes committed in the Palestinian territories since June 2014 in Gaza and the West Bank.

            Located in The Hague, Netherlands, and created by a treaty called the Rome Statute first brought before the United Nations, the ICC operates independently. Most countries – 124 of them – are parties to the treaty, but there are notable exceptions, including Israel, the US and Russia.

            Under the rules of the court, all signatories of the Rome Statute have the obligation to cooperate fully with its decisions.

I don't know what's going on with the Democrats. This role that they're trying to play, instead of… pulling up and saying, well, 'Here we go. This is your time. Congratulations. Let's kill it.

            It has been 12 years since the Australian has lived freely. Assange has spent the past five years in London’s high-security Belmarsh prison and nearly seven years before that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/uk/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-eviction-gbr-intl/index.html">holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy</a> in the city trying to avoid arrest.

	Trump Media and Technology Group, the company affiliated with former U.S. president <a href="https://variety.com/t/donald-trump/" id="auto-tag_donald-trump" data-tag="donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> that operates Truth Social, reported $770,500 in revenue for the first quarter of 2024 and a net loss of $327.6 million. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Shares in Sarasota, Fla.-based TMTG — which says it is a “safe harbor for free expression amid increasingly harsh censorship by Big Tech corporations” — began trading March 26, 2024, on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “DJT” following its merger with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC). At Monday’s closing price of $48.38/share, TMTG has a market capitalization of about $6.6 billion.

</p><p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Trump owns about 64.9% of the outstanding shares in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, making his stake worth about $5.5 billion currently (though he is restricted from selling TMTG shares for the six-month period after the company’s stock started trading publicly). His holdings of 114.75 million shares include 36 million in “earnout shares” officially determined by TMTG on April 26 in accordance with the DWAC merger agreement.

	</p>


<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In Q1, the company recorded $311 million in non-cash expenses arising from the conversion of promissory notes, and the associated elimination of prior liabilities, immediately before the closing of TMTG’s merger with DWAC. Trump Media and Technology Group had a first-quarter operating loss of $12.1 million based on adjusted EBITDA calculations; approximately half of that amount — $6.3 million — consisted of one-time payments related to the closing of TMTG’s merger with DWAC. The company reported an operating loss of $98.35 million for Q1 on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“At this early stage in the Company’s development, TMTG remains focused on long-term product development, rather than quarterly revenue,” the company said in announcing Q1 2024 results. “By adding features to Truth Social, launching live TV streaming, and building out its ecosystem, the Company aims to first develop a slate of best-in-class products that can then be leveraged to increase revenue and drive long-term value.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	TMTG said its “nascent advertising initiative” will “continue to evolve as TMTG implements its vision.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The company plans to launch a new “live TV streaming platform” for Truth Social’s app for Android, iOS, and web. In a subsequent phase, it said, TMTG will release “stand-alone Truth Social over-the-top (‘OTT’) streaming apps for phones, tablets and other devices,” followed by Truth Social streaming apps “for home TV.”

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	As of March 31, TMTG said, its balance of cash and cash equivalents was $273.7 million. The company “believes it has sufficient working capital to fund operations for the foreseeable future,” it said in announcing the Q1 results.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	TMTG’s quarterly report and financials were reviewed by Semple, Marchal &amp; Cooper, which the company appointed as its independent registered public accounting firm effective May 4, 2024. That came after <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-51" target="_blank">the SEC accused TMTG’s previous auditor, BF Borgers, of “massive fraud”</a> in preparing more than 1,500 regulatory filings for public companies.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Trump Media and Technology Group said that based on data provided to the company, as of April 29, 2024, the company’s stock was held by more than 621,000 shareholders, “the vast majority of whom are retail investors.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	TMTG launched Truth Social in early 2022; the company has not disclosed how many people use the service. “At this juncture in its development, TMTG believes that adhering to traditional key performance indicators, such as signups, average revenue per user, ad impressions and pricing, or active user accounts including monthly and daily active users, could potentially divert its focus from strategic evaluation with respect to the progress and growth of its business,” the company said in its 10-Q filing Monday.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Trump Media &amp; Technology Group was formed in 2021 after the former president was kicked off Twitter (now called X), Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other internet platforms, which said he had violated prohibitions against inciting violence in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, which aimed to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump’s accounts have been reinstated by X, Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, YouTube and others, but he continues to use Truth Social as his preferred social media platform. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“TMTG’s success depends in part on the popularity of our brand and the reputation and popularity of President Donald J. Trump. The value of TMTG’s brand may diminish if the popularity of President Donald J. Trump were to suffer,” the company said in a section of the 10-Q filing labeled “Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations.” The section continued, “Adverse reactions to publicity relating to President Donald J. Trump, or the loss of his services, could adversely affect TMTG’s revenues, results of operations and its ability to maintain or generate a consumer base. President Donald J. Trump is involved in numerous lawsuits and other matters that could damage his reputation. Additionally, TMTG’s business plan relies on President Donald J. Trump bringing his former social media followers to TMTG’s platform. In the event any of these, or other events, cause his followers to lose interest in his messages, the number of users of our platform could decline or not grow as we have assumed.”</p>
