<ol>
<li>Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's War Cabinet, has threatened to resign from the government if a new plan for dealing with the war in Gaza is not adopted within three weeks.</li>
<li>Gantz has proposed a six-point plan that includes the return of hostages, ending Hamas' rule, demilitarizing Gaza, and establishing an international administration.</li>
<li>The threat from Gantz puts Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a precarious position, as it would leave him more reliant on far-right allies who take a hardline approach to negotiations with Hamas.</li>
<li>Gantz's resignation would be a significant blow to Netanyahu, who is already facing criticism for his handling of the war in Gaza.</li>
<li>Gantz's departure would also leave Netanyahu more beholden to his far-right allies, who are opposed to a permanent cease-fire with Hamas and want to see Israel reoccupy Gaza.</li>

The plan also supports efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia and widen military service to all Israelis.</p>
    

<p>He gave a June 8 deadline.</p><p>“If you choose the path of fanatics and lead the entire nation to the abyss — we will be forced to quit the government,” he said.</p><p>Netanyahu in a statement reported by Israeli media responded by saying Gantz had chosen to issue an ultimatum to the prime minister instead of to Hamas, and called his conditions “euphemisms” for Israel’s defeat.</p>



<p>Gantz, a longtime political rival of Netanyahu, joined his coalition and the War Cabinet in the early days of the war in a gesture at national unity.</p>
    
<p>His departure would leave Netanyahu even more beholden to far-right allies who take a hard line on negotiations over a cease-fire and hostage release, and who believe Israel should occupy Gaza and rebuild Jewish settlements there.</p><p>Gantz spoke days after Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, the third member of the War Cabinet, said he would not remain in his post if Israel elected to reoccupy Gaza. Gallant also <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-05-15-2024-e9696aa2da25e447219f2be0c1926b11">called on the government</a></span> to make plans for Palestinian administration of the enclave.</p>
    

<p>In what will be seen by many as a swipe at Netanyahu, Gantz said “personal and political considerations have begun to penetrate into the holy of holies of Israel’s security.” Netanyahu’s critics accuse the prime minister of seeking to prolong the war to avoid new elections, allegations he denies.</p><p>Polls suggest Netanyahu would be replaced in elections, with Gantz the most likely candidate to be the next prime minister. That would expose Netanyahu to prosecution on longstanding corruption charges.</p><p>“The people of Israel are watching you,” Gantz said in his prime-time address to Netanyahu. </p><p>Netanyahu is under growing pressure on multiple fronts. Hard-liners want the military offensive on Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah to press ahead. Top ally the U.S. and others have warned against the offensive on a city where more than half of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million had sheltered — hundreds of thousands have now fled — and they have <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-netanyahu-3591fb5f82b22cf8e5d1060fccaef115">threatened</a></span> to scale back support over Gaza’s humanitarian and hunger crisis.</p><p>The U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, will be in Saudi Arabia and Israel this weekend to discuss the war and is scheduled on Sunday to meet with Netanyahu, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-holocaust-gaza-war-hamas-netanyahu-117f2ac858fb40ba46df40650e2d2e3a">who has declared</a></span> that Israel would “stand alone” if needed.</p>
    

<p>Many Israelis, anguished over the hostages and accusing Netanyahu of putting political interests ahead of all else, want a deal to stop the fighting and get them freed. There was fresh frustration Friday when the military said its troops in Gaza <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-hostages-shani-louk-a37e4fd656b46be36c4c659a9c2aac7d">found the bodies of three hostages</a></span> killed by Hamas in the Oct. 7 attack. The discovery of the body of a fourth hostage was announced Saturday.</p><p>Thousands of Israelis again rallied Saturday evening to demand a deal along with new elections.</p><p>The latest talks in pursuit of a cease-fire in Gaza, mediated by Qatar, the United States and Egypt, have brought little. A vision beyond the war is also uncertain.</p><p>Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more. The Israeli offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians in Gaza, local health officials say.</p>
    

<p>Gantz echoed Netanyahu’s call for the return of hostages, ending Hamas’ rule and demilitarizing the territory. But he said an international administration should be set up there, apparently ruling out long-term Israeli occupation.</p><p>“We will not allow any outside power, friendly or hostile, to impose a Palestinian state on us,” he added.</p><p>Netanyahu has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control over Gaza and partner with local Palestinians who are not affiliated with Hamas or the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. But Netanyahu said it is impossible to plan for such a postwar authority before Hamas is defeated.</p>
    

<p>In March, Gantz met with U.S. officials in Washington to discuss the war, earning a rebuke from Netanyahu. He had been widely expected to leave the government once the heavy fighting in Gaza subsides, signaling the period of national unity established after the Oct. 7 attack has ended.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Krauss and Jeffery reported from Jerusalem.

<li>Shanahan argues that when lawmakers engage in personal insults rather than focused policy debate, it undermines the authority of the legislature in the eyes of the public.</li>
<li>Greene's behavior has also been criticized for being "absolutely unacceptable" by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and has sparked international attention, with experts suggesting it may further erode public trust in the institution.</li>

    <p>Here are five key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Federal investigators discovered six underage workers at a large poultry plant in north Alabama, Mar Jac Poultry, and are asking a judge to stop the sale of chicken produced with child labor.</li>
<li>The U.S. Department of Labor filed a civil action against Mar Jac on May 7 to stop the production and sale of goods tainted with child labor through May 31.</li>
<li>According to court documents, investigators found children working on the kill floor deboning poultry and cutting carcasses on May 1, 2024, and the company continued to remove goods from the facility despite knowing about the child labor.</li>
<li>Mar Jac Poultry's lawyers claim that the employees used forged documents, passed the E-verify system, and were terminated after their real ages came to light.</li>
<li>The company's lawyers argue that the court order would create undue hardship for over 1,000 workers at the plant and is an unprecedented move that would have significant consequences for the company and the local community.</li>

In March, the agency required a Tennessee company to set aside $1.5 million in profits as a punishment for using illegal child labor.</p><p id="inarticle-16"></p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CV7G5WRYU5ADXODFL2QQLLZHTU">The investigation began when the agency received a tip that workers under age 18 were employed hanging live chickens on hooks attached to conveyor belts, documents said. Investigators found two 16-year-olds and two 17-year-olds working on a floor where workers eviscerated and hung chicken carcasses. In later court filings, attorneys said two more underage employees had been identified.</p><p id="inarticle-17"></p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PSVZZNB3VBC4JK6ZK527XTCIVA">Berkowitz said the teens were working on the “kill floor,” one of the harshest environments in the plant and an area where workers face high risks of injury. She said the company was already under scrutiny after the death in Hattiesburg last year.</p><p id="inarticle-18"></p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FID22LN3ARGINNNY6IY73GKM6A">“To then find that there are kids in Mar Jac in the neighboring state is just showing that this is not a one off,” Berkowitz said. “That this is how this company does business. That they just thumb their nose at the law.”</p><p id="inarticle-19"></p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="U35DYPCDN5F4HCDCBIJNS7VAIY">In a court filing, lawyers for Mar Jac said the company should not be barred from selling or shipping chicken because a handful of underage workers used falsified documents.</p><p id="inarticle-20"></p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="V32NAF7Y4FC55K2QH3P57NB3F4">“If the District Court grants a TRO prohibiting the transportation of tens of millions of pounds of chicken products and throwing a thousand workers out of their jobs based on the discovery of three alleged child labor violations already conclusively abated, it will be boldly going where no court has gone before,” the filing said.</p><p id="inarticle-21"></p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AS7WZYW4XRAVZJKJNX2TS6LG34">Berkowitz said the recent cases against Mar Jac show the company has a pattern of employing underage workers.</p><p id="inarticle-22"></p><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NLPYO3VRLZBSHODS53BMONYCZU">“There wouldn’t be children in these plants if the companies didn’t put out the word that they would look the other way,” Berkowitz said.</p><p id="inarticle-23"></p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hamas has rejected the US-built pier off the Gaza Strip, stating that it is not a substitute for opening all land crossings under Palestinian supervision and rejecting any military presence on Palestinian land.</li>
<li>The first shipment of aid, containing badly needed supplies, has been delivered to Gaza through the newly built US pier, marking the start of an operation that could see 150 truckloads of aid per day.</li>
<li>The aid delivery comes as Israeli restrictions on border crossings and heavy fighting have hindered the delivery of food and other supplies to Gaza for seven months, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.</li>
<li>While the US and aid groups welcome the aid delivery, they emphasize that the floating pier project is not a permanent solution and that all land crossings need to be opened under Palestinian supervision to address the long-term needs of the population.</li>
<li>The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has been ongoing for seven months, with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and blockade of Gaza causing significant suffering and displacement among the Palestinian population.</li>

US military officials anticipate the aid shipment operation could scale up to 150 truckloads a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The EU welcomed the first shipment from Cyprus to the Gaza pier&lt;/strong&gt;, but called on Israel to “expand deliveries by land and to immediately open additional crossings”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The US aid chief said the new sea corridor could not be a substitute for land crossings, and warned that deliveries of food and fuel entering Gaza had slowed to “dangerously low levels”. &lt;/strong&gt;The head of the US Agency for International Development (USAid), Samantha Power said: “Every moment that a crossing is not open, that trucks are not moving, or where aid cannot safely be distributed, increases the terrible human costs of this conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Israel said it killed two senior Islamic Jihad militants in separate airstrikes in the northern West Bank and in Rafah. &lt;/strong&gt;The armed wing of Islamic Jihad confirmed that a local commander was killed in an overnight strike on the occupied West Bank’s Jenin refugee camp. However there was no immediate comment from the group on the army’s announcement that a “significant” operative was killed in Rafah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Austria said on Saturday it will restore its funding to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa)&lt;/strong&gt; after suspending it over allegations that staff were involved in the 7 October Hamas attacks. A total of €3.4m ($3.7m) in funds have been budgeted for 2024, and the first payment is expected to be made in the summer, Austria’s foreign ministry said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New divisions have emerged among Israel’s leaders over postwar Gaza’s governance&lt;/strong&gt;, with an unexpected Hamas fightback in parts of the Palestinian territory piling pressure on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu came under personal attack from Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant for failing to rule out an Israeli government in &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza\"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; after the war. &lt;strong&gt;Netanyahu’s war planning also came under recent attack by army chief Herzi Halevi as well as top Shin Bet security agency officials&lt;/strong&gt;, according to Israeli media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Israeli military said its air forces “struck over 70 targets” across the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;while ground troops “continue precise operations” in eastern Rafah.&lt;/strong&gt; The Kuwaiti hospital said an overnight Israeli strike killed two people in a displacement camp in Rafah, with witnesses reporting heavy gunfire and shelling in the city’s south-east and jets bombarding its eastern areas. The army said its forces “conducted targeted raids” in Rafah and found weapons and explosives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they fired anti-tank missiles and mortars at Israeli forces massing to the east, south-east and inside the Rafah border crossing&lt;/strong&gt; with Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFP correspondents, witnesses and medics said there were intense battles overnight in the northern Jabalia refugee camp, after the Israeli army reported on Friday “perhaps the fiercest” violence in the town in more than seven months of war. &lt;/strong&gt;Israeli forces “eliminated terrorists in a number of battles” in the Jabalia area and parts of central Gaza, the army said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Palestinian sources in Rafah told AFP that Israeli forces were operating in the city’s al-Salam and Jenina neighbourhood as well as on the Philadelphi route along the Egyptian border.&lt;/strong&gt;“Troops are advancing and retreating around these areas,” a security source said. Cairo, which has been involved in mediation efforts during the war, says a potential Israeli takeover of Philadelphi could violate its landmark 1979 peace deal with Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In northern Gaza’s Beit Lahia, witnesses reported airstrikes near Kamal Adwan hospital on Saturday. &lt;/strong&gt;The hospital’s director Hussam Abu Safiya told AFP on Friday that the facility, which has received “large numbers of injured and killed” from fighting in nearby Jabalia, was running low on medical supplies and fuel to power generators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least 35,386 Palestinians have been killed and 79,366 have been wounded in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October&lt;/strong&gt;, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday. The Hamas-run health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;German-Israeli Shani Louk’s father says that finally laying his daughter to rest will be a gift after her body was recovered from Gaza&lt;/strong&gt;, months after she was killed in Hamas’s 7 October attack on southern &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. Nissim Louk said the funeral will be held on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One person was reportedly killed and other passengers were severely injured after a car was struck by a drone in the western part of Rafah&lt;/strong&gt;, said Al Jazeera correspondent &lt;a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/author/hani_mahmoud_2011101793657547442\"&gt;Hani Mahmoud&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday. Mahmoud, who is reporting from Deir el-Balah, said the car was on the way to central Gaza on the coastal road. The Guardian has been unable to independently verify the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;British security firm Ambrey said on Saturday it had received information that a Panama-flagged crude oil tanker had been attacked approximately 10 nautical miles southwest of Yemen’s Mokha. &lt;/strong&gt;Ambrey later added that the tanker had received assistance and one of its steering units was reportedly functional. It did not indicate who provided the assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earlier on Saturday, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency said a vessel in the Red Sea was struck by an unknown object and sustained slight damage. &lt;/strong&gt;“The vessel and crew are safe and continuing to its next port of call,” UKMTO said in an advisory note, adding the incident occurred 76 nautical miles northwest of Yemen’s Hodeidah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;","elementId":"902e62e4-eaf3-4601-9edc-cd7e0e52a58c"}],"attributes":{"pinned":false,"keyEvent":false,"summary":true},"blockCreatedOn":1716042649000,"blockCreatedOnDisplay":"15.30 BST","blockLastUpdated":1716044607000,"blockLastUpdatedDisplay":"16.03 BST","blockFirstPublished":1716044405000,"blockFirstPublishedDisplay":"16.00 BST","blockFirstPublishedDisplayNoTimezone":"16.00","title":"Closing summary","contributors":[],"primaryDateLine":"Sat 18 May 2024 16.03 BST","secondaryDateLine":"First published on Sat 18 May 2024 08.17 BST"},{"id":"6648828c8f08fcbf82832c60","elements":[{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TextBlockElement","html":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Austria&lt;/strong&gt;

 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>Hamas issued a statement on Friday saying the US-built pier off the Gaza Strip is no alternative to opening all land crossings under Palestinian supervision, adding that they reject any military presence on Palestinian land.</strong> Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza" data-link-name="in body link">Gaza</a> Strip started rolling across a newly built US pier and into Gaza for the first time.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>The bodies of three hostages kidnapped by Hamas, including the German-Israeli Shani Louk, have been retrieved from Gaza by the Israeli military, it announced. </strong>The other two hostages were identified as Amit Buskila, 28, and Itzhak Gelerenter, 56, according to the military spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, who said the three victims were taken to Gaza after being killed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas" data-link-name="in body link">Hamas</a> at the Nova music festival.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>With key land crossings closed or operating at limited capacity due to fighting, some relief supplies have begun to flow into Gaza via a temporary, floating pier constructed by the US. </strong>The Israeli army said 310 pallets began moving ashore in “the first entry of humanitarian aid through the floating pier”.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>In the coming days, about 500 tonnes of aid are expected to be delivered to Gaza through the pier</strong>, according to US Central Command (Centcom). US military officials anticipate the aid shipment operation could scale up to 150 truckloads a day.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>The EU welcomed the first shipment from Cyprus to the Gaza pier</strong>, but called on Israel to “expand deliveries by land and to immediately open additional crossings”.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>The US aid chief said the new sea corridor could not be a substitute for land crossings, and warned that deliveries of food and fuel entering Gaza had slowed to “dangerously low levels”. </strong>The head of the US Agency for International Development (USAid), Samantha Power said: “Every moment that a crossing is not open, that trucks are not moving, or where aid cannot safely be distributed, increases the terrible human costs of this conflict.”</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>Israel said it killed two senior Islamic Jihad militants in separate airstrikes in the northern West Bank and in Rafah. </strong>The armed wing of Islamic Jihad confirmed that a local commander was killed in an overnight strike on the occupied West Bank’s Jenin refugee camp. However there was no immediate comment from the group on the army’s announcement that a “significant” operative was killed in Rafah.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>Austria said on Saturday it will restore its funding to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa)</strong> after suspending it over allegations that staff were involved in the 7 October Hamas attacks. A total of €3.4m ($3.7m) in funds have been budgeted for 2024, and the first payment is expected to be made in the summer, Austria’s foreign ministry said in a statement.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>New divisions have emerged among Israel’s leaders over postwar Gaza’s governance</strong>, with an unexpected Hamas fightback in parts of the Palestinian territory piling pressure on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu came under personal attack from Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant for failing to rule out an Israeli government in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza" data-link-name="in body link">Gaza</a> after the war. <strong>Netanyahu’s war planning also came under recent attack by army chief Herzi Halevi as well as top Shin Bet security agency officials</strong>, according to Israeli media reports.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>Israeli military said its air forces “struck over 70 targets” across the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours</strong> <strong>while ground troops “continue precise operations” in eastern Rafah.</strong> The Kuwaiti hospital said an overnight Israeli strike killed two people in a displacement camp in Rafah, with witnesses reporting heavy gunfire and shelling in the city’s south-east and jets bombarding its eastern areas. The army said its forces “conducted targeted raids” in Rafah and found weapons and explosives.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they fired anti-tank missiles and mortars at Israeli forces massing to the east, south-east and inside the Rafah border crossing</strong> with Egypt.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>AFP correspondents, witnesses and medics said there were intense battles overnight in the northern Jabalia refugee camp, after the Israeli army reported on Friday “perhaps the fiercest” violence in the town in more than seven months of war. </strong>Israeli forces “eliminated terrorists in a number of battles” in the Jabalia area and parts of central Gaza, the army said.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>Palestinian sources in Rafah told AFP that Israeli forces were operating in the city’s al-Salam and Jenina neighbourhood as well as on the Philadelphi route along the Egyptian border.</strong>“Troops are advancing and retreating around these areas,” a security source said. Cairo, which has been involved in mediation efforts during the war, says a potential Israeli takeover of Philadelphi could violate its landmark 1979 peace deal with Egypt.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>In northern Gaza’s Beit Lahia, witnesses reported airstrikes near Kamal Adwan hospital on Saturday. </strong>The hospital’s director Hussam Abu Safiya told AFP on Friday that the facility, which has received “large numbers of injured and killed” from fighting in nearby Jabalia, was running low on medical supplies and fuel to power generators.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>At least 35,386 Palestinians have been killed and 79,366 have been wounded in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October</strong>, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday. The Hamas-run health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>German-Israeli Shani Louk’s father says that finally laying his daughter to rest will be a gift after her body was recovered from Gaza</strong>, months after she was killed in Hamas’s 7 October attack on southern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel" data-link-name="in body link">Israel</a>. Nissim Louk said the funeral will be held on Sunday.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>One person was reportedly killed and other passengers were severely injured after a car was struck by a drone in the western part of Rafah</strong>, said Al Jazeera correspondent <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/author/hani_mahmoud_2011101793657547442" data-link-name="in body link">Hani Mahmoud</a> on Saturday. Mahmoud, who is reporting from Deir el-Balah, said the car was on the way to central Gaza on the coastal road. The Guardian has been unable to independently verify the report.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>British security firm Ambrey said on Saturday it had received information that a Panama-flagged crude oil tanker had been attacked approximately 10 nautical miles southwest of Yemen’s Mokha. </strong>Ambrey later added that the tanker had received assistance and one of its steering units was reportedly functional. It did not indicate who provided the assistance.</p></li>
 <li class="dcr-iy9ec7"><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><strong>Earlier on Saturday, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency said a vessel in the Red Sea was struck by an unknown object and sustained slight damage. </strong>“The vessel and crew are safe and continuing to its next port of call,” UKMTO said in an advisory note, adding the incident occurred 76 nautical miles northwest of Yemen’s Hodeidah.</p></li>

<ol>
<li>The United Automobile Workers (UAW) union has suffered a setback in its efforts to organize other auto factories in the South after a vote at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama.</li>
<li>The vote resulted in a rejection of the union with 56% of workers voting against the UAW.</li>
<li>Despite this setback, the UAW has had successes this year, including a vote by workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee to join the union, as well as a new contract with improved pay and benefits for members at several North Carolina factories owned by Daimler Truck.</li>
<li>The loss may impact the UAW's confidence in its efforts to organize other plants, but experts believe the union is committed to its long-term efforts to organize the auto industry in the South.</li>
<li>The UAW is likely to reassess its strategy and approach going forward, but it is expected to continue its efforts to organize workers in the auto industry.</li>

In April, workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee voted to join the union, the first large nonunion auto plant in the South to do so. Weeks later, the union negotiated a new contract bringing significant pay and benefit improvements for its members at several North Carolina factories owned by Daimler Truck.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">“Losing at Mercedes is not death for the union,” said Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. “It just means they’ll have less confidence going to the next plant. The U.A.W. is in it for the long run. I don’t think they’re going to stop just because they lost here.”</p><p class="css-zry96z" aria-live="polite" role="note"><a class="css-1081t4c" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=8WXW7">Subscribe to The Times</a> to read as many articles as you like.</p></div></div></div>
