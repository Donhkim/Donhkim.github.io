            The Supreme Court’s decision was 6-3, with the court’s liberals in dissent. Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a lengthy and strongly worded dissent in which she excoriated the court for its decision.

            Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in Monday’s opinion, “We conclude that under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of presidential power requires that a former president have some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in office. At least with respect to the President’s exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute.”

            “The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law,” Roberts also wrote.

            The chief justice said the trial court will have to assess what of Trump’s alleged conduct is immunized under the new test handed down by the high court, and the opinion said that additional briefing will be needed for the trial court to do so.
    </p>

            “We accordingly remand to the District Court to determine in the first instance — with the benefit of briefing we lack — whether Trump’s conduct in this area qualifies as official or unofficial,” wrote Roberts, who said there was a lack of “factual analysis” in the previous lower court opinions rejecting Trump’s immunity.

            She took issue with how the court had ruled that evidence from Trump’s official acts should be excluded from the trial, writing that there was no reason to depart from the “familiar and time-tested procedure” that would allow for such evidence to be included.

His legal team says they believe it is possible that special counsel Jack Smith’s case is now completely undermined because any communication Trump had with then-Vice President Mike Pence or Department of Justice officials could be considered official, precluding it from being introduced at trial.

            The team also said it could even help Trump in the classified documents case, though the initial views do not necessarily mean that’s how the legal process will ultimately play out.

            The Supreme Court made clear that unofficial actions do not receive immunity, and Smith has long made clear that he feels he could continue the case based on those unofficial actions. In that sense, if Smith narrowed his indictment, lower courts could hear the Trump trial this year.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly34hyfz001p3b6kbzedh49d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            But the high court also left a lot of work for those lower courts to sort out what constitutes an official act versus a private one.

            Perhaps even more important, the majority made clear that official acts cannot be considered at all as evidence in a potential trial, which could make it much harder for Smith to demonstrate Trump’s motive and other aspects of Smith’s case against Trump. Roberts wrote that the lower courts may not look into a former president’s motive.
    </p>

            “Certain allegations – such as those involving Trump’s discussions with the Acting Attorney General – are readily categorized in light of the nature of the president’s official relationship to the office held by that individual,” Roberts wrote.

            “Other allegations – such as those involving Trump’s interactions with the vice president, state officials, and certain private parties, and his comments to the general public – present more difficult questions,” Roberts wrote.
    </p>

            But Roberts said it is lower courts that must decide whether those actions “are subject to immunity, that analysis ultimately is best left to the lower courts to perform in the first instance.”

            Sotomayor, writing for the two other liberal justices, said the court’s ruling “makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of Government, that no man is above the law.”

It was a previously scheduled trip to the presidential retreat in Maryland for a photo shoot with Annie Leibovitz for the upcoming Democratic National Convention. </p><p>But the gathering was also an exercise in trying to figure out how to quell Democratic anxiety that has exploded following Thursday’s performance. </p><p>While his family was aware of how <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-debate-age-democrats-b93d7ffaad75fd423ea3953fe16287f0">poorly he performed</a></span> against Donald Trump, they also continue to think he’s the best person to beat the Republican presumptive nominee. They also believe he is capable of doing the job of president for another four years, according to the people who were not authorized to speak publicly about internal discussions and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. </p>

Both believe the president shouldn’t bow out when he’s down, and believe that he can come back from what they see as one subpar performance. The family questioned how he was prepared for the debate by staff and wondered if they could have done something better, the people said. </p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know about the 2024 Election Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020.

<ol>
<li><strong>Supreme Court sends laws back to lower courts</strong>: The Supreme Court has sent back to the lower courts two laws passed by Republican statehouses in Florida and Texas that aimed to curb perceived censorship by social media platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Ruling is a loss for tech lobbying group</strong>: The decision is a significant loss for the tech lobbying group, which sought blanket protection from regulation for all content posted and organized on digital platforms.</li>
<li><strong>First Amendment protections may apply</strong>: The court ruled that the First Amendment protections may apply to individual applications of the laws, rather than the laws as a whole. This means that each case must be reviewed individually to determine if the laws violate the First Amendment.</li>
<li><strong>Majority ruling by Justice Elena Kagan</strong>: The majority ruling was written by Justice Elena Kagan and was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.</li>
<li><strong>No immediate win for social media companies</strong>: The court's decision is not an immediate win for social media companies, as it does not strike down the laws entirely. Rather, it sends the cases back to the lower courts for further review and analysis.</li>

The courts mainly addressed what the parties had focused on,” Kagan wrote. “But argument in this Court revealed that the laws might apply to, and differently affect, other kinds of websites and apps. In a facial challenge, that could well matter, even when the challenge is brought under the First Amendment.”</p><p><span>At issue were two laws passed by Republicans in 2021 in response to the perception among conservatives that their views were being censored by big social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter (now X) and other sites. The laws aimed to block digital platforms from banning, removing or hiding content based on the political viewpoint expressed.</span></p><p><span>NetChoice, a lobbying group for the tech industry, sued to overturn the laws by arguing that platforms have a First Amendment right to control the content posted by users. The lobbying group claimed that content moderation decisions made by platforms are no different from the “editorial discretion” exercised by newspapers when they determine what stories or editorials to run and where to place them.</span></p><p><span>Florida and Texas, however, argued that the platforms should not be viewed as akin to newspapers but rather to other telecommunications platforms like the telephone or telegraph. Like other telecommunications platforms, states should be allowed to regulate digital platforms as common carriers by forbidding them to discriminate in the content they transmit.</span></p><p><span>Supporters of strict antitrust regulation also sided with Florida and Texas to argue that granting digital platforms First Amendment protections akin to newspapers could severely hamper regulatory action aimed at reining in the 21st century’s wealthiest and most powerful corporations.</span></p><p id="view-cmts-cta-b5d19ae0-bcc2-38ed-87dd-6ce97bb2cbb9" class="view-cmts-cta-wrapper"><button class="link caas-button view-cmts-cta" data-ylk="sec:view-cmnts-cta;subsec:openweb;elm:cmmt_open;slk:View Comments;itc:1;g:b5d19ae0-bcc2-38ed-87dd-6ce97bb2cbb9" data-uuid="b5d19ae0-bcc2-38ed-87dd-6ce97bb2cbb9" data-rapid_p="24"><span> View comments </span></button></p></div></div>

<li>French political circles are considering the possibility of an "emergency government of experts" as a solution to their current political crisis.</li>
<li>This idea is similar to a concept that is often discussed in the context of Italian politics, suggesting that France may be considering a more Italian-style approach to governance.</li>
<li>The exact details of such an emergency government are not specified in the article, but it implies that it would involve a group of experts rather than politicians.</li>
<li>The context of the article suggests that France is currently facing a political crisis, which could be related to the ongoingCOVID-19 pandemic or other issues.</li>
<li>The article is brief and lacks further details, so it is unclear whether the idea of an emergency government of experts is being seriously considered or is simply being floated as a potential solution.</li>

<p>Pope Francis declared Acutis "blessed" in October of 2020, after a miracle attributed to him was approved by the church. That miracle was a young boy in Brazil who was healed of a deadly pancreatic disease after he and his mother prayed to <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/blessed-carlo-acutis-millennial-saint-relic-brooklyn/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">a relic of Acutis</a></span>.</p><p>In order to be declared a saint, a second miracle — this one posthumous — needed to be approved. It came in 2022, when a woman prayed at Acutis' tomb for her daughter, who just six days earlier had fallen from her bicycle in Florence, causing severe head trauma.</p><p>She required a craniotomy and had a very low chance of survival, according to doctors. On the day of the mother's pilgrimage to Acutis' tomb, the daughter began to breathe spontaneously. Just a few days later, the hemorrhage disappeared completely.</p><p>Along with Acutis, the canonizations of 14 other people were approved Monday, including 11 people who were killed in Syria in 1860, during the Syrian Civil War, which saw thousands of Christians killed.</p>

                                        <p>KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Israeli army ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians from much of Khan Younis on Monday, a sign that troops are likely to launch a new ground assault in the Gaza Strip’s second largest city.</p><p>The order suggested that Khan Younis will be the latest target of Israel’s raids into parts of Gaza it had previously invaded in the war, as it pursues regrouping Hamas militants. Much of Khan Younis was destroyed in a long assault earlier this year, but large numbers of Palestinians have moved back in to escape another Israeli offensive in Gaza’s southernmost city, Rafah.</p><p>The order came as Israel released the director of Gaza’s main hospital after holding him for seven months without charge or trial over allegations the facility had been used as a Hamas command center, which he and other Palestinian health officials have denied. He said he and other detainees were held under harsh conditions and tortured.</p>

        AP AUDIO: Israel orders Palestinians to flee Khan Younis, signaling return of troops to southern Gaza city

    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports dozens of detained Palestinians have been set free by Israel.</p>
    
</div><p>His release triggered an uproar across Israel’s political spectrum. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhu’s office called it “a grave mistake.” Government ministers and opposition leaders expressed outrage and insisted Abu Selmia played a role in Hamas’ alleged use of the hospital — though Israeli security services rarely unilaterally free prisoners if they have a suspicion of militant links. </p><h2>Khan Younis evacuation</h2>
    
<p>Monday’s evacuation order covered the eastern half of Khan Younis and a large swath of the Gaza Strip’s southeast corner. Earlier in the day, the army said a barrage of rockets out of Gaza was fired from Khan Younis.</p><p>The order suggested a new assault into the city was imminent. Israeli forces fought for weeks in Khan Younis earlier this year and withdrew, claiming to have destroyed Hamas battalions. But in other places where the military has made similar claims, renewed raids have underscored Hamas’ capabilities.</p>
    

    

<p>Last week, the military ordered an evacuation from the north Gaza district of Shijaiyah, and intensive fighting has followed.</p><p>Netanyahu said Monday that the military was “making progress toward ending the phase of the destruction of Hamas’ terror army.” But he said forces will continue to “target their remains going forward.”</p><p>More fighting in the Khan Younis area could further hamper Palestinians’ access to much-needed potable water. Included in the evacuation zone is a water line that Israel installed following criticism over its cutoff of water to the strip early in the war.</p><p>Also in the zone is the area surrounding the Kerem Shalom crossing, the major aid crossing to southern Gaza, and an aid route inside the territory that Israel has said it would safeguard.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

        </div><p>Most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have fled their homes, with many displaced multiple times. Israeli restrictions, fighting and the breakdown of public order have hindered the delivery of humanitarian aid, fueling widespread hunger and sparking fears of famine.</p>
    

<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the new evacuation order “just shows yet again that no place is safe in Gaza” for Palestinian civilians. “It’s another stop in this deadly circular movement that the population in Gaza has to undergo on a regular basis,” he said in a statement calling for a cease-fire.</p><h2>Hospital director’s release</h2><p>The decision to release Abu Selmia and 54 other Palestinian detainees back into Gaza appeared to be meant to free up space in overcrowded detention centers. Since the start of the war, Israeli forces have detained thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Many are being held without charge or trial in what is known as administrative detention.</p><p>“Our detainees have been subjected to all kinds of torture behind bars,” Abu Selmia told a news conference. “There was almost daily torture.”</p><p>He said guards used batons to beat detainees and terrorized them with dogs. He said some detainees had limbs amputated because of poor medical care. He said a beating caused his head to bleed and guards broke his finger.</p>
    

<p>The allegations could not be independently confirmed but matched other accounts of Palestinians who have been held in Israeli custody. There was no immediate response from the prison service, which has denied similar accusations.</p><p>Israeli forces raided Shifa Hospital in November, alleging that Hamas had created an elaborate command and control center inside. Abu Selmia and other staff denied the allegations and accused Israel of recklessly endangering thousands of patients and displaced people sheltering there. Abu Selmia was detained on Nov. 22.</p><p>Amid the uproar over Abu Selmia’s release, the various Israeli state organs responsible for detentions scrambled to shift blame.</p><p>Netanyahu’s office said Abu Selmia “belongs in prison” and that the prime minister had ordered a thorough review into how the release happened. It said the decision was made “without the knowledge of the political echelon or the heads of the organizations.”</p>
    

<p>Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel’s far-right national security minister who controls the country’s police and prison service, blamed the Defense Ministry.</p><p>Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s office said prisoner releases are the responsibility of the prison service and the Shin Bet internal security agency. The prison service said the decision was made by the Shin Bet and the army, and released a document ordering his release that was signed by an army reserve general.</p><p>The Shin Bet said Abu Selmia had passed a risk assessment, “compared to other detainees.” It said the government had decided against its advice to release detainees determined to be less of a threat to free up space.</p><p>After its first raid on Shifa Hospital, the military uncovered a tunnel beneath it leading to two empty rooms, as well as evidence that militants had brought wounded hostages to the facility. But the evidence fell short of showing an extensive base as claimed.</p><p>Israel has since raided other Gaza hospitals on similar allegations, forcing them to shut down or dramatically reduce services. The army raided Shifa a second time earlier this year, causing heavy destruction after saying militants had regrouped there.</p><p>Israel launched its offensive after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people across southern Israel and took another 250 hostage. In its campaign, Israel has killed at least 37,900 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or fighters.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Magdy reported from Cairo and Frankel from Jerusalem.

            Beryl’s arrival marks an exceptionally early start to the Atlantic hurricane season. On Sunday it became the earliest Category 4 on record in the Atlantic Ocean and the only Category 4 in the month of June. The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/13/weather/el-nino-la-nina-summer-forecast-climate/index.html">abnormally warm ocean waters</a> that facilitated Beryl’s alarming strengthening are a clear indicator that this hurricane season will be far from normal in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution.

            Beryl is breaking records for June because the ocean is as warm now as it would normally be at the peak of hurricane season, said Jim Kossin, a hurricane expert and science advisor at nonprofit First Street Foundation.

            “Hurricanes don’t know what month it is, they only know what their ambient environment is,” Kossin told CNN. “Beryl is breaking records for the month of June because Beryl thinks it’s September.”

            •<strong> Beryl is a dangerous hurricane:</strong> The storm is located near Carriacou Island, which is part of Grenada, has sustained winds of 150 mph and is moving to the west-northwest at 20 mph. Beryl’s hurricane-force winds extend 40 miles from center while tropical-storm-force winds extend about 125 miles.

Towering waves could also create life-threatening surf and rip currents and threaten small vessels and fishermen well after landfall. Flash flooding is also a concern in parts of the Windward Islands and Barbados. Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley warned citizens to be “extremely vigilant.”

            Beryl is the earliest major hurricane – defined as one that is Category 3 or higher – in the Atlantic in 58 years. The storm’s rapid intensification is very atypical this early into hurricane season, according to National Hurricane Center Director Mike Brennan. It’s rare for tropical systems to form in the central Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles in June, particularly strong ones, as only a handful of tropical systems have done so, <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes/#map=3.76/10.35/-48.52&amp;search=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" target="_blank">according to NOAA records</a>.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Boeing to maintain Spirit's current production contracts</strong>: After the planned acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems, Boeing intends to keep Spirit's current production contracts, including those for the US military.</li>
<li><strong>Spirit supplies major US defence programs</strong>: Spirit AeroSystems currently supplies several important US military programs, including the Northrop Grumman B-21 stealth bomber, Bell V-280 next-generation tiltrotor, and Boeing P-8 maritime patrol jet.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns about supply disruptions</strong>: The acquisition could pose challenges for the US military's aviation modernization initiatives, such as the B-21 and V-280 programs, which are still in development and require a reliable supply chain.</li>
<li><strong>Boeing aims for efficiency and integration</strong>: Boeing hopes to increase integration and efficiency between itself and Spirit AeroSystems after the acquisition, allowing for a "quicker, more efficient and streamlined manner".</li>
<li><strong>Industry response is cautious and supportive</strong>: The defense industry has responded to the acquisition news with caution, expressing concerns about maintaining a strong and reliable supply chain while also providing support for the government's review process to ensure fair competition and a stable supply chain.</li>

    <div><div class="storytext"><p>Boeing intends to maintain Spirit AeroSystems’ current production contracts for the US military after completing its planned acquisition of the supplier.</p>
<p>The troubled producer of aerostructures is set to be acquired by Boeing under an $4.7 billion agreement announced on 1 July. While much focus has been on Spirit’s commercial aircraft programmes, which include sections and components for both Boeing and Airbus jets, the Wichita-based manufacturer is also a key supplier to major US defence firms.</p>
<p>“Under the terms of the definitive merger agreement, Boeing will acquire Spirit’s Wichita and Tulsa operations, which includes responsibility for current defence programmes at the site,” Spirit representative Joe Buccino told FlightGlobal on 1 July.</p>
<p>Boeing aims to close the deal by mid-2025.</p>
<p>Spirit currently supplies both active-production and new-development acquisition programmes for the US military, including the Northrop Grumman B-21 stealth bomber, Bell V-280 next-generation tiltrotor, Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter, Boeing P-8 maritime patrol jet and Boeing KC-46 aerial tanker.</p>

<p>The B-21 and V-280 in particular represent two of the Pentagon’s most-significant aviation modernisation initiatives, with both programmes still in the early development stages. Supply disruptions at such a critical period have the potential to generate significant delays and sharp penalty charges for the prime contractor, particularly on programmes like the B-21 with strict cost control measures in place.</p>
<p>“We are confident<strong> [that by]</strong> reuniting Boeing and Spirit we will have greater integration and the ability to work together in a quicker, more efficient and streamlined manner,” Buccino says.</p>
<p>However, Spirit is not addressing specific programme concerns, saying it “can’t speak on behalf of Boeing regarding their specific plans for post-transaction closing”.</p>

<p>In a securities filing posted on 1 July, Boeing said the proposed deal ”maintains continuity for key US defence and national security programmes”.</p>
<p>It is not unheard of for prime contractors to act as suppliers to competitors. During a June tour of Boeing’s defence unit headquarters in St Louis, company officials told FlightGlobal they are open to taking on more sub-contracting work, in cases when Boeing is not acting as the original equipment manufacturer.</p>
<p>For now, the defence industry appears to be taking news of the pending Boeing-Spirit deal in stride, at least outwardly.</p>
<p>“A strong and reliable supply chain is critical for the aerospace industry to support national defence,” helicopter-maker Sikorsky said on 1 June. “We will provide any assistance needed by the government in its review process to ensure fair competition and a stable supply chain.”</p>
<p>Spirit assembles complete <strong><a href="https://www.flightglobal.com/helicopters/us-navy-approves-full-rate-production-of-sikorsky-ch-53k/151467.article">CH-53K</a></strong> fuselages for Sikorsky, including cockpit and cabin assemblies. Sikorsky is currently on contract to deliver 73 of the three-engined helicopters to the US Marine Corps and Israel.</p>
<p>The total USMC programme of record for the King Stallion covers up to 200 examples of the heavy-lift rotorcraft, making it a significant source of revenue for Sikorsky as the company <strong><a href="https://www.flightglobal.com/helicopters/new-leadership-at-sikorsky-amid-lockheed-leadership-shuffle/158850.article">seeks out</a></strong> new development work.</p>
<p>Northrop and Bell did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Boeing’s pending purchase of Spirit.</p>
<p>There are recent examples of defence-industry mergers being held up by anti-competition concerns among US regulators. A <strong><a href="https://www.flightglobal.com/defence/lockheed-martin-in-44-billion-acquisition-of-aerojet-rocketdyne/141693.article">attempted acquisition</a></strong> of rocket motor supplier Aerojet Rocketdyne by Lockheed Martin was <strong><a href="https://www.flightglobal.com/defence/lockheed-scraps-44bn-acquisition-of-aerojet-rocketdyne/147507.article">blocked</a></strong> by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2022 over concerns it would give Lockheed an unfair advantage over rival munitions producers.</p>
<p>“If the deal is allowed to proceed, Lockheed will use its control of Aerojet to harm rival defence contractors and further consolidate multiple markets critical to national security and defence,” the FTC said in a January 2022 court filing. Aerojet was eventually <strong><a href="https://www.flightglobal.com/defence/us-competition-regulator-clears-l3harris-to-acquire-aerojet-rocketdyne/154328.article">purchased</a></strong> by L3Harris, another defence mainstay that was deemed more neutral by regulators.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if Boeing’s bid to take over Spirit will encounter similar headwinds. The deal will still require approval from US regulators, who have been highly critical of Boeing over <strong><a href="https://www.flightglobal.com/airframers/boeing-insists-companywide-overhaul-ensures-every-aircraft-it-produces-is-safe/158919.article">quality and safety failures</a></strong> at the company’s assembly sites.</p>
<p>Boeing and rival Airbus have reached a <strong><a href="https://www.flightglobal.com/aerospace/boeing-and-airbus-agree-to-split-up-spirit-aerosystems-operations/158963.article">tentative deal</a></strong> that would see Spirit’s operations supplying the French airframer split off from the acquisition, addressing potential competition issues between the duopoly.</p>
<p>Airbus has entered a binding agreement relating to the potential acquisition of Spirit’s A350 fuselage production, which takes place at Kinston in North Carolina and the French city of St Nazaire. It will also take over the A220 wing and central fuselage production activities conducted at Belfast and Casablanca, and pick up the pylon work from Wichita.</p></div></div>
