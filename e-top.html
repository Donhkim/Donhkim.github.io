    <div><section class="content__body"><p><em>Washington — </em>The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed abortions to be performed during certain medical emergencies in Idaho, reinstating a lower court order that blocked the state from enforcing its near-total ban when an abortion is needed to preserve the health of the mother while legal proceedings continue.</p><p>The dispute pitted Idaho's measure, enacted after the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/supreme-court-roe-v-wade-abortion-rights/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">reversal of Roe v. Wade</a></span>, against a federal law that requires Medicare-funded hospitals to offer abortions when needed to stabilize a patient's emergency medical condition. </p><p>The majority dismissed Idaho's appeal of a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit that kept the injunction in place. The Supreme Court in January <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-idaho-abortion-ban/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">allowed Idaho</a></span> to enforce its ban in certain medical situations while it considered the case, but its ruling now dissolves that order. </p>    
  <p>The justices <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-726_6jgm.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">split 6-3</a> in agreeing to lift its stay. The court issued a per curiam opinion, or "by the court," though several justices wrote separately to note their positions in the case. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented. </p><p>The court did not address the underlying question of whether the federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, trumps Idaho's near-total ban in certain circumstances. Instead, the decision indicates the Supreme Court believes it intervened in the dispute too soon. The case is likely to return to the high court after more proceedings.</p>

    </p>
<p>Still, the ruling is a victory for the Biden administration, although likely a temporary one. The government has argued that EMTALA requires hospitals in states with the most stringent restrictions to offer abortions in certain medical emergencies when necessary to prevent harms to the mother's health.</p><p>President Biden said in a statement that the order ensures Idaho women have access to emergency medical care while additional proceedings take place in the lower courts.</p><p>"No woman should be denied care, made to wait until she's near death, or forced to flee her home state just to receive the health care she needs. This should never happen in America," Mr. Biden said. "Doctors should be able to practice medicine. Patients should be able to get the care they need."</p><p>The decision's release came after Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-26/us-supreme-court-poised-to-allow-emergency-abortions-in-idaho?sref=HXowpZpO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> that a copy of the opinion was posted on the Supreme Court's website inadvertently Wednesday. The outlet published the ruling, which showed that the court was set to allow emergency abortions in Idaho. The Supreme Court <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-inadvertently-briefly-uploaded-poised-to-allow-emergency-abortions-idaho/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">acknowledged a document</a></span> was "inadvertently and briefly" uploaded, but said the opinion in the cases out of Idaho would be issued "in due course."</p>

<h2>The Idaho abortion dispute</h2><p>The <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-idaho-abortion-ban-federal-law-emergency-care/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">case before the Supreme Court</a></span> is the first since it overturned Roe in which the justices examined a state law restricting access to abortion. It also was the second case involving the procedure that was before the high court in its current term. In that other court battle, the justices <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-abortion-pill-case-opinion/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">rejected a challenge</a></span> to a widely used abortion pill on procedural grounds, preserving access to it. </p><p>This case involved whether the Biden administration could require Medicare-participating hospitals in states with stringent abortion bans to offer pregnancy terminations in certain emergency situations. The Justice Department argued that under EMTALA, the necessary stabilizing treatment required by the law may sometimes be an abortion.</p><p>Two months after Roe's reversal, in August 2022, the Biden administration <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-sues-idaho-abortion-law/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">sued the state of Idaho</a></span> over its abortion ban. The law includes exeptions in cases of rape or incest, or to prevent the death of the mother. Physicians who perform abortions in violation of the law may be charged with a felony and face up to five years in prison.</p><p>But the Justice Department argued that EMTALA overrides state bans in instances where they conflict. </p><p>A federal judge sided with the Biden administration and allowed physicians to perform abortions in certain emergency situations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to pause that order while litigation continued, prompting the state and its Republican legislative leaders to seek the Supreme Court's intervention.</p><p>The high court <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-idaho-abortion-ban-emtala-federal-law/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">agreed to consider</a></span> whether EMTALA preempts state laws like Idaho's that prohibit most abortions, but allowed the state to continue enforcing its ban in full. It took up the case before the 9th Circuit had ruled on the merits. </p><p>In a concurring opinion joined in full by Justice Sonia Sotomayor and in part by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Justice Elena Kagan said that the court's decision will "prevent Idaho from enforcing its abortion ban when the termination of a pregnancy is needed to prevent serious harms to women." She said that Idaho's law conflicts with EMTALA's promise of ensuring patients receive stabilizing treatment, including abortion care, and the court was right to restore the lower court's order.</p>

    </p>
<p>"Doing so will again give Idaho women access to all the needed medical treatments that EMTALA guarantees," Kagan wrote.</p><p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett, too, authored a concurring opinion that was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh. She lamented that the "shape of these cases" has shifted in the months after the Supreme Court agreed to step into the disputes, which convinced her that they "are no longer appropriate for early resolution."</p><p>"We should not jump ahead of the lower courts, particularly on such an important issue," Barrett wrote.</p><p>Though Jackson agreed with the court's decision to lift its stay, she wrote a separate concurring opinion to voice her opposition to its dismissal of Idaho's appeal. A clear answer to whether EMTALA supersedes state abortion bans is needed, Jackson wrote. She read a summary of her opinion from the bench.</p><p>"Today's decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho. It is delay," Jackson wrote. "While this court dawdles and the country waits, pregnant people experiencing emergency medical conditions remain in a precarious position, as their doctors are kept in the dark about what the law requires."</p><p>In dissent, Alito lambasted the court's decision as an "about-face" that he said is "baffling." </p><p>"Apparently, the court has simply lost the will to decide the easy but emotional and highly politicized question that the case presents," he wrote. "That is regrettable."</p>

<p>The legal battle demonstrated the fallout from the Supreme Court's June 2022 decision unwinding the constitutional right to abortion, after which laws curtailing access to abortion took effect in 22 states. In seven of those states, including Idaho, abortion laws do not contain a health exception, according to the Justice Department.</p><p>Numerous doctors warned the Supreme Court that state abortion bans have left them confused and concerned that they could face felony charges for providing abortions in medical emergencies and have sought clarifications to the narrow exceptions from their state legislatures.</p><p>In Idaho, one health care system that filed a friend-of-the-court brief said many OB-GYNs have left the state because of confusion and fear as they attempted to navigate the new landscape for abortion care. It also said it's been transferring pregnant patients with emergency medical conditions to neighboring states amid concerns about the ramifications of delaying care and uncertainty about whether an abortion could be performed without violating the Idaho law.</p><p>No medical worker in the state has been charged or prosecuted for violating Idaho's ban so far.</p>

<li><strong>Supreme Court ruling</strong>: The Supreme Court has ruled that members of the Sackler family cannot be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic, jeopardizing a bankruptcy plan that would have offered such protection.</li>
<li><strong>Bankruptcy plan</strong>: The plan, negotiated over years with states, tribes, local governments, and individuals, would have allowed Purdue Pharma (maker of OxyContin) to restructure its debt and channel billions of dollars towards addressing the opioid crisis, while shielding the Sackler family from lawsuits.</li>
<li><strong>Liability issue</strong>: The Supreme Court found that the deal broke a basic tenet of bankruptcy law by shielding the Sackler family from lawsuits without the consent of those who might sue.</li>
<li><strong>Unusual deal</strong>: The plan was unusual because it offered broad protections to the Sackler family, who controlled Purdue Pharma, in exchange for avoiding declaring bankruptcy themselves.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Oklahoma's education official orders schools to teach the Bible</strong>: Republican state Superintendent Ryan Walters has directed all public schools in Oklahoma to start incorporating the Bible into lessons for students aged 11-18. The rule is compulsory and requires "immediate and strict compliance".</li>
<li><strong>Criticism from civil rights organizations and separation of church and state groups</strong>: The directive has drawn criticism from groups such as Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Interfaith Alliance, which argue that public schools should not be used to teach religious beliefs.</li>
<li><strong>The Bible is seen as a cultural and historical touchstone</strong>: Walters sees the Bible as an "indispensable historical and cultural touchstone" and argues that students need to understand its significance in American history and culture.</li>
<li><strong>Walters has a history of opposing liberal ideologies in education</strong>: Walters, a former public school history teacher, campaigned on a platform of combating "woke ideology" and eliminating "radical leftists" from Oklahoma's education system.</li>
<li><strong>The move is part of a broader trend of religious expression in public schools</strong>: The directive follows a similar move in Louisiana, where the governor signed a law requiring public schools to display the Ten Commandments. The trend reflects a growing debate over the role of religion in public education in the United States.</li>

Not on our watch," she added.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Walters has previously argued that secularists in the US have created a state religion out of atheism, by driving faith away from the public square.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In an op-ed last year for Fox News, he wrote that US President Joe Biden and the teacher unions had supplanted biblical values with "woke, anti-education values that tell students that they should treat their classmates differently depending on their race and sex and that they should be taught graphic sexual content at a young of an age as possible".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In a statement, the Interfaith Alliance - a US group that seeks to protect religious freedoms - called the Oklahoma superintendent's directive "blatant religious coercion". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“True religious freedom means ensuring that no one religious group is allowed to impose their viewpoint on all Americans," the statement added.  </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It comes a week after Louisiana ordered all classrooms up to university level in the state to display a poster of the Ten Commandments.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Days later, nine families in the state sued Louisiana, marking the start of what some expect will be a protracted legal battle.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The complaint, backed by civil rights groups, argues that such a display violates the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion, and that the display "pressures" students into adopting the state's favoured religion.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There have previously been legal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in public buildings, including in courts, police stations and schools.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In 1980, in the case Stone v Graham, the Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky law requiring that the document be displayed in elementary and high schools. This precedent has been cited by groups contesting the Louisiana law.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the requirement "had no secular legislative purpose" and was "plainly religious in nature" - noting that the commandments made references to worshipping God.</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li><strong>Parents of Uvalde victims react to DOJ report</strong>: The parents of the victims of the Robb Elementary School mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, have shared their reactions to the Department of Justice (DOJ) report on the incident.</li>
<li><strong>Failure to follow protocol blamed</strong>: The DOJ report found that law enforcement failed to follow protocol during the response to the shooting, leading to delays in entering the classroom where the gunman was holed up. The parents are still seeking answers and seeking accountability for the failures.</li>
<li><strong>"We hope that the failures end today"</strong>: One parent, who lost a child in the shooting, expressed hope that the report marks a turning point in terms of law enforcement's response to such incidents, saying, "I hope that the failures end today and that local officials do what wasn't done that day."</li>
<li><strong>Investigation found multiple mistakes</strong>: The DOJ investigation found that there were multiple mistakes made during the response to the shooting, including a 76-minute delay in entering the classrooms, which allowed the gunman to continue killing and wounding victims.</li>

district police chief Pete Arredondo over the police response to the 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School that <a href="/story/news/state/2024/01/18/uvalde-report-doj-us-justice-department-robb-elementary-school-shooting-findings-released/72257633007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">killed 19 students and two teachers</a>, authorities said on Thursday.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Uvalde County Sheriff's office said Arredondo was in custody Thursday, where family members and parents of several victims of the shooting gathered, and was being booked on 10 counts of child endangerment.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The officials identified Arredondo, whose name has been at the center of the police failures, and Adrian Gonzales, who also worked as a school police officer, as the other police officer indicted by the grand jury. Gonzales' role has been less public in the two years and one month since the shooting.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The officers face charges of injury to a child by omission, according to the two officials with knowledge of the developments who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are sealed.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Additionally, Sid Harle, a visiting Uvalde County district judge confirmed to the Austin American-Statesman, part of the USA TODAY Network, that he had set bonds for two people in cases in which the original judge recused herself. He declined to comment further because of the pending matter.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The indictments culminate a six-month grand jury investigation that included months of in-person testimony, including from Texas Department of Public Safety director <a href="/story/news/state/2024/02/28/uvalde-mass-school-shooting-dps-director-steve-mccraw-testifies-at-grand-jury/72773101007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Col. Steve McCraw</a> in late February. The officers face up to two years behind bars and a $10,000 fine if convicted of the state jail felony charges.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The charges follow two years of intense pressure among the families of many of the victims, who have repeatedly demanded accountability. They also come after a damning U.S. Department of Justice report in January that cited <a href="/story/news/nation/2024/01/18/uvalde-school-shooting-report-released-justice-department/72267666007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">“cascading failures”</a> in the botched law enforcement response.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“As a consequence of failed leadership, training, and policies, 33 students and three of their teachers — many of whom had been shot — were trapped in a room with an active shooter for over an hour as law enforcement officials remained outside,” the report concluded.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/nation/2022/05/25/texas-school-shooting-victims-mourned/9916559002/" data-t-l=":l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - Uvalde, Texas school shooting victims mourned across the nation" data-g-r="nav_mo" data-g-tn="pgcss" data-g-mtn="pg9916559002" data-g-moh="hpgm" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" data-c-id="9916559002"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/presto/2022/06/02/NAAS/dc957296-cdda-4a21-9690-9ef1b47d9126-Uvalde_Shooting_jwj_20574.JPG?crop=2999,1687,x0,y167&amp;width=660&amp;height=372&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/presto/2022/06/02/NAAS/dc957296-cdda-4a21-9690-9ef1b47d9126-Uvalde_Shooting_jwj_20574.JPG?crop=2999,1687,x0,y167&amp;width=1320&amp;height=744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt=""><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="152"><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg__ca"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"></use></svg><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_expand"></use></svg></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="Uvalde, Texas school shooting victims mourned across the nation" aria-label="An 18-year-old gunman opened fire Tuesday at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, killing 19 children and two teachers."></p></a><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The indictments also contrast the initial false narrative of police heroism that authorities first provided. In the initial aftermath, officials said more children would have died had responding officers not acted more quickly — a story that fell apart over later weeks and months, and was completely dismantled when the American-Statesman and KVUE-TV obtained a <a href="/story/news/nation/2022/07/12/uvalde-school-shooting-surveillance-video/10032624002/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">77-minute video of the breakdown</a>.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The cases mark the second and third times nationally that a law enforcement officer faced charges for failing to act during an on-campus shooting. Last year, a jury acquitted <a href="/story/news/nation/2023/06/29/scot-peterson-parkland-shooting-trial-verdict-innocent/70360878007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">former sheriff’s deputy Scot Peterson</a> of child neglect and other charges for failing to confront a shooter at <a href="/story/news/nation/2024/06/14/parkland-school-builidng-demolition-victims-families/74092616007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School</a> in Parkland, Florida, who killed 17 people.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He was the only armed school resource officer on campus when that 2018 shooting started. Legal experts said the case, had it resulted in a guilty verdict, could have set a precedent by more clearly defining the legal responsibilities of police officers during mass shootings.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Uvalde County District Attorney Christina Mitchell could not immediately be reached for comment. She has cited the ongoing grand jury investigation for not releasing investigative information sought by victims’ families and news organizations.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><em>Contributing: Reuters</em></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"></p></div></div>

That fueled speculation about what really happened. Opposition senators and government critics joined the chorus, calling the mutiny a “self-coup” — a claim strongly denied by Arce’s government.</p><p></p><p>“What we saw is extremely unusual for coup d’etats in Latin America, and it raises red flags,” said Diego von Vacano, an expert in Bolivian politics at Texas A&amp;M University and former informal adviser to President Arce. “Arce looked like a victim yesterday and a hero today, defending democracy.”</p><p></p><p>Some Bolivians said they believed Zúñiga’s allegations. </p>

Morales has staged a dramatic political comeback since mass protests and a deadly crackdown prompted him to resign and flee in 2019 — a military-backed ouster that his supporters decry as a coup.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

            Cannon has been widely criticized for dragging out the case over multiple hearings, and a prosecutor at the hearing earlier this week told her he believed the Trump team was trying to hijack the proceedings as a way to spread conspiracies about the work of federal investigators on this case.

            Those court proceedings, which would include witness testimony and evidence presentation, would happen before a trial. Cannon then would need to decide if evidence seized from Trump’s Florida estate and Corcoran’s grand jury testimony could be used at trial.

            “The parties can meaningfully confer beforehand on the scope and timing of the hearing, raising appropriate objections with the Court as necessary; the parties can (and will) file exhibit and witness lists as is customary in federal criminal suppression litigation; and the Special Counsel can request the Court to impose reasonable limitations on the evidence produced to ensure efficiency and control,” the judge said.

            Trump’s lawyers say they believe the wording used in the search warrant to authorize agents to seize “national defense information” and “Presidential Records” wasn’t specific enough, and Cannon agreed that there were “ambiguities.”

            “The Court determines that some of the terms in that document do not carry ‘generally understood meaning[s]’ such that a law enforcement agent, without further clarification, would have known to identify such material as ‘seizable’ property,” the judge wrote on Thursday. “Further factual development is warranted related to Defendant Trump’s particularity challenge” of the search warrant’s language.”

            “It is the obligation of this Court to make factual findings afresh on the crime-fraud issue,” Cannon wrote. “And a standard means by which to make such findings — as is customary in criminal suppression litigation — is following an evidentiary hearing at which both sides can present evidence (documentary and testimonial, as applicable).”

<li><strong>Justice Department fears losing case against Julian Assange</strong>: A Justice Department attorney in Europe warned colleagues that their five-year battle to bring Julian Assange to the US to stand trial for publishing secret documents was likely to fail.</li>
<li><strong>Urgency reaches a critical point</strong>: The attorney sent an email saying that if a deal is not made with Assange before an April 16 deadline, the US would lose all leverage and possibly their British attorneys, who increasingly saw the case as unwinnable.</li>
<li><strong>Case will head to appeal and the US will lose</strong>: The email stated that the case will head to appeal and the US will lose, indicating that the government feels it has no chance of winning the case.</li>
<li><strong>Free speech concerns</strong>: The case is related to free speech concerns, with Assange facing charges for publishing hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic and military files.</li>
<li><strong>Deadline to provide assurances on free speech</strong>: Assange was given until April 16 to provide assurances related to free speech, or the US would lose all leverage in the case, according to the email.</li>

The leaks prompted a long-running internal Justice Department debate about whether to charge Assange or whether his organization’s actions — which included accepting leaked government documents and publishing them — were similar enough to traditional newsgathering that a prosecution would violate First Amendment protections for press freedoms. Ultimately, he was indicted in 2018 and arrested in Britain, where he had since 2012 taken shelter in the Ecuadorian Embassy as a fugitive from allegations of sexual assault in Sweden.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y6Y3XXFG3BA2JMFIRE656TQXLQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">In December 2023, attorneys in the Justice Department working on the Assange case alerted superiors to a milestone that had just passed. Assange had spent more time fighting extradition from a London prison than he would probably be sentenced to had he come to the United States and pleaded guilty. While Assange and his supporters frequently <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/julian-assange-fights-extradition-to-the-united-states-in-court/2020/02/23/7389ad1a-54f5-11ea-80ce-37a8d4266c09_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_20" target="_blank">suggested he was facing life in prison</a> or even the death penalty, the government lawyers involved in the case had worked out that his recommended punishment would be about 55 months.

Assange had two nonnegotiable demands. One was that he would not set foot in the continental United States, where he was convinced he would be charged with new crimes or shipped to military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Second was that if he pleaded guilty, his sentence would not exceed time already served in London’s Belmarsh Prison.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XJZRE6ZJ5RDABEMXW5RW5HNJNY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Assange’s lawyers proposed he admit to misdemeanors for <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1924" target="_blank">mishandling classified material</a>, which unlike a felony plea could be handled remotely by video. (The crime <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/10/trump-fbi-search-surveillance-law/?itid=lk_inline_manual_23" target="_blank">is a felony now</a>, but it was classified as a misdemeanor at the time of the leaks.) Prosecutors were open to that if a WikiLeaks representative appeared in the Eastern District of Virginia, where Assange was charged, and pleaded guilty to a felony of behalf of the nonprofit.

<li><strong>Revenue decline expected</strong>: Nike expects its revenue to fall mid-single digits in 2025, including a 10% decline in the first quarter. This is a significant change from the company's initial guidance for overall sales growth in 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Fourth quarter revenue falls short</strong>: Nike's revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 fell 2% from the year prior to $12.61 billion, missing Wall Street's estimates of $12.86 billion. The company's direct-to-consumer sales declined 8% from the same quarter a year ago.</li>
<li><strong>Gross margins increase</strong>: Despite the revenue decline, Nike's gross margins increased to 44.7% in the fourth quarter, up from 43.6% in the same period a year ago, but came in below analyst expectations of 45.3%.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns about sales growth</strong>: Analysts are concerned about Nike's ability to reignite sales growth, with one analyst describing the sales number as "pretty weak".

Nike had initially guided for overall sales growth in 2025.</p><p>The guidance reflects a continuing trend from Nike's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, which the shoemaker reported after the closing bell on Thursday. The company said quarterly revenue in the fourth quarter fell 2% from the year prior to $12.61 billion, below Wall Street's estimates for $12.86 billion. Meanwhile, Nike's $0.99 earnings per share exceeded analysts' expectations of $0.66. Nike's direct-to-consumer sales declined 8% from the same quarter a year ago to $5.1 billion.</p><p>"Fiscal [2025] will be a transition year for our business," Nike CEO John Donahoe said during the company's earnings call.</p><p>The company has been trying to reignite sales growth in what has been a lackluster year for the stock so far. Morningstar equity analyst David Swartz told Yahoo Finance the sales number was "pretty weak" and was the main concern from the release.</p><p>Nike's gross margins increased to 44.7% in the fourth quarter, up from 43.6% in the same period a year ago, but came in below analyst expectations of 45.3%.</p><p>The company's stock entered the release down more than 17% over the last year, a far cry from the S&amp;P 500's (<a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC" data-ylk="slk:^GSPC;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16">^GSPC</a>) 26% gain, as investors grew wary of slowing growth at the retailer.</p><p>"All in, this longtime industry bellwether continues to surprisingly struggle, and we believe that investor patience with management is getting thinner by the day," Wedbush senior vice president of equity research Tom Nikic wrote in a note following the earnings release. "Over the long run, NKE has been one of the most successful growth stories in our coverage, and we keep waiting for the brand to regain its mojo. But it looks like we're going to have to keep waiting longer."</p><p>Wall Street has been closely watching Nike's product pipeline as the Oregon-based company works to fend off competition in its core athletic footwear market from rivals like Adidas (<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADDYY" data-ylk="slk:ADDYY;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="17">ADDYY</a>) and relative upstarts like On (<a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ONON" data-ylk="slk:ONON;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="18">ONON</a>) and Deckers' (<a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DECK" data-ylk="slk:DECK;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="19">DECK</a>) Hoka brand.</p><p>Nike executives stressed they believe their plans to scale new products are on "track" and will be impacting the company's financials by the end of the year.</p><p>"We are planning for meaningful, sequential improvement in the second half versus the first half, and it starts with the confidence that we have around the new products that we're bringing to market," Nike CFO Matthew Friend said on the earnings call.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="20"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">Will innovation boost Nike's stock?
