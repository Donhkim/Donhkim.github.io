Maybe there were too many voices and perspectives and data points put in his head, one campaign source suggested to me, and that just threw him off.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">While that analysis may be correct, the claim that the president was tired and overworked will do little to quell the very real fears that Mr Biden’s advanced age may impact his ability to win this election.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">These fears over the president’s age, mental fitness and stamina - and the insistence that something must be done about it - are far from new.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Back in September, the prominent political columnist David Ignatius, who was a confidant of Mr Biden’s, stated that the president should step aside. In February, Ezra Klein of the New York Times said much the same in a column that generated both buzz and irritation among those inside the White House.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Until now, those voices have been one-offs. That changed after last night’s poor debate performance.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"></p></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Name-calling and insults - key moments from Biden and Trump’s debate</figcaption></p><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In the early hours of Friday morning, a string of high-profile Democratic strategists, pundits, and former officials joined the call for Mr. Biden to bow out. I appeared on Morning Joe, an American political morning show that the president frequently watches. Joe Scarborough, the host of the program and a defender of the president, made the point that while Mr Biden can still govern the country, perhaps he no longer has what it takes to win the election.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">So where does that leave Joe Biden?</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">First, it is important to remember that the decision of whether to continue is - more or less - entirely his. At this point, if he doesn’t want to step back, it’s virtually impossible for him to be removed from the ticket. One campaign source told me any decision to step down would be made by a very small group that includes the president, his wife and his sister, Val Biden.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Second, right now the conversation about whether to replace Mr Biden is happening in public among pundits and former officials but it’s still only happening in private among those with actual influence.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Indeed this morning, several of the president’s allies (who are also, awkwardly, being floated as his potential replacements) took to television and social media to defend him.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">California Governor Gavin Newsom said he was “very proud of the president". Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro told Democrats to “stop worrying". Senator John Fetterman put it bluntly, saying: “I refuse to join the Democratic vultures on Biden’s shoulder.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">My reporting suggests no changes will be made imminently. The team wants to give the president a chance to get out in public and erase the memory of that debate appearance. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On Friday, at a markedly more energetic rally in North Carolina, Mr Biden attempted to put concerns over his age and his debate performance to rest. “I know I’m not a young man,” he said. "I would not be running again if I did not believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On Saturday, he will travel to the ultra-wealthy Hamptons region of New York for fundraisers with Democratic donors.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A source on the campaign tells me that, at the moment, the chance of him stepping aside is only around 5%. But if donors were to abandon him en masse, they acknowledge that could change and prompt a speedier decision about his candidacy.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Polling on the public’s reaction to the debate should filter in over the next few days. That too will guide the discussions.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Already the campaign is pointing to snap polling data from the debate that shows independent voters had a more unfavourable response to Donald Trump than to Joe Biden. They hope that is replicated in later polls.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Joe Biden has been discounted many times before in his political career. When he first ran for Senate he was told he was too young. When he thought of running for president in 2016 he was told it wasn’t his turn. And in 2020 many people felt he didn’t represent the future of a diverse Democratic Party.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He has developed a habit of ignoring sceptics. The only people he really trusts are the few close advisers who’ve been with him for years. I’ve been told those advisers, including Ron Klain and Mike Donilon (who prepared him for this disastrous debate), also happen to believe that Joe Biden is the only person who can beat Donald Trump.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">They were right in 2020. Are they still right today?</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Yes, Joe Biden has a history of bouncing back, but many Democrats are worried this time is different.</p></div></article></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Supreme Court Ruling</strong>: The Supreme Court has ruled that homeless people have a constitutional right to occupy public spaces, including sidewalks and parks, in order to sleep or rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Washington State Leaders React</strong>: Washington state leaders, including Governor Jay Inslee, Attorney General Bob Ferguson, and lawmakers from both parties, have praised the Supreme Court's decision, saying it will help address the homelessness crisis in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Homelessness Crisis</strong>: Washington state has been grappling with a severe homelessness crisis, with over 11,000 people experiencing homelessness on any given night. The state has been working to address the issue through a variety of initiatives, including affordable housing programs and mental health services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: The Supreme Court's decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by a homeless man who was arrested for sleeping in a public park. The court ruled that sleeping or resting in public spaces is a fundamental right and cannot be prohibited unless the state can show that it is necessary for a compelling reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact</strong>: The ruling is expected to have a significant impact on the way authorities handle homelessness in Washington state, with some expecting it to lead to a reduction in arrests and citations of homeless individuals. However, others have expressed concerns that the ruling will make it more difficult to address the root causes of homelessness and provide support services to those in need.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Supreme Court Ruling</strong>: The Supreme Court overturned a 40-year precedent by ruling that colleges cannot consider race as a factor in admissions decisions, leading to uncertainty and legal peril for institutions that had previously factored in race.</li>
<li><strong>Queens University Reaction</strong>: Queens University, a private institution in Charlotte, North Carolina, reacted to the ruling by pausing a Board of Trustees meeting to acknowledge the change and published an open letter by the vice president of strategic enrollment and communications, Adrienne Oddi.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of "Essential Tool"</strong>: Oddi's letter expressed concern that the ruling had taken away an "essential tool" in the admissions process, namely, being able to consider each student's identity, including their race.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Admissions Strategy</strong>: Queens University officials knew they would have to adapt their admissions strategy in response to the ruling, and would have to be cautious when discussing race in admissions discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges Ahead</strong>: The ruling creates challenges for colleges and universities that had previously used race as a factor in admissions decisions, and requires them to retrain staff and adapt their policies to ensure compliance with the new legal landscape.</li>

But that vision has reverberated far beyond academia: Programs meant to diversify companies, public boards and government contractors face a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/06/27/conservative-lawsuits-topple-affirmative-action-dei/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8" target="_blank">legal onslaught</a> unleashed by the landmark ruling, pushing American society at large toward a new race-neutral era.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YKAPAJK6S5HLRNE2H3W2VJ7B3M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-hoAgRD wpds-c-hoAgRD-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">While the changes at colleges like Harvard have been dramatic, the principle of race-neutrality is being felt more subtly at universities like Queens that accept more applicants than they turn away. Oddi said the ruling brought more of an “emotional shift than a practical shift” to her office and described how she blinds herself to a student’s race if the student mentions it in an application essay. The Supreme Court wrote that students could discuss race so long as it’s relevant to an experience, such as a time they overcame racial discrimination.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z4NSD4ERFZFT3JQJCCF3KW25NI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-hoAgRD wpds-c-hoAgRD-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Before the ruling, Oddi said she could “brighten” certain parts of an applicant’s identity while evaluating them “holistically” — including the applicant’s race and ethnicity. If a student wrote about being a biracial woman with a father from the Philippines, for example, an admissions official might note that the university does not see many Filipinos in the applicant pool and that “we would love to have more Filipinos in the community,” Oddi said, posing a hypothetical.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-bHCGeL-isStandardLayoutAd-true article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="cb db dn-ns" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-mobile"><div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-md mt-sm pt-sm pb-sm ad-mobile"><div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"><p class="dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md">Story continues below advertisement</p></div><p class="relative flex flex-column justify-center w-100"><wp-ad id="slug_mob_bigbox_2" class="chromatic-ignore" data-chromatic="ignore" data-slot="/701/wpni.education/higher-education" aria-hidden="true" data-renderbehavior="never" data-refresh="true" data-json='{"targeting":{"zeus_rendercount":"1","zeus_slot":"slug_mob_bigbox_2.init.dsk","kpi":"ctr","pos":"mob_bigbox_2","ctr":["zeus_mob_bigbox_2"],"wp_ad_refresh":"0","wp_refresh":"mob_bigbox_2_0","pwt":["mob_bigbox_2_mab_0"]}}'></wp-ad></p></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4BBTSZJCFZDYZE47NALXGYP2PI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-hoAgRD wpds-c-hoAgRD-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">But today, she said, that conversation would not happen at Queens. In fact, Oddi said she feels barred from acting on the student’s racial information at all. Instead of brightening that aspect of a student’s identity, she feels forced to erase it. And that has instilled in her a sense of “sadness” — not necessarily for herself but rather for the students who may feel dissuaded from writing about their whole selves, including race and ethnicity.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XBCQP7NAFJEGLHNFMSZ6RSSEBQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-hoAgRD wpds-c-hoAgRD-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">“I want to live in a world where people can know and be known fully,” she said.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5L7J3F57YRE6RHZHOIUYPDLAKU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-hoAgRD wpds-c-hoAgRD-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">The true impact of the ruling may not be clear for some time. In the fall, universities will report the racial makeup of their freshman class. Some<b> </b>schools may do so this summer after students have been admitted and committed to attend. Early research suggests the ruling’s impact could be relatively minor: Only a fifth of all U.S. colleges put substantial weight on race in admissions decisions, according to a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/admissions-at-most-colleges-will-be-unaffected-by-supreme-court-ruling-on-affirmative-action/" target="_blank">November 2023 Brookings Institution study</a>.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KGEDZPI2WZDHPFGKQJQKCSP6ZY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-hoAgRD wpds-c-hoAgRD-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">A study by the Common App, a nonprofit whose application is used by more than 1,000 member colleges, found no major changes in the racial and ethnic composition of its applicant pool in the 2023-2024 admissions season. Nor did it see significant deviations from previous trends in how students self-identify their race and ethnicity on the form, or how students write about race and ethnicity in their essays.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NWYQKTP5VVCNVFW5O6JPZFSEL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-hoAgRD wpds-c-hoAgRD-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Zachary Bleemer, an assistant professor of economics at Princeton University, said states that have banned affirmative action at public universities may offer the best preview of the ruling’s potential implications. California, Texas and Michigan — which all have highly selective public universities — saw immediate and significant declines in Black and Hispanic enrollment at their flagship institutions after state officials prohibited them from considering race in admissions.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-bHCGeL-isStandardLayoutAd-true article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="cb db dn-ns" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-mobile"><div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-md mt-sm pt-sm pb-sm ad-mobile"><div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"><p class="dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md">Story continues below advertisement</p></div><p class="relative flex flex-column justify-center w-100"><wp-ad id="slug_mob_bigbox_3" class="chromatic-ignore" data-chromatic="ignore" data-slot="/701/wpni.education/higher-education" aria-hidden="true" data-renderbehavior="never" data-refresh="true" data-json='{"targeting":{"zeus_rendercount":"1","zeus_slot":"slug_mob_bigbox_3.init.dsk","kpi":"ctr","pos":"mob_bigbox_3","ctr":["zeus_mob_bigbox_3"],"wp_ad_refresh":"0","wp_refresh":"mob_bigbox_3_0","pwt":["mob_bigbox_3_mab_0"]}}'></wp-ad></p></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DC4JP5G5QJDG3AD7R5BRXP746Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-hoAgRD wpds-c-hoAgRD-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">After California voters banned affirmative action at state universities in 1996, the University of California system saw a 12 percent drop in underrepresented groups, while campuses in Berkeley and Los Angeles both reported more than 40 percent declines, according to Bleemer’s research. Over time, those numbers have climbed at the most selective UC campuses, which have used multiple strategies to bolster diversity, in part also because of growth in the state’s Hispanic population. But the race-neutral alternatives increased enrollment of underrepresented minorities far less than affirmative action.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F7VYYHCOAZENBAVWA5WYXVFLIU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-hoAgRD wpds-c-hoAgRD-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">It’s harder to predict what might happen at highly competitive private universities, Bleemer said. They may be guided by the experiences of the public schools, which have deployed a variety of strategies to try to maintain diversity.

The university dispatches recruiters to every high school in Charlotte and tries to visit a variety of public high schools outside the city, delivering an “inclusive” message that encourages applicants to apply no matter their backgrounds. In last year’s incoming class, about half of students identified as White, she said, while Black and Hispanic students each made up about 14 percent.

<li><strong>Importance of the runoff</strong>: The runoff election on July 5 will be crucial, as Pezeshkian's campaign will need to draw voters to the ballot box in an election they haven't shown much enthusiasm for, with public anger and frustration with the political system showing no signs of abating.</li>

                                        <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran will hold a runoff presidential election pitting a little-known reformist against a hard-line former nuclear negotiator after results released Saturday showed the lowest-ever poll turnout in the Islamic Republic’s history.</p><p>More than 60% of voters cast no ballot in the race that saw reformist Masoud Pezeshkian best Saeed Jalili, who competed alongside two other hard-liners. </p><p>With Jalili now alone in facing the cardiac surgeon, Pezeshkian’s campaign would need to draw voters to the July 5 runoff in an election they’ve otherwise not taken part in as public anger hardens following years of Iran facing economic hardships and mass protests under its Shiite theocracy. </p><p>“Let’s look at it as a protest in its own right: A very widespread choice to reject what’s on offer – both the candidates and the system,” said Sanam Vakil, the director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa program. “That tells us a lot about public opinion and apathy, frustration. It sort of brings it all together.”</p>
    

<p>Of the 24.5 million votes cast in Friday’s election, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million, election spokesman Mohsen Eslami announced. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million, while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes. </p>



<p>Iranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race’s top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There’s been only one other runoff presidential election in Iran’s history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.</p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024 The year will test even the most robust democracies.

<p>There were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates. </p>
    

<p>The overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 48.8% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6% turnout. </p><p>There had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-narges-mohammadi-nobel-peace-prize-fb0189fbb60c49953e118fc8572e8de3">Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi</a></span>. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.</p><p>There’s also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was “moving toward the same level” of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian’s generation had in the 1979 revolution.</p><p>Jalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as “stupefyingly opaque” in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday’s vote. Jalili is known as the “Living Martyr” after losing a leg in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and is famous among Western diplomats for his haranguing lectures and hard-line stances. </p>
    

<p>Qalibaf, a former general in Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and head of Iran’s police, had been thought to have a wider power base, despite being plagued by corruption allegations and his role in past violent crackdowns. </p><p>He quickly endorsed Jalili in conceding the result and criticized Pezeshkian for allying himself with President Hassan Rouhani and his former foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. The two reached Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which later collapsed after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord. </p><p>“The road is not over yet, and despite the fact that I respect Mr. Dr. Pezeshkian personally, ... I ask all the revolutionary forces and my supporters to help stop the wave that is causing an important part of our economic and political problems today,” Qalibaf said in a statement. </p>
    

<p>Now the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign.

<p>Friday’s vote saw only one reported attack around the election.

While the authorities were questioning the teens, one of them fled on foot, the statement said. </p><p>As he ran, police spotted what "appeared to be a handgun" pointed at the officers. One of the officers fired his gun and hit the teen, described as an Asian male. He was given immediate first aid by the police officers and was brought to Wynn Hospital where he died from his wounds, Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said at a Saturday morning news conference. </p>    
  <p>Officers said they found a replica Glock handgun with a detachable magazine following the shooting. </p><p>"This replica handgun was ultimately found to be a pellet gun," Williams said.</p>

<p>Authorities have not yet released the names of the deceased 13-year-old or the officer who shot him until the next of kin is notified. An interpreter was at the news conference to provide translation for the family and their community who were in attendance, so they could understand the information provided. </p><p>The family's language or ethnicity wasn't identified but Utica has resettled large amounts of refugees in recent years.  According to the Mohawk Valley Resource Center for Refugees, one of the <a href="https://www.thecenterutica.org/community-resources/economic-impact/populations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">largest numbers of Asian refugees</a> Utica has resettled are from Burma, including from the Karen ethnic group as well as other groups. Other Asian refugees include Vietnamese, Thai, Cambodians along with Bosnians, Dominicans and more, the center said. Just over 19 percent of the once rapidly declining industrial city is now foreign-born, the center said. </p><p>Utica City School District's interim superintendent released a statement on Saturday saying out of respect for the student's family they wouldn't release his name. </p><p>"This tragedy reminds us of the tremendous challenges our community faces, particularly our partners in law enforcement, who tirelessly strive to ensure our streets remain safe," interim superintendent Dr. Kathleen Davis said.</p>

<p>A social media video related to the incident has been circulating on the internet. Regarding the video, police said, "We are aware of a video of the incident circulating on social media platforms, which does not portray the incident in its entirety."</p><p>Police said they are conducting an investigation following the shooting and said they will release items related to the shooting over the next several days, including a critical incident brief and the full bodycam footage. The chief said during the news conference the police officers involved in the shooting were placed on administrative leave.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.

<p>Outside a Whole Foods in downtown Denver on Friday, registered Democrat Matthew Toellner tilted his head sideways, mouth agape, in an imitation of his favored candidate, Biden, who was seen doing that at times on the split screen when Trump was talking Thursday night.</p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know about the 2024 Election Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020.

<p>“I’m going to vote for Biden,” said Toellner, 49, leaning against the wood siding of the grocery store. “Actually, I might not.”</p>
    
<p>A few minutes later, Toellner looked out to the street and rethought again. “I’m going to vote for Biden, I think I’d be a fool not to. But I just hate that I have to.”</p><p>His appeal to Biden and Democrats: “Please step down, get somebody electable.”</p><p>On a Detroit park bench, Arabia Simeon was left feeling politically homeless after voting Democratic in the past two presidential elections. “It just feels like we’re doomed no matter what,” she said.</p><p>Trump’s disregard for the facts suffused his arguments, though he was rarely challenged on the specifics during the debate. On abortion, for example, one of America’s most divisive issues for generations, the former Republican president claimed there is universal agreement that states should decide on the legality of it. There is ferocious argument about that.</p>
    

<p>But did that matter? The public reaction, in dozens of interviews across the country, brought to mind Bill Clinton’s post-presidency assessment of what voters want in fraught times: “When people feel uncertain, they’d rather have someone strong and wrong than weak and right.”</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

<p>The third-year doctoral student at the University of Pennsylvania, whose work focuses on the experiences of queer Black and Latino boys in special education classrooms, watched the debate in a Cincinnati bar while visiting the city. “All the work that I do and everything that I fight for is in direct opposition to Trump, his values, and his policies,” he said.</p><p>Biden turned in a more spirited performance Friday at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he acknowledged he is not the debater he used to be. “I know how to do this job,” he said. “I know how to get things done.” He assailed Trump in ways that eluded him the night before.</p>
    

<p>“I thought ‘Well Joe, why didn’t you say that last night?’” said Maureen Dougher, 73, who found Biden “strong,” “definite” and “very clear” in his rally remarks. In a debate watched by an estimated 51.3 million people, according to a preliminary estimate by the Nielsen company, Biden’s showing “didn’t come across as well as it did today.”</p><p>Amina Barhumi, 44, of Orland Park, Illinois, is affiliated with Muslim Civic Coalition and is sizing up Biden and Trump in part on how she expects each will act on the interests of American Muslims. Count her as demoralized about the candidate choices, too. She’s hearing “essentially the same rhetoric” from both.</p><p>“We have not-so-great options that are front-runners on the ticket,” she said. “Yesterday was an affirmation of exactly that.”</p><p>“Quite frankly, I think it was very difficult to watch,” she said of the debate. “I have teenagers and it felt like a bunch of bickering and nonsensical name-calling. And I think the American public expects more.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press journalists Jesse Bedayn in Denver; Mike Householder in Detroit; Carolyn Kaster in Cincinnati; Melissa Perez Winder in Bridgeview, Illinois; and Makiya Seminera in Raleigh, North Carolina, contributed to this report.</p>

<ol>
<li>A 36-year-old woman in North Carolina has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and child abuse after her 8-year-old daughter died from heat-related injuries after being left in a hot car.</li>
<li>According to the police, the woman told them she left her daughter in the car while she went to work and that she had forgotten to take her daughter out of the car. The child was found unresponsive and was later pronounced dead at the hospital.</li>
<li>The woman was arrested and is being held in jail on a $250,000 bond. She has a public defender representing her and is scheduled to appear in court on July 17.</li>
<li>The National Highway Safety Traffic Safety Administration reports that every 10 days, a child dies from heat stroke after being left in a car, and that over 1,000 children have died in hot cars over the last three decades.</li>
<li>The woman's daughter's death is a tragic reminder of the importance of being mindful of the temperature and leaving children in cars. The National Highway Safety Traffic Safety Administration recommends that parents and caregivers should always check their cars for children before leaving them and to never leave a child unattended in a car.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The US government presented Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, with a choice: he could accept a deal that would allow him to leave the US through Guantanamo Bay (Guam) or Saipan, two American-held islands in the Pacific Ocean.</li>
<li>The proposal was presented to Assange's lawyers during negotiations to end the long legal battle between Assange and the US.</li>
<li>The exact nature of the deal was not specified in the article, but it is implied that it would involve Assange leaving the US prison where he has been held for several years.</li>
<li>Assange's fate has been the subject of much speculation and controversy, and the proposal seems to offer him a chance at freedom, albeit under certain conditions.</li>
<li>The article suggests that the proposal was unexpected and perhaps unconventional, with one person involved describing it as sounding like a line from a Monty Python movie.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage was challenged about racist slurs</strong>: Farage was questioned by a BBC Question Time audience about comments made by one of his party's activists, Andrew Parker, who used a racist term to describe Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.</li>
<li><strong>Farage repeated his assertion that the footage was a "set-up"</strong>: Despite the evidence, Farage suggested that the comments may have been paid for or rigged to discredit his party.</li>
<li><strong>Other Reform UK candidates have also made controversial comments</strong>: Farage was asked about comments made by other Reform UK candidates, which he described as "a tirade of invective abuse" and said he had withdrawn his support.</li>
<li><strong>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak condemns the comments</strong>: Sunak described the comments as "hurtful" and "makes me angry", and said his daughters have to see and hear Reform UK activists using racist language against him. He also called on Farage to answer questions about the incident.</li>
