                                        <p>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — The widow of Hunter Biden’s brother told jurors in his federal gun trial Thursday about the moment she found the revolver in his truck, describing how she put it into a leather pouch, stuffed it into a shopping bag and tossed it in a trash can outside a market near her home.</p>
<p>“I panicked, and I wanted to get rid of them,” she testified about finding the gun and ammunition in the vehicle’s console in October 2018. “I didn’t want him to hurt himself, and I didn’t want my kids to find it and hurt themselves.”</p><p>The purchase of the Colt revolver by Hunter Biden — and Hallie Biden’s frenzied disposal of it — are the fulcrum of the case against him. Federal prosecutors say the president’s son was in the throes of a heavy crack addiction when he bought the gun. He’s been charged with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-gun-charge-investigation-e5c8ded90ea8c22d2e2e7cb09804b747">three felonies</a></span>: lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.</p>
    

<p>Hunter Biden, who has pleaded not guilty, has said the Justice Department is bending to political pressure from Republicans and that he’s being unfairly targeted.</p>



<p>Hallie Biden, who had a brief romantic relationship with Hunter after Beau Biden died in 2015, testified that from the time Hunter returned to Delaware from a 2018 trip to California until she threw his gun away, she did not see him using drugs. That time period included the day he bought the weapon.</p>
    
<p>Much of her testimony focused on Oct. 23, 2018 — 11 days after he bought the gun and when she tossed it. Hunter was staying with her and seemed exhausted. Asked by the prosecutor if it appeared that Hunter was using drugs around then, she said, “He could have been.”</p><p>As Hunter slept in her home, Hallie Biden went to check his car. She said she was hoping to help him get or stay sober, free of both alcohol and cocaine. She said she found the remnants of crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia. She also found the gun Hunter purchased in a box with a broken lock that kept it from fully closing. There was ammunition too.</p><div class="AudioEnhancement" data-separate-event="audioModule" data-separate-value="AP AUDIO: Widow of Beau Biden takes the stand in Hunter Biden’s gun trial, talks about tossing the revolver" data-module="" data-gtm-region="AP AUDIO: Widow of Beau Biden takes the stand in Hunter Biden’s gun trial, talks about tossing the revolver" data-align-center="" module-before-ad="" data-module-number="4" data-main-module-number="4">

    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports about Hallie Biden taking the stand in Hunter Biden’s gun trial.</p>
    
</div>
    

<p>Hallie said she considered hiding the gun but thought her kids might find it, so she decided to throw it away.</p><p>“I realize it was a stupid idea now, but I was panicking,” she said.</p><p>Hunter Biden watched expressionless from the courtroom during her testimony. She told jurors that she found crack at her home and saw him using it. She was with him occasionally when he saw dealers. Prosecutor Leo Wise asked Hallie about her own 2018 trip to California, where she visited Hunter at the Roosevelt Hotel, and asked her whether she was also using drugs.</p><p>“Yes, I was,” she said.</p><p>“And who introduced you to it?’”</p><p>“Hunter did,” Hallie said as Hunter rested his face on his hand and looked down.</p><p>“It was a terrible experience that I went through, and I’m embarrassed and ashamed, and I regret that period of my life,” she added.</p><p>Hallie testified she stopped using drugs in August 2018, but that Hunter continued smoking crack. </p><p>Much of the prosecution’s case has been dedicated to highlighting the seriousness of his crack addiction and showcasing to jurors bare-chested moments with ex-girlfriends, infidelity and crack pipes — judgment lapses they believe prove he was actively using when he checked “no” on the form. Prosecutors argue that the evidence is necessary to show his state of mind when he bought the gun.</p>
    

<p>After Hallie Biden threw the unloaded gun in the trash can at Janssen’s Market, he noticed it missing and asked her whether she had taken it.</p><p>“Are you insane?” he texted. He told her to go back to the market to look for it.</p><p>Surveillance footage played for jurors showed her digging around in the trash can for the gun, but it wasn’t there. She asked store officials if someone had taken out the trash.</p><p>Hallie said Hunter told her to file a police report because the gun was registered in his name. She called the police while she was still at the store. Officers located the man who inadvertently took the gun along with other recyclables from the trash and retrieved it. The case was eventually closed because of lack of cooperation from Hunter Biden, would have been considered the victim.</p>
    

<p>The Democratic president’s son arrived at court Thursday with a copy of his memoir, “Beautiful Things,” tucked under his arm. The book, written after he got sober in 2021, figures heavily into prosecutors’ case: They’ve played audio excerpts for jurors in which he details his descent into drugs and alcohol following the death of his brother in 2015 from cancer.</p><p>Defense attorney Abbe Lowell has said Hunter Biden’s state of mind was different when he wrote the book than when he purchased the gun, when he didn’t believe he had an addiction. And he’s suggested Hunter Biden might have felt he had a drinking problem at the time, but not a drug problem. Alcohol abuse doesn’t preclude a gun purchase.</p>
    

<p>Jurors have also heard from the gun store clerk, who testified about how he walked Hunter Biden through a few options before he settled on the $900 gun. The clerk then watched as the customer filled out the firearms transaction record, a required document for the purchase of a gun, and saw him check off “no” to the question of whether he was “an unlawful user of or addicted to” marijuana, stimulants, narcotics or any other controlled substance.</p><p>“Everything he bought, he ultimately decided on,” he told jurors.</p><p>Gordon Cleveland, the former clerk at StarQuest Shooters &amp; Survival Supply, said he saw Biden sign the form, which includes a warning about the consequences of submitting false information.</p><p>In his cross-examination Thursday, Lowell pointed out that some of the questions on the form are in the present tense, such as “are you an unlawful user of or addicted to” drugs. He has suggested Hunter Biden did not believe he had an active drug problem.</p><p>The proceedings are unfolding after the collapse of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-plea-deal-taxes-gun-drugs-690d38f1ffae4dfce2c171d21e7d3594">a plea deal</a></span> that would have resolved the gun charge and a separate tax case, and spared the Biden family the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.</p><p>The president’s sister, Valerie, was in court Thursday.

            Dozens of people were killed by an overnight Israeli airstrike on a United Nations-run school in central Gaza, authorities said, in an attack that CNN analysis found was conducted with a US-made weapon.

            Lerner said “20 to 30 Hamas and Islamic Jihad” militants were targeted in the strike, and that those targeted were “using the facilities to plan and execute attacks” against Israeli forces. Militants who were involved in the October 7 attacks on Israel were among those killed, Lerner said. Later on Thursday, the Israeli military said it had so far identified nine of 30 alleged militants.

            A CNN analysis of video from the scene and a review by an explosive weapons expert found that US-made munitions were used in the strike on the school.

            According to a journalist in the area working with CNN, the school was hit by at least three missiles that penetrated the three-story building. The facility was believed to be housing thousands of displaced people who had taken shelter in the school, its yard, and the surrounding area, according to the journalist. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said the school was sheltering about 6,000 displaced people.

            The Israeli military defended the bombing of the school, saying it had so far identified nine of 30 alleged militants it had targeted, its spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Thursday. He added that Israeli forces, using aerial surveillance over several days, had delayed the strike on the school twice because they had identified civilians in the area.

            “We conducted the strike once our intelligence and surveillance indicated there were no women or children inside the Hamas compound inside those classrooms,” Hagari said. He also accused Hamas of violating international law by allegedly using the UN school as an operational base.

            The US State Department said Israel’s strike did not cross US President Joe Biden’s so-called “red line” because that line referred to a “large-scale operation in Rafah,” which the US has not yet seen.

            Gaza authorities said the dead and injured continue to be brought to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which is operating at three times its clinical capacity, “signaling a real disaster that will lead to a greater increase in the number of martyrs,” the Gaza media office said.

            Lazzarini said in a post on X that while “claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking” they have been unable to verify it. “Attacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law,” he added.

            After that attack, US President Joe Biden refused calls to alter his policy towards Israel, suggesting the deadly Rafah strike had not yet crossed a red line that would force changes in American support. He had previously said <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/joe-biden-interview-cnntv/index.html">in a CNN interview</a> that he wouldn’t allow certain US weapons to be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/bidens-rafah-warning-is-turning-point-in-us-israel-relations-and-a-belated-but-inevitable-rupture-with-netanyahu/index.html">used in a major offensive in Rafah.</a>

            In April, CNN reported that the Biden administration <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/04/politics/us-israel-bombs-transfer/index">authorized the transfer to Israel</a> of over 1,000 small-diameter bombs, according to three people familiar with the matter.

            Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which has supported Al-Aqsa hospital, said Wednesday it had taken in more than 70 people who had been killed, and more than 300 injured, in just 48 hours, amid an escalation in bombing and ground fighting.

            Israel’s renewed focus on bombarding central Gaza highlights again the elusive nature of its stated ambition to destroy Hamas. The brunt of the Israeli military campaign had, in recent months, moved south towards Rafah, but rocket fire and ground warfare have now again engulfed encampments further north such as Nuseirat and areas like Bureij, both just south of Gaza City.

            A federal judge on Thursday ordered Steve Bannon to report to prison by July 1, giving the former Donald Trump adviser a short window to get a higher court’s intervention.

            Bannon was convicted of contempt of Congress in 2022 after failing to provide documents and testimony to the House Select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack. He was sentenced to four months in prison.

            Last month, however, a DC Circuit Court of Appeals panel unanimously rejected several challenges Bannon made to the case, and prosecutors immediately asked Nichols to send Bannon to prison to begin serving his sentence.

            Nichols said Thursday that, given the appeals court ruling, he did not believe the basis he had for pausing Bannon’s sentence “exists any longer.”

            The judge, who was appointed by Trump, said that he concluded that he had the authority to lift the hold on Bannon’s sentence, even as an appeal of conviction will continue.

            Shortly after the hearing concluded, Bannon vowed to fight his contempt of Congress conviction “all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to.”

            Bannon also claimed without evidence that his prosecution by the Justice Department was about “shutting down the MAGA movement, shutting down grassroots conservatives, shutting down President Trump.”

            “There’s nothing that can shut me up and nothing that will shut me up. There’s not a prison built or a jail built that will ever shut me up,” he told reporters outside the federal courthouse in Washington.

            At the hearing, Bannon’s attorney, David Schoen, argued that his client should be able to remain out of prison until the Supreme Court had a chance to weigh in on the case. Schoen also said that his request for the full DC Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case would be filed by June 24.
    </p>

            Prosecutor John Crabb said that Bannon had not satisfied the legal threshold for staying out of prison while his appeal continued. Crabb pointed to the failed effort by Peter Navarro, another ex-Trump adviser prosecuted for refusing to comply with a House January 6 committee subpoena, to pause his sentenced — an effort that was rebuffed by the DC Circuit and the Supreme Court.
    </p>

            Nichols said Navarro’s case presented different issues, and the judge ultimately pointed to the fact that three appeals court judges “wholeheartedly” rejected the arguments Bannon was making in his case. Nichols noted that a member of the DC Circuit panel considering Bannon’s case could have noted in a concurrence or dissent that they had concerns about the key precedent Bannon is seeking to overturn in his case, but no judge on the panel wrote such a statement.
    </p>

            With a little less than a month until the surrender date, Bannon could try to file emergency motions with the appeals court and even the Supreme Court seeking to push off his sentence longer.
    </p>

            After Nichols announced his order, Schoen tried again to convince Nichols to let Bannon stay out of prison, in an exchange with the judge that got heated.

<p>"On behalf of the American people and its commander in chief, it's the highest honor to be able to salute you here in Normandy. All of you. God love you," Mr. Biden said, addressing the WWII veterans in the audience.</p><p>The U.S. president quoted Britain's WWII leader Winston Churchill, saying he "called what happened here the greatest, most complicated operation ever," and adding that the entire world waited to see the outcome of the "great crusade to free Europe from tyranny."</p><p>Speaking about the tens of thousands of American men who poured onto Normandy's beaches that day, charging into a hail of gun and mortar fire, Mr. Biden said "it was estimated that 80% of them would be killed within hours. That was the estimate. But they were brave. They were resolute," and they got the job done. </p><p>"The men who fought here became heroes, not because they were the strongest our toughest or fiercest, although they were, but because they were given an audacious mission, knowing, every one of them knew, the probability of dying was real," Mr. Biden said. "But they did it anyway. They knew, beyond any doubt, there are things that are worth fighting and dying for. Freedom is worth it. Democracy is worth it. America is worth it. The world is worth it. Then, now and always." </p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/06/a681a03b-9f6b-49a4-9f88-6d0f90fef092/thumbnail/620x413/b1f857b3c4e31bf7f7df07bf1e0ca184/biden-d-day-2024.jpg?v=94cbb61397dbf7eca3740fa55510ba88#" alt="U.S. President Biden visits France " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/06/a681a03b-9f6b-49a4-9f88-6d0f90fef092/thumbnail/620x413/b1f857b3c4e31bf7f7df07bf1e0ca184/biden-d-day-2024.jpg?v=94cbb61397dbf7eca3740fa55510ba88 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/06/a681a03b-9f6b-49a4-9f88-6d0f90fef092/thumbnail/1240x826/42204ad39bb83053e722a1f10fc22f9b/biden-d-day-2024.jpg?v=94cbb61397dbf7eca3740fa55510ba88 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E"></span>

In the Southwest, Bracketville, Texas, near the state's Western border with Mexico, is in the extreme category.</p>    
  <h2>Record-breaking temperatures in the West</h2><p>While heat is common in places like Las Vegas, Thursday's 111 degree Fahrenheit heat there broke a daily record set in 2010 by one degree, according <a href="https://x.com/NWSVegas/status/1798323898183725220/photo/2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">to NWS Las Vegas.</a> And on Friday, the heat is expected to break another daily record.</p><p>Early Thursday morning, it was already 100 degrees in Las Vegas – about 4 degrees above the historic daily average, <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/nv/las-vegas/KVGT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according to Weather Underground.</a></p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The UK's statistics watchdog, the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR), has criticized Prime Minister Rishi Sunak over his claims about the tax burden on households if Labour wins the general election.</li>
<li>Sunak claimed that Labour's tax rises would add up to just over £2,000 per working household, but the OSR argues that it's unclear that this is a total over four years, making it impossible to verify the claim.</li>
<li>The OSR's criticism was made after Sunak referred to the figure in a TV debate with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.</li>
<li>The Conservative Party claims that all of the costings are available online, and Sunak also claimed that independent Treasury officials had costed the figure.</li>
<li>However, the OSR's independent regulatory arm has raised concerns that the accuracy of the claim cannot be verified, highlighting the need for clear and transparent costings in political debates.</li>

You had, I think, the person from the Office for National Statistics talking about the economic growth that the country produced in the first quarter of the year.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"He said what he said about that and I think he used the term 'gangbusters', so I will leave it at that."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Sunak was quoting Grant Fitzner, the chief economist at the ONS.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Fitzner had told journalists earlier in May: "To paraphrase former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, you could say the economy is going gangbusters."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">However, on Thursday the ONS said that it immediately clarified the comment at the time as a "passing reference" to the former Australian PM's remarks.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A spokesperson for the ONS said: "It was certainly not intended as a comment about the overall state of the economy and when the comment was made it was immediately clarified to those present that this was not a word that the ONS would use to describe the first quarter's growth.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"We also put the comment in context for journalists who followed up afterwards."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Fitzner's comments came after official figures showed the economy had emerged from recession.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The ONS estimated that gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.6% between January and March, meaning the economy recovered from the recession recorded late last year.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The state of the UK economy is expected to be one of the key campaigning points around the general election, with leaders of various parties setting out their plans on how they would improve growth and productivity.</p></div></article></div>
