<p>The testimony of a witness with such intimate knowledge of Trump’s activities could heighten the legal exposure of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee if jurors deem him sufficiently credible. But prosecutors’ reliance on a witness with such a checkered past — <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-michael-cohen-74aaf72511d64fceb1d64529207bde64">Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payments</a></span> — also carries sizable risks with a jury and could be a boon to Trump politically as he fundraises off his legal woes and paints the case as the product of a tainted criminal justice system.</p>
    

<p>The men, once so close that Cohen boasted that he would “take a bullet” for Trump, had no visible interaction inside the courtroom. The calm was a marked contrast from their last courtroom faceoff, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-michael-cohen-fraud-lawsuit-7f6e536e97d77ef1cd441e4d5ec41ee4">when Trump last October walked out of the courtroom</a></span> after his lawyer finished questioning Cohen during his civil fraud trial.</p><p>This time around, Trump sat at the defense table with his eyes closed for long stretches of testimony as Cohen recounted his decade-long career as a senior Trump Organization executive, doing work that by his own admission sometimes involved lying and bullying others on his boss’s behalf.</p>



<p>Jurors had previously heard from others about the tabloid industry practice of “catch-and-kill,” in which rights to a story are purchased so that it can then be quashed. But Cohen’s testimony is crucial to prosecutors because of his proximity to Trump and because he says he was in direct communication with the then-candidate about embarrassing stories he was scrambling to prevent from surfacing.</p><p>Cohen also matters because the reimbursements he received from a $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels, which prosecutors say was meant to buy her silence in advance of the 2016 election, form the basis of 34 felony counts charging Trump with falsifying business records. Prosecutors say the reimbursements were logged, falsely, as legal expenses to conceal the payments’ true purpose.</p>
    

<p>Under questioning from a prosecutor, Cohen detailed the steps he took to mask the payments — which he had agreed to front — from his wife and his bank. When he opened a bank account to pay Daniels, an action he said he told Trump he was taking, he said it was for a new limited liability corporation but withheld the actual purpose.</p><p>“I’m not sure they would’ve opened it,” he said, “if it stated: to pay off an adult film star for a non-disclosure agreement.”</p><p>Cohen also gave jurors an insider account of his negotiations with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hush-money-trial-national-enquirer-1dd3c3111febf219bdf1d8627504a3c5">David Pecker</a></span>, the then-publisher of the National Enquirer who was such a close Trump ally that Cohen said he told him that his publication maintained a “file drawer or a locked drawer as he described it, where files related to Mr. Trump were located.” That effort that took on added urgency following the October 2016 disclosure of an “Access Hollywood” recording in which Trump was heard boasting about grabbing women sexually.</p>
    

<p>The Daniels payment was finalized several weeks after that revelation, but Monday’s testimony also centered on the deal earlier that fall with McDougal.</p><p>Cohen testified that he went to Trump immediately after the National Enquirer alerted him to a story about the alleged McDougal affair. “Make sure it doesn’t get released,” he says Trump told him.</p><p>Trump checked in with Pecker about the matter, asking him how “things were going” with it, Cohen said. Pecker responded: “‘We have this under control, and we’ll take care of this,’” Cohen testified.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

</div><p>Defense lawyers have teed up a bruising cross-examination of Cohen, telling jurors during opening statements that he’s an “admitted liar” with an “obsession to get President Trump.” Besides portraying him as untrustworthy, they’re also expected to cast him as vindictive, vengeful and agenda-driven.</p><p>Prosecutors are hoping to try to blunt those attacks by acknowledging Cohen’s past crimes to jurors during opening statements and by relying on other witnesses whose accounts, they hope, will buttress Cohen’s testimony. They include a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hush-money-trial-new-fines-testimony-trump-fe6995afbc96650b67f46d813ab05f06">lawyer who negotiated the hush money payments</a></span> on behalf of Daniels and McDougal, as well as Pecker and Daniels.</p><p>Cohen’s role as star prosecution witness further cements the disintegration of a mutually beneficial relationship. After Cohen’s home and office were raided by the FBI in 2018, Trump showered him with affection on social media, praising him as a “fine person with a wonderful family” and predicting — incorrectly — that Cohen would not “flip.”</p><p>Months later, Cohen did exactly that, pleading guilty that August to federal campaign-finance charges in which he implicated Trump. By that point, the relationship was irrevocably broken, with Trump posting on the social media platform then known as Twitter: “If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of Michael Cohen!”</p><p>Cohen later <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-elections-politics-north-america-28301de8eaa94cc796c5279fc28c1fdb">admitted lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate project</a></span> that he had pursued on Trump’s behalf during the heat of the 2016 Republican campaign.

In the late 1990s, he started working as adviser to Russian prime ministers while working towards a PhD, which he obtained in 2006.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">He was appointed minister for economic development in 2012; the following year, he became an aide to Mr Putin.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">In 2020, he was appointed first deputy prime minister of Russia. He has since gained a reputation as a Putin loyalist, having reportedly been the only member of the president’s "economic entourage" to support Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">He is also credited with devising key economic ideas pursued by the Kremlin in recent years, and was seen as one of the key ideologues behind a set of ambitious plans adopted by Mr Putin as he began his fourth presidential term in 2018.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">He was also a key backer of the VAT increase from 18 to 20% in 2019.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Mr Belousov is known to be a hardline defender of state interests over those of businesses. He has long advocated strict regulation, increased government investment and extensive state presence in the economy.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">In 2018, a letter was leaked in which Mr Belousov suggested seizing excess profits from 14 large metallurgical and chemical companies.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">The proposal received widespread criticism. Russia’s Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs warned that this would lead to a wave of bankruptcies, and although the suggestion was never implemented, it caused a slump in the stock market. </p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">In 2021, comments by Mr Belousov again led to a collapse in shares of metallurgical companies after he said metallurgists had “extorted” the state for about 100bn rubles (£870m).</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Unpopular as these initiatives may have been, they matched Mr Belousov’s core belief that the economy is driven by state involvement.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Russian economist and University of Chicago professor Konstantin Sonin told the BBC that Mr Belousov keenly believes “innovation happens because the government invests in innovation, and that economic growth happens because the government forces businesses to make investments".</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">These beliefs are consistent with Mr Putin's state-dominant and isolationist worldview, Mr Sonin added.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the proposed appointment of a civilian showed the role of defence minister called for "innovation".</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">"The one who is more open to innovations is the one who will be victorious on the battlefield," he said.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">As defence minister, Mr Belousov will have to manage Russia’s military spending, which as of 2024 accounts for about 30% of Russia’s budget – about 36.6tn rubles (£324bn).</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Commenting on the nomination, Russian outlet Komsomolskaya Pravda said that Mr Belousov’s economic expertise and understanding of industrial sectors, including defence meant he is well-suited to manage the military's significant budgetary demands.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Mr Belousov’s nomination  – which comes deep into the third year of Russia’s war in Ukraine - also seems to indicate that President Putin is preparing for a long and expensive war. </p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Mr Belousov’s task will be to ensure the Russian economy can continue to sustain its military machine despite Western sanctions.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">The Kremlin will also be hoping that Mr Belousov’s experience as an economist will help make military spending more efficient and reduce corruption.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">His well-established interest in hi-tech weaponry such as drones – of which Russia needs a near-constant supply to continue its attacks on Ukraine - will also be useful. </p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">In 2023, Mr Belousov announced plans to build 18,000 large and medium-sized drones in 2024 and the launch and development of a new industry – manufacturing of unmanned aviation systems.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Russian media have noted that Mr Belousov - who is married with one child, Pavel, born in 1994 - also cuts an usual figure among its peers within the Russian government as he is not known to have profited from corruption, nor does he have a particularly lavish lifestyle.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Like President Putin, Mr Belousov is close to the Russian Orthodox Church. He is thought to have been baptised in 2007. </p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">He is said to be a martial arts enthusiast - as is President Putin - who practised karate and the Russian combat sport sambo in his youth.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb"><i class="sc-ed73b9f2-0 gyrAHo">Additional reporting by Vitaly Shevchenko</i></p></div></div>

<p>The third week of testimony in the <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/tag/karen-read/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcboston.com/tag/karen-read/">Karen Read</a> trial got underway Monday with the defense cross-examining the man who owns the home where John O'Keefe's body was found.</p>

<p>Read is charged with second-degree murder in the 2022 death of O'Keefe, her boyfriend. He was found in the snow outside retired Boston Police Officer Brian Albert's home in Canton. Prosecutors say Read hit O'Keefe with her SUV, while Read says she has been framed in a wide-ranging coverup, claiming the Albert family — which includes a Canton police officer and current selectman — and the state's lead investigator, a family friend, put the blame on Read. </p>

<p>Brian and Nicole Albert <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-day-9/3365017/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-day-9/3365017/">took the stand on Friday</a>. They have been the subject of intense public speculation for months — while prosecutors say Read killed her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe, on their lawn on Fairview Road during a snowstorm in January 2022, Read's lawyers have claimed there was a coverup, one that may have involved at least Brian Albert, a fellow Boston police officer.</p>

<p>Their testimony came as the second week of trial proceedings in Norfolk Superior Court, in Dedham, wrapped up. But before they took the stand, Judge Beverly Cannone ruled that the controversial blogger Aidan Kearney, known as "Turtleboy," wouldn't be allowed in the courtroom for their testimony or that of eight other witnesses he's accused of intimidating.</p>

<p>Brian Albert returned to the stand on Monday to be cross-examined by Read's defense team.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Brian Albert's cross-examination</h2>

<p>Under cross-examination, defense attorney Alan Jackson asked Albert about his initial grand jury testimony that he had never met Read before. He later changed that story and said that he saw Read at the Hillside Pub with O'Keefe on Jan. 22 -- about a week before the incident that resulted in O'Keefe's death.</p>

<p>"You were asked if you knew Karen Read on Jan. 28 and you testified, 'I've never met or seen her before.' You had not only met, but spent several hours with O'Keefe and Read six days before the incident," Jackson said. "On Jan. 22, 2022, you socialized with Karen Read at the Hillside for several hours."</p>

<p>Albert said he was at the bar, but several other people were at the bar.</p>

<p>Jackson then displayed a photo showing Albert, his brother Chris Albert, O'Keefe and another man, and said the photo was taken by Read. But Brian Albert said he did not recall who took the photo.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image forceratio size-full is-resized"></figure>

<p>"I remember having conversations with John that evening. I don't remember having conversations with Karen," he said.</p>



<p>Jackson also showed a portion of the surveillance video from the Waterfall Bar &amp; Grill on the night before O'Keefe died that appeared to show Brian Albert talking directly to Read amid a group of several other people.</p>

<p>"It looked like I was speaking. I can't say for sure I was talking directly to the defendant," Albert said.</p>

<p>Jackson also got Albert to say that his nephew, Colin Albert, was at his house on the night of Jan. 28, 2022. Albert didn't initially tell police that Colin Albert was at his house that night. Brian Albert said he didn't mention it to police because Colin had left soon after Brian arrived home that night.</p>

<p>"In your initial reports to the police, his name was never mentioned, was it?" Jackson asked.</p>

<p>"I did not mention it, no," Albert replied.</p>

<p>Jackson also displayed video in court taken from inside Brian Albert's former home on Fairview Road, showing the bulkhead doors in the basement. The video also includes footage of the home's backyard and the front yard by the street.</p>

<p>Jackson also asked Albert about his police training, including whether he has ever received training on criminals covering up crime scenese or deleting phone evidence. Albert said he hadn't.</p>

<p>He also asked Albert about his cell phone and specifically a directive from the district attorney's office that he had to preserve his cell phone due to a motion filed by the defense in the Read case. When the district attorney's office informed him of this, Albert said he had just upgraded his phone a week earlier, but didn't mention that to the district attorney.</p>

<p>"Where is your phone?" Jackson asked.</p>

<p>"My phone was upgraded and traded in for a new phone," Albert replied.</p>

<p>He said he upgraded it in the third week of September, around the 22nd, of 2022, the day before a court order that it be preserved.</p>

<p>"I upgraded my phone on and around the 22nd, yes," Albert said. "That just happened to be the day that I got it."</p>

<p>He said the fact that he turned in the phone just a day before he was told not to destroy it was just a coincidence.</p>



<p>Jackson also asked Albert if he and his friend Brian Higgins had agreed to get rid of their personal phones. But Albert said he didn't recall that.</p>

<p>"I don't remember having that conversation with Brian Higgins," Albert said.</p>

<p>Jackson also asked Albert if he was aware that Higgins had also gotten rid of his phone.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied.</p>

<p>Jackson also asked if Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor entered Albert's house on Jan. 29, 2022.</p>

<p>"He conducted an interview with my wife and I don't remember if it was the 29th or the 30th," Albert said.</p>

<p>But Jackson said that interview actually occurred on Feb. 3, 2022, days after O'Keefe died. He also got Albert to acknowledge that forensics experts never came into his house as part of their investigation.</p>

<p>Jackson also asked about Albert's time in the Marines and whether he received any training in hand-to-hand combat. Albert said he had, along with training on defensive tactics during his time as a police officer. He also asked about Albert's training as a boxer.</p>

<p>"Have I boxed before? Yes," Albert said. He also confirmed that he was shown boxing in a television show about the Boston Police Department called "Boston's Finest." He also showed surveillance video from the waterfall showing Albert and Higgins appearing to square off in a fighting stance in what he described as a form of horseplay.</p>

<p>"Just having fun with my friends, hanging out and fooling around," Albert said of his actions in the video.</p>

<p>Another portion of the video was shown where Albert appears to wrap Higgins in a bear hug from behind. When Albert lets Higgins go, Higgins pretends to knee him in the abdomen.</p>

<p>"I don't know what his intent was. It looks like he was just fooling around, like I was," Albert said. "We're in the bar together, we're good friends, we're just being silly and fooling."</p>

<p>The two are then seen hugging immediately afterward.</p>

<p>Jackson then asked Albert if he put his phone on a charger when he got home after the Waterfall. He said he didn't, and kept it in bed with him instead.</p>

<p>"All I can answer is I sleep with my phone in my bed. That's just what I do," Albert said.</p>

<p>Jackson asked Albert if he made any phone calls after he went to bed. He said he did -- "I inadvertently called Brian Higgins" sometime after 2 a.m. But he said he never spoke with Higgins. </p>

<p>"It's kind of like a butt dial," Albert said.</p>

<p>Jackson also pointed out that Albert had said previously that he and his wife, Julie, were in bed around the time the phone call to Higgins was made, "in an intimate situation."</p>

<p>Jackson referenced a call Brian Albert made to Higgins at 2:22 a.m. on Jan. 29, 2022, that lasted one second. He also referenced a second call 17 seconds later from Higgins to Albert. That call lasted 22 seconds, according to phone records.</p>

<p>"I did not answer it," Albert said.</p>

<p>But Jackson said if it was a missed call, as Albert said, it should have shown the missed call in red. He also pressed Albert on how the phone could have "butt dialed" Higgins, since it should have required a passcode or facial recognition in order to unlock it.</p>

<p>"I don't know that the phone was locked. I could have been looking through my phone," Albert said. "I butt dial people often and make calls."</p>

<p>"So how'd you miss the call 17 seconds later?" Jackson asked.</p>

<p>"I never got the second call from him," Albert said. "I'm not sure what I was doing at that second."</p>

<p>"Was the phone unlocked and did you make a call?" Jackson asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Albert said. He also said he didn't answer the ensuing call from Higgins.</p>

<p>"Simply touching your butt will not answer that phone. It has to be swiped," Jackson said.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think it has to be swiped," Albert said. "I don't remember answering that call. I could've hit the phone by accident, causing it to answer."</p>

<p>The next morning, Albert said he mentioned to Higgins that he might have "butt dialed" him.</p>

<p>Since that time, Jackson again stressed that Albert and Higgins have both gotten rid of their phones.</p>

<p>Jackson also asked Albert about a call he made on the morning of O'Keefe's death, around 7:20 a.m., to Higgins.</p>

<p>"I informed him of what was going on at my house," Albert said. "We were out the night before and I thought it was important for him to know what had happened."</p>

<p>Jackson also asked about several subsequent calls to Higgins and his brother, Canton Police Officer Kevin Albert. Brian Albert also acknowledged he spoke with Canton Police Chief Kenneth Berkowitz and his sister-in-law Jennifer McCabe that morning, and again with Kevin Albert and Higgins that afternoon. The next day, he spoke with Berkowitz, and the day after that with McCabe. And then Berkowitz called Albert again on Feb. 1. Three days later, he again spoke with Higgins.</p>

<p>"I don't know the subject of all these calls," he said, but he acknowledged that many of them likely pertained to O'Keefe's death. "Of course, it was a horrible situation that was going on. Everybody was distraught and there were a lot of phone calls."</p>

<p>But he denied that any of those calls were in an effort to "get their stories straight," as Jackson put it.</p>

<p>Court broke for lunch around 12:40 p.m., with Albert still on the stand and resumed again around 1:45 p.m.</p>

<p>During redirect, Lally asked Albert if he or Higgins went into the basement of his home after returning home from the Waterfall on Jan. 28, 2022. Albert said they did not.</p>

<p>Lally also asked about Albert's phone and mentioned that although Albert had upgraded his phone, texts, phone calls and other information could still be available in the cloud. He also asked Albert about his experience boxing. Albert said it had been about two decades since he actively boxed.</p>

<p>Albert also testified that some areas of his home were a "dead zone" for his phone, and that the phone might not have been locked when he was engaged in the intimate moment with his wife. He also reiterated that O'Keefe never entered his house on the night before he died, saying he would have been "welcomed with open arms" if he had.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Brian Albert Jr. testifies</h2>

<p>The second witness of the day on Monday was Brian Albert Jr., the son of Brian and Nicole Albert. The 25-year-old lived in the home at Fairview Road with his parents until they sold it, and he now lives with them in Norwood.</p>

<p>He said he had several friends over to the Fairview Road home to celebrate on Jan. 28, 2022, the night before his 23rd birthday. He said he and two other friends listened to music, ate some food, drank alcohol and played some card games.</p>

<p>"Just a normal hangout," he said.</p>

<p>He said three other friends from high school joined them at the house a short time later. He said his cousin Colin Albert arrived later on that night, and his mother, father and sister and some of their friends, including Higgins, returned home later as well.</p>

<p>He said Colin Albert left the house soon thereafter.</p>

<p>Brian Albert Jr. testified about seeing a dark SUV outside the house that night, and said it was snowing at the time. He said the passenger's side of the vehicle was facing the house. He said he didn't hear any noise coming from outside the house.</p>

<p>When he first saw it, he said the SUV was right by the mailbox, but when he next saw it several minutes later, it appeared to have moved closer to a flagpole on the other side of the house. He also said he saw tire tracks in the snow.</p>

<p>Albert Jr. said he went to sleep around 1 a.m. and woke up around 7:30 or 8 a.m. when his father knocked on his door.</p>

<p>He said neither O'Keefe nor Read ever entered his house on the night in question. He said he never formally met O'Keefe but might have been around him, and that he never met Read.</p>

<p>Defense attorney Elizabeth Little asked Albert Jr. when he first spoke with investigators in the Karen Read case, and he confirmed it was July 6, 2023, about 18 months after O'Keefe's death.</p>

<p>He said he didn't look outside the house on the morning O'Keefe's body was found on the Albert's lawn because it gave him anxiety. He said he never saw O'Keefe's body. He was dismissed shortly after 3 p.m.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Caitlin Albert testifies</h2>

<p>Shortly after 3 p.m., Caitlin Albert took the stand. She is the daughter of Brian and Nicole Albert and brother of Brian Albert Jr.</p>

<p>She also testified about the events of Jan. 28, 2022, when she came to Canton with her boyfriend and met her mom and aunt at the Waterfall around 6 p.m. She said the four of them ordered food and drinks and her boyfriend went home after eating because he had to be up early the next day.</p>

<p>She said she remembers leaving the Waterfall around midnight.</p>

<p>Like other witnesses before her, she said the mood at the Waterfall seemed positive, and there were no issues involving tension or anyone fighting among their group or between O'Keefe and Read.</p>

<p>She also testified that her father drove her and her mom home to her parents house on Fairview Road.</p>

<p>When she first walked in, she said she saw her cousin Colin Albert. She said it was already snowing at this point, and progressively getting worse.</p>

<p>Under cross-examination, defense attorney David Yannetti asked Caitlin Albert if she was the last one to leave the house that night.</p>

<p>She also acknowledged that she did not receive any communication from any investigators involved with the case until May of 2023, over a year after O'Keefe's death.</p>

<p>Yannetti also asked Caitlin Albert about <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-day-5/3360359/">Katie McLaughlin</a>, a Canton firefighter and previous witness in the case who she attended high school with.</p>

<p>"I can't think of a time possibly ever where her and I ever hung out 1-on-1 or individually," she said. "More of, like, a friend of a mutual friend."</p>

<p>"I would not consider her one of my, again, close friends," she added.</p>

<p>Court adjourned for the day around 4 p.m. Caitlin Albert is expected to return to the stand on Tuesday morning, which will be a half day of testimony.</p>

                    <p>BALTIMORE (AP) — After weeks of preparation, crews are scheduled to conduct a controlled demolition Monday to break down the largest remaining span of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Maryland, which came crashing down under the impact of a massive container ship on March 26.</p>
<p><strong>The demolition is expected to begin at 5 p.m. EDT. Watch it live in the player above.</strong></p>
<p>The steel span — which is an estimated 500 feet (152 meters) long and weighs up to 600 tons (544 metric tons) — landed on the ship’s bow after the Dali lost power and crashed into one of the bridge’s support columns shortly after leaving Baltimore. Since then, the ship has been stuck among the wreckage and Baltimore’s busy port has been closed to most maritime traffic.</p>
<p>Officials on Sunday said the demolition had been tentatively moved to Monday evening after lightning in the area and rising tides prompted them to reschedule.</p>
<p>Six members of a roadwork crew plunged to their deaths in the March 26 collapse. The last of their bodies was recovered from the underwater wreckage last week. All the victims were Latino immigrants who came to the U.S. for job opportunities. They were filling potholes on an overnight shift when the bridge was destroyed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/construction-workers-had-little-warning-as-baltimores-key-bridge-collapsed-raising-safety-concerns"><strong>READ MORE:</strong> Construction workers had little warning as Baltimore’s Key Bridge collapsed, raising safety concerns</a></p>
<p>The controlled demolition will allow the Dali to be refloated and guided back into the Port of Baltimore. Once the ship is removed, maritime traffic can begin returning to normal, which will provide relief for thousands of longshoremen, truckers and small business owners who have seen their jobs impacted by the closure.</p>
<p>The Dali’s 21-member crew will stay onboard the ship while the explosives are detonated.</p>
<p>William Marks, a spokesperson for the crew, said they would shelter “in a designated safe place” during the demolition. “All precautions are being taken to ensure everyone’s safety,” he said in an email.</p>
<p>Officials said the demolition is the safest and most efficient way to remove steel under a high level of pressure and tension.</p>
<p>“It’s unsafe for the workers to be on or in the immediate vicinity of the bridge truss for those final cuts,” officials said in a news release Sunday.</p>
<p>In a videographic released last week, authorities said engineers are using precision cuts to control how the trusses break down. They said the method allows for “surgical precision” and the steel structure will be “thrust away from the Dali” when the explosives send it tumbling into the water.</p>
<p>Once it’s demolished, hydraulic grabbers will lift the resulting sections of steel onto barges.</p>
<p>“It’s important to note that this controlled demolition is not like what you would see in a movie,” the video says, noting that from a distance it will sound like fireworks or loud thunder and give off puffs of smoke.</p>
<p>So far, about 6,000 tons (5,443 metric tons) of steel and concrete have been removed from the collapse site. Officials estimate the total amount of wreckage at 50,000 tons (45,359 metric tons), about the equivalent of 3,800 loaded dump trucks.</p>
<p>Officials previously said they hoped to remove the Dali by May 10 and reopen the port’s 50-foot (15.2-meter) main channel by the end of May.</p>

<p>The Dali is currently scheduled to be refloated during high tide on Tuesday, officials said Sunday. They said three or four tugboats will be used to guide the ship to a nearby terminal in the Port of Baltimore. It will likely remain there for a few weeks and undergo temporary repairs before being moved to a shipyard for more substantial repairs.</p>
<p>The Dali crew members haven’t been allowed to leave the vessel since the disaster. Officials said they have been busy maintaining the ship and assisting investigators. Of the crew members, 20 are from India and one is Sri Lankan.</p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board and the FBI are conducting <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/fbi-opens-criminal-investigation-into-baltimore-bridge-collapse-source-tells-ap">investigations into the bridge collapse</a>.</p>
<p>Danish shipping giant Maersk chartered the Dali for a planned trip from Baltimore to Sri Lanka, but the ship didn’t get far. Its crew sent a mayday call saying they had lost power and had no control of the steering system. Minutes later, the ship rammed into the bridge.</p>
<p>Officials have said the safety board investigation will focus on the ship’s electrical system.</p>

                                        <p>KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian troops were locked in intense battles with Ukrainian soldiers around the embattled town of Vovchansk in northeast Ukraine on Monday, pushing ahead with a ground offensive that opened a new front and put more pressure on overstretched Ukrainian forces. </p><p>Moscow’s renewed northeast offensive, launched late last week, was the most significant border incursion since the full-scale invasion began. </p><p>In just two days, Moscow has captured between 100 to 125 square kilometers (38 to 47 square miles) that includes at least seven villages, most of them already depopulated, according to two open source monitoring analysts. </p>
    
<p>Vovchansk, among the largest towns in the area whose pre-war population of 17,000 had dwindled to just 2,500 before Russia renewed its ground assault last week, has emerged as a key focus of the pitched battles engulfing the Kharkiv region. By Monday, only 200 to 300 residents remained, said Kharkiv Gov. Oleh Syniehubov, as Russian forces closed in from three sides. </p>
    

<p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-fortifications-8a72981dfdb755de6f8011b13f4d062e">Poorly built fortifications</a></span> and long-term ammunition shortages enabled Russia’s sweeping advance in the area since Friday, local officials and soldiers said. The Kremlin’s forces were seeking to divert and distract Ukrainian troops across the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line until a big batch of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-mike-johnson-ukraine-israel-b72aed9b195818735d24363f2bc34ea4">new military aid</a></span> for Kyiv from the U.S. and European partners arrives on the battlefield in the coming weeks and months, Ukrainian commanders and analysts said. </p>




    
<p>That makes this period a window of opportunity for Moscow and one of the most dangerous for Kyiv in the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">two-year war</a></span>, they said. By intensifying offensive operations, Russia seeks to stretch Ukraine’s forces thin and forge breakthroughs. </p><p>Russian forces claimed to have taken an additional 90 square kilometers (35 square miles), which has not been independently confirmed. </p><p>Opening a new front from two points along the border with the Russian region of Belgorod was the easiest tactic to pin down and divert Ukrainian forces from heavy battles raging in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Russia’s most sought-after prize. </p>
    

<p>“The enemy identified the most geographically convenient place ... the state border line,” said Yurii Federenko, commander of the ACHILLES battalion of the 92nd brigade. His unit was among others rotated into the northeast from the Donetsk region to stabilize the northeast front, he said. </p><p>He fears a similar front may be opened in the Sumy region, which also shares a border with Russia.</p><p>The string of villages captured along the contested gray zone, where enemy shelling precludes the building of fortifications, were also the easiest for Moscow’s forces to nab. Their momentum will likely slow as they approach better fortified settlements, Ukrainian commanders said. </p><p>Small batches of U.S. military aid have started to trickle into the front line in the form of much needed artillery, said Federenko, whose unit received some of the aid. But it will take at least two months before incoming supplies will meet Kyiv’s needs to hold the line, he said. Until they arrive, Ukraine won’t be able to seize the battlefield initiative, he said. </p>
    

<p>“They now have an opportunity to attack us while we cannot properly reply,” he said. </p><p>Russia’s offensive seeks to take advantage of this window of time. “In order to achieve success, in my opinion, in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the enemy needed to spread ... our defense forces. Accordingly, the enemy started the campaign in Kharkiv region specifically,” Federenko said. </p><p>The Kharkiv incursion has effectively pinned Ukrainian forces in the region, while potentially drawing precious reserves away from heavy battles in the Avdiivka and Chasiv Yar areas of the Donetsk region, where Russia’s advance has been far more significant and strategically important. </p><p>Ukrainian local officials said they feared Vovchansk’s fate may mirror that of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, Ukrainian cities where fierce fighting and scorched earth tactics forced Ukrainian withdrawals. </p><p>Russian forces were inching closer to Vovchansk, and heavy battles were ongoing on the town’s outskirts. Using assault infantry units Russian forces are attempting to secure positions in three directions, as Ukrainian forces attempt to dislodge them using firepower. Ukrainian commanders describe the battles as dynamic and complicated.</p>
    

<p>Russian troops have so far entrenched themselves in the villages of Strilecha, Pylna, Borysivka, Krasne, Oliynykove, Mrakovets, Pletenivka, and from there were launching attacks near Hlyboke Zelene Hatysche, and Buchansk.</p><p>The capture of the Donetsk city of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-avdiivka-2e827b4cae4698b3f6b80a421447fab8">Avdiivka</a></span> in February opened a door for the Kremlin’s troops to push westward, deeper into Donetsk. Russia illegally annexed Donetsk and three other regions in 2022 shortly after it invaded Ukraine, and taking control of all of Donetsk is one of the Kremlin’s main war goals.</p>
    

<p>If Ukraine isn’t able to halt Moscow’s advance, it could create conditions for a possible attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. </p><p>It could also create a “buffer zone” to protect Belgorod, where frequent Ukrainian attacks have embarrassed the Kremlin. In March, Russia announced plans to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-belgorod-border-evacuation-children-029e64bdb0d9ba2c8a13dc0854aa7ca4">evacuate about 9,000 children</a></span> from the Belgorod region because it was being shelled continuously.</p><p>Russian emergency services on Monday finished clearing the rubble in the region’s capital city of Belgorod, where a section of a residential building collapsed following what authorities said was Ukrainian shelling.</p><p>Fifteen bodies were pulled from the rubble, Belgorod regional Gov.
