            Beryl is the earliest major hurricane – defined as one that is Category 3 or higher – in the Atlantic in 58 years. The storm’s rapid intensification is very unusual this early into hurricane season, according to Brennan. It’s rare for tropical systems to form in the central Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles in June, particularly strong ones, with only a handful having done so, <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes/#map=3.76/10.35/-48.52&amp;search=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" target="_blank">according to NOAA records</a>.

            Beryl isn’t just early for this hurricane season: It is now the Atlantic Ocean’s third-earliest major hurricane. The earliest was Hurricane Alma on June 8, 1996, followed by Hurricane Audrey, which reached major hurricane status on June 27, 1957.

            Warmer waters in the Atlantic Basin have given tropical storms and hurricanes the opportunity to develop at a more rapid pace in an more eastward position, according to Brennan, allowing storms to become more powerful and therefore more destructive earlier on in hurricane season, which runs from June 1 until November 30.

<li>French political circles are considering the possibility of an emergency government of experts.</li>
<li>This idea is reminiscent of a concept commonly discussed in Italy, where an "expert government" has been floated as a solution to the country's political stalemate.</li>
<li>The motivation behind this proposal is not clearly stated in the article, but it may be a way to address France's political crisis or stabilize the country in a time of uncertainty.</li>
<li>The concept of an emergency government of experts suggests that France may be looking for a non-partisan solution to its political problems.</li>
<li>The timeframe for this potential development is not specified in the article, but it is likely to be a short-term or emergency measure rather than a long-term solution to France's political challenges.</li>

                                        <p>On Wednesday, Nyah Mway finished middle school in the central New York city where his family moved about a decade ago as refugees from Myanmar, relatives said.</p><p>By Friday night, the 13-year-old was fatally shot by police who’d tackled him to the ground after he allegedly pointed what turned out to be a BB gun at them during a foot chase.</p><p>Struggling to comprehend his death, his anguished relatives and outraged members of their immigrant community called Sunday for justice for him and accountability for police. </p><p>“We came to the United States, finally, to get the education and to get the good jobs here” and hoping for a peaceful life after decades of strife and violence in Myanmar, said Lay Htoo, who identified himself as one of Nyah’s cousins. </p><p>But instead of celebrating the teen’s ascent to high school, his parents were waiting for medical examiners to release his body and wondering what would become of the officers.</p>
    

<p>“They want them to be in prison forever,” the cousin said in a phone interview. </p><p>As the state attorney general and the Utica Police Department investigate the shooting, Nyah’s relatives and other local members of Myanmar’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-thailand-karen-guerrillas-9f10f507a9388fa326584893ba443f1b">Karen ethnic minority</a></span> said they planned to meet Sunday afternoon with Utica Mayor Michael P. Galime. A message seeking comment was sent to the mayor’s office.</p>



<p>For now, the officers are on paid administrative leave. </p><p>The shooting happened Friday night in Utica, an old industrial city where thousands of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/401514c43cb848309d4fa7b4a96459de">refugees from various countries have settled in recent decades</a></span>, creating a measure of revival in a faded Rust Belt hub. The city’s population of 65,000 includes more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.thecenterutica.org/community-resources/economic-impact/populations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to The Center</a></span>, a nonprofit group that helps to resettle refugees. </p>
    
<p>According to police, Nyah and another 13-year-old boy were stopped Friday night because they fit descriptions of suspects in an armed robbery that had happened Thursday in the same area, and because one teen was jaywalking. The police department declined Sunday to release the armed robbery report and its suspect description, citing the ongoing investigation. </p>
    

<p>The body camera video shows an officer saying he needs to pat them down for any weapons. Then one of the teens — identified as Nyah — runs away, turns and appears to point a black item at them. </p><p>The officers believed it was a handgun, police said, but it was later determined to be a BB or pellet gun that closely resembled a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine. Police released an image showing the device did not have an orange band on the barrel that many BB gun-makers have added in recent years to distinguish their products from firearms.</p><p>Officer Bryce Patterson caught up with Nyah, tackled and punched him, and as the two wrestled on the ground, Officer Patrick Husnay opened fire, body camera video showed. Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said at a news conference Saturday that the single shot hit the youth in the chest.</p><p>A bystander video posted to Facebook also showed an officer tackling the teen and punching him as two other officers arrive, then a gunshot ringing out as the teen was on the ground.</p>
    

<p>Under New York law, the attorney general’s office looks into every death at the hands of law enforcement. The police department’s own probe will explore whether officers followed policies and training.</p><p>Williams called the shooting “a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved, and his department said it released information and the body camera video in keeping with “our commitment to transparency.”</p><p>To Nyah’s cousin, Isabella Moo, however, the police narrative seemed like “trying to criminalize him a lot more and trying to protect the police officers.” </p><p>“The escalation of this should not have happened, and our police officers need to be trained a lot better or a lot differently,” she said in a phone interview. “The city needs to be held accountable, and this should not have been done to any child.”</p><p>Karens are among groups warring with the military rulers of Myanmar, the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-supreme-court-suu-kyi-special-appeal-reject-ee823606ef47a455818c3cac6b1618aa">Aung San Suu Kyi</a></span> in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule. </p>
    

<p>Nyah’s family fled about two decades ago from Myanmar to Thailand, where he was born in a refugee camp, and then immigrated through a resettlement program to the United States about nine years ago, Htoo said.

            The Massachusetts judge presiding over <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/karen-read-john-okeefe-what-we-know/index.html">the Karen Read murder trial</a> ordered the jury to continue deliberations after the jurors sent a note Friday saying they could not reach a unanimous verdict.

            The six man and six woman jury in the trial of Read, who is accused of drunkenly driving into her police officer boyfriend and leaving him to die in January 2022, informed the court shortly after midday, saying, “Despite our exhaustive review of the evidence and our diligent consideration of all disputed evidence, we have been unable to reach unanimous verdict.”

            After hearing arguments from the prosecution and defense, Norfolk County Superior Court Judge Beverly Cannone asked the jury to continue to deliberate.
    </p>

            “Lunch will be arriving shortly, when it comes, I’d ask you to clear your heads, have lunch and begin your deliberations again,” Cannone told the jurors.

            After the judge’s order, the jury continued deliberating until shortly after 4 p.m. local time. Deliberations will resume Monday morning at 9 a.m., the judge announced.
    </p>

            The jury has been deliberating Read’s fate since midday Tuesday. The case has featured accusations of a vast police cover-up as well as allegations of improper conduct and sexist text messages from a lead investigator.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxyzjqu300063b6kh8p0ygb5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The prosecution and defense both weighed in on the jury’s note, asking the judge to consider different outcomes in her decision on what to tell the jury.
    </p>

            “It is far, far, far too early in their deliberative process to even consider giving them any kind of Tuey-Rodriguez instruction or anything close to that,” Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally said, referring to a special set of Massachusetts instructions that are read to a jury when jurors are unable to agree on a verdict. “The note doesn’t really indicate affirmatively that they can’t come to a conclusion, it just says they haven’t come to a conclusion through their deliberative process at this time.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxyzlyw9000b3b6kqh6ds6ld@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Alternately, defense attorney David Yanetti argued the jury should be read the Tuey-Rodriguez criminal model instructions, indicating that they would like the court to proceed toward having a hung jury.
    </p>

            “The word exhaustive is the word I think that’s operative here,” he told the judge. “They are communicating to the court that they’ve exhausted all manner of compromise, all manner of persuasion, and they’re at an impasse.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxyzngse000h3b6kwllbx1s5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The judge said she weighed both counsel’s views in deciding to send the jury back to deliberate a verdict in the controversial case. The Tuey-Rodriguez instructions were not read to the jury. Case law cautions against reading the instruction prematurely.
    </p>

            Read, 45, pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of a collision resulting in death. If found guilty of second-degree murder, Read faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter265/Section2" target="_blank">according to Massachusetts law</a>.

            The body of her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O’Keefe, was found bruised and battered in the snow on January 29, 2022, outside the home of a fellow Boston police officer in Canton, Massachusetts.
    </p>

            Prosecutors have alleged Read and O’Keefe, who had an at-times tumultuous relationship, got into an argument that night, and that she drunkenly backed into him and fled the scene, leaving him to die in the cold.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxyxh237000a3b6kdp9zupnc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “What the constellation of the facts and the evidence ineluctably demonstrate here is that the defendant drove her vehicle in reverse at 24.2 miles per hour for 62.5 feet, struck Mr. O’Keefe, causing those catastrophic head injuries, leaving him incapacitated and freezing him to death,” prosecutor Adam Lally said in closing arguments Tuesday.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxyxh237000b3b6ko0acz4m5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            In contrast, Read’s defense has accused<em> </em>off-duty police inside that Canton home of fatally beating O’Keefe, dumping his body on the lawn and then conspiring through fabricated evidence and false testimony to frame Read.
    </p>

            “Ladies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,” defense attorney Alan Jackson said. “You’ll surely say to yourself, ‘I don’t want to believe it, I don’t want to believe that could happen in our community,’ but sadly over these past eight weeks you’ve seen it right before your eyes.”
    </p>

            The closing arguments represented the end of a murder trial that has garnered interest both local and widespread, including accusations of witness tampering, a federal probe into the investigation, and groups of pink-wearing supporters chanting to “Free Karen Read.”

            The prosecution’s case also has been hampered by a series of missteps and unusual investigative practices. Most notably, a lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, admitted that he sent a series of sexist and offensive texts about Read in a private group chat, calling her a “whack job,” mocking her medical issues and commenting to coworkers that he had found “no nudes” while searching her phone for evidence, <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/karen-read-trial-live-updates-june-10-2024/61054104" target="_blank">CNN affiliate WCVB reported</a>.

            Proctor apologized for the “unprofessional” comments on the stand, but the vulgar texts have been sharply criticized in and out of court, including from the governor.

            “It’s completely unprofessional,” Gov. <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/disgusted-gov-healey-reacts-to-troopers-texts-from-karen-read-case/61099964" target="_blank">Maura Healey told WCVB of the texts</a>. “It does harm, frankly, to the dignity and the integrity of the work of men and women across the state police and law enforcement. So as a former attorney general and as governor, I am disgusted by that.”

<ol>
<li>Maryland Governor Wes Moore has announced that he will not seek the Democratic nomination in the 2024 presidential election, solidifying President Biden's position as the party's likely nominee.</li>
<li>Moore, a rising star in the Democratic Party, has been a rumor as a potential replacement for President Biden if he drops out of the race, but he has now publicly committed to supporting Biden's reelection bid.</li>
<li>Despite President Biden's poor performance in the first presidential debate, Moore believes Biden should remain in the race and has pledged to work towards his reelection throughout November.</li>
<li>Moore has expressed confidence in Biden's ability to serve as president, stating that Biden "has earned — and Joe Biden deserves — the confidence, the respect, and frankly the partnership that we now have to provide to him."</li>
<li>Moore's announcement is seen as a significant boost for President Biden, as it sends a message to party members and potential voters that the party is united behind the incumbent president and will work to reelect him in November.</li>

At the debate, the 81-year-old president struggled to correct falsehoods from Trump, while delivering rambling answers to key questions in a hoarse voice. In the aftermath of the debate, his campaign has been clear that there are no conversations about the president stepping aside. </p>

<p>The debate came at a time when many Americans believe the president may be too old for the job. And a new <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-debate-should-biden-be-running-mental-abilities/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">CBS News poll</a></span> found that since the debate, the number of voters who say that Mr. Biden has the cognitive ability to serve as president has dropped from 35% just weeks ago to 27%. Nearly three quarters of voters say the president shouldn't be running for reelection, including almost half of Democrats, according to the poll. </p><p>At the same time, views of former President Donald Trump's cognitive ability aren't far off. About half of all voters say Trump doesn't have the cognitive health to serve. But voters generally believed Trump presented his ideas more clearly at the debate, while appearing more confident and presidential.</p><p>Moore insisted that "both candidates struggled" at Thursday's debate, shifting the focus to the former president rather than analyzing the leader of his own party's performance. </p><p>"So it wasn't a great night for the president or Donald Trump. But I also do know that performance does matter," Moore said, contrasting Mr. Biden's record with the former president's.</p>

<p>Moore acknowledged that the president "had a tough night," but said that "when we get knocked down we get back up," pointing to Mr. Biden's performance at a campaign event in North Carolina the following day, along with his other duties.</p><p>"He got back up and he got back to work," Moore said. </p><p>When questioned about the president's ability to serve as compared to younger alternatives within the party, the Maryland governor cited Mr. Biden's response to the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/francis-scott-key-bridge-collapse-timeline-911-call-dali-cargo-ship-mayday-maps-construction-worker-recovery/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Baltimore bridge collapse</a></span> earlier this year. Moore said he's seen the president "in times of trial," saying he's seen him be able to be a "remarkable partner to us."</p><p>"I saw when he said that he was going to be with us every step of the way that he is a man of his word. And I respect that, and I admire that and I will always stand by that," Moore said. "That is why I defend this president, that is why I need another four years."</p><p>For young voters, who make up a crucial voting bloc for Democrats, Moore said they are going to see themselves reflected in "all the people who are going out being the president's surrogates."</p><p>"I'm the youngest Democratic governor in this country, the only African American governor in America, and we're out here all the time," Moore said. "We're going to the people and we're making our case to the people as to why this kind of partnership matters."</p><p>Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat, also appeared on "Face the Nation" on Sunday and downplayed the importance of Mr. Biden's debate performance for Americans, pointing to his record instead. Himes said the president's job is "enormously hard and involves all kinds of things, none of which are standing and doing a debate for 90 minutes on TV."</p>

<p>"I'm not so cynical as to believe that the American people are going to choose a president based on a 90-minute debate rather than a four-year record of startling legislative achievements and of setting a tone that the rest of the world says 'wow, you know, America is back to the decent leader that we used to believe that it was prior to the Trump administration,'" he said.  </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>UK is a better place to live now than in 2010</strong>: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insisted that the country is a better place to live now than when the Conservatives came into government in 2010.</li>
<li><strong>Economic concerns and pandemic response</strong>: Sunak acknowledged that the Covid pandemic and war in Ukraine had made life "difficult for everyone", but claimed that the country is now "on the right track". Labour, however, pointed to rising prices, NHS waiting lists, and mortgage rates under the Conservatives.</li>

<li><strong>Labour's approach to Brexit</strong>: Labour's election co-ordinator Pat McFadden said his party would not sign up to any Brexit deal that wasn't in the UK's interest, and aimed to improve relations with the EU while maintaining control over borders.</li>
<li><strong>Liberal Democrat's Brexit stance</strong>: The Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper criticized the current Brexit deal as "botched" and advocated for free movement for under-35s to work or study in Europe, while simultaneously suggesting that immigration was too high.</li>
