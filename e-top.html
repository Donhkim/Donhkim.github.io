            <strong>• ‘Catastrophic flooding’ in Iowa: </strong>On Saturday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for 21 counties in northwest Iowa and directed all available state resources to assist Rock Valley and other communities in response to “catastrophic flooding.” In Rock Valley, all residences north of Highway 18 were being evacuated amid high floodwaters. There’s a level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall Saturday over northern Iowa, and that corner of the state has seen an estimated 10-plus inches of rain based on radar. The heaviest rain is expected further east. And in nearby Sioux Falls, South Dakota, nine people have been rescued in the past 24 hours from rising water due to heavy rainfall, according to City Emergency Manager Regan Smith.

            <strong>• Flood threat in fire zone: </strong>A flash flood warning was issued for Ruidoso and other New Mexico areas burned by the South Fork Fire after 0.5 inches of rain fell in the morning and more rain was expected into the late afternoon hours. Rain earlier in the week created a flash flood emergency with water rescues as a torrent of mud and water rushed from burned areas. Ground charred by fire, also known as a burn scar, loses its ability to effectively absorb water and more easily floods.

The mayor of hard-hit Ruidoso said they were preparing for more fatalities in the fires and bringing in dogs to help the search for “more loss of life.” The South Fork and Salt fires have together burned an estimated 24,000 acres and were still 0% contained as of Friday. Evacuations are still in effect for Village of Ruidoso and City of Ruidoso Downs residents and additional evacuation orders have been issued in at least seven more areas. Ruidoso residents will be allowed to return to their homes Monday, and authorities ask that they bring at least a week’s worth of food and drinking water, as grocery stores are not operating at full capacity. Meanwhile, FBI special agents have joined the investigation into the cause of wildfires.

Israel said Saturday that it was continuing to operate in central and southern Gaza and has pushed ahead with its invasion of Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from fighting elsewhere. Most have now fled the city, but the United Nations says no place in Gaza is safe and humanitarian conditions are dire as families shelter in tents and cramped apartments without adequate food, water or medical supplies.</p>
    

<p>A separate Israeli strike Saturday in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley killed a member of the military wing of al-Jamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, a Sunni Muslim faction closely allied with Hamas, according to the group. The member was the seventh killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon since the war began.</p>



<p>The Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. when Hamas militants who stormed southern Israel killed about 1,200 people and took some 250 others hostage. Israel has responded by bombarding and invading the enclave, killing more than 37, 400 Palestinians there according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. </p>

<p>At least 549 Palestinians in the territory have been killed by Israeli fire since the war began, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which tracks the killings.

Commenting on the shooting, the Israeli army said its forces raided al-Amari refugee camp near Ramallah to arrest a suspect Friday and then opened fire on a group of Palestinians who were pelting them with stones. </p>
    

<p>Israel said Saturday that it was investigating a separate incident into conduct of its soldiers after a video surfaced online showing an injured Palestinian being transported on the hood of an Israeli armored car in the northern West Bank. The army said the man in the video was a wanted suspect and injured during an exchange of fire between Palestinian militants and Israeli forces near the city of Jenin. The man was being transported to a Red Crescent ambulance situated nearby, it said. The army said the conduct in the video didn’t “conform to the values” of the army. </p><p>Anger across the country is growing at the government’s handling of the war in Gaza and the hostage crisis. </p>
    

<p>On Saturday, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv calling for new elections and for the government to bring the hostages home.

<ol>
<li>Two Hispanic men, Franklin Jose Pena Ramos and Johan Jose Rangel Martinez, were arrested and charged with the murder of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray in Houston, Texas.</li>
<li>The men, who are illegal immigrants from Venezuela, were recently caught by Border Patrol and released into the US, according to a report by Fox News.</li>
<li>The Associated Press (AP) reported on the arrests, but failed to mention that the suspects were illegal immigrants.</li>
<li>Prominent social media users, including Senator Ted Cruz, criticized the AP's report for ignoring this crucial detail, calling it "not journalism".</li>
<li>The men reportedly lured Nungaray under a bridge in Houston, tied her up, and killed her, with prosecutors alleging that they planned and executed the murder.</li>

About two-thirds of Americans say abortion should generally be legal, according to polling last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.</p>    
  <h2>A federal ban on abortion</h2><p>Ralph Reed, the founder and chairman of the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition that Trump will address Saturday, said people in his movement would like to see a federal ban on abortion and want Republican elected officials to be "profiles in courage" who are "articulating their strongly held pro-life views."</p><p>But, Reed said, Trump's positions do not put him at risk of losing any of the deep support of <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iowa-evangelical-voters-iowa-trump-desantis-haley/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">evangelical </a></span>voters who give him "more slack in the rope than they would likely give another politician."</p>

    </p>
<p>"I don't think it's going to hurt him at all because he's got enormous credibility on this issue," Reed said. "He did more for the pro-life and pro-family cause than any president we've ever had in the history of the movement."</p><figure class="embed embed--type-video embed--type-content_video is-video embed--float-left embed--size-medium ">

"I understand though, that as in accordance with the Constitution, that decision should be left up to the states."</p><p>Dickinson said she can't stand the abortion law in her state, which does not set limits on the procedure based on gestational age. But she said outside of preferring a national ban, leaving the issue to the state "is the best alternative."</p>

<p>John Pudner, a 59-year-old who recently started a Faith &amp; Freedom chapter in his home state of Wisconsin, said members of the movement feel loyal to Trump but "we'd generally like him to be more pro-life."</p><p>"I think a lot, you know, within the pro-life movement feel like, well, gosh, they're kind of thinking he's too far pro-choice," he said. "But because they appreciate his Supreme Court justices, like that's a positive within the pro-life community."</p><h2>Evangelical support</h2><p>According to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate, about 8 in 10 white evangelical Christian voters supported Trump in 2020, and nearly 4 in 10 Trump voters identified as white evangelical Christians. White evangelical Christians made up about 20% of the overall electorate that year.</p><p>Beyond just offering their own support in the general election, Reed's group plans to help get out the vote for Trump and other Republicans, aiming to use volunteers and paid workers to knock on millions of doors in battleground states.</p><p>While he still takes credit for the reversal of <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/contraception-access-roe-v-wade-donald-trump-keller-at-large/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Roe v. Wade</a></span>, Trump has also warned abortion can be tricky politically for Republicans. For months he deferred questions about his position on a national ban.</p><p>Last year, when Trump addressed Reed's group, he said there was "a vital role for the federal government in protecting unborn life" but didn't offer any details beyond that.</p><p>In April of this year, Trump said he believed the issue should now be left to the states. He later stated in an interview that he would not sign a nationwide ban on abortion if it was passed by Congress. He has still declined to detail his position on women's access to the abortion pill mifepristone.</p>

    </p>
<p>In 2016, white evangelical Christians were initially reluctant to support Trump and suspicious of his image as a twice-divorced New York City tabloid celebrity who had at one point described himself as "very pro-choice."</p><p>But his promises to appoint justices to the court that would overturn Roe, along with his decision in 2016 to name Mike Pence, an evangelical Christian, as his running mate, helped him gain the movement's backing.</p><p>Several Republicans seen as potential running mates for Trump are also speaking at the conference, including New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, former presidential candidate and Trump Housing Secretary Ben Carson and Arizona Senate candidate <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elise-stefanik-rebuke-biden-praise-trump-israeli-parliament/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Kari Lake. Stefanik</a></span> and Carson are among the Republicans who received vetting paperwork from the Trump campaign in recent weeks.</p><p>Reed said members of his coalition are watching them closely and looking for Trump to pick someone who shares his views.</p><p>"We're looking for somebody who will be a champion, a pro-family and pro-life and pro-Israel champion. And we're looking for someone who has the ability to bring some new folks into the fold and act as an ambassador for our values," he said.</p><p>Reed wouldn't name any of the field as strongest or weakest, calling it "an embarrassment of riches."</p><p>Later Saturday, Trump plans to hold an evening rally in Philadelphia.</p>

            “Why did I say that? It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union was giving this man [Putin] a reason to his Russian people to say they’re coming for us again, and to go to war,” he told the BBC’s Nick Robinson.

            Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reacted to the comments today while speaking to journalists. “What he said was completely wrong and only plays into Putin’s hands,” said Sunak. “This kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain’s security.”

The current level is considered a 3.7-month supply, the highest in over four years. Inventory is nearly 19% higher than in the same month a year ago.</p><p>"People's circumstances change," Yun said. Households wanting to retire in different locations, families with new children needing a bigger house, and workers relocating for new jobs are all reasons homeowners may be listing their homes.</p><p>"With time, people just simply cannot live in the same house," Yun said. Still, inventory remains much lower than in the pre-pandemic era, when available units ranged from 1.8 million to 2.3 million prior to 2019.</p><p>The median home price increased by almost 6% annually in May to a record high of $419,300, according to the NAR. Home prices have recorded year-over-year gains for 11 consecutive months. May's increase also marked the strongest price appreciation since October 2022.</p><p>Properties typically stay on the market for 24 days in May, two days fewer than in April but much higher than last May's 18 days.
