Egypt has refused to coordinate with Israel on the delivery of aid though the crossing because of “the unacceptable Israeli escalation,” the state-owned Al Qahera News television channel reported, citing an unnamed official.</p>



<p>U.S. President Joe Biden has said he won’t provide offensive weapons to Israel for Rafah. On Friday, his administration said there was “reasonable” <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-gaza-war-nsm-international-law-c83b6f39ce2799e5d2c473a337e2f857">evidence that Israel had breached international law</a></span> protecting civilians — Washington’s strongest statement yet on the matter.</p>
    
<p>In response, Ophir Falk, foreign policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a></span>, told The Associated Press that Israel acts in compliance with the laws of armed conflict and the army takes extensive measures to avert civilian casualties, including alerting people to military operations via phone calls and text messages.</p>

The latest evacuations are forcing some to return north, where areas are devastated from previous attacks. Aid agencies estimate that 110,000 had left before Saturday’s order that adds 40,000.</p><p>“Do we wait until we all die on top of each other? So we’ve decided to leave,” Rafah resident Hanan al-Satari said as people rushed to load mattresses, water tanks and other belongings onto vehicles.</p><p>“The Israeli army does not have a safe area in Gaza. They target everything,” said Abu Yusuf al-Deiri, displaced earlier from Gaza City.</p><p>Many people have been displaced multiple times. There are few places left to go. Some Palestinians are being sent to what Israel has called humanitarian safe zones along the Muwasi coastal strip, which is already packed with about 450,000 people in squalid conditions.</p><p>Georgios Petropoulos, with the U.N. humanitarian agency in Rafah, said that aid workers had no supplies to help people set up in new locations. </p><p>“We simply have no tents, we have no blankets, no bedding,” he said.</p>
    

<p>The World Food Program had said it would run out of food to distribute in southern Gaza by Saturday, Petropoulos said — a further challenge as parts of Gaza face what the WFP chief has called <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-famine-world-food-program-israel-hamas-war-476941bf2dc259f85a706408b2a665ff">“full-blown famine.”</a></span> Aid groups have said that fuel will be depleted soon, forcing hospitals to shut down critical operations.</p><p>Heavy fighting was also underway in northern Gaza, where Hagari said that the air force was carrying out airstrikes. Palestinians in Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and surrounding areas were told to leave for shelters in the west of Gaza City, warned that Israel would strike with “great force.”</p><p>Northern Gaza was the first target of Israel’s ground offensive launched after Hamas and other militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 250 hostage. They still hold about 100 captives and the remains of more than 30. Hamas on Saturday said that hostage Nadav Popplewell had died after being wounded in an Israeli airstrike a month ago, but provided no evidence.</p>
    

<p>Israel’s bombardment and ground offensives have killed more than 34,800 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures. Israel blames Hamas for civilian casualties, accusing it of embedding in densely populated residential areas.</p><p>Civil authorities in Gaza gave more details of mass graves that the Health Ministry announced earlier at Shifa hospital, the largest in northern Gaza and the target of an earlier Israeli offensive. Authorities said most of the 80 bodies were patients who died from lack of care. The Israeli army said “any attempt to blame Israel for burying civilians in mass graves is categorically false.”</p>
    

<p>At least 19 people, including eight women and eight children, were killed overnight in central Gaza in strikes that hit Zawaida, Maghazi and Deir al-Balah, according to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital and an AP journalist who counted the bodies.</p><p>“Children, what is the fault of the children who died?” one relative said. A woman stroked the face of one of the children lying on the ground.</p><p>Another round of cease-fire talks in Cairo ended earlier this week without a breakthrough, after Israel rejected a deal that Hamas said it accepted.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people attended the latest anti-government protest in Israel on Saturday evening amid growing pressure on Netanyahu to make a deal. </p><p>“I think the (Rafah) operation is not meant for the hostages and not meant for killing the Hamas, it’s meant for just for one thing, save the government,” protester Kobi Itzhaki said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Sam Mednick reported from Tel Aviv and Samy Magdy from Cairo.

<li>Former President Donald Trump's Chicago skyscraper has been audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over a dubious accounting maneuver that allegedly claims improper tax breaks.</li>
<li>The IRS is disputing Trump's claim, which could result in a tax bill of over $100 million if Trump loses the audit battle.</li>
<li>The 92-story skyscraper, which is the tallest and last major project by Trump, was a significant money-loser due to cost overruns and opening during the Great Recession.</li>
<li>Trump allegedly took advantage of tax benefits from his losses, but the IRS argues that he wrote off the same losses twice, which is seen as an improper accounting maneuver.</li>
<li>The IRS audit is focused on Trump's attempt to claim tax benefits from his losses at the Chicago skyscraper, which suggests that the Trump administration may have taken an aggressive stance on tax avoidance.</li>

<li><strong>Violence broke out at UCLA</strong>: Late on April 30, masked agitators attacked pro-Palestinian protesters on a campus quad at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), with witnesses calling 911 to report the incident.</li>
<li><strong>911 calls were made</strong>: Sean Tabibian, a local business executive and UCLA alumnus, made multiple 911 calls to report the violence, with records showing 11 calls made between 11:09 pm and the early hours of May 1.</li>
<li><strong>Responding to the violence</strong>: Although Tabibian was told by 911 operators that police were responding to the incident, no officers arrived on the scene during the reported violence.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns about discrimination</strong>: Tabibian, who was near the campus at the time of the incident, expressed concerns that protesters had been discriminating against Jewish students.</li>
<li><strong>Mixed responses</strong>: The article does not explicitly state the outcome of the incident or the response of authorities, but rather presents a narrative of the events as reported by witnesses, including Tabibian's account of being told that police were responding to the 911 calls but not arriving on the scene.</li>

Elsewhere police have been accused of using heavy-handed tactics, but at UCLA, where university policy discourages calling police preemptively, campus police as well as the Los Angeles Police Department and California Highway Patrol are facing scrutiny for their hands-off approach that night.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">It’s not clear why police waited so long to respond. But in the hours before they took action, at least 16 people were visibly injured, the majority of them pro-Palestinian, including two protesters who could be seen with blood streaking across their faces and soaking into their clothes, videos and images show. The counterprotesters ignited at least six fireworks; struck protesters at least 20 times with wooden planks, metal poles and other objects; and punched or kicked at least eight protesters.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">The protesters occasionally fought back.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Barron Trump, the youngest son of former US President Donald Trump, is declining to serve as a delegate on behalf of his father at the Republican National Convention.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The 18-year-old's decision was announced by his mother, Melania Trump's office, with a statement saying that Barron "regretfully declines to participate due to prior commitments".</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Florida Republican Party had earlier announced that Barron would be among those selecting Donald Trump as the party's presidential nominee.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Donald Trump, the former President, reacted to the news, saying he is "all for it" and seemingly indicating that he had expected his son to participate.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This would have been Barron Trump's first major political appearance, making his decision not to participate notable and unexpected.</strong></li>

<li>President Biden warned Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel on February 11 that a major assault on the Gaza city of Rafah would have consequences, suggesting that continued U.S. support would depend on how Israel proceeded.</li>

The president’s chief diplomat was calling from his blue-and-white government plane as he was flying home from a security conference in Munich.
