    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Defense lawyers question Michael Cohen's credibility</strong>: Defense attorney Todd Blanche pressed Cohen on his criminal history and past lies, trying to convince jurors not to believe his pivotal testimony in the hush money trial against Donald Trump.</li>
<li><strong>Cohen's testimony crucial in the case</strong>: Whether the defense is successful in undermining Cohen's credibility could determine Trump's fate in the case. Cohen described meetings and conversations he had with Trump about the alleged scheme to stifle stories about sex that threatened to torpedo Trump's 2016 campaign.</li>
<li><strong>Trump's lawyers focus on Cohen's misdeeds</strong>: The defense is trying to portray Cohen as a serial fabulist who is bent on seeing Trump behind bars. This shift in focus aims to discredit Cohen's testimony and undermine the prosecution's case.</li>
<li><strong>Prosecution's case against Trump</strong>: Trump is facing four criminal indictments and a civil lawsuit related to the alleged hush money scheme. The prosecution alleges that Trump made false statements to banks and insurance companies in 2015 and 2016 as part of his efforts to conceal the payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Cohen's testimony</strong>: Cohen's testimony has been crucial in the case, and the defense's attack on his credibility could impact the outcome of the trial. If the jury questions Cohen's credibility, it could undermine the prosecution's case and potentially lead to a not-guilty verdict for Trump.</li>

    </div><p>The defense also attacked Cohen’s motivations, suggesting he turned on Trump after he was denied a White House job. Blanche confronted Cohen with a a series of text messages showing private conversations he had in November 2016. In one message, Cohen texted his daughter that he still had a shot at becoming the president’s chief of staff. Another shows Cohen telling a friend that she could serve as his assistant once he gets the position.</p>
    
<p>“The truth is, Mr. Cohen, you really wanted to work in the White House, correct?” asked Blanche. “No sir,” Cohen replied.</p><p>Cohen is by far prosecutors’ most important witness, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-cohen-hush-money-stormy-daniels-735aadfd1ce015e05ba955c203a96f1b">placing Trump directly at the center</a></span> of the alleged scheme to silence women who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies the women’s claims. Cohen told jurors that Trump promised to reimburse him for the money he fronted and was constantly updated about behind-the-scenes efforts to bury stories feared to be harmful to his 2016 campaign.</p>
    

<p>Trump, who insists the prosecution is an effort to damage his campaign to reclaim the White House, says the payments to Cohen were properly categorized as legal expenses because Cohen was a lawyer. The defense has suggested that he was trying to protect his family, not his campaign, by squelching what he says were false, scurrilous claims.</p>



<p>“The crime is that they’re doing this case,” he told reporters Thursday before entering the courtroom, flanked by a group of congressional allies that included Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., and Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., the chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus.</p><p>The former president has been joined at the courthouse in recent days by a slew of conservative supporters, including some considered potential vice presidential picks and others angling for future administration roles. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-speaker-mike-johnson-court-09aef3de395fa77843f2600f40da6ac3">House Speaker Mike Johnson</a></span> appeared Tuesday.</p>
    

<p>Gaetz later <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://twitter.com/mattgaetz/status/1791101846972449026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a photo</a></span> on social media of him standing behind Trump in court, with the words, “Standing back, and standing by, Mr. President.” That is a phrase that the Proud Boys, an extremist group whose leaders were convicted of seditious conspiracy after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, have used since Trump, during a 2020 campaign debate, said: “Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.”</p><p>Blanche confronted Cohen with profane social media posts, a podcast and books he wrote about the former president, getting Cohen to acknowledge that he has made millions of dollars off slamming Trump. In one clip played in court Thursday, Cohen could be heard using an expletive and saying he truly hopes “that this man ends up in prison.”</p><p>“It won’t bring back the year that I lost or the damage done to my family. But revenge is a dish best served cold,” Cohen was heard saying. “You better believe that I want this man to go down.”</p>
    

<p>Cohen acknowledged he has continued to attack Trump, even during the trial.</p><p>In one social media post cited by the defense attorney, Cohen called Trump an alliterative and explicit nickname, as well as an “orange-crusted ignoramus.” Asked if he used the phrase, Cohen responded: “Sounds correct.”</p><p>Cohen, in earlier testimony, told jurors how his life and relationship with Trump were upended after the FBI raided his office, apartment and hotel room in 2018. Trump initially showered him with affection on social media and predicted that Cohen would not “flip.” Trump’s tone changed when, months later, Cohen <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/8b9d39ea54374ae296a9a8401bf58cb8">pleaded guilty to federal campaign-finance charges</a></span> and implicated him in the hush money scheme. Trump was not charged with a crime related to the federal investigation.</p>
    

<p>Cohen also described a meeting in which he says he and Trump discussed with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/weisselberg-trump-perjury-new-york-b76cde56c6cb983ab8789f95d5a0c6c0">Allen Weisselberg</a></span>, a former Trump Organization chief financial officer, how the reimbursements for Cohen’s $130,000 hush money payment to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-gag-order-d853768fff5fafbdee55623579889140">porn actor Stormy Daniels</a></span> would be paid as legal services over monthly installments. That’s important because prosecutors say the reimbursements were falsely logged as legal expenses to conceal the payments’ true purpose.</p><p>Defense lawyers are expected to question Cohen through the end of the day on Thursday. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office has said it will rest its case once he’s done on the stand, though it could have an opportunity to call rebuttal witnesses if Trump’s lawyers put on witnesses of their own.</p><p>The defense isn’t obligated to call any witnesses, and it’s unclear whether the attorneys will do so. Blanche told Judge Juan M.

<li>The Supreme Court has rejected a broad challenge to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a watchdog agency created in 2010 to protect consumers from predatory lending practices.</li>
<li>The court's 7-2 decision, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, upheld the CFPB's funding mechanism, which comes from the profits of the Federal Reserve, rather than annual appropriations from Congress.</li>
<li>The CFPB was established in the wake of the financial crisis to prevent abuses, such as predatory lending and junk fees, and to protect borrowers.</li>
<li>The challenge to the CFPB's constitutionality was sparked by a lower court ruling that identified flaws in the agency's funding mechanism.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court's decision is a victory for the CFPB and financial regulators, as it maintains the agency's autonomy and ability to operate effectively in protecting consumers from financial abuses.</li>

    <div><section class="content__body"><p><em>Washington</em> — The Justice Department officially proposed a new rule on Thursday that would reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III drug, a policy move that would ease restrictions on cannabis on the federal level if ultimately approved. </p><p>While the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marijuana-reclassified-drug-enforcement-administration-shift/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">rescheduling of marijuana</a></span> would neither make the substance legal nor decriminalize it across the nation, changing the classification from its current Schedule I status to Schedule III would bring the drug into regulatory parity with other substances, like ketamine and anabolic steroids.</p><p>The Drug Enforcement Administration currently classifies marijuana as a substance that has "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse." The proposed rule would shift the DEA's treatment of the drug to one that has "a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence."</p>    
  <p>The proposal kicks off a months-long comment and administrative period, meaning the rescheduling would not immediately take effect. After 60 days, officials will make a final determination before the rule is officially published. </p><p>In 2022, President Biden asked the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department to examine the DEA's marijuana classification. According to a Justice Department memo published last month, HHS "concluded after reviewing several studies that there was some credible scientific support that marijuana could be used effectively" in certain medical situations.</p>

    </p>
<p>"No professional medical organization currently recommends use of marijuana," the memo said, adding that "one recommends against its use." Dozens of states already allow marijuana to be used for medicinal purposes or recreationally.</p><p>The notice of proposed rulemaking sent to the Federal Register on Tuesday said the attorney general "concurs with HHS's recommendation, for purposes of initiation of these rulemaking proceedings, that marijuana has a potential for abuse less than the drugs or other substances in schedules I and II." </p><p>Mr. Biden called the move "monumental" in a video posted Tuesday and noted marijuana policy has been a priority of his administration. </p><p>Last year, the president moved to pardon thousands of Americans convicted at the federal level for simple possession of cannabis and urged governors to do the same. Advocates for a policy change, including Mr. Biden, have said marijuana scheduling has unduly affected minority populations and have resulted in harsh prison sentences for mere possession.</p>

    </p>
<p>News of the proposed rescheduling broke in late April after Attorney General Merrick Garland and the DEA submitted the rule to administration officials for review. Critics of the move — including multiple former officials at the DEA who spoke with CBS News — said at the time that the administration was making a mistake because of risks posed by the drug's side effects. And the new rule, they said, would be a gateway to more dangerous substances.</p><p><em>Pat Milton contributed to this report. </em></p>

            The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to advance contempt proceedings against Attorney General Merrick Garland for his refusal to turn over audio recordings of President Joe Biden’s interview with special counsel Robert Hur.

            The panel approved a report recommending a contempt of Congress resolution against Garland for failing to comply with a congressional subpoena, paving the way for the full House to vote on holding the attorney general in contempt, though it is not clear when that vote could take place. The House Oversight Committee will also take up the issue of contempt for Garland Thursday evening.
    </p>

            Republicans have seized on Hur’s description of Biden as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” in his final report, a characterization that Biden has disputed. Republicans say that access to the tapes would provide valuable information beyond what a written transcript can provide, but the Department of Justice has raised questions over whether the House GOP is seeking the audio files solely for political purposes and maintains they have distinct privacy concerns to protect.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw9e72l000023b6k8bgc7q9z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The special counsel report quickly became a political problem for the president, spotlighting an issue that has proven to be intractable for Biden: his age. The White House and Biden’s campaign reacted furiously to Hur’s characterization of the president, launching a fierce defense aimed at beating back the special counsel’s allegations that Biden was forgetful — particularly on the matter of whether the president recalled the year in which his son died.

            Republican lawmakers had previously subpoenaed the audio recordings of Biden’s interviews, along with his ghostwriter, Mark Zwonitzer, and other items from Hur’s investigation into Biden’s handling of classified information.

            Through their subpoenas to the DOJ, House Republicans have argued that the audio recordings are crucial to their impeachment inquiry into Biden, which remains stalled as the prospects of the investigation ending in impeachment are increasingly unlikely. Without the votes in their narrow majority or evidence of an impeachable offense, Republicans are now struggling with how to end their probe and are looking for ways to target other members of the Biden administration.

            “Because of the President’s longstanding commitment to protecting the integrity, effectiveness, and independence of the Department of Justice and its law enforcement investigations, he has decided to assert executive privilege over the recordings,” White House Counsel Edward Siskel wrote to House Oversight Chair James Comer and House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan.

<p>Judges at the court have broad powers to order a cease-fire and other measures, although the court does not have its own enforcement apparatus. A <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-united-nations-netherlands-the-hague-e135b9bb3ba785607694c843e18b6f3b">2022 order</a></span> by the court demanding that Russia halt its full-scale invasion of Ukraine has so far gone unheeded.</p>

The country says Rafah is the last stronghold of the militant group. </p>
    
<p>The latest request focuses on the incursion into Rafah. </p><p>South Africa argues that the military operation has far surpassed justified self-defense. “Israel’s actions in Rafah are part of the end game. This is the last step in the destruction of Gaza,” lawyer Vaughan Lowe said. </p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/icj-south-africa-israel-restrictions-f7ff022da34bcd1b5fbd88e4b0dda8ed">According to the latest request</a></span>, the previous preliminary orders by The Hague-based court were not sufficient to address “a brutal military attack on the sole remaining refuge for the people of Gaza.” Israel will be allowed to answer the accusations on Friday. </p>

In a second order in March, the court said Israel must take measures to improve the humanitarian situation. </p><p>South Africa has to date submitted four requests for the international court to investigate Israel. It was granted a hearing three times. </p><p>Most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people have been displaced since fighting began.</p><p>The war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7 in which Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages. Gaza’s Health Ministry says over 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants in its count.</p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/un-court-south-africa-israel-gaza-genocide-71be2ce7f09bfee05a7cae26689ee262">South Africa initiated proceedings</a></span> in December 2023 and sees the legal campaign as rooted in issues <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-palestine-israel-genocide-mandela-arafat-39d222b9dd65994c4c13730efabe8815">central to its identity</a></span>.

<p>On Sunday, Egypt announced it plans to join the case. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Israeli military actions “constitute a flagrant violation of international law, humanitarian law, and the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 regarding the protection of civilians during wartime.”</p><p>Several countries have also indicated they plan to intervene, but so far only Libya, Nicaragua and Colombia have filed formal requests to do so.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Causes of Death</strong>: A 14-year-old boy, Harris Wolobah, died from cardiopulmonary arrest, likely due to his recent ingestion of a spicy chip with high capsaicin concentration, according to a medical examiner's report.</li>
<li><strong>Spicy Chip</strong>: The chip in question was a Paqui brand tortilla chip, dusted with two of the hottest peppers in the world, the Carolina Reaper and Naga Viper. The chip was marketed as the "One Chip Challenge" and featured a skull and snake design.</li>
<li><strong>Warning Label</strong>: The chip's label carried a warning, "Inside: One Extremely Hot Chip," and instructed customers to wait as long as possible before eating or drinking anything after consuming the chip.</li>
<li><strong>Medical Conditions</strong>: The medical examiner's report noted that Harris had a pre-existing heart condition, including cardiomegaly (enlarged heart) and myocardial bridging of the left anterior descending coronary artery.</li>
<li><strong>Manner of Death</strong>: The medical examiner's office could not determine the manner of death, leaving it as "undetermined." The boy's mother, Lois Wolobah, has previously stated that she believes the spicy chip contributed to his death.</li>

On January 10, 2017, just 10 days before Trump's inauguration, Tapper co-authored a blockbuster report about the existence of the now-infamous Steele dossier and spent several months legitimizing its claims. </p><p>Even after the release of the Mueller report that failed to find evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, Tapper suggested Trump sounded like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnns-jake-tapper-trump-gives-putins-pov-like-the-spokesman-for-the-kremlin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"the spokesman for the Kremlin"</a> over comments Trump made about his May 2019 conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin. </p><p>Throughout the 2020 presidential election, Tapper became more vocal about his animus towards the then-president. In March 2020, in the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, he said Trump "continues to lie to the American people" about COVID testing at the time. The following month, Tapper retweeted a post from anti-Trump critic George Conway <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-jake-tapper-george-conway-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calling Trump "100% insane."</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnns-jake-tapper-says-durham-report-devastating-fbi-after-spending-years-legitimizing-russiagate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CNN'S JAKE TAPPER SAYS DURHAM REPORT IS ‘DEVASTATING’ FOR FBI AFTER SPENDING YEARS LEGITIMIZING RUSSIAGATE </strong></a></p><p>In October 2020, Tapper shamed Trump after he was diagnosed and hospitalized for COVID. </p><p>"Make no mistake, this was not just reckless behavior, this was a demonstration of a wanton disregard for human life. President Trump, now in quarantine, has become a symbol of his own failures," Tapper told CNN viewers. </p><p>Weeks later, after Trump's defeat in the 2020 election, Tapper declared "for tens of millions of our fellow Americans: their long national nightmare is over."</p><p>"It's been a time of extreme divisions, many of the divisions caused and exacerbated by President Trump himself," Tapper <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnns-jake-tapper-declares-the-trump-era-is-over" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in an impassioned monologue</a>. </p><p>"It's been a time of several significant and utterly avoidable failures, most tragically, of course, the unwillingness to respect facts and science and do everything that could be done to save lives during a pandemic. It has been a time where truth and fact where truth and fact were treated with distain," he continued. "It was a time of cruelty where official inhumanities such as child separation became the official shameful policy of the United States. But now the Trump presidency is coming to an end."</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash were tapped to moderate the first presidential debate slated for June 27.</span> <span>(Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images)</span></p></div></div></div><p>Tapper maintained his animosity towards Trump and his supporters long after the 45th president left office. For several months, Tapper banned GOP lawmakers who challenged the results of the 2020 election who he deemed "election liars" from appearing on his programs, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jake-tapper-cnn-book-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite having written a book</a> titled "Down and Dirty: The Plot to Steal the Presidency" about George W. Bush's election victory in 2000 and routinely inviting Democrats who didn't accept Trump's 2016 victory and other prominent election deniers like former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams onto his shows. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-hits-back-jake-tapper-after-demanded-cnn-cut-footage-enthused-trump-supporters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP HITS BACK AT JAKE TAPPER AFTER HE DEMANDED THAT CNN CUT FOOTAGE OF ENTHUSED TRUMP SUPPORTERS</strong></a></p><p>He even questioned the patriotism of Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jake-tapper-brian-mast-commitment-democracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Mast</a>, R-Fla., an army veteran who lost both legs in 2010 after stepping on an IED in Afghanistan, after Mast voted against Trump's 2021 impeachment.</p><p>"Congressman Brian Mast, a Republican from Florida — who lost his legs, by the way, fighting for democracy abroad, although I don't know... about his commitment to it here in the United States," Tapper told a panel.  </p><p>Tapper continued to rail against Trump and Republicans <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jake-tapper-fuels-gop-bashing-primetime-despite-cnns-newfound-mission-towards-nonpartisanship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during his brief 2022 stint in primetime</a>, blasting his "unhinged lies" and his "refusal to accept reality… this anti-democracy insanity." He plugged the Jan. 6 Committee's final hearing as "one last chance to try to convince rational Americans about the dangers of the anti-democracy movement."</p><p>In December, the liberal CNN anchor declared that "the dehumanizing rhetoric of Adolf Hitler is once again alive and well" while condemning Trump's comments about illegal immigrants "poisoning the blood of our country."</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Tapper repeatedly piled on former President Trump during his brief stint in CNN primetime.</span> <span>(Screenshot/CNN)</span></p></div></div></div><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnns-jake-tapper-insists-wont-shy-away-covering-hunter-biden-avoiding-laptop-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CNN'S JAKE TAPPER INSISTS HE WON'T ‘SHY AWAY’ FROM COVERING HUNTER BIDEN AFTER AVOIDING LAPTOP SCANDAL IN 2020</strong></a></p><p>Meanwhile, Tapper has been far gentler towards Biden and Democrats. In October 2020, he joined the media chorus in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jake-tapper-declares-hunter-biden-claims-too-disgusting-to-repeat-on-cnn-the-rightwing-is-going-crazy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoiding the bombshell revelations</a> from Hunter Biden's laptop, saying "the rightwing is going crazy with all sorts of allegations about [then-candidate] Biden and his family, too disgusting to even repeat here." In 2022, Tapper conducted a softball interview with Biden, which made so little news that it received virtually zero coverage on the five Sunday shows that weekend. </p><p>He had one question pertaining to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jake-tappers-soft-hunter-biden-question-during-biden-interview-follows-medias-weak-coverage-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hunter Biden's legal woes</a> amid reports that criminal charges against him by the DOJ were imminent, asking the president, "Personally and politically, how do you react to that?" without any followups. </p><p>Last year, Tapper chalked up the Biden family's foreign money transactions uncovered by House Republicans <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnns-jake-tapper-chalks-up-biden-family-money-revelations-sleazy-not-criminal-during-comer-clash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as being "sleazy" but not criminal</a> during a combative exchange with House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky.</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Jake Tapper’s primetime debut featuring an exclusive sit-down with President Biden was widely panned as a softball interview.</span> <span>(Screenshot/CNN)</span></p></div></div></div><p>Biden wasn't the only Democrat that Tapper handled with kid gloves. In 2020, Tapper <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnns-jake-tapper-under-fire-after-admitting-he-didnt-fact-check-aoc-on-trump-coronavirus-claim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted he didn't fact-check</a> Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., while she attacked Trump in an interview. In 2021, Tapper bizarrely would <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-jake-tapper-cuomo-blackout-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid covering the various scandals</a> plaguing then New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on his CNN program but acknowledging them online by retweeting posts.</p><p>There was even an instance where Tapper <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-jake-tapper-republican-sean-parnell-democrat-conor-lamb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to privately convince Republican Sean Parnell</a> not to run against then-incumbent Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb for his House seat during the 2020 election cycle.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</u></strong></a></p><p>Tapper's co-moderator Dana Bash has also been hostile towards Trump and conservatives. In 2022, Bash defended Biden's "semi-fascism" jab against Republicans, insisting he was "specifically talking about Trump supporters," which represents tens of millions of Americans. Earlier this year, she <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-anchor-invokes-nazi-germany-blasts-trumps-antisemitic-incredibly-dangerous-remarks-jewish-dems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invoked Nazi Germany</a> while condemning Trump's comments slamming Jewish voters who back Democrats, calling what he said "antisemitic and incredibly dangerous." </p><p>CNN did not immediately respond to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital</a>'s request for comment. </p><p>Also announced on Wednesday was a second debate to be hosted by ABC on Sept. 10, which will be moderated by anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. </p></div>  </div>

            The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/bob-menendez-what-to-know-trial/index.html">corruption trial of Sen. Bob Menendez</a> is off to an explosive start, with prosecutors saying the New Jersey Democrat <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/bob-menendez-bribery-trial/index.html">was “on the take” from a cast of shady characters</a> and lawyers for Menendez and his co-defendants all casting blame on the senator’s wife, Nadine, for any potential crimes.
    </p>

            Menendez, 70, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/05/politics/bob-menendez-new-charges/index.html">has been charged</a> with acting as a foreign agent on behalf of Egypt and assisting the government of Qatar, all while taking bribes from several New Jersey businessmen. He is being tried with Wael Hana, an Egyptian American businessman, and Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer. All three have pleaded not guilty.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw9ldt9t00093b6jc34bla5m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The allegations against Menendez, who stepped down as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after being indicted, have already put his long political career on the brink. He <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/21/politics/bob-menendez-reelection-plans/index.html">is not running for reelection</a> in next month’s Democratic primary but has said he would consider an independent bid should he be exonerated.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw9ldt9t000a3b6jvon7s9jt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            After seating a jury Wednesday, the lawyers took centerstage. First up was the prosecution, which sought to take the complex allegations and spell them out in plain English – describing a series of “schemes” conducted by the defendants and led by a powerful US senator who was, as assistant US Attorney Lara Pomerantz put it, “on the take” and using his wife as a “go-between” with his partners. (Nadine Menendez is also charged and set to go on trial in July, separately from her husband.)
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw9ldt9t000b3b6jhkmmc3fm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The senator’s lawyer, Avi Weitzman, painted a much different picture, depicting his client as a lovestruck naif, unaware of Nadine Menendez’s financial dealings, debts and – most spectacularly – the contents of her closet in their home, where she kept <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/12/politics/menendez-gold-cash-what-matters/index.html">gold bars</a> allegedly given to her as bribes. Attorneys for Hana and Daibes followed a similar script. Like Weitzman, they also argued that the transactions between the three, and Menendez’s wife, did not qualify as a crime – but were simply friendly gift-giving outside the context of the senator’s official governmental powers.
    </p>

            Here are four takeaways from the opening statements of the Bob Menendez trial:

            The most striking notes from the opening statements by the defendants’ lawyers concerned Nadine Menendez and her role in the alleged crimes of her husband, Hana and Daibes.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw9ldt9t000f3b6j78vgz390@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            While Pomerantz, the prosecutor, described Nadine Menendez mostly as a conduit for the passage of bribes between the men, the senator’s lawyer suggested she was a driving, deceitful figure. He told the story of a younger woman, who was “beautiful,” “tall” and cosmopolitan. Nadine Menendez, Weitzman said, “had financial concerns she kept” from her husband and engaged in cash and gold exchanges of which he was not made aware.
    </p>

            “She kept things from him,” Weitzman told the jury. “She kept him in the dark.”
    </p>

            Weitzman brought a series of visual aids to underscore his point.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clw9ldt9t000i3b6jjbhmiga5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            One image from the couple’s home showed Nadine Menendez’s “locked closet,” a rambling walk-in with messy racks and clothes strewn on the floor, where the now infamous gold bars were found. The senator, Weitzman said, “did not know of the gold bars that existed in that closet.” Later on, Weitzman showed another photo, this time of the senator’s closet – a smaller space with neatly hung suit jackets and shirts. Nothing of interest, he stressed to the jury, had been found there.
    </p>

            The lawyer for Hana, Lawrence Lustberg, also focused a large chunk of his opening statement on Nadine Menendez. She and his client “cared about each other,” Lustberg said, and frequently gave one another gifts – tequila, jewelry, watches.
    </p>

            Their personal friendship, he explained, led to an ill-fated business arrangement. Nadine Menendez was supposed to help set up offices for Hana’s halal company, but she – as Lustberg characterized it – not only failed to follow through but was essentially an absentee employee and did not want to work eight-hour days.

            The three checks from his company to her, each for $10,000, were not bribes, Lustberg insisted, but parting compensation to “make her good on it.”

            Later Thursday morning, Bob Menendez announced in a statement that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/nadine-menendez-breast-cancer/index.html">his wife has breast cancer</a> and will undergo a mastectomy. Her trial had been delayed and split from her husband’s owing to a previously disclosed “serious medical condition.” The senator said the couple went public with the information in a bid for privacy, “as a result of constant press inquiries and reporters following” her.

            “Robert Menendez was a United States senator on the take,” Pomerantz, an assistant US attorney, told the jury in her opening remarks. “Motivated by greed, focused on how much money he could put in his own pocket and his wife’s pocket. That is why we are here today. That is what this trial is all about.”

            Lawyers for the senator, Hana and Daibes, again, offered a different take.

            On Thursday, Cesar de Castro, Daibes’ lawyer, argued that prosecutors were distorting the nature of his client’s relationship with Bob and Nadine Menendez.

            “The government wants you to assume, presume and infer the worst. It needs you to assume the worst in order for the evidence to make sense, and that tells you everything you need to know about this case,” de Castro said. “There’s one thing on which we can agree with the government: This case is about relationships.”

            None of Hana’s “gifts” to Nadine Menendez, “before or after she met Mr. Menendez, were in exchange for anything,” Lustberg said. “What the government is trying to do here is criminalize gift-giving.”
    </p>

            Weitzman, the senator’s lawyer, offered a broader criticism of the government’s case, saying that prosecutors were conflating “constituent services” with bribery and “diplomacy” with allegations that he worked as a foreign agent.

            The gold bars discovered in the Menendez home, which the indictment says were given as bribes, has become the trial’s trademark, headline-grabbing detail. In court, the defense attorneys in their opening statements sought to defuse the issue.
    </p>

            Their message was consistent: The giving or receiving of gold or gold bars should not imply any criminal behavior. Especially so in this case, they argued, because both Nadine Menendez, originally from Lebanon, and Hana, an Egyptian immigrant, hail from a region where keeping gold is “cultural,” as Weitzman stated.
    </p>

            Hana’s lawyer said his client gave Nadine Menendez gifts aplenty, but he told the jury that they “will hear nothing about gold bars that are traceable to Wael Hana in the senator’s home.” They will be told, he said, that gold is a particular gift that people in the Middle East give each other.

            Though the courtroom has been mostly full during the opening days of the Menendez trial, there has been a notable lack of hoopla outside on the streets of Lower Manhattan – especially in comparison with the circus-like atmosphere that has consumed former <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-45">President Donald Trump</a>’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-16-24/index.html">hush money trial</a>, which is taking place a short walk away.

            That’s welcome news, or a pleasing lack thereof, for national Democrats who might otherwise be facing tougher questions about Bob Menendez’s alleged crimes and why, despite the damning nature of the indictment, he is still a member in good standing of the US Senate. (More than half of the Senate Democratic caucus has called on him to step down, including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/26/politics/menendez-calls-for-resignation-democratic-party-senate/index.html">top ally Cory Booker</a>, the junior senator from New Jersey.

            Menendez is up for reelection this year but will not run in the Democratic primary, which Rep. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/23/politics/menendez-andy-kim-senate/index.html">Andy Kim</a> is poised to win in his bid to succeed the longtime incumbent. But with no serious Republican challenger in the race, and the national GOP pre-occupied with Trump – many of them <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/trump-allies-courthouse-appearances/index.html">making regular pilgrimages to New York</a> to appear beside him – the Menendez case has mostly flown below the radar outside New York and New Jersey.

            In fact, the Democrat most likely to suffer politically could be the senator’s son, Rob Menendez Jr., a first-term US House member from North Jersey. He is facing a primary challenge from Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla, who has frequently invoked the incumbent’s father during their tense campaign.
    </p>

            “His son also happens to be my primary opponent in NJ-08 and was handpicked by his father for his seat,” Bhalla said in his call for the senator to resign earlier his year. “This culture of corruption and cronyism is bad for New Jersey and bad for America.”

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>By James Mackenzie</p><p>JERUSALEM, May 16 (Reuters) - Israeli government splits over the war in Gaza broke open this week, after the Defence Minister publicly demanded a clear strategy from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as troops returned to battle Hamas fighters in areas thought to have been cleared months ago.</p><p>The comments from Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who said he would not agree to setting up a military government in the enclave, reflect growing unease in the security establishment at the lack of direction from Netanyahu over who will be left to run Gaza when the fighting stops.</p><p>They also brought out the sharp split between the two centrist former army generals in the cabinet, Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, who both backed Gallant's call, and the hard right nationalist religious parties led by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Internal Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who condemned the comments.</p><p>"That's no way to run a war," the right-wing Israel Today tabloid headlined its Thursday edition over a photo of Netanyahu and Gallant facing in different directions.</p><p>Apart from dismantling Hamas and returning some 130 hostages still held by the Islamist movement, Netanyahu has not articulated any clear strategic goal for the end of the campaign, which has killed some 35,000 Palestinians and left Israel increasingly isolated internationally.</p><p>However, backed by Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, both close to the West Bank settler movement, he has rejected any involvement in running postwar Gaza by the Palestinian Authority, set up under the Oslo interim peace accords three decades ago and generally seen internationally as the most legitimate Palestinian governing body.</p><p>Netanyahu, struggling to hold his increasingly fractious coalition together, has so far stuck to his pledge of total victory over Hamas. Afterwards, Gaza could be run by a "non-Hamas civilian administration with an Israeli military responsibility, overall military responsibility", he said in an interview with CNBC television on Wednesday.</p><p>Israeli officials have said that Palestinian clan leaders or other civil society figures may be recruited to fill the void but there has been no evidence that any such leaders, able or willing to replace Hamas, have been identified and no friendly Arab countries have stepped forward to help.</p><p>"From Israel the options are either they end the war, and they withdraw, or they establish for all intents and purposes a military government there, and they control the entire territory for who knows how long, because once they leave an area, Hamas will reappear," said Yossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Chatham House.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="12" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>GUERRILLA TACTICS</p><p>Gallant's refusal to contemplate any form of permanent military government reflects the material and political costs of an operation that could stretch the military and the economy painfully, reviving memories of Israel's years-long occupation of southern Lebanon after the 1982 war.</p><p>Taking full control of Gaza would require perhaps four divisions, or around 50,000 troops, said Michael Milshtein, a former intelligence officer and one of Israel's leading specialists on Hamas.</p><p>While thousands of Hamas fighters have been killed in the campaign and Israeli commanders say most of the movement's organised battalions have been broken down, smaller groups have popped up in areas the army left in the early stages of the war.</p><p>"They are a very flexible organisation and they can adjust very quickly," Milshtein said. "They have adopted new patterns of guerrilla warfare."</p><p>The likely cost to Israel of a prolonged insurgency was illustrated on Wednesday, when five Israeli soldiers were killed by an Israeli tank in a so-called "friendly fire" incident, as Israeli troops fought fierce battles in the Jabalia area north of Gaza City.</p><p>Israel's military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said the military's job was to "break down those places where Hamas is returning and trying to reassemble itself" but he said any question of an alternative government to Hamas would be a matter at the political level.</p><p>Although most surveys show Israelis still broadly support the war, that support has been slipping, with more and more prioritising a return of the hostages over destroying Hamas. Such incidents may erode support further if they continue.</p><p>A taste of the broader social divisions likely to be unleashed has been seen in the long-running dispute over conscripting ultra Orthodox Torah students into the military, a move backed by Gantz and his allies as well as by many secular Israelis but fiercely resisted by the religious parties.</p><p>Netanyahu has so far managed to avoid a walk-out by either side that could potentially bring his government down.</p><p>But Gallant, who has already led a revolt against Netanyahu from within the cabinet over plans to cut the power of judges last year, has clashed repeatedly with Smotrich and Ben-Gvir and his latest challenge to the prime minister may not be his last.</p><p>(Additional reporting by Andrew MacAskill in London; Editing by Nick Macfie)</p></div></div>

        AP AUDIO: US military says Gaza pier project is complete and aid will soon flow as Israel-Hamas war rages
    </h1>
    
    
    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">In a teleconference, the U.S. Agency for International Developments’ Sonali Korde says more work must be done with the Israeli military to keep humanitarian aid workers safe in Gaza.</p>
    
</div>
    

<p>Already, the site has been targeted by mortar fire during its construction, and Hamas has threatened to target any foreign forces who “occupy” the Gaza Strip.</p><p>The “protection of U.S. forces participating is a top priority. And as such, in the last several weeks, the United States and Israel have developed an integrated security plan to protect all the personnel,” said Navy Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, a deputy commander at the U.S. military’s Central Command. “We are confident in the ability of this security arrangement to protect those involved.”</p><p>U.S. troops anchored the pier Thursday morning, Central Command said, stressing that none of its forces entered the Gaza Strip and would not during the pier’s operations. It said trucks with aid would move ashore in the coming days and “the United Nations will receive the aid and coordinate its distribution into Gaza.”</p>
    

<p>The World Food Program will be the U.N. agency handling the aid, officials said. </p><p>Israeli forces will be in charge of security on shore, but there are also two U.S. Navy warships near the area, the USS Arleigh Burke and the USS Paul Ignatius. Both are destroyers equipped with a wide range of weapons and capabilities to protect American troops offshore and allies on the beach. </p><p>The British logistics ship RFA Cardigan Bay will also provide support, Cooper said. </p><p>Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani confirmed that the pier had been attached and that Israeli engineering units had flattened ground around the area and surfaced roads for trucks.</p><p>“We have been working for months on full cooperation with (the U.S. military) on this project, facilitating it, supporting it in any way possible,” Shoshani said. “It’s a top priority in our operation.”</p>
    

<p>The U.N., U.S. and international aid groups say Israel is allowing only a fraction of the normal pre-war deliveries of food and other supplies into Gaza since Hamas’ attacks on Israel launched the war in October. Aid agencies say they are running out of food in southern Gaza and fuel is dwindling, while USAID and the World Food Program say famine has taken hold in Gaza’s north. </p><p>Israel says it places no limits on the entry of humanitarian aid and blames the U.N. for delays in distributing goods entering Gaza. The U.N. says fighting, Israeli fire and chaotic security conditions have hindered delivery. Under pressure from the U.S., Israel has in recent weeks opened a pair of crossings to deliver aid into hard-hit northern Gaza and said that a series of Hamas attacks on the main crossing, Kerem Shalom, have disrupted the flow of goods.</p><p>The first cargo ship loaded with food left Cyprus last week and the cargo was transferred to a U.S. military ship, the Roy P. Benavidez, which is off the coast of Gaza.</p><p>The installation of the floating pier several miles (kilometers) off the coast and of a causeway, which is now anchored to the beach, was delayed for nearly two weeks because of bad weather that made conditions too dangerous.</p><p>Military leaders have said the deliveries of aid will begin slowly to ensure the system works. They will start with about 90 truckloads of aid a day through the sea route, and that number will quickly grow to about 150 a day. But aid agencies say that isn’t enough to avert famine in Gaza and must be just one part of a broader Israeli effort to open land corridors.</p><p>Because land crossings could bring in all the needed aid if Israeli officials allowed it, the U.S.-built pier-and-sea route “is a solution for a problem that doesn’t exist,” said Scott Paul, an associate director of the Oxfam humanitarian organization.</p><p>Under the new sea route, humanitarian aid is dropped off in Cyprus where it will undergo inspection and security checks at Larnaca port. It is then loaded onto ships and taken about 200 miles (320 kilometers) to the large floating pier built by the U.S. military off the Gaza coast.</p><p>There, the pallets are transferred onto trucks, driven onto smaller Army boats and then shuttled several miles (kilometers) to the causeway anchored to the beach. The trucks, which are being <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-gaza-pier-92b6986eed29cec9ab33e40584f22543">driven by personnel from another country</a></span>, will go down the causeway into a secure area on land where they will drop off the aid and immediately turn around and return to the boats. </p><p>Aid groups will collect the supplies for distribution on shore.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Julia Frankel in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this report.</p>

<li>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) criticized President Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) for blocking US military aid to Israel during its war against Hamas.</p>
</li>

<p>Johnson accused Biden of "using his authority to defend himself politically" rather than defending the US's closest ally at war.</p>

<li>
<p>The House is set to vote on a bill to force the delivery of bombs to Israel, which Johnson claims has been blocked by the Biden administration.</p>

<li>
<p>Johnson drew a parallel between Biden's assertion of executive privilege to block House committees from obtaining subpoenaed audio recordings and his withholding of congressionally mandated aid to Israel.</p>

<li>
<p>Johnson accused Schumer of having done an "about-face" on his earlier statement in favor of providing aid to Israel, stating that Schumer has joined Biden in opposing the delivery of aid to Israel.</p>
