    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hunter Biden's gun trial has gone to the jury</strong>: The jury has begun deliberating on the gun charges against Hunter Biden, accusing him of lying about his drug use on a federally required form when he bought a gun in 2018.</li>
<li><strong>Prosecutors claim overwhelming evidence</strong>: Prosecuting attorney Derek Hines argued that there was "overwhelming" evidence against Hunter Biden and that he chose to lie and violate the law.</li>
<li><strong>Defense claims lack of firm evidence</strong>: Hunter Biden's defense attorney Abbe Lowell argued that prosecutors lacked firm evidence for much of their case and treated the case like a "magic trick", using circumstantial evidence to direct the jury's focus away from the whole picture.</li>
<li><strong>Cash withdrawals linked to drug use</strong>: Prosecuting attorney Derek Hines pointed to cash withdrawals of over $150,000 made by Hunter Biden, which he claimed were "indicative of continual, significant drug use" described in his book.</li>
<li><strong>Case is now in the jury's hands</strong>: The jury is responsible for deciding whether Hunter Biden lied about his drug use on the federally required form, which could result in fines or imprisonment if convicted.</li>

            <p>Prosecutor Derek Hines began his rebuttal statement by saying that several things defense attorney Abbe Lowell said during closing arguments were “completely unfair” – including Lowell’s suggestion that jurors have Hunter Biden’s life in their hands.</p><p>If Hunter Biden had simply been an addict struggling with personal problems, “we would not be here in this courtroom,” Hines said. But the defendant is on trial for buying a gun and lying about being a drug addict on the federally required gun purchase form, he said.</p><p>Hines also took exception with Lowell’s assertation that the prosecution’s questioning of Naomi Biden was “extraordinarily cruel.”</p><p>“Who called the defendant’s daughter as a witness in this case?” Hines asked. “Not us.”</p><p>Hines told the jury that the evidence clearly shows that Hunter had a pattern of illegal drug use at the time he bought the gun. Prosecutors do not have to prove that Hunter used drugs on the day he bought the gun or was under the influence while in the gun store, he said.</p><p>He said text messages indicate Hunter Biden was going to a convenience store in the days before buying the gun to make drug deals. He rejected the notion that Hunter Biden had no plan to purchase a weapon, and only walked into the gun store on a whim after stopping at a nearby cellular store.</p><p>“He knew what he was getting into,” Hines said. “He could have gone to the AT&amp;T store and gone home.”</p><p>The prosecutor also said Hunter Biden stored drugs in the brown leather pouch that Hallie Biden used to dispose of the gun, and said Hunter was the source of the drug residue found on the pouch.</p><p>“There is no evidence that the brown leather pouch is anyone else’s,” he said.</p>

Prosecutors did not provide any evidence of allegations that Hunter had contact with a dealer named Frankie, and they didn’t produce Frankie either, Lowell said.<br>Lowell also stressed that Hunter Biden pushed to report to police that the gun was missing from the trash, and was consistently listed as the victim in the incident.</p><p>He suggested that prosecutors were treating the case like a magic trick, presenting circumstantial evidence like a magician might present a card trick -- trying to get jurors to focus on one hand and ignore the other.</p><p>The fact that Hunter Biden has a famous last name does not mean he is less entitled to his rights than any other defendant, Lowell said, reminding jurors that he is still presumed innocent unless and until a guilty verdict is given.</p><p>“With my last breath in this case, I ask for the only verdict that will hold the prosecutors to what the law requires of them,” he concluded, asking jurors to find Hunter not guilty.</p>

            <p>Text messages from 2018 and 2019 point to Hunter Biden’s drug use and efforts to obtain crack cocaine from drug dealers, Wise said.</p><p>One day after buying the gun, Hunter texted Hallie Biden that he was waiting for a dealer named Mookie. The following day, Hunter told Hallie in a text message that he was smoking crack. In other text messages, Hunter described himself as both “a drunk” and “an addict.”</p><p>In addition to the text messages, Hunter in his memoir described buying and using drugs during four years of “active addiction,” Wise said.</p><p>“In his prologue, he referred to himself as a drug addict,” Wise said.</p><p>Hunter’s ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, testified to his drug use and addiction, Wise noted. His former girlfriend Zoe Kestan said she saw Hunter using drugs from December 2017 through November 2018, even after he had gone to rehab.</p>

            <p>Wise said prosecutors have shown that Hunter Biden, as a drug user, knowingly and illegally possessed the handgun, regardless of how it was acquired.</p><p>“You saw messages from the defendant to Hallie Biden where he admits that the gun was his,” Wise said, noting that there’s no evidence that anyone else possessed it from Oct. 12 to Oct. 23.</p><p>Wise said the evidence shows that Hunter “knowingly” made a false statement in buying the gun and “knowingly” possessed it. The evidence shows Hunter Biden knew he was using drugs and was addicted to drugs, Wise said.</p><p>Wise noted that prosecutors don’t have to prove that Hunter used drugs on the day he bought the gun, or during the time he possessed it, just that he used drugs around the time of the gun purchase. He noted that Hunter’s former girlfriend testified that he used drugs in California less than three weeks before he bought the gun.</p><p>“You can consider the defendant’s pattern of use,” Wise said, adding that the evidence shows that Hunter also used drugs in the days after he bought the gun.</p>

            <p>There was no visible reaction from Hunter Biden when lawyer Abbe Lowell said the defense rested. The defense rested their case without calling the president’s son to the witness stand. Defendants aren’t required to testify and lawyers often advise against it since it leaves them open to prosecutors’ grilling on cross-examination.</p><p>Shortly before the judge read instructions to the jury, Hunter Biden’s sister Ashley draped her arm around the first lady, reaching Melissa Cohen Biden, Hunter’s wife, and gently touching her back.</p><p>Both Hunter and the prosecutors scanned the jury as the judge instructed them on the law. Some jurors took notes with yellow pencils and many followed along with the judge’s instructions, turning pages as she read aloud from the bench.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>France's President Emmanuel Macron has decided to dissolve parliament and hold snap elections after his party suffered a stinging defeat in European elections, with the far-right National Rally (RN) securing over 31% of the vote.</li>
<li>The elections will take place in two rounds, starting on June 30, and have been described by Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire as having "the most serious consequences" in modern French history.</li>
<li>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has ruled out holding early elections in Germany, despite his Social Democratic Party (SPD) also suffering a significant defeat in the European elections.</li>
<li>The leader of Bavaria's CSU party, Markus Söder, has called for early elections in Germany, stating that the country "needs a new start" and that the current government is "essentially finished".</li>
<li>The decision to hold snap elections in France has been seen as a major shock across the political spectrum, with some critics calling for the left to rally around Socialist candidate Raphaël Glucksmann, who scored nearly 14% in the European vote.</li>

Without a majority in parliament, the government relies on support from other parties to pass legislation.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There was also frustration from the Socialist mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, that the vote was taking place three weeks before the capital hosts the Olympics.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Macron's Renew party polled less than 15% of the vote on Sunday, while the anti-immigration National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen and young leader Jordan Bardella, secured more than 31%.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The decision to hold new elections came as a shock across the political spectrum, with reports of a hastily organised meeting involving top RN leaders and Marion Maréchal from rival far-right party Reconquête.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There were calls for France's bitterly divided left to rally round Socialist Raphaël Glucksmann, who scored almost 14% in the European vote.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">President Macron joined German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Monday in the French village of Oradour-sur-Glane, to mark the 80th anniversary of an infamous Nazi massacre in World War Two, when SS troops murdered 643 villagers in 1944.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">President Steinmeier said it was fitting on the day after European elections that Europeans never forgot the damage done by nationalism and hate: “Let us never forget the miracle of reconciliation that the European Union has worked.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Alternative for Germany (AfD) came second in Germany's European vote on Sunday, ahead of all three parties in the Mr Scholz's coalition government, despite a succession of scandals involving the AfD's top two candidates.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Its newly elected MEPs voted to exclude top candidate Maximilian Krah from their delegation in the European Parliament, after he was investigated for alleged links to Russia and China.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Meanwhile, President Macron is due to meet both Olaf Scholz and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni at a G7 summit this week in the Italian region of Puglia.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The three leaders are likely not just to discuss the outcome of Sunday’s European vote, but also whether to support Ursula von der Leyen’s bid to win a second term as president of the European Commission.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Italian leader told Italian radio on Monday that it was “too early to talk about a second mandate” for the current Commission chief.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Ms von der Leyen’s centre-right European People’s Party emerged as by far the biggest grouping in the next European Parliament.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Among the winners on the centre-right were Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who managed to lead his Civic Coalition party to a narrow victory over the right-wing-populist PiS party for the first time in a decade.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Tusk is now one of Europe's few leaders to have emerged from these elections with a stronger mandate.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The far-right Polish Confederation party won 12% of the vote, and one of its successful candidates is Grzegorz Braun - who provoked an international outcry in December when used a fire extinguisher to put out candles on a menorah in the Polish parliament placed there for the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Czech President Petr Pavel said Europe should examine why support for far-right, conservative, nationalist parties was increasing and “needs to take notice of these voices”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Czech vote was won by the opposition ANO party of former prime minister Andrej Babis, which clinched seven of the available 21 seats in the European Parliament.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But it was also a good night for three small anti-system parties, including a new party called Motorists, who are campaigning against the EU’s Green Deal on measures on climate change and sustainability. One of the MotoristS MEPs will be controversial former racing driver Filip Turek, who was recently exposed for old social media posts revealing his passion for Nazi gestures and memorabilia.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The far-right fared unexpectedly poorly in Finland and Sweden. The Finns Party had been polling in third place but ended up with just 7.6% of the vote, while the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats slipped to fourth place with 13.2% of the vote.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There was also a surprise result in Denmark, where the Social Democrats of Mette Frederiksen were defeated by Green-Left party SF which polled more than 17% of the vote.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Ms Frederiksen, who is recovering from a physical assault in Copenhagen on Friday night, called the result "really miserable".</p></div></div>

<li>Benny Gantz, the leader of National Unity, Israel's second-largest political party, resigned from the country's ruling government on June 8.</li>
<li>Gantz's resignation was not a surprise, as he had previously set an ultimatum for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to present a clear plan to end the war in Gaza, which Netanyahu failed to do.</li>
<li>Gantz accused Netanyahu of botching the war effort and preventing a "real victory" in his exit speech.</li>
<li>Despite Gantz's resignation, the report suggests that it is unlikely to have a significant practical impact in the short term, as Netanyahu still has enough seats in the Knesset to remain in power.</li>

His decision made headlines, but its actual effects on the war in Gaza and Israel’s political future remain unclear.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Gantz’s departure was not a surprise. In mid-May, he <a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-805262">set out an ultimatum</a>: Either Netanyahu lays out a clear and plausible plan to end the war in Gaza, or Gantz quits the government on June 8. Netanyahu did not do so, and Gantz followed through on his threat (with the announcement delayed a day by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/06/08/israel-hostages-nuseirat-camp-gaza/">Israel’s Saturday raid in Gaza that freed four hostages and killed over 200 Palestinians</a>).</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">“Netanyahu prevents us from progressing to real victory,” <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/urging-elections-gantz-quits-wartime-government-accuses-pm-of-botching-war-effort/?utm_source=The+Daily+Edition&amp;utm_campaign=daily-edition-2024-06-10&amp;utm_medium=email">Gantz said in his exit speech</a>.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">In the short term, this resignation is likely of little practical consequence.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Though Gantz is correct that <a href="https://www.vox.com/24055522/israel-hamas-gaza-war-strategy-netanyahu-strategy-morality">Israel’s lack of a defined endgame is strategically disastrous</a>, he simply didn’t have enough influence inside the government to force Netanyahu to adopt one. Indeed, the prime minister still has enough seats in the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) to remain in power even after Gantz’s resignation — meaning that there will be no immediate change in government.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">To make a truly meaningful change, Gantz and his allies in the opposition would need to persuade five Knesset members to leave the current governing coalition and vote to call new elections. It’s possible that could happen, but there are no guarantees.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Were the government to fall, it would be a really big deal. It’s arguably the <a href="https://www.vox.com/23954323/return-of-liberal-zionism-israel">most plausible scenario by which the war could end</a>. And we’re definitely somewhat closer to that reality than we were with Gantz in government.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">How much closer?

He coordinated a broad swath of parties, ranging from the right to the far left, in blocking Netanyahu’s efforts to seize control of Israel’s judiciary and to <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/23864407/israel-judicial-overhaul-supreme-court-hearing-netanyahu">do potentially fatal damage to Israeli democracy</a>. Opposing Netanyahu — as well as his government of extreme rightists and ultra-Orthodox religious hardliners — was Gantz’s central reason for being in politics.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">After Hamas attacked, Gantz and National Unity joined the government on an emergency basis. Part of the agreement was that Gantz would be one of three members of Israel’s “war cabinet”: an ad hoc body that would make big-picture war decisions collectively. The other two were Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, a relatively moderate member of Netanyahu’s Likud party who had opposed the judicial overhaul from within.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">From Gantz’s point of view, being part of the war cabinet was worth partnering with the hated Netanyahu. In this arrangement, he and Gallant could check Netanyahu’s far-right allies and shape Israel’s policy for the better.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">“We [joined] because we knew it was a bad government,” Gantz said in his exit speech. “The people of Israel …needed unity and support like they needed air to breathe.”</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Over the months, the limits of this (always questionable) theory have become apparent. As much as he has tried, Gantz has been unable to push Netanyahu toward a clear and plausible theory for ending the war and the political situation in Gaza afterward.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">While Netanyahu can survive without Gantz, he <em>cannot</em> survive without the extreme right Religious Zionism party. This faction is inveterately opposed to the only feasible scenario for a non-Hamas postwar Gaza government — putting some kind of Palestinian government in charge of the Strip. Instead, they want Netanyahu to announce that Israel would reoccupy Gaza and rebuild Jewish settlements on its land.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Netanyahu cannot endorse such a plan without a rebellion inside his Likud party; Gallant has publicly said he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/02/opinion/yoav-gallant-israel-defense.html">opposes any reoccupation</a>. <strong> </strong>But Netanyahu also cannot lose Religious Zionism by endorsing Palestinian control over Gaza, the only other feasible alternative.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">The only option for Netanyahu to keep his government together has been keeping the war going indefinitely — over Gantz’s objections. And that’s exactly what has happened. Ultimately, Gantz felt he could no longer participate in a government so blatantly putting Netanyahu’s political interests over Israel’s national interests.</p></div><div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="_7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg0"><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">Why Gantz’s resignation doesn’t matter — yet</h2></p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">The very logic of Gantz’s resignation implies that, in the immediate term, it is largely an impotent act. He is basically admitting that he is not really shaping war policy at the most fundamental level and that he lacks the influence to change the government’s political calculation.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">For now, that means Netanyahu will stay in office and keep waging <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/351968/the-slaughter-in-rafah-and-israels-moral-nadir">a deadly and strategically dubious war</a>. Palestinians will continue dying, and Gaza will continue burning, in the name of a “total defeat” of Hamas that still proves elusive. This nightmare will continue until until the coalition cracks or Netanyahu is forced out <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/world/netanyahu-corruption-trial-resumes/index.html">by some other means</a>.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">There is only one plausible way that Gantz’s resignation in particular could hasten the collapse of Netanyahu’s government: by triggering defections from Gallant and others on the more centrist side of Netanyahu’s Likud party.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Traditionally, Likud was Israel’s leading center-right party. In the past few years of Netanyahu, it has undergone a trajectory similar to the Republican Party under Donald Trump: a lurch to the radical right. However, some more traditionally minded Likudniks remain in the party’s Knesset delegation — and Gallant is their leading figure.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">If managing Netanyahu and the war without Gantz proves intolerable to this faction, it’s possible they could rebel. This would entail voting with Gantz and the other coalition parties in a parliamentary motion to dissolve the government and schedule new elections. If elections do happen, polling suggests Gantz is heavily favored to become the next prime minister.</p></div><div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="_7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg0"><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">What does any of this mean for the Gaza conflict’s future?</h2></p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">If Gantz’s departure does trigger a broader exodus from Netanyahu’s government, such a change would definitely matter — and could potentially be transformative.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">In the immediate term, Gantz is more likely to accept <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-israel-hamas-war-gaza-ceasefire-f90f323b350cc2e164b0fecd942451b9">the American-backed ceasefire deal</a> — which includes a hostage-for-prisoners swap between Israel and Hamas. In the longer term, he’s more likely to accept Palestinian Authority control over Gaza. In the even longer term, he’s more likely to strike a deal with Saudi Arabia to make “concrete steps” toward Palestinian statehood in exchange for Saudi diplomatic recognition of Israel.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">But we’re still quite a few “ifs” away from all of that. We don’t know what Gallant and his like-minded figures inside Likud are thinking — or how the next few weeks and months of a Gantz-less government will change their minds.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">So right now, the world is basically in a holding pattern. Gantz’s resignation doesn’t matter much at present, and might not matter at all in the long run. But if events go a certain way, it could mark the beginning of the end of the Gaza war.</p></div></div></div>
