<ol>
<li><strong>Hundreds of thousands of Israelis take to the streets</strong>: Over 100,000 Israelis protested in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, demanding that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accept a US-brokered deal for a cease-fire in Gaza.</li>
<li><strong>US-brokered deal proposed by President Biden</strong>: President Joe Biden revealed a surprise speech on Friday, proposing a six-week pause in fighting between Israel and Gaza, during which hostages would be released and aid shipments increased.</li>
<li><strong>Key sticking point: Ending the war officially</strong>: The main obstacle to the deal is how and when the war will officially end. Netanyahu's office has authorized the text of the proposal, but emphasized that Israel's conditions for ending the war have not changed.</li>
<li><strong>Netanyahu's government faces pressure</strong>: The proposal's release has put pressure on Netanyahu's government, which is facing opposition from within his own far-right coalition, which threatens to bring down the government if a deal is made.</li>
<li><strong>Gaza Strip and Palestinian prisoners also at stake</strong>: The proposal includes the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and increased aid shipments to the Gaza Strip. However, Netanyahu's government has emphasized that a deal must also involve the complete destruction of Hamas and the end of its security threat to Israel.</li>

<li>Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, is facing trial on three felony gun charges, including lying on a federal form about his drug use to procure a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver.</li>
<li>Prosecutors claim that in October 2018, Hunter Biden knowingly lied on a federal form about his drug use in order to procure the firearm, and is being charged with two counts related to false statements in purchasing the firearm and a third count of illegally obtaining a firearm while addicted to drugs.</li>
<li>Hunter Biden's legal team, led by veteran defense attorney Abbe Lowell, is planning to fight the charges and has signaled that the contours of the case will depend on how prosecutors proceed at trial.</li>
<li>Lowell has hinted that he will try to cast doubt on some of the government's most crucial evidence and witnesses, and has latched onto revelations that there are two copies of the federal gun form at the heart of the case, which could be tampered with or annotated.</li>
<li>The trial is set to begin on Monday, and if Hunter Biden is convicted, he could face a prison sentence.</li>

He is charged with two counts related to false statements in purchasing the firearm and a third count of illegally obtaining a firearm while addicted to drugs.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">But Hunter Biden's legal team believes it can throw a wrench in Weiss' tidy narrative. At a recent pretrial hearing, an attorney for Biden suggested the firearm form at the heart of the case was "much more complicated than [the] special counsel indicates it is."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Jury selection for the trial is set to begin on Monday. And if 12 Delaware residents accept the government's story, the president's only living son could face a prison sentence.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The task of fighting that outcome falls to Abbe Lowell, a veteran defense attorney who has represented several other high-profile figures, including Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">How Lowell plans to fight the charges remains somewhat unclear. He has signaled to U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika that the contours of his case would depend in large part on how prosecutors proceed at trial.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">But in court records and at pretrial hearings, he has offered some tea leaves -- and suggested he will attempt to cast doubt on some of the government's most crucial evidence and witnesses.</p><h3 class="vPZug oPAle xcLAU bunQU uhXXI PjNjV lNbol LBPRq">'Tampered' or 'annotated'?</h3><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Lowell has, for example, latched onto revelations in court that two copies exist of the federal gun form at the heart of the case, called an ATF Form 4473. A shop employee created the original document when Hunter Biden purchased the firearm in 2018. It lists Biden's passport as the ID he presented to the shop employee.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Years later, however, a copy was made. The copy included a handwritten note, "DE Vehicle Registration," on a line left blank for "Supplemental Government Issued Documentation." Store employees did so in 2021 to rectify a requirement that gun buyers present a form of ID that includes an address, which passports do not.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Lowell contends that gun store employees "tampered with" the document, and that it raises questions about "who wrote what on the form, and when."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Weiss' office has said the gun shop employees merely "annotated" the document. But they took Lowell's argument seriously enough to re-interview the gun store owner, Ronald Palimere, on May 16.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">During the interview, according to notes filed on the case docket, Palimere said Hunter Biden's legal tribulations were becoming "a big scandal and there was intense attention on the incident," and that employees at the store "were all scared to death."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Palimere "felt it was necessary to annotate the Form 4473 because he felt they were going to get in trouble just for going up against Biden," according to the notes.</p><div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "><div><div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"><figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"><figcaption><div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"><div class="HXPPJ barbu IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "><span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"><span><span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ ">Hunter Biden departs the House Rayburn Office Building following a surprise a...</span><span class="Truncate__ShowMore--hidden" aria-hidden="true">Show more ---</span></span><button aria-hidden="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Show more" class="rmXUm rGbDS UbGlr fKEHm NQBmG kGyAC LDLer mrzbZ RzTJw hGXEb YKYa-d lqtkC HkWF HfYhe UoVV WtEci dSKvB seFhp NqeUA UzzHi YusgD gYkWv jIRH mLASH FSaCd VTMUD VTlC KgrzM nMMea bNYiy qEZfD hukhf GZviH aMUVL VwboG LpXnG eFRhh fzuTW hUXYk TsdbM TkDoS NJHde eWOet BZZZx " data-testid="truncate-button" type="button">Show more<svg aria-hidden="true" class="HUcap MYLGy QGyss lZur llpL stwOr " data-testid="prism-iconography" role="presentation" viewbox="0 0 32 32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" data-icon="caret-downSmall"><path fill="currentColor" d="M16 24L4 12.187l2.827-2.853L16 18.374l9.173-9.04L28 12.187 16 24z"></path></svg></button></span></div><p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh "><span class="YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh  gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ ">Kevin Lamarque/Reuters, FILE</span></p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">If jurors are persuaded by Lowell's tack, the argument could undermine the credibility of some key government witnesses -- the people who sold Biden the gun -- and potentially create a reasonable doubt that Hunter Biden was the one who actually checked that box.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">At least two gun store employees, including Palimere, are expected to testify at the trial.</p><h3 class="vPZug oPAle xcLAU bunQU uhXXI PjNjV lNbol LBPRq">The definition of 'is'</h3><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Lowell may also advance the argument that Hunter Biden may have been confused by the language on the ATF Form 4473. The box he checked "no" asked of the buyer, "Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to" various narcotics.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"The issue here is Mr. Biden's understanding of the question, which asks in the present tense if he 'is' a user or addict," Lowell wrote in court papers.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him," he continued. "Someone like Mr. Biden, who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Finally, Lowell has raised "an issue of chain of custody" with a leather pouch that allegedly held the revolver Hunter Biden purchased. In court documents filed earlier this year, prosecutors said this pouch had cocaine residue on it.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">After purchasing the firearm in 2018, Hunter Biden possessed it for less than two weeks before his then-romantic partner, Hallie Biden – who is also the widow of his brother, Beau – discovered the weapon and the pouch, discarded them in a dumpster.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The gun was soon recovered by the authorities, but the pouch was not tested for drug residue until five years later, in 2023. Lowell said at the pretrial hearing that he wants to question witnesses about what happened to the pouch during those five years when it was in police custody to see if it was "tampered with."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">One of the witnesses Lowell plans to call for the defense is a chemical residue expert.</p><h3 class="vPZug oPAle xcLAU bunQU uhXXI PjNjV lNbol LBPRq">The government's case</h3><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Prosecutors hope these arguments fall flat, and that jurors rely on the voluminous evidence they plan to present to find Hunter Biden guilty of committing the three felony charges he faces.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Prosecutors seem poised to use Hunter Biden's own words against him -- excerpts from his 2021 memoir, "Beautiful Things," and text messages he exchanged around the time of the gun purchase -- to demonstrate that he was in fact a drug user when he filled out the ATF Form 4473 and procured the weapon.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In one text message prosecutors included in court filings, Hunter Biden wrote two days after allegedly purchasing the gun: "I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney," referring to an intersection in Wilmington.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Weiss' office also plans to show jurors the original ATF Form 4473, in which Biden represented that "he was not an unlawful user of, or addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance" -- despite allegedly knowing it not to be true.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Prosecutors indicated that they plan to call as many as <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/special-counsel-hunter-biden-case-plans-call-wife/story?id=110420238" target="_blank">12 witnesses</a>, including Hallie Biden and Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Lowell has not yet decided whether Hunter Biden will testify in his own defense.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The trial begins on Monday and is expected to last two to three weeks. If he's found guilty, Biden could face a prison sentence of up to 25 years, though legal experts suggest that, as a first-time and nonviolent offender, he would not likely serve time.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Weiss' office also charged Hunter Biden in December with nine felony and misdemeanor charges stemming from his failure to pay $1.4 million in taxes for three years during a time when he was in the throes of addiction. The back taxes and penalties were eventually paid in full by a third party, identified by ABC News as Hunter Biden's attorney and confidant, Kevin Morris. Hunter Biden has <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/hunter-biden-returning-court-arraignment-federal-gun-charges/story?id=103667562" target="_blank">pleaded not guilty</a> to all charges.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN">The trial in that case was scheduled to begin on June 20 in California, but Lowell successfully petitioned the judge to postpone it until Sept. 5 -- raising the likelihood that a jury could be deliberating whether to convict the president’s son on several felony counts in the waning weeks of the 2024 election.</p></div></div>

<p>Los Angeles County — particularly the Pasadena and Alhambra areas — was rattled by an earthquake Sunday morning.</p>



<p>The preliminary 3.5-magnitude quake struck four kilometers south-southwest of South Pasadena, the <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/ci40611087/dyfi/intensity">USGS said</a>.  </p>



<p>The quake struck at a depth of 11.3 kilometers.  </p>



<p>Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones, who was in South Pasadena at the time, <a href="https://x.com/DrLucyJones/status/1797315208228307189">posted on X</a> that the quake was “sharp and short.”</p>





<p>“The focal mechanism shows east-west thrust faulting, much like the 1987 Whittier Narrows quake,” Dr. Jones <a href="https://x.com/DrLucyJones/status/1797316668487811303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>.  “[Sunday’s] quake is west of that event.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://ktla.com/author/peter-wilgoren/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KTLA Director of Content and Coverage Peter Wilgoren</a>, the temblor felt like someone “took a tuning fork to the entire house.”</p>





<p>No injuries or damage were immediately reported.</p>

<p>Mohamed, 35, was convicted of first-degree burglary in 2007 and was ineligible to carry a firearm. He had an active warrant out for his arrest stemming from a 2022 incident in which, court documents say, police saw him at the scene of a downtown Minneapolis robbery carrying a gun. </p><p>Mohamed allegedly hid the gun behind a pillar when he saw police arrive. When police chased him, he threw a gun holster to the side and was arrested at the scene.</p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/01/8e5b76c1-d39d-4c0e-bae1-0b0c144ad9f8/thumbnail/620x349/f6ec5b282328c105438f3f4ceb93ad72/mustafa-ahmed-mohamed.jpg?v=d7bbca61a2ddd34e0cfc8fb46aec1df3#" alt="mustafa-ahmed-mohamed.jpg " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/01/8e5b76c1-d39d-4c0e-bae1-0b0c144ad9f8/thumbnail/620x349/f6ec5b282328c105438f3f4ceb93ad72/mustafa-ahmed-mohamed.jpg?v=d7bbca61a2ddd34e0cfc8fb46aec1df3 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/01/8e5b76c1-d39d-4c0e-bae1-0b0c144ad9f8/thumbnail/1240x698/440a926ac519a810dbd5e0bf1fd259c7/mustafa-ahmed-mohamed.jpg?v=d7bbca61a2ddd34e0cfc8fb46aec1df3 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

He did not say which ones.</p><p>“Russia, using Chinese influence in the region, using Chinese diplomats also, does everything to disrupt the peace summit,” he said at a news conference at the Shangri-La defense forum. “Regrettably this is unfortunate that such a big independent powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of (Russian leader Vladimir) Putin.”</p><p>China has staked out what it says is a neutral position on <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">the war</a></span>, putting it at odds with Ukraine, the United States and most of Europe. Its trade with Russia has grown, easing the economic impact of Western sanctions. And American, Ukrainian and other intelligence agencies say there is evidence that Chinese parts are winding up in Russian weaponry, even if China is not directly arming its neighbor.</p>
    

<p>The Swiss had been hoping China would attend the peace conference in mid-June, but Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-russia-ukraine-war-switzerland-talks-eb8c186efa880a49d42a8d594df73dc9">signaled on Friday</a></span> that that was unlikely. China has been calling for a peace conference with equal participation of all sides, including Russia, which has not been invited.</p>



<p>“There is still a clear gap between the arrangements for the meeting and the demands of the Chinese side, as well as the general expectations of the international community,” Mao said. “This makes it difficult for China to participate in the meeting.”</p>
    
<p>The foreign ministry did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Zelenskyy’s accusation.</p><p>The Ukrainian leader said of China’s pressure on others, “That is not only support to Russia, that is basically support of war.”</p>

<p>“The same goes for the countries in the region,” he said through an interpreter. “We truly count on you supporting this summit, and that you will be present in Switzerland.”</p><p>From Singapore, he may travel to Manila to invite President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to the summit in person, two senior Philippine government officials said.</p><p>Ukrainian officials have notified the Philippines of Zelenskyy’s intention to go, but the visit is uncertain because of the Ukrainian president’s travel plans are constantly changing, one of the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the matter.</p><p>Singapore Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen, who shared the stage with Zelenskyy, did not say whether his country’s leaders would attend, but did note Singapore had condemned the invasion and provided Ukraine with military ambulances.</p><p>“We stand with you, and I think your appearance at this Shangri-La Dialogue is the epitome of what we are all hoping for, a rules-based order that guarantees the security and survival of large nations and small,” he said.</p>
    

<p>Dong did not specifically mention the Switzerland meetings in his address to the forum, but did say “on the Ukraine crisis, China has been promoting peace talks with a responsible attitude.”</p><p>He added that China had not provided weapons to either side of the conflict.</p><p>“We have never done anything to fan the flames,” he said. “We stand firmly on the side of peace and dialogue.”</p><p>U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sat in the front row as Zelenskyy talked.

<p>Ahmadinejad, who was president from 2005 to 2013, registered along with dozens of others at the interior ministry on Sunday, a day before the sign-up period ends.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 4 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 4 of 4</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>The politician, who had been largely sidelined following his controversial terms in office, said he’s only heeding “a call from people from across the country” to run again, and he’s confident he can resolve Iran’s domestic and international issues.</p>
<p>“Don’t ask political questions,” he said with a grin when asked by reporters about his reaction if he were to be disqualified from running by the Guardian Council – the constitutional body that vets all candidates.</p>
<p>Despite Supreme Leader <a href="/news/2024/4/21/supreme-leader-khamenei-says-iran-demonstrated-its-power-against-israel">Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a> urging him to stay away in 2017, he signed up and was barred from running, but chose to not register for the 2021 election.</p>

<p>Ahmadinejad’s presidency was marked by economic malaise defined by massive inflation and currency devaluation, along with explosive tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme – which saw multilateral sanctions imposed on the country.</p>
<p>His 2009 re-election sparked <a href="/opinions/2013/6/12/what-happened-to-the-green-movement-in-iran">the Green Movement</a> of protests across the country amid claims of vote tampering, which were refuted by authorities as they mounted a crackdown.</p>
<h2 id="who-else-wants-to-be-in-the-race">Who else wants to be in the race?</h2>
<p>The dozens who signed up to run for president also include senior security official and former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, former three-time parliament speaker Ali Larijani, Tehran’s Mayor Alireza Zakani, and former central bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati.</p>
<p>Jalili is now the Iranian supreme leader’s representative to the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) and used to be security chief from 2007 to 2013 at the height of the tensions surrounding the nuclear file. He has run for president unsuccessfully three times before.</p>
<p>Larijani, a conservative figure belonging to a powerful family, is perhaps the only relatively moderate candidate with any chance of garnering a considerable number of votes – that is if he is greenlit by the Guardian Council after being disqualified in 2021.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>Despite the disqualification last time, Larijani was the first major figure to announce his candidacy, signing up in Tehran on Friday with his campaign releasing a dramatic video containing cinematic shots of him in the process.</p>
<p>After the latest presidential and parliamentary elections produced the lowest turnouts in the near 45-year history of the Republic of Iran, turnout is expected to prove a challenging issue during this vote as well.</p>
<p>The research centre of the Iranian parliament announced on Sunday that 53.4 percent of people – responding to a survey it conducted – said they would vote in the June 28 presidential election, with 28.9 percent still on the fence.</p>
<p>This is just above the 48 percent that saw Raisi become president, and much higher than the 42 percent turnout announced <a href="/news/2024/3/2/conservatives-dominate-irans-parliament-assembly-elections">for the parliamentary election</a> in March.</p>
<p>The Guardian Council is scheduled to begin vetting the candidates from Tuesday for six days, after which the list of approved candidates will be announced on June 11.</p>

            North Korea is almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say.

            Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea’s relationship with China expanded.
