            <strong>• ‘Catastrophic flooding’ in Iowa: </strong>On Saturday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for 21 counties in northwest Iowa and directed all available state resources to assist Rock Valley and other communities in response to “catastrophic flooding.” In Rock Valley, all residences north of Highway 18 were being evacuated amid high floodwaters. There’s a level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall Saturday over northern Iowa, and that corner of the state has seen an estimated 10-plus inches of rain based on radar. The heaviest rain is expected further east. And in nearby Sioux Falls, South Dakota, nine people have been rescued in the past 24 hours from rising water due to heavy rainfall, according to City Emergency Manager Regan Smith.

            <strong>• Flood threat in fire zone: </strong>A flash flood warning was issued for Ruidoso and other New Mexico areas burned by the South Fork Fire after 0.5 inches of rain fell in the morning and more rain was expected into the late afternoon hours. Rain earlier in the week created a flash flood emergency with water rescues as a torrent of mud and water rushed from burned areas. Ground charred by fire, also known as a burn scar, loses its ability to effectively absorb water and more easily floods.

The mayor of hard-hit Ruidoso said they were preparing for more fatalities in the fires and bringing in dogs to help the search for “more loss of life.” The South Fork and Salt fires have together burned an estimated 24,000 acres and were still 0% contained as of Friday. Evacuations are still in effect for Village of Ruidoso and City of Ruidoso Downs residents and additional evacuation orders have been issued in at least seven more areas. Ruidoso residents will be allowed to return to their homes Monday, and authorities ask that they bring at least a week’s worth of food and drinking water, as grocery stores are not operating at full capacity. Meanwhile, FBI special agents have joined the investigation into the cause of wildfires.

<p>But while many members of the movement would like to see him do more to restrict abortion, they cheer him as the greatest champion for the cause because of his role in appointing U.S. Supreme Court justices who overturned national abortion rights in 2022.</p>
    

<p>Trump highlighted that Saturday, saying, “We did something that was amazing,” but the issue would be left to people to decide in the states.</p><p>“Every voter has to go with your heart and do what’s right, but we also have to get elected,” he said. </p><p>While he still takes credit for the reversal of Roe v.

<p>About two-thirds of Americans say abortion should generally be legal, according to polling last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.</p><p>Attendees at the evangelical gathering on Saturday said that while they’d like to see a national abortion ban, Trump isn’t losing any of their deep support. </p><p>“I would prefer if he would sign a national ban,” said Jerri Dickinson, a 78-year-old retired social worker and Faith &amp; Freedom member from New Jersey. “I understand though, that as in accordance with the Constitution, that decision should be left up to the states.”</p><p>Dickinson said she can’t stand the abortion law in her state, which does not set limits on the procedure based on gestational age. But she said outside of preferring a national ban, leaving the issue to the state “is the best alternative.”</p>
    

<p>According to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate, about 8 in 10 white evangelical Christian voters supported Trump in 2020, and nearly 4 in 10 Trump voters identified as white evangelical Christians. White evangelical Christians made up about 20% of the overall electorate that year.</p><p>Beyond just offering their own support in the general election, the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition plans to help get out the vote for Trump and other Republicans, aiming to use volunteers and paid workers to knock on millions of doors in battleground states.</p><p>Trump also rallied voters in Philadelphia on Saturday with a speech heavily focused on violent crime, telling supporters at an arena that he would grant police officers immunity from prosecution.</p><p>“Under Crooked Joe, the City of Brotherly Love is being ravaged by bloodshed and crime,” he said. “We will surge federal law enforcement resources to the places that need them most.”</p>
    

<p>Statistics from the Philadelphia city controller say there were 410 homicides in 2023, a 20% drop compared to 2022.</p><p>Tyler Cecconi, 25, of Richmond, Virginia, said he was glad that Trump is stepping out of his comfort zone and going to places that may not be red.

And then you have the champion of your league, these are the greatest fighters in the world, fighting the champion of the migrants,’” Trump described saying to White. “I think the migrant guy might win, that’s how tough they are.

            But what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime turned tragic this week, when Wurie learned that her mother Isatu Tejan Wurie, 65, and father Alieu Dausy Wurie, 71, were among the hundreds of pilgrims who have died during the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/22/middleeast/medics-pilgrimage-hajj-eyewitnesses-intl/index.html">extreme temperatures</a> that have gripped the Persian Gulf country. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/21/middleeast/hajj-deaths-mecca-extreme-heat-intl-latam/index.html">More than 500</a> have been confirmed dead while there are fears that number is well above a thousand.

            The Wuries were American citizens from Bowie, Maryland. Mrs. Wurie had recently retired as a head nurse at Kaiser Permanente in Prince George’s County, her daughter told CNN.

            Speaking to CNN’s Whitfield on Saturday, Wurie said she had been in close contact with her parents while they were in Saudi Arabia via a family group chat. It was in that chat, she said, that she learned that the tour company did not provide the proper transportation or credentials needed to participate in the pilgrimage. The group her parents were traveling with, which included up to 100 fellow pilgrims, lacked sufficient food and supplies for the five-to-six-day journey that is a pillar of Islam, she said.
    </p>

            Wurie believes her parents were not “properly prepared” for the trip by the tour operator and “did not receive what they paid for” from the company. CNN has reached out to the tour company for comment.
    </p>

            She last heard from her parents on Saturday, June 15, when her mother messaged that they had already been waiting for transportation for hours to take them to Mount Arafat. She believes they were located in Mina at the time. The couple ultimately opted to walk instead and sent a message to their daughter after they had been walking for over two hours.
    </p>

            The couple then joined fellow pilgrims and others in their tour group on Mount Arafat, where they were gathering to pray and reflect on the holy site. A man on their tour group contacted Saida Wurie to say that her parents had gone missing on Mount Arafat, after her father said that he could not continue on the journey and stopped for a break along the way. The man had continued to the top of Mount Arafat but could not find the couple upon his descent.

            Wurie received death notifications from the US Consulate in Jeddah, which had obtained them from the Saudi Interior Ministry, saying her parents had died of “natural causes” on June 15. She was later advised by someone at the US Embassy that heat stroke would be considered a natural cause.

            “We did ask the Saudi government to hold the bodies in order for us to travel to Saudi Arabia to at least give them the proper burial with [their] children being present and to be able to identify the bodies,” she told Whitfield. “Unfortunately, they have already been buried.”

            ⁠She would like American diplomats to meet her and her siblings on the ground when they arrive to assist them in finding where their parents are buried and collecting their belongings, since she does not know Arabic and is not familiar with the area. As of Saturday, diplomats have not committed to meeting them in person in Saudi Arabia, she said.

            Extreme heat has been named as a main factor behind the hundreds of deaths and injuries reported this year during the Hajj. Mecca, the holy city that is central for Hajj pilgrims, saw temperatures soar to a record-setting 125 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday.

            High temperatures for this year’s gathering had been expected, with the Saudi army deploying more than 1,600 personnel with medical units and 30 rapid response teams specifically for heatstroke. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers were also on duty.

            But CNN has spoken to other Hajj pilgrims who said the preparations weren’t enough, with one <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/22/middleeast/medics-pilgrimage-hajj-eyewitnesses-intl/index.html">describing</a> seeing fellow worshipers lose consciousness and walking past bodies covered in white cloths.

            This isn’t the first time hundreds of pilgrims have died while traveling for the Hajj, which this year attracted more than 1.8 million people. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/25/middleeast/hajj-pilgrimage-stampede/index.html">In 2015 more than 700 people were killed</a> during a stampede in the Saudi Arabian city of Mina, just outside of Mecca. In 2006, 363 people were killed during a stampede at the site where pilgrims gathered to participate in the ‘stoning of the devil’ ritual in Mina. Last year, more than 200 people died.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rip currents are a serious threat</strong>: Rip currents are powerful and fast-moving currents that can pull swimmers away from the shore and out to sea. They can be deadly, and it's essential to know how to identify and escape them.</li>
<li><strong>Don't fight the current</strong>: If you find yourself caught in a rip current, don't try to swim against it. This can exhaust you and increase the risk of drowning. Instead, swim parallel to the shore until you're out of the current.</li>
<li><strong>Stay calm and swim laterally</strong>: If you're in a rip current, stay calm and swim laterally (sideways) towards the shore. Don't try to swim straight back to the shore, as the current will just pull you back out.</li>
<li><strong>Look for breaks in the water</strong>: Rip currents often appear as a line of churning water or a foam line. If you see a break in the water, stay away from it. If you're already in the water and see a break, swim out of it immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Know how to identify a rip current</strong>: Rip currents can be difficult to spot, but there are some signs to look out for. These include a lack of foam or breaking waves, a decrease in wave height, or a change in the color of the water. If you notice any of these signs, exercise extreme caution and consider swimming elsewhere.</li>

    <div><section class="content__body"><p>The Biden campaign is deploying both Vice President Kamala Harris and first lady Jill Biden to battleground states in the coming days, as part of a full-court political press centered around abortion.</p><p>Their travels line up with Monday, June 24, two years to the day since the Dobbs decision that overturned <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Roe v. Wade</a>, which codified a woman's right to abortion.</p><p>The first lady is heading to Pittsburgh and Lancaster, a rural area in the battleground state of Pennsylvania that Trump won by 15 points, on Sunday. The vice president will be campaigning in Arizona and Maryland, where there are competitive Senate races, on Monday.</p>    
  <p>The Biden campaign says they will have over 50 events across the country in the coming days about the Dobbs ruling, with a focus in battleground states. This includes Harris' and Mrs. Biden's events, a tour in Wisconsin with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and several events with women who have been impacted by <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arizona-high-court-1864-near-total-abortion-ban-late-september-kris-mayes/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">restrictive abortion bans in Republican states</a></span>. </p><p>Abortion is a top issue of concern for voters. The Biden-Harris re-election team is using this as an opportunity to campaign on reproductive rights, lay out the stakes for November's general election, draw a contrast with Republicans on the issue, and blame former President Donald Trump for abortion bans across the country. </p>

    </p>
<p>While in Arizona, the vice president will focus on the impact of restrictions on reproductive freedom on Latinos. According to the Pew Research Center, there are 1.3 million eligible Latino voters in Arizona, roughly making up 1 in every 4 voters for 2024. </p><p>Harris is also expected to highlight what she sees as the threats contraception and IVF face and make the claim that Trump will sign a national ban, according to a source familiar with the vice president's plans.    </p><p>On the campaign trail, the vice president has made reproductive rights a signature issue and often blames abortion bans happening across the country on the former president. Harris repeatedly warns voters that Trump has promised to sign a federal abortion ban.</p><p>"A second Trump term would be even worse," Harris said during a Florida campaign event on May 1, as the state's 6-week abortion ban took effect. "Friends and allies in Congress are trying to pass a national ban and understand a national ban would outlaw abortion in every single state."</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Trump floated the idea of a federal ban on abortion at 15 weeks, but in April, he sidestepped the idea saying the issue should be decided by states. Most recently, during an appearance on the "All-In" podcast on Thursday, Trump said he would not support a national ban.</p><p>The first of two scheduled debates between Mr. Biden and Trump is set for Thursday. It will be hosted by CNN and Harris is expected to say she thinks the former president will be on the defense on the issue of abortion during the debate, according to a source familiar with her remarks.</p><p>Since the overturning of Roe v Wade, Harris has participated in more than 85 events across the country focused on reproductive rights. Monday's visit will mark the third time Harris has visited Arizona this year. It's a state that Trump won in 2016 and while Biden won in 2020, it was by fewer than 11,000 votes.</p>

            Outside, David Rodriguez was pulling into a gas station when he heard “pops” that he initially thought were fireworks. He then noticed the grocery store’s front windows were broken – as if they had been “shot open” by gunfire, Rodriguez said.

            Not finding an escape route, Doherty and others in the store hurriedly hid in a freezer. Doherty’s daughter and son, who were in a different aisle, reunited with their mother in the back of the store and followed two store workers into the freezer. The 39-year-old mother said she heard about nine or ten rounds before making it into the icy shelter.

            “We ran in there really fast. We still heard gunshots keep going off,” Doherty said. “It was like slow motion. My daughter was like ‘Mama, pinch me, this can’t be real.’ And I was like, ’Baby, it’s real.’”

            Doherty couldn’t hear what was happening outside, and when they tried to call 9-1-1, there was no service. The group stayed inside, enduring the freezing cold in “panic mode,” with some praying and others crying, she recalled.

She was crying.”

            At one point, one of the workers opened the freezer door, and saw someone dead right outside of it, Doherty said. The door remained shut until one of the store workers heard police outside, and they were then escorted out of the store, Doherty said.

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p><a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=744b820d-2733-4df6-9efd-0a3b26908e87" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Artificial intelligence (AI);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">Artificial intelligence (AI)</a> is a truly revolutionary technology that has captured the imagination of investors like few things before. This is a double-edged sword, even if the tech really is here to stay. If we learned anything from 2000, it's that too much hype around new technology without the economics to back up sky-high valuations is dangerous territory to be in.</p><p>I don't want to draw too close a parallel here -- there are plenty of reasons to believe this is not dot-com bubble round two -- but it is always prudent to maintain a healthy skepticism during a boom. All eyes -- skeptics' and believers' alike -- are on <strong>Nvidia</strong>'s <span class="ticker">(NASDAQ: NVDA)</span> upcoming annual shareholder meeting.</p><p>On June 26, 2024, the figurehead of the AI revolution will hold the meeting, discussing strategy and holding votes on action items like board approvals. Typically, annual general meetings don't move the needle as much as earnings reports do, but it's still an important event that could help shed light on what the future holds for Nvidia and the market as a whole.</p><p>So, with the meeting fast approaching, is it a good time to hop on board the Nvidia train? Here are three reasons the stock still looks strong.</p><h2>1. Nvidia has a lot of cash to play with</h2><p>As the company has rocketed to stardom and proven how lucrative the business is, its competition wants a piece of that profit. The threat of an <strong>AMD </strong>or <strong>Intel</strong> catching up and eating into the roughly 80% market share Nvidia enjoys is real and should be taken seriously. However, Nvidia has major resources to defend itself through constant innovation.</p><p>In tech, having the best product goes a long way. AMD and Intel need to produce a product comparable to Nvidia's if they hope to chip away at its market share. This takes money -- a lot of it. AMD spent $1.5 billion in research and development (R&amp;D) last quarter, while Nvidia spent $2.7 billion. Remember, Nvidia is already in pole position; it has the best tech on the market, and it's still outspending AMD almost two to one.</p><p>Intel, on the other hand, is outspending both, at $4.4 billion last quarter. The catch here is that this spending is putting Intel in the red. How long can it keep it up?</p><p>Take a look at this chart showing the <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/p/price-to-free-cash-flow/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=744b820d-2733-4df6-9efd-0a3b26908e87" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free cash flow (FCF);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0">free cash flow (FCF)</a> of these companies. FCF is a company's income after you've subtracted operating expenses and capital expenditures (the money a company spends to grow) and it is indicative of how much headroom a company has if it wants to, say, increase R&amp;D spending.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">NVDA Free Cash Flow Chart</figcaption></p></figure><h2>2. The market as a whole is growing rapidly</h2><p>So if we accept that Nvidia has the resources to defend itself from its primary competitors, we can assume Nvidia can maintain or grow its market share. There are certainly more factors, but it's not an unreasonable assumption.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Statista.com predicts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the AI market at-large of about 28.5% through 2030. That is a seriously quick rate of growth, albeit slower than the lightning speed at which the company has been growing recently. Still, this would be an incredible growth rate to maintain.</p><p>This is an estimate for the entire market -- not just semiconductors, which are Nvidia's bread and butter -- so this is a very rough measuring stick. The semiconductor segment could have a lower CAGR rate than this. However, this brings me to my next point.</p><h2>3. Nvidia isn't sitting on its laurels -- it's expanding its revenue streams</h2><p>There's no doubt that what has led to Nvidia's massive success as of late is the sale of its powerful AI-enabling chips, but the company sees a future beyond this. Nvidia is attempting to build an entire AI ecosystem. It is partnering with companies like <strong>Dell </strong>to offer full-scale, on-premises, AI computing solutions. It is building technologies and end-to-end platforms designed for autonomous vehicles, humanoid robotics, and drug research. There's more, but I'll stop here. The point is that Nvidia intends to position itself at the very center of all things AI, as a star that other companies orbit, rather than just one more link in the chain.</p><h2>Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?</h2><p>Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:</p><p>The <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the <strong><a href="https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=a6d65378-0527-4fc0-a28e-07fba28302c6&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-foolcom-sa-bbn-dyn%3Faid%3D8867%26amp%253Bsource%3Disaeditxt0010895%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D13885&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=744b820d-2733-4df6-9efd-0a3b26908e87" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 best stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.
