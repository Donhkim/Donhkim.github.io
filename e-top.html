            The defense and prosecution gave their closing arguments in Trump’s New York hush money trial, spending many hours late into the evening Tuesday offering the jury diametrically opposed stories about the payment made to<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/07/politics/takeaways-stormy-daniels-hush-money-testimony/index.html"> Stormy Daniels </a>in October 2016 and the subsequent reimbursement to Cohen the following year.

            On Wednesday, Judge Juan Merchan will give the jury his instructions in the morning, and then jurors will begin deliberations, with the historic and unprecedented trial – and a pivotal moment in the 2024 presidential election – hanging in the balance.

            Here are takeaways from Day 21 of the Trump hush money trial:

            Defense attorney Todd Blanche was up first, and he spent much of his two-hour closing argument attacking the credibility of Cohen, Trump’s former fixer.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv200073b6jgbyd1cr1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            He accused Cohen of lying directly to the jury, on top of the lies he was convicted of telling. Cohen lied so much, Blanche alleged, that he should be considered the Tom Brady of lying – the “GLOAT,” or the “Greatest Liar of All Time.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv200083b6j81566fzq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Blanche focused on Cohen’s claims about his phone call with Trump on October 24, 2016. Cohen testified that Trump bodyguard Keith Schiller put Trump on the phone so Cohen could tell him he was going forward with the Daniels payment.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv200093b6jjrxfvi3l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            During cross-examination, Blanche confronted Cohen with text messages he sent to Schiller around the same time as the call asking for help about a teenager prankster.
    </p>

            “We all know that he called Keith Schiller to talk about the fact that a 14-year-old had been harassing him for several days and forgot to block his number, and Mr. Cohen wanted to fix that,” Blanche said Tuesday.
    </p>

  


    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv3000b3b6j4oihz06o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Blanche told the jury it’s clear they were talking about the teen prankster because Cohen hung up and texted Schiller about the situation then followed up the next morning.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv3000c3b6jo13di7fd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “That is perjury,” Blanche said, raising his voice as he slowly emphasized each syllable of the final word.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv3000d3b6j9j1j5su5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Blanche also said that prosecutors offered no evidence connecting Trump to the payment to Daniels outside of Cohen’s testimony.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv3000e3b6j4lpovbut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “There’s no way that you can find that President Trump knew about this payment at the time it was made without believing the words of Michael Cohen, period. And you cannot – you cannot – believe his words,” Blanche told the jury.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv3000f3b6j5e3s503k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            At the end of his closing argument, Blanche again returned to Cohen.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv3000g3b6j8ni5izeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “His words cannot the trusted,” Blanche said. “He came in here, he raised his right hand and he lied to each of you repeatedly. You cannot send someone to prison – you cannot convict somebody based upon the words of Michael Cohen.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv3000h3b6ji8qnh0cz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Prosecutors objected to Blanche’s commentary about prison – and Merchan admonished him for saying it, because jurors are not allowed to consider penalties, that’s up to the judge – but Blanche had made his point regardless.
    </p>

            Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass pushed back against Blanche’s attack when it was his turn to present to the jury in the afternoon, arguing there was plenty of corroboration of Cohen’s testimony, both from documents and the testimony of others, particularly former AMI chief David Pecker.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv3000k3b6j2ub3p176@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “We didn’t choose Michael Cohen to be our witness. We didn’t pick him up at the witness store. The defendant chose Michael Cohen as his fixer because he was willing to lie and cheat on his behalf,” Steinglass said of Cohen.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv3000l3b6jok34cd2h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Steinglass tried to rebut Blanche’s allegation about the October 24, 2016, call with a bit of role-playing. The prosecutor put his thumb and forefinger to the side of his head and acted out a theoretical call Cohen could have made where he talked to both Schiller and Trump.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv3000m3b6jit4lqowk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “Hey, Keith, how’s it going? It seems like this prankster might be a 14-year-old kid,” Steinglass began the fake conversation, pretending to move into asking Schiller to pass the phone to Trump and then acting out a quick update on Daniels and the payment.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv4000n3b6j47fp0b14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            When he finished the fake conversation, Steinglass said, “49 seconds.” The call between Schiller and Cohen lasted 1 minute 36 seconds, according to call logs.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv4000o3b6j8u50l1fp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “These guys know each other well. They speak in coded language, and they speak fast,” Steinglass said of Cohen and Trump.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv4000p3b6jc9msap8r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Steinglass also focused on testimony from Pecker to help bolster Cohen’s credibility, such as showing that Cohen’s story was corroborated by Pecker’s description of a phone call with Trump about the Karen McDougal story in June 2016.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv4000q3b6jxunzb81z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “Trump is deputizing Cohen right in front of Pecker so that Pecker knows that any go ahead from Cohen is a go head from Trump. This call makes it impossible for the defense to claim that Cohen was acting on his own here,” Steinglass said, calling it “powerful evidence of the defendant’s involvement wholly apart from Cohen.”
    </p>

  

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv4000s3b6jd01rxtqk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Steinglass spent 4 hours and 41 minutes walking jurors back through all of the documents and testimony they had heard over the six-week trial, beginning with the 2015 Trump Tower meeting all the way through Trump’s pressure of Cohen in 2018 before Cohen began cooperating with federal investigators and pleaded guilty.
    </p>

            Steinglass argued that Pecker, Trump and Cohen entered into a conspiracy in 2015 when Pecker agreed to be the “eyes and ears” of the campaign – alleging that the agreement went well beyond the normal bounds of a press relationship.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv4000u3b6j3oq97u60@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            When the “Access Hollywood” story came out in October 2016, Steinglass said that Trump and the campaign went into panic mode. Around the time Trump’s campaign was dealing with the fall out of the “Access Hollywood” tape, he said, Trump was “negotiating to muzzle a porn star who was prepared to go public with allegations of extramarital sex.”
    </p>

            “Stormy Daniels was a walking, talking reminder that the defendant was not only words. She would have totally undermined his strategy for spinning away the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape,” Steinglass said.
    </p>

            Steinglass noted that when Cohen paid Daniels’ attorney the $130,000 wire transfer through an LLC, it shouldn’t be surprising to jurors that Trump wasn’t connected to the documents.
    </p>

            “Now it’s true that Mr. Trump didn’t sign these documents himself. That’s kind of the whole point,” Steinglass said.

            Steinglass walked jurors back through the hand-written calculations from former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg to repay Cohen, in which Weisselberg wrote on Cohen’s bank statement that the reimbursement would be “grossed up” to account for taxes.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwr1ykv5000z3b6jlz96j63v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “We don’t have to prove that the defendant made and created the false entries himself,” Steinglass said. Trump is guilty of false business records when he makes or causes a false entry in his business records, Steinglass argued.
    </p>

            Throughout his presentation, Blanche continued to raise the concept of reasonable doubt with the jury – even punctuating the conclusion of his closing argument with “10 reasons” why jurors should have reasonable doubt about the case

            “Each one of these reasons makes a not guilty verdict a very easy path and a very quick path,” Blanche said.

            Among his arguments: that the invoices and vouchers created to pay Cohen were accurate because Cohen was working as Trump’s attorney, that Trump had no intent to defraud and that there’s no evidence Trump knew the invoices were sent.

            Blanche also argued there was no attempt to conceal or commit another crime – one of the conditions needed for a felony conviction – and there was “absolutely” no agreement to influence the 2016 election.

  <p>"Ohio is running out of time to get Joe Biden, the sitting president of the United States, on the ballot this fall," DeWine said last week. "Failing to do so is simply unacceptable. This is ridiculous. This is (an) absurd situation."</p><p>The Democrats are scheduled to hold their convention Aug. 19-22, meaning the president's formal nomination would miss the current Ohio deadline.</p><p>To avoid any confusion and to ensure access to the Ohio ballot, DNC officials say the party's rules and bylaws subcommittee plans to vote next Tuesday to recommend to the full body that the president and vice president be nominated virtually. Officials noted this is similar to what occurred in 2020, when Mr. Biden and Harris had to be nominated virtually after the pandemic severely curtailed the meetings of the party's quadrennial convention.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree. But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own," DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement. "Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice."</p><p>A DNC official said that despite the virutal nomination, the Chicago convention "will continue to serve as an important convening event for Democrats across the country." </p>

"People are in desperate need of aid and this is one means to deliver it."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On 17 May, the US military confirmed that the first shipments of humanitarian aid were delivered into Gaza via the pier, but in a separate incident last weekend four vessels supporting the pier became unmoored in "heavy sea states", beaching two of them.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In an earlier incident, three US soldiers taking part in the Gaza pier mission were also injured, one of whom was in critical condition and evacuated to a hospital in Israel.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Reuters news agency quoted the UN World Food Programme (WFP) spokesperson as saying that the UN has transported a total of 137 lorries of aid from the pier - approximately 900 metric tonnes - since it began operating. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">At the White House on Tuesday, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the pier was never expected to "supplant" aid reaching Gaza via land crossings, but instead could be a "force multiplier". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Pentagon estimates that more than 1,000 tonnes have been delivered to shore, with just over 900 tonnes reaching UN warehouses. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Despite mounting concerns over the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he remains committed to "total victory" in Rafah, Hamas' last remaining urban stronghold in the south of the strip. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Israel's military campaign in Gaza began after gunmen from Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking 252 others to Gaza as hostages.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Karen Read's blood alcohol level</strong>: On January 29, 2022, Read's blood alcohol content (BAC) was tested at Good Samaritan Hospital in Brockton, where she had been brought in under a "Section 12" order. The test showed a BAC of 0.093%.</li>
<li><strong>Retrograde testing</strong>: A Massachusetts Office of Alcohol Testing expert, Nicholas Roberts, testified about a type of testing that allows the lab to estimate a person's blood alcohol level hours before an official test was taken. Using this method, Read's blood alcohol level was estimated to have been between 0.135% and 0.292% at the time she consumed her last drink.</li>
<li><strong>Murder trial</strong>: Karen Read is on trial for allegedly killing her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, by hitting him with her SUV and leaving him to die in the snow in 2022. The prosecution alleges that Read hit and killed O'Keefe, while her defense team claims she is the victim of a coverup by law enforcement.</li>
<li><strong>Witness testimony</strong>: Emergency room doctor Justin Rice testified that he treated Read at Good Samaritan Hospital on January 29, 2022, after she was brought in under a "Section 12" order. Rice described the order as an "involuntary detention" over a mental health concern.</li>
<li><strong>Defense claims investigation</strong>: Read's defense attorneys have claimed that law enforcement officials, including Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Brian Higgins, were involved in O'Keefe's death.</li>

Rice described it as an "involuntarily detention," usually over a mental health concern.</p>

    </p>
<p>Rice said bloodwork was performed on Read. She had a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 93 milligrams per deciliter, or 0.093%. The legal BAC limit in Massachusetts for driving is 0.08%.</p><p>Later, Nicholas Roberts, who at the time was a member of the Massachusetts Office of Alcohol Testing working with the Massachusetts State Police crime lab unit, took the stand.</p><p>He spoke about a type of "retrograde" testing that allows the lab to estimate what a person's blood alcohol level would have been hours before an official blood test was taken. </p><p>Read's blood was taken at 9:08 a.m. Using 12:45 a.m. as the estimated last drink Read consumed, Roberts estimated that her BAC would have previously been a minimum of 0.135% or a maximum of 0.292%.</p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'>
    </p>
<p>Defense attorney Elizabeth Little spent cross-examination of Roberts attempting to show that the estimation could have been inaccurate. She said the testing method is "acting with a lot of unknowns."</p><p>"If Miss Read drank alcohol after 12:45 a.m. and before her blood was drawn at 9:08 a.m., your entire calculation would be invalid," Little said. Roberts responded, "Yeah."</p><h2>John O'Keefe's injuries</h2><p>In addition to seeing Read, Rice treated O'Keefe when he was rushed to the hospital after being found in the snow. </p><p>He described O'Keefe's injuries, saying he was unresponsive and intubated as he arrived at the emergency room.</p><p>O'Keefe was in cardiac arrest and had a body temperature of 80.1 degrees when he arrived. He had no pulse, and also had a cut, and other scratches on his forearm.</p><h2>Children called to testify</h2><p>Earlier in the day, around 10 a.m. all cameras in the courtrooms were ordered to shut off as children who were in John O'Keefe's care took the stand. O'Keefe took custody of his sister's children after she died of cancer and the children's father died of a heart attack several months later.</p><p>A court order prevented the media from broadcasting any information until the children finished their testimony.</p>

    </p>
<p>The children's testimony lasted just under two hours.</p><h2>Read and O'Keefe's "sometimes rough" relationship</h2><p>O'Keefe's nephew, a young teenager, described Read and O'Keefe's relationship as "sometimes rough."</p><p>"There was a lot of disagreements and arguments," the boy said. He added that the couple yelled frequently, and the disagreements became more frequent closer to O'Keefe's death.</p><p>During cross-examination, Read's attorney David Yannetti was soft-spoken, asking if the boy knew the phrase "raise a hand in anger." He then asked if O'Keefe or Read every raised a hand in anger at the other, and the teenager said no.</p><p>"I'm so sorry that you were made to come here today. Nothing further," Yannetti said as he concluded his cross-examination, prompting Judge Beverly Cannone to strike the comment from the record.</p><h2>"A lot of arguing and fighting"</h2><p>The boy's older sister, a teenager, said there were good days and bad days with the couple. She said on the bad days, Read would ignore the children. She also described problems in O'Keefe and Read's relationship.</p><p>"It was good in the beginning but it was bad at the end," the girl said. "There was a lot of arguing and fighting."</p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc5" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",5]'>
    </p>
<p>Like her brother, the girl testified that fights between the couple were more frequent closer to O'Keefe's death.</p><p>She told jurors about a fight between the couple sometime in January 2022. O'Keefe was asking her to leave my house, she said. He said the relationship had run its course, that it used to be fun and now it's not. But the niece said Karen Read would not leave.</p><h2>The morning John O'Keefe's body was found</h2><p>O'Keefe's niece described the morning of January 29, 2022 when the Boston police officer's body was found at 34 Fairview Road in Canton.</p><p>The girl said she called Jennifer McCabe, a previous witness in the case, and put Read on speakerphone. McCabe later would go out with Read and Kerry Roberts to search for O'Keefe.</p><p>O'Keefe's niece said she heard Read on the phone saying "Maybe I did something, maybe a snow plow hit him." </p><p>"She said they were in an argument," the girl testified.</p><p>According to the niece, Read's story later changed as she called more people. First she mentioned that there was a fight and she wondered if she had hit O'Keefe, then in another phone call no fight was mentioned but she said maybe a plow had hit him.</p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc6" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",6]'>
    </p>
<p>"I had never seen her like that. Frantic. Pacing around," the girl said. </p><p>Yannetti's cross-examination was again brief, asking similar questions that he asked the girl's brother.</p><h2>"Desperate and inappropriate"</h2><p>Outside court Tuesday afternoon, the defense criticized the prosecution's decision to call O'Keefe's niece and nephew to testify.  </p><p>"It was desperate and inappropriate for the DA's office to call children to try to prove a nonexistent motive that they failed to prove through their adult witnesses," Yannetti said.  </p><h2>Cross-examination of Brian Higgins</h2><p>Before the children testified, Higgins was back on the stand for the rest of his cross-examination. Last Friday he read several "flirty" text messages that he exchanged with Read just days before O'Keefe died.</p><p>Defense attorney Alan Jackson handled the cross-examination on Friday, but he was unable to be in Norfolk Superior Court on Tuesday. Yannetti continued the cross-examination in Jackson's absence. </p><p>On Friday, Jackson accused Higgins of destroying his phone despite receiving a preservation order for his data. Higgins said he threw it away.  </p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc7" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",7]'>
    </p>
<p>When court resumed on Tuesday, Yannetti once again focused on Higgins disposing of his phone.</p><p>"It went in a trash bag, yes," Higgins said.</p><p>"You used a passive voice. It went into a trash bag, did it fly out of your hand unexpectedly into a trash bag, sir?" Yannetti said. "Are you reluctant to say that you put it in a trash bag, sir?"</p><p>Yannetti asked Higgins if it was important that no one saw his text with members of the Albert family. "No sir, that's not true," Higgins responded. </p><p>"From that day forward, no one would ever be able to discover the content that you discussed on your phone?" Yannetti asked, before concluding cross-examination after about 10 minutes.</p><p>Prosecutor Adam Lally later followed up by asking Higgins why he threw his phone away.</p><p>"Because it was beaten. It was broken up. I already had a new phone. The only explanation is I threw it away. That's it," Higgins said. </p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc8" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",8]'>
    </p>
<p>Higgins said a reason he was getting rid of his phone was that a person he was investigating in another case had posted his number online. </p><p>He also said the phone didn't mean much to him. "I'm divorced. I don't have kids. I didn't have the typical memories that somebody would have had on their phone," Higgins said. </p><h2>Brian Higgins "embarrassed" by text messages with Karen Read</h2><p>With cross-examination completed, Lally once again questioned Higgins again. </p><p>Lally asked Higgins if he had spoken to anyone else about the text messages with Read. He said he had not. </p><p>"On a personal level, I keep things to myself. I was a little embarrassed. Not really proud of them. Didn't show me in a good light with respects that I was John's friend," Higgins said.</p><p>Higgins completed his testimony and stepped down after less than an hour on the stand Tuesday.</p><h2>Who is Brian Higgins?</h2><p>Higgins was one of the people at an after-party at Brian Albert's 34 Fairview Road home on January 29, 2022. Read's defense is mounting a third-party culprit defense, and says Higgins is one of three men who could have killed O'Keefe in a fight. They say the group then dragged O'Keefe's body outside.</p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc9" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",9]'>
    </p>
<p>During his testimony on Friday, Higgins said he considered O'Keefe a friend. Both men were drinking at the Waterfall Bar and Grille in Canton before leaving for Brian Albert's home.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>President Joe Biden's campaign conducted an unusual move by sending actor Robert De Niro and two former police officers to outside the courtroom where former President Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial was taking place.</li>
<li>The motive behind this move was to refocus the presidential race on Trump's role in the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol insurrection, rather than his criminal trial.</li>
<li>The Biden campaign had previously avoided commenting on the trial, but decided to engage in order to capitalize on the large media focus on the trial and the drama-filled closing moments.</li>
<li>Trump's advisers responded to the Biden campaign's move by arguing that it validated Trump's claims that his prosecutions are being driven by politics, rather than any wrongdoing on his part.</li>
<li>The Biden campaign's communication director, Michael Tyler, denied that the team was there to comment on the trial, saying they were instead exploiting the media attention to refocus the race on more pressing issues.</li>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden’s campaign on Tuesday showed up outside former President Donald Trump’s New York City <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-jury-hush-money-stormy-daniels-e262d1fe4a9ca624f2f983ca1000eb55">criminal hush money trial</a></span> with actor Robert De Niro and a pair of former police officers in an effort to refocus the presidential race on the former president’s role in <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege">the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol insurrection</a></span>.</p><p></p><p>It was a sharp about-face for Biden’s team, which had largely ignored the trial since it began six weeks ago and is now looking to capitalize on <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-stormy-daniels-cohen-a1984e2353de3df5d0520e4f0705f7f8">its drama-filled closing moments</a></span>, sending the “Goodfellas” actor and the first responders who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Biden’s campaign had been wary about feeding into Trump’s argument that his criminal trials were the result of politically motivated prosecutions, but ultimately it decided to engage because its message about the stakes of the election was struggling to break through the intense focus on the trial.</p>
    

<p></p><p>A top Biden adviser said they weren’t there to talk about the trial — and De Niro and the officers didn’t reference the sordid criminal case directly — rather to exploit the large media focus on the legal proceedings. But Trump advisers argued in a dueling press conference that the Biden team’s presence validated the Republican former president’s claims that his prosecutions are being driven by politics.</p>



<p></p><p>“We’re not here today because of what’s going on over there,” Biden campaign communication director Michael Tyler told reporters, gesturing toward the courthouse. “We’re here today because you all are here.”</p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know: Prosecutors and defense lawyers in Donald Trump's hush money trial are set to deliver closing arguments to the jury after more than four weeks of testimony.

</div>
<p></p><p>The back-to-back press conferences were a sideshow to the main event playing out inside the courthouse, where closing arguments were underway in the only Trump trial likely to surface before the November election. There are two others directly related to the Republican’s efforts to undo his 2020 loss to Biden, a Democrat: A federal case in Washington is related to his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, and a state case in Georgia accuses him of election interference. He has pleaded not guilty in those cases. The last case involves accusations he willfully retained classified documents after he left office. </p>
    
<p></p><p>The Biden campaign last week released a new ad that was narrated by De Niro sharply criticizing Trump’s presidency and plans if he’s reelected. On Tuesday, he said he’d joined the campaign because it was the only way to “preserve our freedoms. ”</p>
    

<p></p><p>“I don’t mean to scare you. No, wait, maybe I do mean to scare you,” De Niro told reporters. “If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.”</p><p></p><p>The actor cast himself as the true New Yorker and mocked Trump’s history of sometimes-unsuccessful business ventures and self-promotion, saying Trump was looking to “destroy” the city.</p><p></p><p>“We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another crappy real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot,” De Niro said. “I love this city. I don’t want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city but the country, and, eventually, he could destroy the world.”</p><p></p><p>Former Washington, D.C., police officer Michael Fanone and former Capitol police officer Harry Dunn spoke of their personal experiences on Jan. 6, with Fanone describing his injuries suffered at the hands of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-confirm-joe-biden-78104aea082995bbd7412a6e6cd13818">the mob of Trump supporters</a></span> seeking to halt Congress’ certification of Biden’s 2020 presidential victory.</p>
    

<p></p><p>“I came here today to remind Americans of what Donald Trump is capable of and the violence that he unleashed on all of Americans on Jan. 6, 2021,” Fanone said.</p><p></p><p>The two former officers were also witnesses during a congressional investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot. Hundreds of law enforcement officers were beaten and bloodied in the attack by Trump supporters, who descended after a rally and smashed into the Capitol while Trump remained silent for hours.</p><p></p><p>“Americans need to wake up. This is not a drill,” said Dunn, a former Capitol police officer who ran unsuccessfully for office in Maryland.</p><p></p><p>“We can’t count on these institutions to stop Donald Trump,” he added. “It’s going to take us Americans at the ballot box to defeat him once and for all.”</p><p></p><p>Trump’s campaign staffers held their own news conference at the same spot outside the courthouse to respond to De Niro, the Jan. 6 officers and the Biden campaign.</p>
    

<p></p><p>Trump’s senior campaign adviser, Jason Miller, called De Niro — who won Oscars for his roles in “The Godfather: Part II” and “Raging Bull” — “a washed-up actor” and said the Biden news conference proved Trump’s arguments that the trial, like the others the former president is facing, was motivated by politics.</p><p></p><p>“After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,” Miller said. </p><p></p><p>Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s press secretary, called the Biden campaign “desperate and failing” and “pathetic” and said its event outside the trial was “a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.”</p><p></p><p>Yet even as Trump and his aides denounce the trial as politically motivated, he has been working to turn the proceedings into an offshoot of his <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-new-york-hush-money-trial-56fd4f4bb7562772c701a2acab76e9fd">presidential campaign</a></span>.

<li>Detective Sgt. Brian Keely, a 50-year-old Michigan State Police detective sergeant, has been charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in connection with the April 17 death of 25-year-old Samuel Sterling.</li>
<li>Sterling died after being crushed by a police SUV while running from authorities. The incident occurred when Sterling fled from troopers in a fugitive task force attempt to arrest him.</li>

<li>
<p>Garry Conille, a UN development specialist, was named Haiti's new prime minister, nearly a month after a transitional council sought to choose someone else for the position.</p>

                                        <p>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — U.N. development specialist Garry Conille was named Haiti’s new prime minister Tuesday evening, nearly a month after a coalition within a fractured transitional council sought to choose someone else for the position.</p><p>The long-awaited move comes as gangs continue to terrorize the capital of Port-au-Prince, opening fire in once peaceful neighborhoods and using heavy machinery to demolish several police stations and prisons.</p><p>Council member Louis Gérald Gilles told The Associated Press that six out of seven council members with voting power chose Conille earlier Tuesday. He said one member, Laurent St. Cyr, was not in Haiti and therefore did not vote.</p><p>Conille has been UNICEF’s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean since January 2023 and previously served as Haiti’s prime minister from October 2011 to May 2012 under then President Michel Martelly. He replaces Michel Patrick Boisvert, who was named interim prime minister after Ariel Henry resigned via letter in late April.</p>
    

<p>Henry was on an official trip to Kenya when a coalition of powerful gangs launched coordinated attacks Feb. 29, seizing control of police stations, shooting at Haiti’s main international airport and storming the country’s two biggest prisons, releasing more than 4,000 inmates.</p>



<p>Henry was locked out of the country by the attacks, with the airport in the Port-au-Prince capital remaining shuttered for nearly three months.</p>
    
<p>Gang violence is still surging in parts of Haiti’s capital and beyond as Conille takes over the helm of the troubled Caribbean country awaiting the U.N.-backed deployment of a police force from Kenya and other countries.</p><p>Conille studied medicine and public health and helped develop health care in impoverished communities in Haiti, where he helped coordinate reconstruction efforts after the devastating 2010 earthquake. </p>
    

<p>He worked for several years at the United Nations before Martelly designated him as prime minister in 2011. Conille resigned less than a year later following clashes with the president and his Cabinet over an investigation into government officials who have dual nationality, which is not allowed by Haiti’s constitution.</p><p>Conille has an arduous task ahead of him, having to quell rampant gang violence while helping lift Haiti out of deep poverty, with inflation reaching a record 29%, according to the latest data available. In recent years, gangs that control at least 80% of Port-au-Prince have forced more than 360,000 people from their homes, and they continue to control key routes from the capital to Haiti’s northern and southern regions, often paralyzing the transportation of critical goods.</p><p>The selection of Conille as prime minister comes just weeks after former Haitian sports minister Fritz Bélizaire was chosen for the post in late April by a four-member coalition within the nine-member transitional council in a surprise announcement that angered many. Critics said proper procedure was not followed as dictated by the framework that established the council, so a new process was started to choose a prime minister, with dozens of names submitted for the post.</p>
    

<p>The drawn-out process has been criticized by many, including the Montana Accord, a Haitian civil society group that has a representative on the council.</p><p>In a statement Tuesday, the group accused the council of not taking any “consequential measures” since being installed as “the suffering of the people is getting worse, while the gangs are taking control of more territory and committing more crimes.”</p><p>It also accused the council of not being transparent while choosing a new prime minister, saying it did not publicly share the criteria used or the names submitted, among other things.</p><p>Liné Balthazar, president of the Tet Kale party, called on the council to be transparent in an interview Monday with Magik9, a local radio station, and said the selection of a prime minister appeared improvised.</p><p>In addition to selecting a new prime minister, the nine-member council, of which seven have voting powers, also has to appoint a provisional electoral commission, a requirement before elections can take place. The council’s non-renewable mandate expires Feb. 7, 2026, at which date a new president is scheduled to be sworn in.</p>
    

<p>In addition to picking a new prime minister, the council also is responsible for selecting a new Cabinet and holding general elections by the end of next year.</p><p>The council members are Emmanuel Vertilaire for Petit Desalin, a party led by former senator and presidential candidate Jean-Charles Moïse; Smith Augustin for EDE/RED, a party led by former Prime Minister Claude Joseph; Fritz Alphonse Jean of the Montana Accord; Leslie Voltaire for Fanmi Lavalas, the party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide; Louis Gérald Gilles for the Dec. 21 coalition that backs former Prime Minister Ariel Henry; Edgard Leblanc Fils for the Jan. 30 Collective, which represents parties including that of former President Michel Martelly; and Laurent Saint-Cyr for the private sector.</p>

    <div><div class="sc-ivDvhZ iBEcrE sc-ilpitK eqflEz sc-jIJgYh fNjber sc-gXCJSa laAjLu sc-bouBDN ihKGDI rich-text"><p>Georgian lawmakers on Tuesday <a class="internal-link" href="/en/georgias-president-vetoes-foreign-agent-law/a-69122348">voted down a presidential veto</a> of the controversial "foreign agents" legislation, clearing the way for the bill to come into force. </p>

<p>The law, which has led to weeks of mass protests, would require media outlets and NGOs that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as "pursuing the interests of a foreign power."</p>

<p>Lawmakers voted 84 to 4 to override a veto by President Salome Zourabichvili and pass the bill. Most opposition MPs walked out of the 150-seat chamber ahead of the vote.</p>

<p>The legislation was put forward by the ruling Georgian Dream party in April and <a class="internal-link" href="/en/georgia-parliament-passes-divisive-foreign-influence-bill/a-69077202">approved by the parliament</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p>The bill has been <a class="internal-link" href="/en/georgia-eu-nato-condemn-passing-of-foreign-agent-law/a-69084301">widely criticized by the EU, UN, NATO and the US</a>. Washington has <a class="internal-link" href="/en/us-issues-sanctions-over-georgias-foreign-agent-bill/a-69167271">announced travel sanctions</a> over the measure.</p>

<p>"It is unfortunate that Georgia's leaders are choosing to forego the steps needed to advance Georgia and the western direction that its people want," US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.</p>

<p>The EU said that it "deeply regrets" the law's adoption. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was "considering all options to react to these developments."</p>

<h2>Why did the president veto the bill?</h2>

<p>President Zourabichvili, a fierce critic of the governing party, vetoed the bill on May 18.</p>

<p><a class="internal-link" href="/en/georgias-president-plans-foreign-agent-law-veto-as-symbol/a-69090123">In an interview with DW ahead of the veto</a>, she accused Georgian Dream of jeopardizing the country's future and said the law had become a "symbol of a number of laws and measures and rhetoric that is taking Georgia away from its European path."</p>

<p>"What I think is important is that the country continues on its path towards Europe," she said. </p>

<p>The government has defended the legislation, saying it is needed to ensure transparency and to keep a lid on harmful foreign actors seeking to detabilize the South Caucasus country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, opponents have labeled the bill "the Russian law" because it is similar to measures pushed through by Moscow to crack down on independent media and dissent. Critics also say the bill aims to appease the Kremlin and restrict media freedoms in the leadup to Georgia's parliamentaly elections in October.</p>

<h2>Protests again erupt in Tbilisi</h2>

<p>Thousands of people gathered outside parliament on Tuesday, waving Georgian and EU flags ahead of a planned evening rally.</p>

<p>There have been repeated clashes between demonstrators and police since the law was first proposed several weeks ago. </p>

<p>Speaking from Tbilisi, DW correspondent Maria Katamadze described the situation as "very fragile, very volatile."</p>

<p>"This comes after the unprecedented domestic backlash from the streets of Tbilisi where mainly youth, Gen Z and grassroot movements have been protesting for over a month now," she said. "They say this is a national resistance to the government's actions that many critics say is going to damage the reputation of Georgia across the world and damage the relationship with the West."</p><div

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pope Francis has apologized for using derogatory language towards gay men in a private meeting with Italian bishops, as reported by an Italian tabloid website and confirmed by other sources.</li>
<li>According to reports, the Pope said gay men should not be allowed to train for the priesthood and added that there is already an "air of frociaggine" (a highly offensive slur) among gay priests.</li>
<li>The Vatican issued a statement apologizing to those who were hurt by the Pope's language, saying that he did not mean to offend anyone and that he never intended to use homophobic language.</li>
<li>This is in stark contrast to the Pope's previous public statements and actions, which have been seen as progressive and inclusive towards LGBTQ+ individuals. He has previously spoken out in favor of same-sex couples and has welcomed gay people into the Church.</li>
<li>The apology has been met with a mixed reaction, with some Catholics defending the Pope's use of language, citing that he sometimes makes mistakes in Italian colloquialisms, while others have condemned the comments as "shocking and hurtful" and a step backwards for the Church's stance on LGBTQ+ issues.</li>

Nobody is useless or superfluous, there is room for everyone, just the way we are.’”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“The Pope never meant to offend or to use homophobic language, and apologises to everyone who felt offended [or] hurt by the use of a word,” Mr Bruni concluded in the Vatican statement.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Progressive supporters of the Pope have long argued that while little has tangibly changed in terms of gay rights in Catholicism, he has changed the tone of the Church’s attitude.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">When asked about gay people early in his papacy, he hit the headlines by responding, “Who am I to judge?”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He recently created consternation among Catholic traditionalists by saying priests should be able to bless same-sex couples in some circumstances and has frequently talked of gay people being welcome in the Church.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Spanish-speaking defenders of the Pope point out that he sometimes makes mistakes in Italian colloquialisms, and suggest that he did not appreciate the level of offence he might have caused, even though he did grow up in an Italian-speaking household in Argentina.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But the head of the LGBT Catholic rights group DignityUSA, Marianne Duddy-Burke, called the reported comments "shocking and hurtful", especially to gay priests who have served "God's people faithfully and well".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Unfortunately, even if intended as a joke, the Pope's comment reveals the depth of anti-gay bias and institutional discrimination that still exist in our church," she told Reuters news agency.</p></div></div>

"This [plan] relieves the U.S. of some of its organizational burden while still maintaining full oversight," she said.</p>    
  <p>Stoltenberg has proposed a $107 billion, five-year package of military aid for Ukraine that would give the broader alliance a more direct role in funding, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/nato-ministers-mull-100-billion-euro-military-fund-ukraine-2024-04-02/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters reported</a> last month.</p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/28/af33eab5-27fa-494c-a8cc-241fe9ca1bab/thumbnail/620x445g2/6fc8f17eded5a2dee303932eacbe0785/gettyimages-1229490604.jpg?v=c5044be0004eac09882c007ac02fef6d#" alt="File:The Best Of U.S. President Donald Trump " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/28/af33eab5-27fa-494c-a8cc-241fe9ca1bab/thumbnail/620x445g2/6fc8f17eded5a2dee303932eacbe0785/gettyimages-1229490604.jpg?v=c5044be0004eac09882c007ac02fef6d 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/28/af33eab5-27fa-494c-a8cc-241fe9ca1bab/thumbnail/1240x890g2/2d29d2d1d967271834a7d3a04b1931ac/gettyimages-1229490604.jpg?v=c5044be0004eac09882c007ac02fef6d 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20445'%2F%3E"></span>

<p>Trump's first term as president demonstrated that the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-mississippi-alabama-primary-results-biden-trump/#:~:text=President%20Biden%20and%20former%20President,to%20clinch%20the%20GOP%20nomination." rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">2024 presumptive Republican nominee</a> is unafraid to upend the NATO alliance. Trump shocked America's allies with his <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-nato-past-comments/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">open criticism</a></span> of the failure of some NATO members to meet defense funding commitments, and the Trump campaign has said that calling on allies to increase their defense spending is a policy that a future Trump White House would aggressively pursue.</p><p>In an emailed statement, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that "President Trump got our allies to increase their NATO spending by demanding they pay up, but Crooked Joe Biden went back to letting them take advantage of the American taxpayer."</p><p>"When President Trump returns to the Oval Office, he will restore peace and rebuild American strength and deterrence on the world stage," Leavitt said.</p><p>Lungescu said that the strategy proposed by Stoltenberg would address Trump's complaint that NATO allies aren't doing enough to share the economic burden. At the same time, Stoltenberg is trying to protect Ukraine from the kind of severe <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-ukraine-israel-foreign-aid-package/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">delays in Congress</a></span> — mostly driven by House Republicans — that halted U.S. aid and weapons funding for the first half of the year. NATO allies are also increasing their own individual defense spending, Lungescu told CBS News, although she also pointed out that American presidents dating back to Eisenhower have criticized NATO partners for not contributing enough.</p>

    </p>
<p>NATO guidelines say member states should commit a minimum of 2% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to defense spending to continue to ensure the Alliance's military readiness.</p><p>By NATO's own admission, in terms of GDP, the wealth of its members "nearly equals that of the U.S." But "non-U.S. Allies together spend less than half of what the United States spends on defense," according to <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">NATO's website</a>.</p><p>As of 2023, only 10 of the 30 other NATO allies had met the 2% spending commitment, excluding the U.S., though two-thirds of the NATO allies are expected to meet the target by the end of the year. </p><p>"I think by the time we get to the Washington NATO summit in July, we will have updated figures and will be in an even better position in terms of significantly increased defense spending," Lungescu predicted. </p><h2><strong>Trump vows to not protect NATO allies who don't raise their spending</strong></h2><p>In February, former President Trump said at a campaign rally in South Carolina that he'd encourage Russia to "do whatever the hell they want" to NATO allies who don't pay their fair share into the Western military alliance.</p><p>Referring to a conversation with an unnamed leader of an NATO country who asked him, "If we don't pay, are you still going to protect us," Trump said he replied, "Absolutely not." </p><p>Since Trump left office in Jan. 2021, his former national security adviser, John Bolton, has said the former president had been close to withdrawing the U.S.from NATO at the end of a 2018 summit and said another Trump term presents an existential threat to the trans-Atlantic alliance.</p>

<p>"Many [NATO] countries owe us a tremendous amount of money… The United States has paid and stepped up like nobody," Trump said at a July 2018 NATO gathering, adding that "something has to be done." </p><h2><strong>Will Trump withdraw U.S. from NATO? </strong></h2><p>"I think Trump will cause significant damage in a second term, damage that in some cases will be irreparable," Bolton wrote in his 2020 memoir, "The Room Where It Happened." He said he believes Trump intends to pull America out of the alliance if reelected.</p><p>"I think he fully intends to do that," Bolton wrote. "I think that would be a catastrophic decision for America and a whole host of other things. It's a very grim prospect to see Trump in for a second term."</p><p>"I think that actually the biggest danger he [Trump] is for NATO is his unpredictability," Ben Hodges, a former commanding general of the U.S. Army in Europe, told CBS News. "The urgency of defense investment is even greater if Trump turns out to be not as dependable as every other American president has been."</p><p>Hodges said that a way to ensure that NATO allies maintain smooth diplomatic relations with any incoming Trump administration would be for America's allies to honor their commitments and increase their defense spending now.</p><p>But he's skeptical that Mr. Trump would move to withdraw the U.S. from NATO, pointing to a law passed in Congress last year that prohibits the president from withdrawing from NATO or using any appropriated funds for that purpose without approval from lawmakers.</p><h2><strong>War game simulates NATO collapse in a second Trump term </strong></h2><p>A recent war game run by Finley Grimble, a former intelligence analyst for the U.K. Ministry of Defense, found that in the event of a second Trump presidency, the alliance would be vulnerable to collapse, even if the U.S. doesn't  withdraw from NATO.</p>

    </p>
<p>Grimble's war game ran a scenario in which Trump wins the election. The new administration immediately attempts to unilaterally broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. The talks break down and Trump then slashes foreign aid to Ukraine.</p><p>In the absence of having the congressional majority needed to formally withdraw the U.S. from the NATO treaty, the Trump White House then significantly reduces U.S. participation in NATO exercises, including moving 50% of America's military presence in Europe, to the Indo-Pacific region.</p><p>Grimble told CBS News that his analysis showed such a scenario would leave NATO a "hollowed out, unprepared shell" by pursuing a policy of NATO "dormancy."</p><p>In Grimble's war game, Trump takes advantage of NATO's command structure in which the supreme allied commander of NATO forces in Europe is always a U.S. officer and is responsible for the overall command of NATO military operations.</p><p>"NATO has these war-fighting plans that are ready to roll out… but the supreme allied commander in Europe would answer to Donald Trump," Grimble told CBS News.</p><p>"You tell [the NATO supreme allied commander] to stop cooperating, to stop enacting the plans, and the whole thing falls apart. And that's what Trump did in the game," he said.</p>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday sentenced former FTX executive Ryan Salame to more than seven years in prison, the first of the lieutenants of failed cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried to receive jail time for their roles in <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ftx-bankruptcy-binance-timeline-c519d50b9059aa8bff0ce8b6cd26c40e">the 2022 collapse</a></span> of the cryptocurrency exchange. </p><p>Salame, 30, was a high-ranking executive at FTX for most of the exchange’s existence and, up until its collapse, was the co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets. He pleaded guilty last year to illegally making unlawful U.S. campaign contributions and to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. </p><p>The sentence of 7 1/2 years in prison, plus three years of supervised release, was more than the five to seven years prosecutors had asked Judge Lewis A. Kaplan to impose on Salame in their pre-sentencing memo.</p><p>While Salame was a high-level executive at FTX, he was not a major part of the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-cryptocurrency-sentencing-sbf-d7bb1a5e94b4c22039d74dfeab1a2ff1">government’s case</a></span> against Bankman-Fried at his trial earlier this year and did not testify against him. In a bid for leniency, Salame said during the sentencing hearing that he cooperated and even provided documents that aided prosecutors in their cross examination of Bankman-Fried, as well as in his own prosecution.</p>
    

<p>Along with helping Bankman-Fried hide the holes in FTX’s balance sheet that ultimately led to the exchange’s failure, Salame was used as a conduit for Bankman-Fried to make illegal campaign contributions to help shape U.S. policy on cryptocurrencies. On the surface, Bankman-Fried mostly gave political contributions to Democrats and liberal-leaning causes, while Salame gave contributions to Republicans and right-leaning causes. </p>
    
<p>But ultimately the funds that Salame used for those contributions came from Bankman-Fried. </p>



<p>Kaplan said Salame “knew precisely what he was doing … and the whole idea was to hide it from the world. Astonishing!”</p><p>The judge also chastised Salame for pulling $5 million in cryptocurrencies out of FTX as the exchange was failing. </p>
    

<p>“You tried to withdraw tens of millions more,” Kaplan said. “It was me first. I’m getting in the lifeboat first. To heck with all those customers.”</p><p>Salame apologized to FTX customers and his family, saying that he and others had good intentions, though he added: “I fully understand that the means I sought to achieve these goals were illegal.”</p><p>Before he was sentenced, Salame gave brief remarks saying he was “beginning my path to redemption.”</p><p>“I accept what’s next,” he said.</p><p>Three other high-level executives at FTX are awaiting sentencing for their roles in the exchange’s collapse: Caroline Ellison, who was CEO of the FTX hedge fund Alameda Research, Gary Wang, the co-founder of FTX, and Nishad Singh, FTX’s head of engineering. All three cooperated with prosecutors and testified at trial against Bankman-Fried in exchange for potentially suspended prison sentences. </p><h2>_____</h2><p>Associated Press writer Larry Neumeister in New York contributed to this report.</p>
