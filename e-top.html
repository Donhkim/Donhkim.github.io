State TV said what it called a “hard landing” happened near Jolfa, a city on the border with the nation of Azerbaijan, some 600 kilometers (375 miles) northwest of the Iranian capital, Tehran. Later, state TV put it farther east near the village of Uzi, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/helicopter-iran-raisi-crash-azerbaijan-3ef9fe5772fb06f6d9dcc371b115923f">but details remained contradictory. </a></span></p>




    

<p>Traveling with Raisi were Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, the governor of Iran’s East Azerbaijan province and other officials and bodyguards, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. One local government official used the word “crash,” but others referred to either a “hard landing” or an “incident.” </p>
    
<p>Neither IRNA nor state TV offered any information on Raisi’s condition in the hours afterward. </p><p>Early Monday morning, Turkish authorities released what they described as drone footage showing what appeared to be a fire in the wilderness that they “suspected to be wreckage of helicopter.” Iranian rescuers rushed to the site, state TV reported. The coordinates listed in the footage put the fire some 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of the Azerbaijan-Iranian border. </p>
    

<p>Hard-liners urged the public to pray for him. State TV aired images of hundreds of the faithful, some with their hands outstretched in supplication, praying at Imam Reza Shrine in the city of Mashhad, one of Shiite Islam’s holiest sites, as well as in Qom and other locations across the country. State television’s main channel aired the prayers nonstop.</p><p>In Tehran, a group of men kneeling on the side of the street clasped strands of prayer beads and watched a video of Raisi praying, some of them visibly weeping.</p><p>“If anything happens to him we’ll be heartbroken,” said one of the men, Mehdi Seyedi. ”May the prayers work and may he return to the arms of the nation safe and sound.”</p><p>In comments aired on state TV, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi said: “The esteemed president and company were on their way back aboard some helicopters and one of the helicopters was forced to make a hard landing due to the bad weather and fog.” </p><p>“Various rescue teams are on their way to the region but because of the poor weather and fogginess it might take time for them to reach the helicopter.”</p><p> IRNA called the area a “forest” and the region is known to be mountainous as well. State TV aired images of SUVs racing through a wooded area and said they were being hampered by poor weather conditions, including heavy rain and wind. Rescuers could be seen walking in the fog and mist.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

<p>A rescue helicopter tried to reach the area where authorities believe Raisi’s helicopter was, but it couldn’t land due to heavy mist, emergency services spokesman Babak Yektaparast told IRNA. Late in the evening, Turkey’s defense ministry announced that it had sent an unmanned arial vehicle and was preparing to send a helicopter with night vision capabilities to join the search-and-rescue efforts.</p><p>Long after the sun set, Iranian government spokesman Ali Bahadori Jahromi acknowledged that “we are experiencing difficult and complicated conditions” in the search.</p><p>“It is the right of the people and the media to be aware of the latest news about the president’s helicopter accident, but considering the coordinates of the incident site and the weather conditions, there is ‘no’ new news whatsoever until now,” he wrote on the social platform X. “In these moments, patience, prayer and trust in relief groups are the way forward.”</p>
    

<p>Khamenei himself also urged the public to pray. </p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pressure on Netanyahu</strong>: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing pressure from his own defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and former military chief Benny Gantz to come up with a decisive strategy for ending the conflict with Hamas in Gaza.</li>
<li><strong>Divided government</strong>: The Israeli government is deeply divided on how to approach the conflict, with Netanyahu's hard-line allies pushing for a military solution and centrists like Gantz advocating for a political solution.</li>
<li><strong>No major changes expected</strong>: Despite the tensions, analysts say that Netanyahu's rivals are unlikely to bring about major changes to the government's policy on Gaza.</li>
<li><strong>Options being considered</strong>: Netanyahu is reportedly considering two options: either maintaining Israeli military control over Gaza after the conflict ends, or finding an alternative to Hamas to govern Gaza with international support.</li>
<li><strong>Gantz sets ultimatum</strong>: Benny Gantz, the former military chief and Netanyahu rival, has set a deadline of June 8 for Netanyahu to choose a path forward, threatening to quit the government if Netanyahu does not take decisive action.</li>

While their demands laid bare the divisions in Mr. Netanyahu’s wartime government, analysts said they were unlikely to bring about major change.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Both Mr. Gallant and Mr. Gantz have implicitly accused the Israeli leader in recent days of putting his political survival ahead of national security. They are demanding that Mr. Netanyahu choose between an endgame that would leave postwar Gaza under Israeli military control, as his far-right coalition partners want, or, as they suggest, have some kind of Palestinian alternative to Hamas take over with international support.</p><div class="css-1dv1kvn"><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">More broadly, they have called on him to stop appeasing his hard-line political allies at the expense of any semblance of national consensus, even as he continues to send Israeli soldiers into battle.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Mr. Gantz <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/18/world/israel-gaza-war-hamas-rafah#ron-binyamin-had-set-out-on-a-bicycle-ride-the-morning-of-oct-7" title="">set an ultimatum</a>, saying on Saturday that his National Unity party would quit the government by June 8 should Mr. Netanyahu choose “the path of the zealots” and fail to pave a strategic path forward.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">But his party’s exit alone would not loosen Mr. Netanyahu’s hold on power: The far-right and religiously ultraconservative coalition he formed after the November 2022 election would still command a majority of 64 seats in the 120-seat Parliament. Still, it would leave Mr. Netanyahu in a more precarious position, reliant on his hard-line partners and with less domestic and international legitimacy.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">“Gantz’s problem is that he can’t alone produce a war and postwar strategy, pressure Netanyahu to come up with one or create enough pressure to bring down the current Israeli government,” said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The demands presented by Mr. Gantz and Mr. Gallant come as pressure is growing in Israel for clear government decisions that will bring home the 128 hostages remaining in Gaza, of whom an unknown number are already dead, and also dismantle Hamas’s military capabilities and ability to lead in Gaza.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Those goals may be mutually exclusive, analysts say, since Hamas is demanding an Israeli commitment to end the war as a condition for any hostage deal.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Some critics saw Mr. Gantz’s move as too hesitant, calling into question his credentials as an electable alternative to Mr. Netanyahu.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">“A three-week ultimatum? That’s ridiculous!” said Mitchell Barak, an Israeli pollster and analyst who worked as an aide to Mr. Netanyahu in the 1990s.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Between now and June 8, Mr. Barak said, any number of things could happen in Israeli politics, in Gaza and elsewhere. “It makes him look not serious,” he added.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Mr. Gantz left the parliamentary opposition in October out of a sense of national responsibility, he said at the time, and joined the war cabinet as one of its three principal members, along with Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gallant.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Mr. Gallant has demanded that Mr. Netanyahu engage in a serious discussion about who, or what, should replace Hamas in a postwar Gaza. He challenged the prime minister to state clearly whether or not he supports his far-right partners’ agenda of Israeli military rule in the enclave and said last week that he had tried to advance a plan for a “non-hostile Palestinian governing alternative” to Hamas, without elaborating.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Some analysts also said that Mr. Gantz’s demands were largely amorphous and that his own suggestions lacked clarity.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Mr. Gantz called for the hostages to be brought home, for Hamas control to end and for the Gaza Strip to be disarmed — without saying how to achieve those goals.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Even as he called for a day-after strategy for Gaza, Mr. Gantz went along with Mr. Netanyahu in saying that the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, should not take over Gaza — flouting the position of the United States, Israel’s most important international ally.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Instead, Mr. Gantz called more vaguely for a U.S.-European-Arab-Palestinian administration that would run civilian affairs in Gaza and “lay the foundations for a future alternative that is neither Hamas nor Abbas.”</p><div class="live-blog-post-signed-bylines css-j3uhc5"><p class="css-e9nh73 e1jsehar1"><span class="byline-prefix">— </span><span class="css-1baulvz last-byline" itemprop="name"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner" class="css-n8ff4n e1jsehar0">Isabel Kershner</a></span> reporting from Jerusalem</p></div></div><button class="css-182hr0m" data-testid="Show-More" type="button" aria-hidden="true">Show more</button></div></div>

<ol>
<li>Donald Trump, the former US President, appeared to freeze for over 30 seconds during a speech at the National Rifle Association's annual meeting in Dallas, Texas.</li>
<li>Trump's speech was delayed by over two hours, causing supporters of President Joe Biden to quickly seize on the moment and claim that Trump's age and mental fitness are a concern.</li>
<li>In the speech, Trump praised the state of Texas and its founders, saying that the country was founded by cowboys, cattle drivers, and pioneers who worked hard to build a great nation.</li>
<li>Trump's pause was met with music playing in the background, and at one point, he shook his head before continuing his speech, in which he criticized the current state of the country, saying it is in decline and has high inflation, bank failures, and soaring interest rates.</li>
<li>Social media commentators, including the account @BidensWins, pounced on the moment, sharing a clip of Trump's pause and claiming that he is "senile" and unfit for office.</li>

<p>Netanyahu, who is opposed to Palestinian statehood, has rejected those proposals, saying Israel will maintain open-ended security control over Gaza and partner with local Palestinians unaffiliated with Hamas or the Western-backed Palestinian Authority.</p><p>Gantz' withdrawal would not bring down Netanyahu's coalition government, but it would leave him more reliant on far-right allies who support the "voluntary emigration" of Palestinians from Gaza, full military occupation and the rebuilding of Jewish settlements there.</p><p>Even as the discussions of postwar planning take on new weight, the war is still raging with no end in sight. In recent weeks, Hamas has regrouped in parts of northern Gaza that were heavily bombed in the early days of the war and where Israeli ground troops had already operated.</p><p>The airstrike in Nuseirat, a built-up Palestinian refugee camp in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, killed at least 27 people, including 10 women and seven children, according to records at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, which received the bodies. The hospital had said in an initial statement to AFP that it "received 20 fatalities and several wounded after an Israeli air strike targeted a house belonging to the Hasan family in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza." The Civil Defense in Gaza later said 31 bodies were recovered after a bombing in the Nuseirat camp at dawn.</p>

Footage released by the rescuers showed them trying to pull the body of a woman out of the rubble as explosions echo in the background and smoke rises.</p><p>In the urban Jabliya refugee camp nearby, residents reported a heavy wave of artillery and airstrikes. </p><p>"The situation is very difficult," said Abdel-Kareem Radwan, a 48-year-old in Jabaliya. He said the whole eastern side has become a battle zone where the Israeli fighter jets "strike anything that moves."</p><p>Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for the Civil Defense, said rescuers had recovered at least 150 bodies, more than half of them women and children, since Israel launched the operation in Jabaliya last week. He said around 300 homes have been "completely destroyed."</p><p>Israel launched its offensive after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which Palestinian militants stormed into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting some 250.</p>

<p>The war has killed at least 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Around 80% of the population of 2.3 million Palestinians have been displaced within the territory, often multiple times.</p><p>Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames the high death toll and destruction on Hamas, which positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in dense, residential areas. </p><p>Netanyahu's critics, including thousands of protesters who took to the streets again on Saturday, accused him of prolonging the war and rejecting a cease-fire deal that would release hostages so he can avoid a reckoning over the security failures that led to the attack.</p><p>Polls show that Gantz, a political centrist, would likely succeed Netanyahu if early elections are held. That would expose Netanyahu to prosecution on longstanding corruption allegations.</p><p>Netanyahu denies any political motives and says the offensive must continue until Hamas is dismantled and the estimated 100 hostages held in Gaza, and the remains of more than 30 others, are returned. He has said it's pointless to discuss postwar arrangements while Hamas is still fighting because the militants have threatened anyone who cooperates with Israel.</p><p>Netanyahu also faces pressure from Israel's closest ally, the United States, which has provided crucial military aid and diplomatic cover for the offensive while expressing growing frustration with Israel's conduct of the war. </p><p>President Joe Biden's administration recently held up a shipment of 3,500 bombs of up to 2,000 pounds each and said the U.S. would not provide offensive weapons for a full-scale invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, citing fears of a humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

    </p>
<p>But last week, after Israel launched what it says is a limited operation in Rafah, the administration told legislators it would move forward with the sale of $1 billion worth of arms, tank ammunition, tactical vehicles and mortar rounds, according to congressional aides. </p><p>Sullivan is expected in Israel after meeting with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Saturday. The administration has been working on an ambitious plan in which Saudi Arabia would recognize Israel and join other Arab states in helping to administer and rebuild Gaza, in exchange for a U.S. defense pact and help in building a civilian nuclear program.</p><p>But U.S. and Saudi officials say that deal requires Israel to agree to a credible path to eventual Palestinian statehood, something Netanyahu has repeatedly ruled out.</p><p>In Gantz' ultimatum, he expressed support for normalizing ties with Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries. But he also said "we will not allow any outside power, friendly or hostile, to impose a Palestinian state on us."</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>President Biden announces increase in tariffs on Chinese imports</strong>: President Biden has announced a sharp increase in tariffs on various Chinese imports, including electric vehicles, semiconductors, solar panels, and advanced batteries, as part of his administration's effort to protect American industries from Chinese competition.</li>
<li><strong>About-face for Biden</strong>: This move is a reversal for Biden, who in 2019 criticized Trump's tariffs as being paid by the American people, not China. Biden had previously pledged to remove some of Trump's tariffs, but is now endorsing maintaining tariffs on over $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.</li>
<li><strong>Trump's reaction</strong>: Trump has criticized Biden's decision, saying that China is "eating our lunch" and that the tariffs should be imposed on many more products. Trump also proposed a 10% tariff on all imported goods from all countries to help lower the US trade deficit, which Biden has criticized as being harmful to families.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on consumers</strong>: The article highlights the potential impact on consumers, with Trump's plan to impose tariffs on all imported goods estimated to drive up costs by an average of $1,500 per year, while Biden's tariffs may also increase the cost of certain imported goods.</li>
<li><strong>Criticism of policy</strong>: The article notes that there is criticism of the policy from those who see the tariffs as a form of protectionism, which may not be the most effective way to achieve the administration's goals of promoting American industries and reducing the US trade deficit.</li>

    [Music] well well well President Biden moving full steam ahead with policies that he used to vociferously criticize on Tuesday the president announced a sharp increase in tariffs on a variety of Chinese Imports including electric vehicles semiconductors solar panels and advanced batteries it's part of the administration's broader effort to protect American Industries from competitors in China now Biden wrote on x quote China is determined to dominate these industries I'm determined to ensure that America leads the world in them but this is what Biden said in 2019 after former president Donald Trump increased tariffs up to 25% on many Chinese goods and other foreign Goods as well quote Trump doesn't get the basics he thinks his tariffs are being paid by China any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying his tariffs the cashiers at Target see what's going on they know more about economics than Trump Biden had previous ly pledged to remove some of Trump's tariffs but now he's officially endorsing maintaining tariffs on over $300 billion worth of Chinese Goods put in place by Trump back in 2018 and 2019 now taking them even further this is how Trump reacted to Biden's change of tune electric vehicles that Biden is pushing down everybody's throat even though people don't want them he wants to put a uh big tariff on China which is a suggestion that I said where have you been for 3 and A2 years they should had done it a long time ago but they've also got to do it on other vehicles and they have to do it on a lot of other products because China's eating our lunch right now and they went away from what I was doing they're eating our lunch so they have to do it on much more than electric vehicles and they have to get going fast but it should have been done 3 and A2 years ago I did it I started in his afternoon speech President Biden made sure to hit back at Trump's broader approach calling out out Trump's proposal to impose a 10% tariff on all imported goods from all countries to help lower the US trade deficit instead China Imports from America barely budged and now Trump and his magga Republicans want to cross the board tariffs on All Imports from all countries if reelected well that would drive up cost for families on an average of $1,500 per year each year it simply doesn't get it if Trump's elected he also plans to impose a tariff on up to of up to 60% on all Chinese Imports and 100% tariff on all cars manufactured outside of the US so it does seem like there's two parts of this one is the question of Biden's hypocrisy saying one thing when Biden when Trump was proposing the policy and another thing now and the second is what actually is the most advantageous policy here for the two goals one getting Americans uh access to Affordable EV and then to the kind of background or maybe foreground environmental interest in doing so right which I'm seeing a lot of uh criticism of this policy which as you just pointed out is a continuation is a policy both presidents have uh have supported uh uh doing these tariffs which you know prevent people from from getting access to the Chinese electric vehicles and then also probably presumably end up making us electric vehicles more expensive because if the makers here don't have to compete or you're making the ones the the foreign ones more expensive than they could raise their their prices um look I think two things are being a little bit conflated here like Biden was frankly right the first time that very basic economics lessons are skeptical of tariffs as a good idea because they they end up making things more expensive raising prices making it harder for consumers to get Goods now so the economic case I would say is very weak now there's a different and separate like national security case being made that you know China is pernicious for a variety of reasons and we need to compete with them but we should not so people have to make that case say well this is why we have to do something about China not like you know try to smuggle that into oh like this would be better for like the electric vehicle Market well is it better for the people buying the electric vehicles here not really so I I think a better argument or like at least I saw Josh Barrow who writes about economics saying this why if China is the problem well then what is the US doing to to support or or have better TR trade relations with you know other countries that could make or Supply these products that we have you know that we have good relations what what are we doing to to to build up to to Foster um th that kind of trade rather than just saying China bad and going down this pathway sure I mean one big question is why is it that America is so uncompetitive when it comes to making electric vehicles one argument is that the American car market has decided to only create luxury EVS so americ EES are out here costing about $30,000 minimum and upward from that astronomically whereas China is managing to make these $110,000 SUVs largely because they have not focused on the luxury Market the way that American manufacturers have they focused on a much more cost affordable vehicle now why is that do we need to have a tariff system to encourage American manufacturers to provide EVS for the average car consumer um as opposed to just making Lexus uh electric vehicles is the only way to do that by uh diminishing uh the ability for China to import cars here or does the fact that CH Chinese EVS become more available create the very incentive that we want for American manufacturers to finally make a cards cars that are affordable for most Americans right I would think the latter which is why this is a a I think a very troubling policy and you know and then it's just not the electric vehicles it's um semiconductors and everything else and again I understand the the appeal of having more of industrial production in the US but you know that if you look at like you know the chips act which everybody was so excited about if you look at are are like factories actually being built here um you're finding out no you're finding out that even with the tremendous subsidies to do it companies are deciding it's not profitable enough in America so I have this like I guess Middle Ground view that okay I understand the problems with China but does does that mean everything has to be built here when it's you can't make it happen if it's just way too expensive so are there other countries that we have better relationships with where they could similarly have you know cheap production situations going on that are you know beneficial to there to emerging economies and and so on and not have it be China okay fine but we we obviously can't just do it all here well this is difficult because it is true that for Americans to really get the cost benefit of how inexpensive Chinese uh uh EVS are they would have to be manufactured in North America but this is where we get back to some of the inconsistency not just by Joe Biden but by Donald Trump trump said that if China were to start to try to build car manufacturing plants in Mexico he would put enormous tariffs on any cars imported that were Chinese made from Mexico so it really does seem like both candidates here are putting American consumers in the position where they basically cannot buy a an electric vehicle more hypocrisy from Biden because he's claims to care about the environment and claims to care about this just green transition um but instead the only option I cannot stress this enough the middle tier luxury EVS in the United States are priced at $50,000 they're just not accessible to most people yeah and so many political figures we we've heard from uh you know Pete Budaj and uh um Jennifer granholm the uh the energy or Commerce Secretary one of one of she's one of those position she was formerly my governor of Michigan so in my heart that's always the role she has talking about yeah just get like that's the solution all higher gas prices get an electric vehicle um well Biden's making it harder to get an electric vehicle because you got to really get the affordable ones from China you know and every time a politician on either party proposes a tariff I mean fundamentally what it is is I want to buy something they're willing to sell it to me and you the government are coming in saying we would like to make this purchase more expensive and and I do get caring about the domestic uh car manufacturer Market but again why have they artificially constrained what they've chosen to adopt for the American Consumer seems very muddled U more Rising right after this [Music] oh
