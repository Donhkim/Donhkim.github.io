            The 8-1 decision in one of the court’s most closely watched cases limited the scope of a blockbuster ruling the justices handed down just two years ago that prompted a flood of legal challenges to other gun laws across the nation.
    </p>

            The decision, which placed most of the court’s conservatives and liberals on the same side, could help shore up similar federal gun regulations that have been challenged since the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/politics/supreme-court-guns-second-amendment-new-york-bruen/index.html">Supreme Court vastly expanded gun rights</a> in 2022, at least in situations where a criminal defendant is considered dangerous. That court’s 2022 ruling caused substantial confusion for lower court judges reviewing Second Amendment lawsuits.

            Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, said the court had “no trouble” coalescing around the idea that an individual who poses a threat can be denied access to weapons.

            The chief justice pushed back on the idea that its decision two years ago in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf" target="_blank">New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</a> had hemmed locked lower courts into striking down any gun law that didn’t have a direct historic analogue.

            “The court’s ruling today leaves intact a specific federal criminal prohibition on gun possession by those subject to domestic violence-related restraining orders,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

            “But there are dozens of other federal and state gun regulations that have been challenged since the court’s 2022 ruling in the Bruen case. The harder cases, like whether Congress can prohibit all felons, or all drug offenders, from possessing firearms, are still to come.”

            Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the majority opinion in Bruen, authored a lone dissent on Friday.

            “The court and government do not point to a single historical law revoking a citizen’s Second Amendment right based on possible interpersonal violence,” Thomas wrote. “Yet, in the interest of ensuring the Government can regulate one subset of society, today’s decision puts at risk the Second Amendment rights of many more.”
    </p>

            At issue in the case was a 1994 law that bars people who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders from possessing guns. A Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was convicted for violating that law following a series of shootings, including one in which police said he fired into the air at a Whataburger restaurant after a friend’s credit card was declined.

            Rahimi’s lawyers claimed that the Supreme Court’s blockbuster decision two years ago meant that the law on domestic violence orders could not be squared with the Constitution. A 6-3 majority in Bruen, in the opinion by Thomas, ruled that gun regulations must be “consistent with this nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”
    </p>

            The defense attorneys argued that the founding generation never responded to domestic violence by banning the possession of weapons and, because of that, the government couldn’t do so now. The New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals embraced that argument, concluding that a gun ban for people involved in domestic disputes was an “outlier that our ancestors would never have accepted.”
    </p>

            But the Biden administration and domestic violence victims groups noted there were founding-era laws that prohibited dangerous Americans from possessing guns. In other words, they said, when viewed more generally, there were laws that could meet the court’s new history-based test.

            “The Supreme Court’s narrow opinion offers no endorsement of red flag laws or of the dozens of other unconstitutional laws that the NRA is challenging across the country that burden the right of peaceable Americans to keep and bear arms,” Kozuch said in a statement. “This decision holds only that an individual who poses a clear threat of violence may be temporarily disarmed after a judicial finding of dangerousness.”

That may be in part because a series of related legal challenges are already queued up for the court, including a question of whether non-violent felons can be denied access to firearms.

            In one sense, by upholding the law, the decision was a win for prosecutors in that matter. But the majority also avoided weighing into a legal debate over whether other federal gun prohibitions – such as for non-violence felons – would also be upheld.

<ol>
<li>President Joe Biden is beginning an intense period of private preparations at Camp David ahead of the first 2024 presidential debate with Republican rival Donald Trump on June 27.</li>
<li>Biden's team is aware that he cannot afford to have an underwhelming performance in the debate, as Trump is expected to attack Biden's physical and mental strength, his record on the economy and immigration, and even his family.</li>
<li>Trump, meanwhile, will stay on the campaign trail before heading to his Florida estate for two days of private meetings as part of his informal debate prep process. His allies expect him to be tested on his plans for governing and his responses to pointed questions about his focus on election fraud and other issues.</li>
<li>The June 27 debate will be a historic event, with the two presumptive nominees meeting on the debate stage so early in the general election season and at such advanced ages, with widespread questions about their readiness.</li>
<li>The debate will also be notable due to the criminal charges against Trump, who is scheduled to go on trial later this year on charges related to his role in the January 6th Capitol riot.</li>

            </div>
        </div><p>The ground rules for the June 27 debate, the first of two scheduled meetings, are unusual.</p><p>The candidates agreed to meet at a CNN studio in Atlanta with no audience. Each candidate’s microphone will be muted, except when it’s his turn to speak. No props or prewritten notes will be allowed onstage. The candidates will be given only a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water.</p>
    

<p>There will be no opening statements. A coin flip determined Biden would stand at the podium to the viewer’s right, while Trump would deliver the final closing statement. </p><p>The next debate won’t be until September. Any stumbles June 27 will be hard to erase or replace quickly. </p><p>Biden arrived at Camp David on Thursday night and is expected to hunker down with senior campaign aides until the debate. While traveling to the mountainside retreat, he gave a thumbs up to reporters when asked how debate prep was going. </p><p>The president’s aides have been reluctant to share details about his preparations, run by former chief of staff Ron Klain. But they’ve signaled he’s preparing to be aggressive and wouldn’t shy away from using the term “convicted felon” to describe his opponent. </p><p>One adviser not authorized to speak publicly about debate strategy noted Biden has been increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the debate. That’s still while trying to project himself as “the wise and steady leader” in contrast with Trump, the adviser said. </p>
    

<p>Among some political operatives, there’s the sense Biden may have more to lose given his struggle to generate momentum amid signs of weakness within his political coalition. Trump and his allies have set an extraordinarily low bar, however, by suggesting for months Biden is contending with serious physical limitations that make it difficult for him to stand for 90 minutes or string together two sentences. </p><p>“It’s like the mirror test. Put a mirror under Biden’s nose, and if it fogs it up, he wins, right? That’s about what the threshold is for Biden,” Republican strategist and Trump ally David Urban said with a laugh. “Can Biden demonstrate that he’s mentally nimble? That’s the big question.”</p><p>Yet Trump sought to shift expectations in a Thursday interview with the “The All-In Podcast” in which he veered sharply away from his typical Biden taunts. He said Biden “destroyed” vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan in their 2012 debate.</p>
    

<p>“I assume he’s going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater,” Trump said of Biden. “I don’t want to underestimate him.” </p><p>Biden’s aides have dismissed concerns about his age and mental readiness. They’re fighting against what they allege is deceptive editing of video clips to suggest he’s confused.</p><p>But while some Democrats project confidence, Biden’s allies also say he has spent much of the last two weeks traveling — in Europe and on the West Coast — limiting his ability to prepare. Others note incumbent presidents typically struggle in the season’s opening general election debate. </p><p>Messina made both points even as he sought to play up the political stakes for Trump. He suggested Trump was taking an unnecessary political risk by debating Biden.</p>
    

<p>“I wouldn’t have done the debate if I was him,” Messina said of Trump. The strategist added, “Why would you want to give him this air? He decided he wanted to do this to knock him out, and if he doesn’t, then I think he’s in real trouble.”</p><h2>TRUMP PROJECTING CONFIDENCE</h2><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

        </div><p>Trump’s team sees the faceoff as an opportunity to demonstrate a clear contrast with Biden’s leadership ability and governing record.</p><p>And while downplaying his preparations, Trump aides have a pattern of insisting he doesn’t prepare for debates when, in fact, he does — in his own way. Instead of mock debates with lecterns and stand-ins or hours spent poring over policy books, the ex-president is expected to rely on a series of conversations about policy and strategy with aides and political allies. </p><p>Trump will also make public appearances over the coming days. </p><p>On Saturday, he’s set to host a rally in Philadelphia and deliver a keynote address to a conference of Christian conservatives in Washington. He also has a fundraiser in New Orleans on Monday before going to his Florida estate for meetings.</p><p>“Biden needs rehearsals with handlers to find some way to explain this mess he’s made of our nation,” Trump spokesman Brian Hughes said. “President Trump is always prepared to present to Americans his record of success and Biden’s weakness and failures.”</p><p>Biden’s camp is aware Trump will likely focus on his son Hunter, as the then-president did on the debate stage four years ago.

Republicans have also criticized Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings when Joe Biden was vice president.</p><p>Biden’s allies are also concerned, however, their famously combative rival might be on good behavior. </p><p>“For both campaigns, the goal here is reaching an audience of moderate, independent, swing voters in swing states who will, in many ways, be the deciding factor in this election,” said former Biden administration official Bill Russo.</p><p>“Trump has kind of a golden opportunity here. If he can pretend that he’s a reasonable human being for 90 minutes while he’s in the spotlight, he’s got a lot to gain,” Russo added. “The real key here is which Trump shows up.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Michelle L.

<p></p><p>The gag order, issued in March, prohibited Trump from making or directing others to make public statements about witnesses, jurors and others connected to the case. It does not restrict comments about the judge, Juan M. Merchan, or Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office prosecuted the case.</p>



<p></p><p>Attorneys for Trump have called on the judge to lift the order following the culmination of his trial last month, which ended in his conviction on 34 felony counts for falsifying records to cover up a potential sex scandal. Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing, is set to be sentenced on July 11.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Ryan Watson, an American tourist from Oklahoma, was sentenced to 13 weeks in prison and a $2,000 fine for possessing ammunition at a airport in the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watson was arrested on April 12 and was out on bail for several weeks as his case moved through the legal system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The judge in the case took into account exceptional circumstances and deemed a lengthy sentence would be arbitrary, resulting in a suspended sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watson's spokesperson, Jonathan Franks, tweeted that the family would be leaving the Turks and Caicos Islands and returning to Oklahoma City that night, implying that the case was finally resolved.</p>
</li>

<p>The possession of ammunition was reportedly found in Watson's carry-on bag during a flight to the British territory.</p>

<p>A Clark County judge has dismissed the charges filed against the six Nevada Republicans who submitted an invalid slate of electoral votes for former President Donald Trump in 2020 on the grounds that the county was not the appropriate jurisdiction for the case. </p>
<p>At a Friday morning hearing in Clark County District Court, Judge Mary Kay Holthus said she was unconvinced by state prosecutors’ arguments that Clark County was the appropriate county to hear the case. The electors’ attorneys had argued a more appropriate venue would be in Carson City, where the false signing ceremony took place, or in Douglas County, where the fake elector documents were originally mailed from. </p>
<p>Clark County is more Democratic, meaning a jury could be less favorable to the Republican defendants.</p>
<p>“You have literally, in my opinion, a crime that has occurred in another jurisdiction,” Holthus said. “It’s so appropriately up north and so appropriately not here.”</p>
<p>Immediately after the ruling, Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said the “judge got it wrong” and that his office will appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. </p><div id="om-pnfjqoeyuyx4qaxmpisa-holder" class="oim-campaign noprint"><div class="rowlett-campaign Campaign CampaignType--inline" id="om-pnfjqoeyuyx4qaxmpisa"><div id="om-pnfjqoeyuyx4qaxmpisa-optin" class="rowlett-c-canvas Campaign__canvas"><div class="rowlett-c-wrapper Campaign__innerWrapper"><div class="StyledBackgroundWrapper__BackgroundWrapper-sc-4136c0-0 jRrmck rowlett-c-alpha Campaign__alphaLayer"><div class="StyledBackgroundWrapper__BackgroundWrapper-sc-4136c0-0 brbwAg rowlett-c-bravo Campaign__bravoLayer"><div class="rowlett-c-content Campaign__content"><div class="Row__StyledRow-sc-3p43ya-0 gWmuIY rowlett-row rowlett-row-1 Row om-row"><div class="rowlett-row-content Row__content"><div class="StyledBackgroundWrapper__BackgroundWrapper-sc-4136c0-0 hVluvJ rowlett-row-inner"><div class="rowlett-column rowlett-col-1 Column om-column"><div class="rowlett-col-content Column__content"><div class="StyledBackgroundWrapper__BackgroundWrapper-sc-4136c0-0 hVluvJ rowlett-col-inner"><div class="rowlett-element rowlett-ele-1 Element om-element"><div class="rowlett-ele-content Element__content"><div class="rowlett-te-wrapper rowlett-TextElement--wrapper " id="rowlett-TextElement--wrapper--zxB5I5aB3fHV3kGjT3UK"><div class="rowlett-te-content rowlett-TextElement--content"><p><span><span>Catch up on the latest Nevada news with our weekday newsletter</span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p id="om-pnfjqoeyuyx4qaxmpisa-CustomJS"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="rowlett-campaign Campaign CampaignType--inline" id="om-pnfjqoeyuyx4qaxmpisa"><div id="om-pnfjqoeyuyx4qaxmpisa-optin" class="rowlett-c-canvas Campaign__canvas"><div class="rowlett-c-wrapper Campaign__innerWrapper"><div class="StyledBackgroundWrapper__BackgroundWrapper-sc-4136c0-0 jRrmck rowlett-c-alpha Campaign__alphaLayer"><div class="StyledBackgroundWrapper__BackgroundWrapper-sc-4136c0-0 brbwAg rowlett-c-bravo Campaign__bravoLayer"><div class="rowlett-c-content Campaign__content"><div class="Row__StyledRow-sc-3p43ya-0 gWmuIY rowlett-row rowlett-row-1 Row om-row"><div class="rowlett-row-content Row__content"><div class="StyledBackgroundWrapper__BackgroundWrapper-sc-4136c0-0 hVluvJ rowlett-row-inner"><div class="rowlett-column rowlett-col-1 Column om-column"><div class="rowlett-col-content Column__content"><div class="StyledBackgroundWrapper__BackgroundWrapper-sc-4136c0-0 hVluvJ rowlett-col-inner"><div class="rowlett-element rowlett-ele-1 Element om-element"><div class="rowlett-ele-content Element__content"><div class="rowlett-te-wrapper rowlett-TextElement--wrapper " id="rowlett-TextElement--wrapper--zxB5I5aB3fHV3kGjT3UK"><div class="rowlett-te-content rowlett-TextElement--content"><p><span><span>Catch up on the latest Nevada news with our weekday newsletter</span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p id="om-pnfjqoeyuyx4qaxmpisa-CustomJS"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>The state is unable to re-file the case up north because a three-year statute of limitations expired in December.</p>
<p>Maggie McLetchie, a lawyer for one of the defendants, said of the state: “They’re done.”</p>
<p>The ruling marks the first time that a case related to the Trump campaign’s efforts to submit a false slate of electors has been dismissed. Similar prosecutions are taking place in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/us/politics/trump-trial-fake-electors-cases.html">four other swing states</a> —  Michigan, Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin — involved in the Trump campaign’s effort to submit a false slate of electors after he lost the 2020 election to President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The six defendants — Nevada GOP Chairman Michael McDonald, Republican National Committeeman Jim DeGraffenreid, Clark County GOP Chairman Jesse Law, state party Vice Chair Jim Hindle, Shawn Meehan and Eileen Rice — were each <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-gop-fake-electors-indicted-for-falsely-claiming-trump-won-states-2020-election">indicted</a> on two counts by a grand jury in December over their role in submitting fake election documents to federal and state election authorities that purported to cast Nevada’s six electoral votes for Trump.</p>
<p>Lawyers with the Nevada Attorney General’s Office had filed the charges in Clark County and argued that it was an appropriate venue for the case. Two defendants conspired and drafted key documents while they were still in Clark County, they alleged, and fraudulent electoral documents were mailed to a federal judge in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Attorney Richard Wright, who is representing McDonald, said the motion to dismiss the case was supported by a 2021 Nevada Supreme Court <a href="https://nvcourts.gov/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/40143/137_Nevada_Reports_pages_599-650.pdf">ruling</a> involving murders committed in Washoe and Douglas counties. The high court ruled at the time that if a location was only  involved in preparatory acts and the formation of intent, it is an insufficient venue for a trial.</p>
<p>In addition, Wright argued that the fraudulent documents were erroneously sent to Miranda Du, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court of Nevada, in Las Vegas despite Du being based in Reno, according to testimony from the court clerk, which Wright said was withheld from the grand jury.</p>
<p>“It temporarily made a pit stop in Las Vegas,” Wright said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Matthew Rashbrook, a lawyer with the attorney general’s office, argued that there is no single county that could have complete jurisdiction over the case, to which Holthus responded by saying she disagreed with “100 percent.”</p>

<li><strong>Trump's campaign has a large war chest</strong>: The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee reported having more than $170 million in the bank at the end of May, although Biden's campaign questioned whether Trump's campaign is using some of this money to cover his legal fees.</li>

At the same time, billionaire Timothy Mellon donated a stunning $50 million to a pro-Trump super PAC the day after Trump’s guilty verdict, according to the filings.</p>
    

<p>Overall, Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee reported more than $170 million in the bank at the end of May, although Biden’s campaign questioned whether the groups were devoting resources to cover Trump’s legal fees.</p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know about the 2024 Election Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020.

<p>“Our strong and consistent fundraising program grew by millions of people in May, a clear sign of strong and growing enthusiasm for the president and vice president every single month,” said Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez. “The money we continue to raise matters, and it’s helping the campaign build out an operation that invests in reaching and winning the voters who will decide this election –- a stark contrast to Trump’s PR stunts and photo-ops that he’s pretending is a campaign.”</p>
    
<p>Taken together, the numbers detailed in the campaigns’ latest Federal Election Commission filings suggest Democrats may still maintain a cash advantage in the 2024 presidential contest. But almost four months before Election Day, Trump’s side is closing the gap — if it isn’t closed already.</p>
    

<p>The new fundraising figures also underscore the extent to which the rules of presidential politics are being rewritten in the Trump era. </p><p>At almost any other time in U.S. history, a presidential candidate would have been forced to leave an election after being convicted of dozens of felonies. But in 2024, Trump’s guilty verdict has instead fueled a massive fundraising surge that puts his team in a position to ramp up advertising and swing- state infrastructure just as voters begin paying closer attention to the election.</p><p>Backed by Mellon’s massive donation, the pro-Trump super PAC known as MAGA Inc. on Thursday reserved $3.5 million in television advertising set to begin July 3 across Georgia and Pennsylvania, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Overall, the group reported a $68.8 million haul for May, ending the month with $93.7 million in the bank. </p>




    

<p>Mellon has been among the biggest donors to Trump and independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., although his support for Kennedy may be fading. </p><p>Kennedy raised $2.6 million last month and finished May with $6.4 million in the bank. The vast majority of his fundraising total came from running mate Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley lawyer. The Kennedy campaign spent more than it raised for the month. </p><p>The numbers reported Thursday did not include anything raised in June, including roughly $40 million raised by Biden and his top surrogates in recent days. The vast majority came from a glitzy fundraiser last Saturday with movie stars and former President Barack Obama in Los Angeles that raised more than $30 million. First lady Jill Biden also has been on her own personal fundraising swing that has brought in $1.5 million.</p><p>Meanwhile, Biden also got a big boost from Bloomberg. </p><p>The billionaire philanthropist, who briefly ran for president as a Democrat in 2020, sent $19 million to the pro-Biden group Future Forward in addition to sending the legal maximum of $929,600 to the Biden Victory Fund, according to a person familiar with the transfers. </p>
    

<p>Bloomberg also formally endorsed Biden on Thursday. “I stood with Joe Biden in 2020, and I am proud to do so again,” Bloomberg said in a statement. </p><p>The Biden campaign said the vast majority of its latest fundraising came from grassroots donors such as nurses, teachers and retirees. Overall, the Biden campaign and Democratic National Committee attracted more than 3 million new donors last month, according to a statement from the campaign.</p><p>“While Trump is leeching off his billionaire sycophants, our campaign represents the voices of America, and we’re honored to have their support as we race toward November,” Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>AP writers Seung Min Kim in Washington and Jill Colvin in New York contributed. </p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>China's stance</strong>: Despite a new defense pact between Russia and North Korea, China has not commented on the deal and has only made boilerplate statements about seeking peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns for China</strong>: Experts say China is likely worried about a potential loss of influence over North Korea after the Russia-North Korea partnership, which could increase instability on the Korean Peninsula and reduce China's role in regional affairs.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity of China's position</strong>: China has conflicting goals, as it wants to keep peace in the Koreas while also countering the US and its Western allies on the global stage. This makes it difficult for China to find a suitable response to the Russia-North Korea partnership.</li>
<li><strong>Weak Chinese response</strong>: The Chinese response to the new defense pact has been "very weak", according to Victor Cha, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. This could indicate that Beijing is still trying to figure out how to respond to the development.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic implications</strong>: The Russia-North Korea partnership has significant strategic implications, including the potential for increased Russian influence in North Korea and a shift in the balance of power in the region, which could be viewed by China as a threat to its own interests.</li>

<p>The Chinese response has been “very weak,” said Victor Cha, senior vice president for Asia and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, adding that it could be a sign that Beijing doesn’t yet know what to do.</p>



<p>“Every option is a bad option,” he said. “You’re either unable to make a decision because of very strongly held competing views or ... you’re just incapable of making a decision because you just don’t know how to evaluate the situation.”</p>
    
<p>Some in Beijing may welcome the Russia-North Korea partnership as a way of pushing back at America’s dominance in world affairs, but Cha said that “there is also a great deal of discomfort” in China, which doesn’t want to lose its sway over its neighbor to Russia, doesn’t want to see a destabilizing nuclear power on its doorstep, and doesn’t want to bring the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">conflict in Europe</a></span> to Asia.</p>
    

<p>But China isn’t raising these concerns publicly. “They don’t want to push Kim Jong Un further into the arms of Vladimir Putin,” Cha said, referring to the leaders of the two countries.</p><p>Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, declined to comment on the new agreement. “The cooperation between Russia and the DPRK is a matter between two sovereign states. We do not have information on the relevant matter,” he said, referring to North Korea by the initials for its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. </p><p>John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, told reporters that the pact between Russia and North Korea “should be of concern to any country that believes that the U.N. Security Council resolutions ought to be abided by.” The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea to try to stop its development of nuclear weapons.</p><p>Kirby also said the agreement “should be of concern to anybody who thinks that supporting the people of Ukraine is an important thing to do. And we would think that that concern would be shared by the People’s Republic of China.” </p>
    

<p>One area that China could be concerned about is whether Russia will help North Korea’s weapons program by sharing advanced technology, said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.</p><p>“If China is indeed concerned, it has leverage in both Russia and North Korea and it could probably try to put some limitations to that relationship,” he said.</p><p>The meeting between Putin and Kim this week was the latest chapter in decades of complicated political and military relationships in East Asia, where the Chinese Communist Party, once an underdog, has emerged as a leading power that wields influence over both North Korea and Russia. </p><p>That and other developments have raised alarms in the U.S. that Beijing, now the world’s second-largest economy, could challenge the U.S.-led world order by aligning itself with countries such as Russia, North Korea and Iran. Beijing has rejected that allegation.</p><p>Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, said Beijing doesn’t want to form a three-way alliance with North Korea and Russia, because it “needs to keep its options open.”</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth="">

<p>Such a coalition could mean a new Cold War, something Beijing says it is determined to avoid, and locking itself to Pyongyang and Moscow would be contrary to China’s goals of maintaining relationships with Europe and improving ties with Japan and South Korea, she said.</p><p>Sun added that the rapprochement between North Korea and Moscow “opens up possibilities and potentials of uncertainty, but based on what has happened so far, I don’t think that China’s national interests have been undercut by this.”</p><p>Closer ties between Putin and Kim could weaken Beijing’s sway and leave it as the “biggest loser,” said Danny Russel, who was the top U.S. diplomat for Asia in the Obama administration.</p>
    

<p>“Apart from irritation over Putin’s intrusion into what most Chinese consider their sphere of influence, the real cost to China is that Russia’s embrace gives North Korea greater impunity and room to maneuver without consideration to Beijing’s interests,” he said.</p><p>Russel, now vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said that Kim is eager to reduce his country’s dependence on China.</p><p>“The dilution of Chinese leverage means Kim Jong Un can disregard Beijing’s calls for restraint,” he said, “and that is much more likely to create chaos at a time when (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping desperately wants stability.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Tang reported from Washington.

<ol>
<li><strong>Control transferred to Settlements Administration</strong>: The Israeli army's Civil Administration has handed more control over the occupied West Bank to the Settlements Administration, led by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in an illegal settlement.</li>
<li><strong>Smotrich's goals</strong>: Smotrich has pushed for more Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law, as a step towards annexation.</li>

    <div><div class="wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content css-ibbk12" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"><p>About a month ago, a quiet transfer happened.</p>
<p>The Israeli army’s Civil Administration handed more control over the occupied West Bank to the Settlements Administration, led by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who <a href="/news/2023/3/1/israel-arrests-settlers-after-anti-palestinian-pogrom">lives in an illegal settlement himself</a>.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 3 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>Now Smotrich and his Settlements Administration control more things, like building regulations and the management of farmland, parks and forests.</p>
<p>Since he entered government, Smotrich has pushed openly for more Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank – illegal under international law – as steps towards annexation.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean?</p>

<h2 id="what-s-the-settlements-administration">What’s the Settlements Administration?</h2>
<p>It was set up back in February 2023, after lots of political wrangling between Smotrich – who is also a minister within the Ministry of Defense – and Yoav Gallant, the defence minister.</p>
<p>There were a lot of details, but the upshot is that the responsibility for monitoring illegal construction in the occupied West Bank came under Smotrich.</p>
<p>Meaning that illegal settlement or outpost construction would be ignored and eventually approved, while Palestinian construction would be subject to intense scrutiny over permits, and often demolished.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-smotrich-swing-that">How did Smotrich swing that?</h2>
<p>Smotrich and his fellow member of the extreme right, Itamar Ben-Gvir, head a coalition of hard right and ultra-Orthodox parties that have propped up the rule of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Using that far-right heft, Smotrich negotiated to essentially take control of Israeli expansion into occupied land.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>So what changed this May 29?</p>
<p>The army’s handover on May 29 means pages of bylaws will now be enforced by the Settlements Administration, making illegal settlement expansion even easier.</p>

<h2 id="did-israel-already-control-the-occupied-west-bank">Did Israel already control the occupied West Bank?</h2>
<p>Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967, as well as Gaza and East Jerusalem – the longest military occupation in modern history.</p>
<p>But, even occupation has rules.</p>
<p>According to international law, the occupying power cannot move its citizens into occupied land. Israel’s Supreme Court confirmed this in 2005.</p>
<p>That did not stop Israelis from <a href="/news/2023/7/14/israel-sets-record-for-illegal-settlement-approvals-rights-group">building illegal settlements on stolen land</a>. And it did not stop Israeli settlers – supported by security forces sometimes – from <a href="/news/2024/4/15/we-are-on-the-edge-palestinians-terrified-by-israeli-settler-violence">attacking Palestinians to force them off even more land</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-many-palestinians-live-in-the-west-bank">How many Palestinians live in the West Bank?</h2>
<p>According to the US government, three million people.</p>
<p>In many cases, families have lived in the same house or on the same farm for centuries.</p>
<p>Traditional farming is a source of pride and identity, with generations dedicating themselves to tending ancestral olive groves and fruit orchards. Some Palestinian tribes are shepherds, traditionally roaming across their lands so their flocks can graze.</p>
<p>But settler attacks have focused on farmers and shepherds, who tend to live in small, peaceful communities that make easy pickings for armed settlers with the police as their backup.</p>
<p>This pushed many Palestinians to move to towns, working unskilled jobs like construction.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-going-to-happen-to-them-now">What’s going to happen to them now?</h2>
<p>Life will likely get even harder.</p>
<p>On top of sweeping arrest campaigns being stepped up in the occupied West Bank since Israel launched its brutal war on Gaza on October 7, the number of settler attacks to scare families off their land has exploded too.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>More than 500 Palestinians have been killed in attacks in the occupied West Bank.</p>
<p>Restrictions on movement have increased as Israel increased both <a href="https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2018/commuting-through-israeli-checkpoints/index.html">fixed and mobile checkpoints</a> and settlers have started setting up their own random roadblocks.</p>
<p>This means Palestinians have a much harder time getting to work or keeping their businesses running. Or seeing family, or going for a picnic. Anything, really.</p>
<p>Add to that the increased leniency Smotrich’s Administration is likely to show illegal settlement expansion and the crackdown on any Palestinian construction, the outlook is bleak.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2557296" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2557296" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2557296" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/INTERACTIVE-UN-LIST-ILLEGAL-SETTLEMENTS-DEC14-2023-1702556698.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C770&amp;quality=80" alt="INTERACTIVE -UN-LIST-ILLEGAL-SETTLEMENTS-DEC14-2023-1702556698" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2557296" class="wp-caption-text">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="is-this-it-annexation">Is this it? Annexation?</h2>
<p>Annexing the occupied West Bank to Israel is certainly a dream for Smotrich and his close political ally, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir.</p>
<p>They see taking over managing the occupation – by essentially commandeering the Civil Administration – as a major step towards that ambition.</p>

            The vessel is estimated to be from the 13th or 14th century BCE, the authority said in a statement. It was discovered 90 kilometers (around 56 miles) from the shore, in waters 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles) deep, with hundreds of intact jars still on board, the statement added.

"That's what I'm afraid of."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">But despite the continuous attacks, its people try to keep ordinary life going.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"People just have a normal life knowing that every day, somewhere bombs will hit and maybe kill them, maybe not," Kachanov said. "So this is life in Kharkiv."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Kachanov and his team have been responding to Russian strikes for more than two years. They tackle blazes and rescue survivors from the rubble, in a relentless battle that intensified again over the last two months.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"I think me and a lot of other Ukrainians who are still here, who are still in Kharkiv, if we will be thinking negative, it will make our condition even worse," Kachanov said. "I'm trying to stay positive."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Kachanov decided to send his wife and daughter abroad for safety after the full-scale invasion, and they have remained there since.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"A lot of us separated from their families, a lot of divorces, a lot of everything,” Kachanov said. "So that’s hard. Emotionally hard. Not emotionally hard because of war, because of dead, injured people. Even [we got] used to this one. Yeah. Sometimes you have some stuff in your head. Maybe you need to speak with the guys with a beer.

Firefighters also say Russian troops frequently target sites a second time once first responders arrive, a tactic known as the "double tap.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Last month, Kachanov suffered a concussion after an explosion in a structure where he was fighting to control a fire caused by a Russian strike. He said he has also been at fires dozens of times in the past year that have been hit by a second Russian strike.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The attacks frequently disrupt the work of teachers, trainers, and other essential workers. Adapting to them often means having to move life underground. Last month, Kharkiv opened its first purpose-built underground school, located 16 feet below ground. For the kids here, it means they can attend in-person classes for the first time in more than two years.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"We started in distance learning for two years, and now our children can just sit at the desk, they can speak to each other, you can see that they are smiling, they are happy to be here, and they feel safe here," Olga Grigorash, a teacher at the school, said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Local volunteer groups have also stepped in to provide humanitarian assistance, and helping with the evacuation of civilians from towns and villages closer to the frontline. Maria Zaitseva, the founder of the charity, Unbreakable Kharkiv, distributes humanitarian aid and helps evacuate people from combat areas.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Last month, Zaitseva decided to evacuate her own children to Germany.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"This summer I decided that it would be safer for my children to stay with my parents during the holidays," Zaitseva said. "Because Kharkiv is being destroyed. Hits on civilian targets, shopping centers, residential areas. It is very dangerous."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Amid fears of a Russian breakthrough, the Biden administration in June agreed to begin allowing Ukraine to use American weapons to strike back across the border inside Russia.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">That has let Ukraine push Russian missile launchers farther away from Kharkiv, and in the past week the bombing in Kharkiv has notably eased, residents said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN">"Things in Kharkiv are quieter," Zaitseva said. "A lot quieter since our international partners allowed Ukraine to hit inside Russia. And we have results -- in Kharkiv it's better. It would be even better if we were allowed to strike at Russian aircraft."</p></div></div>

That led to an outage that continued to impact many of their operations on Friday.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">For prospective car buyers, that may mean delays at dealerships or vehicle orders written up by hand, with no immediate end in sight. Here's what you need to know.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">CDK Global is a major player in the auto sales industry. The company, based just outside of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, provides software technology to dealers that helps with day-today operations — like facilitating vehicle sales, financing, insurance and repairs.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">CDK serves more than 15,000 retail locations across North America, according to the company. Whether all of these locations were impacted by this week's cyberattacks was not immediately clear.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">CDK is “actively investigating a cyber incident” and the company shut down all of its systems out of an abundance of caution, spokesperson Lisa Finney said Wednesday. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">CDK “executed extensive testing," consulted third-party experts, and restored its core DMS and Digital Retailing solutions by the afternoon, Finney said in a prepared statement. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">CDK experienced another "cyber incident” Wednesday evening, Finney said in a update the following day. “We remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible,” she said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">When that will be is still unknown. As of Friday morning, a recorded message from CDK on a hotline detailing updates for its customers said “we do not have an estimated time frame for resolution — and therefore our dealer systems will not be available, likely for several days.” Customer care support channels also remain unavailable, it said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The message added that the company was aware of “bad actors” posing as members or affiliates of CDK to try to obtain system access by contacting customers. It urged employers to be cautious of any attempted phishing.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Several major auto companies — including Stellantis, Ford and BMW — confirmed to The Associated Press Friday that the CDK outage had impacted some of their dealers, but that sales operations continue.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In light of the ongoing situation, a spokesperson for Stellantis said that many dealerships had switched to manual processes to serve customers. That includes writing up orders by hand. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">A Ford spokesperson said that the outage may cause “some delays and inconveniences at some dealers and for some customers.” However, many Ford and Lincoln customers are still getting sales and service support through alternative routes being used at dealerships. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">With many details of the cyberattacks still unclear, customer privacy is also at top of mind — especially with little known about what information may have been compromised this week.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In a statement sent to the AP on Friday, Mike Stanton, president and CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association said that “dealers are very committed to protecting their customer information and are actively seeking information from CDK to determine the nature and scope of the cyber incident so they can respond appropriately."</p></div></div>
