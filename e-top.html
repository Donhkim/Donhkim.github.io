<ol>
<li>The US Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, has announced plans to push for a warning label on social media platforms, advising parents that using social media may damage adolescents' mental health.</li>
<li>The warning label would be similar to those used on tobacco and alcohol products, but would require approval from Congress to implement.</li>
<li>This proposal builds on previous warnings from the Surgeon General, including a May 2023 advisory recommending that parents set limits on phone use and urging Congress to develop health and safety standards for technology platforms.</li>
<li>The Surgeon General's proposal is aimed at raising awareness about the potential negative impacts of social media use on adolescent mental health.</li>
<li>The proposal highlights the growing concern about the impact of social media on young people's mental health, and the potential need for increased regulation and oversight of technology platforms.</li>

                                        <p>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dissolved the influential war Cabinet that has overseen the fighting in Gaza, a government spokesperson said Monday, days after <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-gaza-netanyahu-gantz-48a4a60ccccdb7f74b4bf7816f9a7c67">a key member of the body bolted</a></span> from the government over frustration with the Israeli leader’s handling of the war.</p><p>The move was widely expected following the departure of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-gantz-netanyahu-war-hamas-hostages-b24508eea7f8b85b146427368c98b034">Benny Gantz</a></span>, a centrist former military chief.

<p>The war Cabinet was formed in the early days of the war, when Gantz, then an opposition party leader and Netanyahu rival, joined the coalition in a show of unity following the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas. He demanded that a small decision-making body steer the war, in a bid to sideline far-right members of Netanyahu’s government. It was made up of three members — Gantz, Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.</p><p>The <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-war-cabinet-hamas-netanyahu-b50f7fe8913b06aaba377ae6b37c3fed">move to scrap the war Cabinet</a></span> comes as Israel faces more pivotal decisions.</p>
    
<p>Israel and Hamas are weighing the latest proposal for a cease-fire in exchange for the release of hostages taken by Hamas during its attack. Israeli troops are still bogged down in the Gaza Strip, fighting in the southern city of Rafah and against pockets of Hamas resurgence elsewhere, in addition to a dramatic escalation last week on the northern border with Lebanon.</p><div class="AudioEnhancement" data-separate-event="audioModule" data-separate-value="AP AUDIO: Israeli officials say Netanyahu has dissolved the War Cabinet after key partner bolted government" data-module="" data-gtm-region="AP AUDIO: Israeli officials say Netanyahu has dissolved the War Cabinet after key partner bolted government" data-align-center="" data-module-number="3" data-main-module-number="3">

    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports on the volatile situation along the Lebanon-Israel border.</p>
    
</div><p>After launching hundreds of rockets and drones toward Israel in some of the most intense barrages in the conflict, Hezbollah sharply reduced the number of projectiles fired toward northern Israel on Sunday and Monday.</p>
    

<p>The lull continued even after Israeli military officials said they killed a key operative in Hezbollah’s rocket and missile department, Mohammed Ayoub, in a drone attack on Monday morning. The Israeli military said it tracked just two missiles fired Monday from Lebanon, and they did not enter Israeli territory. In the past 48 hours, there were just six launches, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-mideast-latest-06-12-2024-847f2f13670cf2fa8a92180de9c2c36b">down from more than 200</a></span> on Thursday.</p><p>The lull could be due to the Muslim feast of Eid al-Adha that began Sunday morning, as well as a visit from Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden. Hochstein is in Israel to discuss the volatile situation along the Lebanon-Israel border. He is scheduled to be in Beirut on Tuesday.</p><p>The U.S. has been trying to ease tensions along the frontier, and Hochstein made several trips to the region in recent months. Hezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted, and daily exchanges of fire have been commonplace since then. In recent weeks, the exchanges have intensified, with fires breaking out on both sides of the border.</p>
    

<p>Netanyahu has played a balancing act throughout the war, weighing pressure from Israel’s top ally, the U.S., and growing global opposition to the fighting, as well as from his government partners, chief among them Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir.</p><p>Both have threatened to topple the government should Israel move ahead on a cease-fire deal. The latest proposal is part of the Biden administration’s most concentrated push to help wind down the war. For now, progress on a deal appears to be stalled.</p><p>Critics say Netanyahu’s wartime decision-making has been influenced by the ultra-nationalists in his government and by his desire to remain in power. Netanyahu denies the accusations and says he has the country’s best interests in mind.</p><p>Gantz’s departure, while not posing a direct threat to Netanyahu’s rule, rocked Israeli politics at a sensitive time. The <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-gantz-netanyahu-gaza-war-5174c723b53747229cc43b254f1768a7">popular former military chief</a></span> was seen as a statesman who boosted Israel’s credibility with its international partners at a time when Israel finds itself at its most isolated. Gantz is now an opposition party leader in parliament.</p>
    

<p>Gantz’s decision also prompted another resignation. Former army chief and fellow party member Gadi Eisenkot left the war Cabinet, where he had observer status.</p><p>Netanyahu’s government is Israel’s most religious and nationalist ever. In Israel’s fractious parliamentary system, Netanyahu relies on a group of small parties to help keep his government afloat. Without the support of Gantz’s party, Netanyahu is expected to be more beholden to far-right allies.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is monitoring two systems in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico that have a chance to develop into tropical depressions or storms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One system, located several hundred miles east of the Bahamas, is forecast to approach the coast of the southeastern United States on Thursday or Friday, and may bring heavy rainfall to Florida.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NHC gives this system a 10% chance of developing in the next two days and a 30% chance of developing in the next seven days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A second system in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico has a higher chance of development and could threaten the US this week as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NHC gives this system a higher probability of development, but details on its potential trajectory and impact are still being determined.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Largest state-issued pardons in US history</strong>: Maryland Governor Wes Moore issued over 175,000 pardons for misdemeanor cannabis possession and use convictions, making it one of the largest state-issued pardons in United States history.</li>
<li><strong>Cannabis legalization in Maryland</strong>: The pardons were issued after Maryland voters overwhelmingly approved the legalization of recreational cannabis use for adults in the 2022 general election. Cannabis officially became legalized in the state on July 1, 2023.</li>
<li><strong>Goal to address systemic injustices</strong>: Governor Moore emphasized the need to address the systemic injustices associated with cannabis criminalization, stating that individuals with misdemeanor cannabis convictions continue to face barriers to employment, education, and reintegrating with their families.</li>
<li><strong>Pardons do not release incarcerated individuals</strong>: The pardons do not result in the release of currently incarcerated individuals. The pardons apply to individuals who have already completed their sentences or are no longer incarcerated.</li>
<li><strong>Goal to right historical wrongs</strong>: Governor Moore emphasized that the pardons are just a step towards addressing the historical wrongs associated with cannabis criminalization, stating that "You have to be able to right these wrongs in order for the right steps to be made."</li>

    <div><div class="body-copy mng-subscriber-content"><p>Gov. Wes Moore issued more than 175,000 pardons for misdemeanor cannabis possession and use convictions Monday morning — one of the largest state-issued pardons in United States history.</p><p>“We’ll be clear: This is just a step — this is not a conclusion,” Moore, a Democrat in his first term, said in a interview Monday morning. “You have to be able to right these wrongs in order for the right steps to be made.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2024/06/16/gov-wes-moore-to-pardon-175000-marijuana-convictions/">pardons</a> apply to over 150,000 misdemeanor convictions for cannabis possession and more than 18,000 misdemeanor convictions for use or possession with intent to use drug paraphernalia. Moore called this “the largest such action in our nation’s history” at an Annapolis news conference Monday morning.</p><p>Marylanders voted on an overwhelming margin to approve recreational use cannabis for adults during the 2022 general election. Cannabis officially became legalized in the state on <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2023/07/01/a-new-era-legalization-of-recreational-cannabis-in-maryland-to-grow-market-to-more-than-45-million-adults/">July 1, 2023.</a></p><p>“You cannot talk about the benefits of legalization if you’re not willing to deal with the consequences of criminalization,” Moore said. “For people who are walking around with misdemeanor cannabis convictions, the weight of that action for them — in some cases, which are decades old — it still continues to hinder them: their ability to get a job, their ability to go to school, their ability to start a business, their ability to reintegrate with their family members.”</p><p>Monday’s pardons will not result in the release of any currently incarcerated person from prison. The cases receiving pardons for misdemeanor use or intent to use drug paraphernalia were not tied in with convictions on other charges.</p><cnx class="cnx-main-container cnx-in-desktop cnx-ps cnx-main-container-flex" id="ad215f8fdb554e3190ab63d200fc967f"><cnx class="cnx-player-wrapper cnx-size-responsive"><cnx class="cnx-ratio"></cnx><cnx class="cnx-playspace-container cnx-in-ps-landscape cnx-bp-md-st cnx-close-hover cnx-close-float-off cnx-bp-xl-v"><cnx class="cnx-ui cnx-ui-ad cnx-is-paused cnx-mod-display-none"><cnx class="cnx-ui-ad-content "><cnx class="cnx-ad-marker" role="img" aria-label="Ad"><cnx class="cnx-marker-cnt-first"><cnx class="cnx-marker-cnt-second"><cnx class="cnx-ad-marker-svg"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 32 22"><path d="M26,22H0V0H31.93L32,16A6,6,0,0,1,26,22Z"></path><path d="M12,5.29h0L16.45,16.7H14.83l-1.06-2.85H8.86l-1,2.85H6.21L10.6,5.31h0Zm5.89,11.42V5.29h3.63A5.52,5.52,0,0,1,26.65,11a5.33,5.33,0,0,1-4.93,5.7H17.89Zm1.46-1.36h2.17c1.77,0,3.7-1.49,3.7-4.35s-1.93-4.28-3.7-4.28H19.35Zm-8-8.16-2,5.24h3.86Z"></path></svg>

pre-trial maintain their right to vote. Those convicted of a felony offense are eligible to register to vote after serving a court-ordered prison sentence.</p><p>Officials from the Moore administration were unclear Monday morning exactly how many people will be affected, because some individuals will be pardoned for multiple convictions.</p><p>People with these convictions can see if they received a pardon by visiting kiosks at any state courthouse or the Maryland Judiciary Case Search website, which will reflect those pardons in about two weeks. Those who are eligible but did not receive pardons can apply for them through the regular application process, which can be found on the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services website.</p><p>At least a quarter of these pardons will apply to convictions in Baltimore City. Marylanders of color, particularly the Black community, have been disproportionately represented among these convictions.</p><p>Pardons, which can only be issued by the governor, still allow for the display convictions on an individual’s record. To have a pardoned conviction removed from a record, people must file for expungement in the court where the case was concluded.</p><p><a name="pd_a_13920140"></a></p><noscript></noscript><p></p><p>Moore said that the pardons were “a hard-fought victory,” not just for those who will receive them, “but for the soul of our state.”</p><p>Moore signed Monday’s executive order issuing the pardons with the Last Prisoner Project’s “Pen to Right History,” which has been used by the loved ones of people impacted by cannabis convictions across the country to write to their elected officials asking for justice.</p><p>“Undoing decades of harm cannot happen in a day, but we’re going to keep up the work, we’re going to keep up the pace and were going to do it together. This is about recognizing our collective, shared humanity,” he said. “This is about how changing how both government and society view those who have been walled-off from opportunity because of broken and uneven policies.”</p><p>According to the U.S. Department Of Justice Office of the Pardon Attorney, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, issued a proclamation in October 2022 that resulted in pardons for a slew of people convicted of simple cannabis possession at the federal level. He expanded that proclamation late last year to include attempted cannabis possession and some offenses under Washington, D.C., code.</p><p>Moore said that the sweeping pardons demonstrate to governors in other states that they have the power to address decades of wrongs independent of the federal government, and that Maryland is “unafraid to lead.”</p><p>According to the ACLU of Maryland, 71% of the state’s prison population is constituted of Black men — the highest percentage among states across the country and more than twice the national average.</p><p>Moore, the state’s first Black governor, said at the pardon signing ceremony held two days before Juneteenth that Black Marylanders were three times more likely to be arrested for cannabis-related charges than white Marylanders before legalization.</p><p>In a statement, Del. Jheanelle Wilkins, a Montgomery County Democrat and the chair of Maryland’s Legislative Black Caucus, celebrated Moore’s historic order, while still recognizing the work that needs to be done in partnership with the General Assembly to “reduce the long-term impact of criminal convictions.”</p><p>Those with criminal convictions for cannabis possession face barriers to housing and educational and employment opportunities.</p><p>Attorney General Anthony Brown said “the enforcement of cannabis laws has not been colorblind,” noting that, though Black, Latino and white Marylanders use cannabis at the same rate, Black and Latino users face higher rates of arrests and convictions.</p><p>“The shackles of slavery, though removed, left an indelible mark on our state, on our nation,” Brown, a Democrat and Maryland’s first Black attorney general, said.</p><p>He pointed to post-reconstruction-era Jim Crow laws, the convict leasing system, the war on drugs and the disproportionate arrests and convictions as “the residuals of slavery.”</p><p>“This morning, I can almost hear the clanging of those shackles falling to the floor,” Brown said.</p><p></p>

Eisenhower may be one of the oldest aircraft carriers in the U.S. Navy, but it's still fighting — despite repeated false claims by Yemen's Houthi rebels.</p><p class="speakable">The Houthis and online accounts supporting them have repeatedly alleged they hit or even sank the carrier in the Red Sea as it leads the U.S. response to the rebels' ongoing attacks targeting both commercial vessels and warships in the crucial waterway.</p><p>That's put its leader, Capt. Christopher "Chowdah" Hill, and his social media profile directly in what has become an increasingly bizarre internet front line as the campaign goes on. And while he shrugs off his posts, they represent the new level of information warfare the Navy is having to fight as it faces its <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-navy-faces-most-intense-combat-since-wwii-against-yemens-iran-backed-houthi-rebels-officials-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most intense combat since World War II</a> and tries to keep the morale of the nearly 5,000 personnel aboard the Eisenhower high and munitions ready as their deployment stretches on.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russian-warships-near-florida-aim-intimidate-navy-views-them-more-like-target-practice" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RUSSIAN WARSHIPS NEAR FLORIDA AIM TO INTIMIDATE. OUR NAVY VIEWS THEM MORE LIKE TARGET PRACTICE</strong></a></p><p>"I think it’s been about two or three times in the past six months we’ve allegedly been sunk, which we have not been," Hill told The Associated Press during a recent visit to the carrier. "It is almost comical at this point. They’re attempting to maybe inspire themselves through misinformation, but it doesn’t work on us."</p><p>The visit by two AP journalists and others to the Eisenhower represents part of the effort the Navy has made to try to counter the Houthi claims. While on board for about a day and a half, journalists escorted by sailors crisscrossed the nuclear-powered ship's 1,092-foot length. AP journalists also repeatedly circled the Eisenhower from the air in a Seahawk helicopter.</p><p>Other than rust on its side from the hot, humid Red Sea air and water apparently leaking from a pipe in a dining room, the ship appeared no worse for wear. Its flight deck bore no blast damage or gaping holes, just the stink of jet fuel, pooled puddles of oily water and the scream of engines before its F/A-18 fighter jets took flight.</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>The USS aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower sails in the Red Sea on June 12, 2024. </span> <span>(AP Photo/Bernat Armangue)</span></p></div></div></div><p>The other half of the information warfare effort has been Hill himself, a native of Quincy, Massachusetts, something noticeable immediately in his South Boston accent. While even the secretive leader of the Houthis, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, has name-dropped the carrier in speeches while making false claims about the vessel, Hill has offered ceaselessly positive messages online about his sailors on board.</p><p>Videos of flight operations from the bridge and images of sailors eating cookies in the captain's chair are constant staple. After one false Houthi claim, Hill responded by posting images of cinnamon rolls and muffins in the bakery on board the Eisenhower — a subtle jab at the claims.</p><p>"The whole intent of the social media outreach was to connect with families, to bring them closer to the ship," Hill said. "So if I can post pictures of sons and daughters, husbands and wives out here, or even fathers and mothers, get it out there, it just kind of brings the family closer to us. And again, that’s our support network. But it also took on another role because everyone else was watching to see what we’re doing."</p><p>Then there's the "Star Wars" memes and images of Captain Demo, the Labrador-golden retriever mix who roams the ship as a support animal for sailors. And as far as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/ship-hit-twice-apparent-houthi-cruise-missile-attack-yemeni-coast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Houthi forces</a> watching his postings, Hill takes special pleasure in writing about "Taco Tuesday" on the ship.</p><p>"We’re going to celebrate ‘Taco Tuesdays’ because it’s my absolute favorite day of the week. That will never end," the captain said. "If you call that an information warfare campaign, you can. It’s just who I am, you know, at the end of the day."</p><p>But morale remains a deep concern for Hill and other leaders on board the ship. The Eisenhower and its allied ships have gotten just one short port call during the eight-month rotation so far to Greece. The carrier also has been the most-deployed carrier among the entire U.S. fleet over the last five years, according to an analysis by the U.S. Naval Institute's news service.</p><p>One sailor, Lt. Joseph Hirl from Raleigh, North Carolina, wore a patch reading: "Go Navy, Beat Houthis." While that's a play on the classic call for the annual Army-Navy football game, the naval flight officer stressed that he knew the combat was deadly serious.</p><p>"It’s pretty much the day-in, day-out stress of knowing that we are being shot at definitely gives a realism to the whole experience that this is not a normal deployment," Hirl said.</p><p>Meanwhile, munitions also remain a concern. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro told the U.S. Senate's Armed Services Committee in May the Navy had spent at least $1 billion in armaments to fight in the Red Sea. Every leader on board the Eisenhower that the AP spoke to acknowledged <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/navy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Navy</a> was trying to use the right weapon against the Houthis, whose asymmetrical warfare sees them use far cheaper munitions.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p><p>"My sailors, my ships are priceless — that’s not a calculus I want a captain to have," said Capt. David Wroe, the commodore overseeing the guided missile destroyers escorting the Eisenhower. "Now, using the appropriate effect weapon system on the appropriate threat to preserve magazine depth, to have more missiles, is certainly a germane tactical question."</p><p>For now, the Eisenhower continues its patrol along with the USS Philippine Sea, a cruiser, and two destroyers, the USS Gravely and the USS Mason. It's been extended twice already and there's always the chance it could happen again. But Hill said his sailors remained ready to fight and he remained ready to continue to captain in his style.</p><p>"I came to a revelation at some point in my career that, one of the things that all humans require is to be loved and valued," Hill said. "So I shouldn’t be afraid, as a leader, to try to love and value everybody, and also to expect other leaders that I’m responsible for to love and value their sailors."</p>  </div> </div>
