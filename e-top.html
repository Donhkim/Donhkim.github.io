His aides said he was in “great spirits” and doing well, and he arrived in Milwaukee Sunday evening for the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/republican-national-convention">Republican National Convention</a></span>, which begins Monday. </p><p></p><p>“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” he wrote on his social media site. “Much bleeding took place.”</p><p></p><p>In a subsequent social post Sunday, Trump said: “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win.”</p><p></p><p>The rallygoer who was killed was identified as Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief from the area, according to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who added that Comperatore “died a hero.” </p><p></p><p>“His wife shared with me that he dove on his family to protect them,” Shapiro said. The two wounded bystanders were listed in stable condition.</p><p></p><p>Biden spoke briefly with Trump and was to address the nation Sunday evening. The president said the country would continue to debate and disagree, but stressed: “We must unite as one nation to demonstrate who we are.”</p><h2>FBI investigates shooting as possible domestic terrorism</h2><p></p><p></p><h2></h2>
    
<p></p><p>The FBI identified the gunman as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the scene of the shooting. </p><p></p><p>The gunman had his father’s AR-style rifle and was perched atop a nearby roof when some rallygoers pointed him out to local law enforcement, said two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing criminal probe.</p><p></p><p>A local law enforcement officer climbed to the roof and found Crooks, who pointed the rifle at the officer. The officer retreated down the ladder, and the gunman quickly fired toward Trump, the officials said. That’s when U.S. Secret Service gunmen shot him, the officials said.</p><p></p><p>Questions abounded about how the gunman got so close in the first place. Kevin Rojek, the agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh field office, said “it is surprising” the gunman was able to open fire on the stage before the Secret Service killed him.</p><p></p><p>Bomb-making materials were found inside both Crooks’ vehicle and at his home, officials said. The FBI described the devices as “rudimentary.”</p><p></p><p>His motive remained unclear. Crooks wasn’t on the FBI’s radar, and he was believed to have acted alone. Investigators combed through his social media feeds and his home but found no immediate threatening writing or posts. His family was cooperating. Crooks’ relatives didn’t return messages seeking comment from the AP.</p>



<p></p><p>Crooks’ political leanings were not clear. Records show Crooks was registered as a Republican voter in Pennsylvania, but federal campaign finance reports also show he gave $15 to a progressive political action committee on Jan. 20, 2021, the day Biden was sworn in as president.</p><p></p><p>The absence of a clear ideological motive added to deepening questions about the shooting, denying the public any swift or tidy conclusions.</p><p></p><p>Biden urged Americans to stay patient. “Please, don’t make assumptions about his motives or his affiliations,” he said.</p><h2>Most serious assassination attempt since 1981</h2><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The attack was the most serious attempt to kill a president or presidential candidate since <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/reagan-assassination-attempt-trump-butler-gunman-bd3c038d706de55a64727f7d15dffbc8">Ronald Reagan was shot</a></span> in 1981. It drew new attention to concerns about political violence in a deeply polarized U.S. less than four months before the presidential election. </p><p></p><p>FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said agents have seen increasingly violent rhetoric online since the rally, along with people posing online as the dead shooter. He said the FBI was focused on the upcoming political conventions in Milwaukee and Chicago.</p><p></p><p>Biden on Sunday ordered a security review of operations for the Republican National Convention, which is proceeding as planned. The Secret Service said it was “confident” in the security plan, and no additional changes were planned. </p><p></p><p>Biden, who is running against Trump, said the two men had a “short but good” conversation Saturday night. Biden returned to Washington from his Delaware beach home where he met with leaders in the Situation Room about the attack. He said during <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-shooting-election-2024-704592d02c3421a767112f0bf6d25eb9">an address</a></span> Sunday afternoon that “there is no place in America for this kind of violence.”</p><p></p><p>Yet many Republicans quickly blamed the violence on Biden and his allies, arguing that sustained attacks on Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment.</p><p></p><p>It’s unclear whether Biden will be forced to recalibrate a campaign largely focused on Trump as a threat to democracy. It is a situation the U.S. has not seen since Teddy Roosevelt was shot a month before the election in 1912 while campaigning to regain the White House as a third-party candidate.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

People in the stands behind him also crouched as screams rang out. </p><p></p><p>Someone could be heard near the microphone saying, “Get down, get down, get down, get down!” as agents rushed to the stage. They piled atop Trump to shield him with their bodies as other agents took up positions on stage to search for the threat.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, voices were heard saying, “Shooter’s down” several times, before someone asked, “Are we good to move?” and “Are we clear?” Then someone ordered, “Let’s move.” </p><p></p><p>Trump got to his feet moments later and could be seen reaching with his right hand toward his face, streaked with blood. He then pumped his fist in the air and appeared to mouth the word “fight” twice, prompting cheers and chants of “USA. USA. USA.”</p><p></p><p>His motorcade left moments later. Video showed Trump turning back to the crowd and raising a fist right before he was put into a vehicle.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

Arrested and accused of drunken driving and battery, she acquired a reputation in the tabloids and entertainment press as a hard-partying Hollywood “bad girl,” with colleagues complaining of divalike behavior that culminated in acrimonious departures from her two best-known shows.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4KE4WPY5RBC23AJFGXFEZT2F44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">In childhood, she was the voice of a precocious, anthropomorphic mouse in the animated film “The Secret of NIMH” (1982) and played the ponytailed Jenny Wilder in the final season of NBC’s pioneer drama “Little House on the Prairie,” as well as in three subsequent made-for-TV movies based on the homespun series.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BNQISROXXFCWJKFKUGIVBYMRQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Her “Prairie” work led to a starring role alongside Wilford Brimley in the NBC family drama “Our House,” in which she played a spirited teenager who dreams of following her late father into the Air Force. The show ended after two seasons, and Ms. Doherty soon gained wider prominence with a supporting part in the 1988 dark comedy “Heathers,” which marked a striking change of character.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-bHCGeL-isStandardLayoutAd-true article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="cb db dn-ns" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-mobile"><div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-md mt-sm pt-sm pb-sm ad-mobile"><div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"><p class="dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md">Story continues below advertisement</p></div><p class="relative flex flex-column justify-center w-100"><wp-ad id="slug_mob_bigbox_2" class="chromatic-ignore" data-chromatic="ignore" data-slot="/701/wpni.local/obituaries" aria-hidden="true" data-renderbehavior="never" data-refresh="true" data-json='{"targeting":{"zeus_rendercount":"1","zeus_slot":"slug_mob_bigbox_2.init.dsk","kpi":"ctr","pos":"mob_bigbox_2","ctr":["zeus_mob_bigbox_2"],"wp_ad_refresh":"0","wp_refresh":"mob_bigbox_2_0","pwt":["mob_bigbox_2_mab_0"]}}'></wp-ad></p></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WAZDKDEJAVBZZLHT3KJBXFDRBY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Ms. Doherty played the conniving Heather Duke, one of several girls in a popular high school clique known as “the Heathers” who are tormented by a sociopath and his belatedly conscience-stricken accomplice, played by Christian Slater and Winona Ryder. (Ms. Doherty later appeared in a 2018 television reboot, “Heathers,” for the Paramount Network.)</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7WO273TG6RGQNCOGDY3GNL6SQM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">The film was not a commercial success, but it received strong reviews and caught the eye of television producer <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/23/AR2006062301826.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_15" target="_blank">Aaron Spelling</a>, who was moving on from the ABC hit “Dynasty” with a new series about teenage angst at the fictional West Beverly Hills High.

Stories proliferated about her partying, her abrasive treatment of colleagues, her late arrivals at work and extravagant shopping sprees.

When Brenda seemed to undergo a transformation during the show’s second season, becoming increasingly bad-tempered, fans revolted, forming an anti-Doherty fan club that received national press coverage for its “Hating Brenda” novelty record and “I Hate Brenda” bumper stickers.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PU5466R5IBHPXLPGTASCSWQ2HU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Ms. Doherty left the show in 1994 in what she called a “mutual decision” with producer Spelling. To explain her central character’s departure, the script had her decamping to London to train as an actress. She later reprised the role in several episodes of “90210,” a reboot that aired on the CW Network from 2008 to 2013, and in “BH90210,” which ran on Fox in 2019 and featured many of her original co-stars.</p></div><p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="6F3MELXHWVEDBAWYG6TC7ZGYSQ" data-apitype="header" level="3" id="6F3MELXHWVEDBAWYG6TC7ZGYSQ">Child actress</h3></p><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PDI7RYPPYBCQNHZ2VLBFFXDXEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Shannen Maria Doherty was born in Memphis on April 12, 1971.

                    <p>BUTLER, Pa. (AP) — Former President Donald Trump called for unity and resilience Sunday after an attempt on his life added fresh uncertainty to an already tumultuous presidential campaign and raised sharp questions about how a gunman was able to open fire from a rooftop near a Pennsylvania campaign rally.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trump-holds-rally-in-western-pennsylvania-days-before-the-rnc"><strong>WATCH:</strong> Rally in Butler, Pennsylvania cut short after shooter opens fire on Trump</a></p>
<p>A full day after the shooting, the gunman’s motive was still a mystery, and investigators said they believe he acted alone. President Joe Biden ordered an independent security review of the attack, which left one bystander dead and two others critically wounded. The FBI was investigating the shooting as a potential act of domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>The attack shook the firmament of the American political system, causing a reassessment and a detente — at least temporarily — of the heated 2024 presidential campaign that has grown increasingly vicious.</p>
<p>Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said the upper part of his right ear was pierced by a bullet. His aides said he was in “great spirits” and doing well, and he headed to Milwaukee to the Republican National Convention that begins Monday.</p>
<p>“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” he wrote on his social media site. “Much bleeding took place.”</p>
<p>In a subsequent social post Sunday, Trump said: “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win.”</p>

<p>The rallygoer who was killed was identified as Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief from the area, according to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who added that Comperatore “died a hero.”</p>
<p>“His wife shared with me that he dove on his family to protect them,” Shapiro said. He declined to discuss the condition of two others who were wounded.</p>
<p>Biden, meanwhile, spoke briefly with Trump and was to address the nation Sunday evening. The president said the country would continue to debate and disagree, but stressed: “We must unite as one nation to demonstrate who we are.”</p>
<h3>FBI investigates shooting as possible domestic terrorism</h3>
<p>The FBI identified the gunman as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, which is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the scene of the shooting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fbi-names-suspect-in-trump-assassination-attempt"><strong>READ MORE:</strong> The FBI named a suspect in the Trump assassination attempt. Here’s what we know</a></p>
<p>The gunman had his father’s AR-style rifle and was perched atop a nearby roof when some rallygoers pointed him out to local law enforcement, said two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing criminal probe.</p>
<p>A local law enforcement officer climbed to the roof and found Crooks, who pointed the rifle at the officer. The officer then retreated down the ladder, and the gunman quickly fired toward Trump, the officials said. That’s when U.S. Secret Service gunmen shot him, the officials said.</p>
<p>Questions abounded about how the gunman could have gotten so close in the first place. Kevin Rojek, the agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh field office, said “it is surprising” that the gunman was able to open fire on the stage before the Secret Service killed him.</p>
<p>Bomb-making materials were found inside both Crooks’ vehicle and at his home. FBI described the devices as “rudimentary.”</p>
<p>His motive remained unclear. Crooks wasn’t on the FBI’s radar, and he was believed to have acted alone. Investigators are combing through his social media feeds and his home, but so far have not found any threatening writing or posts. His family is cooperating.</p>
<p>Crooks’ political leanings were also not clear. Records show Crooks was registered as a Republican voter in Pennsylvania, but federal campaign finance reports also show he gave $15 to a progressive political action committee on Jan. 20, 2021, the day President Joe Biden was sworn in as president.</p>
<p>The absence of a clear ideological motive added to the deepening questions about the shooting, denying the public any swift or tidy conclusions about the shocking crime.</p>
<p>Biden urged Americans to stay patient. “I urge everyone — everyone, please, don’t make assumptions about his motives or his affiliations,” he said.</p>
<h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold">Most serious assassination attempt since 1981</h3>
<p>The attack was the most serious attempt to kill a president or presidential candidate since <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/a-look-at-past-presidential-assassination-attempts-in-american-history">Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981</a>. It drew new attention to concerns about political violence in a deeply polarized U.S. less than four months before the presidential election.</p>
<p>FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said agents are seeing increasingly violent rhetoric online since the rally and have seen people posing online as the shooter, who is dead.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-political-violence-and-violent-threats-are-on-the-rise-in-the-united-states"><strong>WATCH:</strong> Why political violence and violent threats are on the rise in the United States</a></p>
<p>“We’re also focused on the continuing efforts — which were already substantial, given that they’re national security special events — to conventions in Chicago, in Milwaukee,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden on Sunday ordered a security review of operations for the Republican National Convention, which is proceeding as planned. The Secret Service said they were “confident” in the security plan for the RNC, and no additional changes were planned.</p>
<p>Trump flew to New Jersey after visiting a local Pennsylvania hospital, landing shortly after midnight in Newark. Video posted by an aide showed the former president leaving his private jet flanked by Secret Service agents and heavily armed members of the agency’s counterassault team, an unusually visible show of force by his protective detail.</p>
<p>Biden, who is running against Trump, said the two men had a “short but good” conversation Saturday night. Biden cut short a weekend at his beach home in Rehobeth Beach, Delaware, to return to Washington, where he said during <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-biden-addresses-the-nation-after-receiving-briefing-on-trump-rally-shooting">an address Sunday afternoon</a> that “there is no place in America for this kind of violence.”</p>
<p>“We cannot allow this to happen,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Yet many Republicans quickly blamed the violence on Biden and his allies, arguing that sustained attacks on Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment. They pointed in particular to a comment Biden made to donors on July 8, saying “it’s time to put Trump in the bullseye.”</p>
<p>A person familiar with those remarks said the president was trying to make the point that Trump had gotten away with a light public schedule after last month’s debate while the president himself faced intense scrutiny from many even within his own party. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to more freely discuss private conversations.</p>
<p>In the donor call, Biden said: “I have one job and that’s to beat Donald Trump … I’m absolutely certain I’m the best person to be able to do that.”</p>
<p>Biden continued then: “So, we’re done talking about the debate. It’s time to put Trump in the bullseye. He’s gotten away with doing nothing for the last 10 days except ride around in his golf cart, bragging about scores he didn’t score … Anyway I won’t get into his golf game.”</p>
<p>But it’s not clear yet whether Biden will be forced to recalibrate a campaign that’s largely focused on Trump as a threat to democracy. It is a situation the U.S. has not seen since Teddy Roosevelt was shot a month before the election in 1912 while campaigning trying to regain the White House as a third-party candidate.</p>

Fans have been congregating at Hard Rock Stadium since well before the planned kickoff at 8 p.m. ET, with one parking lot attendant saying he had been called to work early given that fans started to arrive as early as 6 a.m.</p><aside class="inline inline-photo full"><figure><picture><source data-srcset="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0714%2Fr1358739_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&amp;w=570&amp;format=jpg, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0714%2Fr1358739_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&amp;w=1140&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0714%2Fr1358739_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&amp;w=375, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0714%2Fr1358739_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&amp;w=750&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"><img class=" lazyload lazyload" data-image-container=".inline-photo"></source></source></picture><figcaption class="photoCaption"><cite>Getty Images</cite></figcaption></figure></aside><p>A handful of people could be seen receiving medical treatment and asking for water in the sweltering South Florida heat.

The two parties in the new alliance have more than half the members in parliament required to prove their majority.</p>
    

<p>Oli’s biggest challenge as prime minister will be balancing Nepal’s relationship with its giant neighbors India and China, as both seek to wield influence over the small nation. Landlocked Nepal is surrounded by India on three sides and imports all of its oil and most supplies from India. It also shares a border with China.</p>



<p>Oli, 72, was born in a village in east Nepal and has been involved in politics since he was young. </p><p>He worked up the ranks of the communist party and was jailed a total of 14 years for opposing the autocratic rule of Nepal’s monarchs. The royals had banned political parties until 1990, when street protests forced then-King Birendra to hold free elections that turned Nepal into a constitutional monarchy, which was formally abolished in 2008.</p><p>Oli has made regular trips abroad for treatment of kidneys and has had kidney transplant surgeries. </p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bastille Day celebrations coincide with Olympic flame arrival</strong>: The annual Bastille Day celebrations in Paris took place on Sunday, coinciding with the arrival of the Olympic flame 12 days before the start of the Games.</li>
<li><strong>Less militaristic parade</strong>: The parade on Sunday was noticeably less militaristic than in previous years, with athletes and Olympic volunteers participating alongside soldiers, medics, and police officers.</li>
<li><strong>Limited spectators allowed</strong>: Due to space constraints and security concerns, authorities limited the number of spectators to 6,200, who were required to sign up in advance, a move attributed to the strain on police resources ahead of the Olympics.</li>
<li><strong>Temporary Olympic stadiums construction</strong>: The construction of temporary Olympic stadiums at Place de la Concorde has been ongoing, causing the parade to be moved to Avenue Foch, a shorter and less well-known road around the Arc de Triomphe.</li>
<li><strong>Traditional air show takes place</strong>: The annual air show, featuring fighter jets spraying blue, white, and red smoke, took place above Paris, maintaining a traditional element of the Bastille Day celebrations.</li>

It's a rare chance to score Black Friday-level pricing outside of November so is usually well worth shopping.  </p><h2> When is Amazon Prime Day?  </h2><p>Amazon Prime Day takes place on July 16 and 17. During this time the best deals are available but Amazon frequently has some deals ahead of, and after, the big event. </p><h2> What should I buy during Amazon Prime Day? </h2><p>Amazon will offer discounts on just about all of its categories. Big savings typically can be seen with Amazon smart home devices, tablets, and TVs as well as with everyday items, fashion, home goods, kitchen gadgets and more.  </p><h2> Are there sales happening at other retailers during Amazon Prime Day? </h2><p>Each Prime Day, we see other retailers announcing sales that directly compete with Amazon's event. We've already seen <a href="https://www.cnet.com/deals/walmart-gets-out-ahead-of-prime-day-with-july-8-summer-sale-event/" rel="follow" target="_self">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/deals/target-circle-week-returns-in-july-competing-with-amazon-prime-day/" rel="follow" target="_self">Target</a> announce their anti-Prime Day sales -- both launching before Prime Day.

<p>Samsung isn't just making <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/11/samsung-galaxy-ring-oura-ring-price-features-subscription-ai/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/11/samsung-galaxy-ring-oura-ring-price-features-subscription-ai/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/11/samsung-galaxy-ring-oura-ring-price-features-subscription-ai/" aria-label="big price decisions for its new Galaxy Ring">big price decisions for its new Galaxy Ring</a>. The pre-order promotion for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 are also surprisingly generous.</p>

<p>Until July 23rd, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-pre-order-deal-galaxy-fold-6-galaxy-ring/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-pre-order-deal-galaxy-fold-6-galaxy-ring/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-pre-order-deal-galaxy-fold-6-galaxy-ring/" aria-label="Samsung has upped its trade-in prices">Samsung has upped its trade-in prices </a>when buying either of the new foldable phones. Buyers can get up to $1200 off the Fold 6 when trading in their old device, or up to $1000 when purchasing the Flip 6. Before this deal landed on the 10th, the trade-in prices topped out at $750.</p>
<p class="halfway_hardwall_2"></p>
<p>Of course, to get the full amount you will need to hand over a Galaxy Z Fold 5, which isn’t a wise thing to do considering it’s a new phone with all of Samsung’s AI abilities, and five years of updates left. But there are some unusually high valuations for old phones in Samsung’s deal.</p>

<p>Some of these phones we released almost five years ago, like the Galaxy Note 10 and iPhone 11 Pro Max. On the secondary market, the Note 10 is selling for under $200, as is the case with the other listed handsets, which are selling for less than what Samsung will give you for them.</p>

<p>If you’re planning to buy the Flip 6 or Fold 6, it might be worth picking up a cheap used handset from eBay or Swappa and handing it over to Samsung to get that extra discount.</p><a class="embed-base color-body color-body-border link-embed embed-2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/11/samsung-galaxy-ring-oura-ring-price-features-subscription-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Samsung Says New Galaxy Ring Price Decision Is Permanent" data-ga-track="forbesEmbedly:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/11/samsung-galaxy-ring-oura-ring-price-features-subscription-ai/"><span class="link-embed__info"><span class="link-embed__provider">Forbes</span><span class="link-embed__title">Samsung Says New Galaxy Ring Price Decision Is Permanent</span><small class="link-embed__byline">By <span class="link-embed__author"></span></small></span><span class="link-embed__thumbnail-wrapper"><span class="link-embed__thumbnail allow-inline-style"></span></span></a>






<p>The Korean company is also offering a base of $300 for any smartphone from Google, Samsung or Apple. This is similar to a recent Galaxy Watch trade-in deal, which offered a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/06/27/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-trade-in-deal-100-off/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/06/27/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-trade-in-deal-100-off/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/06/27/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-trade-in-deal-100-off/" aria-label="fixed amount of money for any device in “any condition.">fixed amount of money for any device in “any condition.</a>” The difference here, though, is that whatever handset you send to Samsung must be working and in good condition.</p>


<p>These trade-in prices, combined with the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-pre-order-deal-galaxy-fold-6-galaxy-ring/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-pre-order-deal-galaxy-fold-6-galaxy-ring/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-pre-order-deal-galaxy-fold-6-galaxy-ring/" aria-label="company’s double storage offer">company’s double storage offer</a>, 5% discount when bought with the app, and 12 months of Samsung Care + represent some of Samsung’s most aggressive deals.</p>
<p>The caveat is that these devices have not been reviewed yet and there’s a good chance that they won’t be (fully) before the pre-order deal ends on July 23rd. As ever, the good value pre-order deals are balanced with taking a leap of faith on a device that hasn’t seen many hands yet.</p>
<p>Also, be aware of what’s marketing and what is real. The trade-in page has crossed out figures for devices, which <em>suggests</em> how much they were previously. But these don’t appear to be accurate.</p>
<p>For example, the Galaxy S22 Ultra is now worth $650, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/08/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-price-offer-galaxy-unpacked/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/08/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-price-offer-galaxy-unpacked/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/08/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-price-offer-galaxy-unpacked/" aria-label="compared to $600 on July 9th, a day before Galaxy Unpacked">compared to $600 on July 9th, a day before Galaxy Unpacked</a>. But the trade-in page has “$230” crossed out. The Galaxy S23 Ultra is valued at $800, up $50 from the previous price, but the page suggests that it was worth only $380 before.</p><a class="embed-base color-body color-body-border link-embed embed-4" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/09/motorola-razr-2023-android-14-update-new-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Motorola Confirms New Android Feature Boost For Razr Users" data-ga-track="forbesEmbedly:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2024/07/09/motorola-razr-2023-android-14-update-new-features/"><span class="link-embed__info"><span class="link-embed__provider">Forbes</span><span class="link-embed__title">Motorola Confirms New Android Feature Boost For Razr Users</span><small class="link-embed__byline">By <span class="link-embed__author"></span></small></span><span class="link-embed__thumbnail-wrapper"><span class="link-embed__thumbnail allow-inline-style"></span></span></a>
