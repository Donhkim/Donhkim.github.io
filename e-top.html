<p></p><p>Senate candidates who were addressing the convention Tuesday not only blamed Biden for the number of migrants crossing the border, but just as often faulted Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Republicans have increasingly focused on amid speculation that she could replace Biden as the Democratic nominee after the president’s poor debate performance.</p>
    
<p></p><p>The GOP candidates, mindful of their own races, sought to blame their Democratic opponents as well. Pennsylvania candidate David McCormick, for example, tied in his challenger, Sen. Bob Casey, with the term “Biden-Harris-Casey wide open borders.”</p>
    

<p></p><p>Kari Lake, the party’s Senate candidate in Arizona, stuck to a message that appealed largely to the GOP base and her reputation as a former television news anchor turned conservative firebrand. She blasted the “fake news” for spending “the last eight years lying about President Donald Trump and his amazing patriotic supporters.” She also blamed Biden and Democrats for the situation on the U.S.-Mexico border, saying they’re “full of bad ideas.”</p><p></p><p>In the latest signal the party is solidifying to take on Biden in November, several of Trump’s fiercest GOP primary rivals will also speak Tuesday. They include former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. </p><h2>There were security incidents outside the convention</h2><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Trump’s survival of an <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-rally-shooting-butler-police-cdfd3f4b163f7f91b05eeefe21caa45a">attempted assassination</a></span> Saturday at a rally in Pennsylvania was on the minds of many inside the hall. One of the delegates in the crowd could be seen with a folded white piece of paper over his ear — an apparent tribute to the bandage Trump wore when he entered the hall Monday to a roaring crowd. </p><p></p><p>Scalise, who was injured in a politically motivated shooting in 2017 while he was practicing for a charity baseball game, spoke of his own experience when he touched on Trump’s attack.</p><p></p><p>“While I was fighting for my life, Donald Trump was one of the first to come to console my family at the hospital. That’s the kind of leader he is. Courageous under fire, compassionate towards others,” Scalise said. </p><p></p><p>In the wake of Saturday’s attempt on Trump’s life, there was a heightened focus on security at the convention, which drew thousands of people to downtown Milwaukee, including a number of high-profile elected officials.</p><p></p><p>A man armed with an AK-47 pistol and wearing a ski mask was taken into custody Monday, the convention’s first day, near the Fiserv Forum where the convention is being held, a federal law enforcement official said Tuesday.</p><p></p><p>The 21-year-old was arrested after being encountered by U.S. Capitol Police and Homeland Security Investigations agents who said he was acting suspicious, according to the official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.</p><p></p><p>Police found the weapon in his backpack, the official said.</p><p></p><p>On Tuesday, five Ohio police officers who were in Wisconsin for the convention shot a man who was in a knife fight near the convention, killing him, Milwaukee’s police chief said.</p><p></p><p>The man who police shot had a knife in each hand and refused police commands, Milwaukee Chief Jeffrey Norman said at a news conference. Two knives were recovered from the scene, the chief said.</p><h2>There’s growing anticipation for Trump’s speech</h2><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Trump and Vance were expected to appear in the hall each of the last three nights of the convention.

            “Secret Service learned of the increased threat from this threat stream,” the official told CNN. “NSC directly contacted USSS at a senior level to be absolutely sure they continued to track the latest reporting. USSS shared this information with the detail lead, and the Trump campaign was made aware of an evolving threat. In response to the increased threat, Secret Service surged resources and assets for the protection of former President Trump. All of this was in advance of Saturday.”

            “I told you explicitly that we would resort to legal and judicial procedures and frameworks at the domestic level and international level in order to bring the perpetrators and military advisers of General Soleimani’s assassination to justice,” Kani told Zakaria in an interview that will air Sunday on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS.”

            Iran has repeatedly vowed revenge for the US military’s killing of Soleimani. And former senior Trump administration officials who worked on national security have had tight security since leaving the government.

            In August 2022, the Justice Department announced criminal charges against a member of the IRGC for allegedly trying to orchestrate the assassination of John Bolton, who served as Trump’s national security adviser. US prosecutors said the plot against Bolton was “likely in retaliation” for Soleimani’s assassination.

            Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was also a target of the Iranian assassination plot, according to a federal law enforcement source familiar with the investigation and a source close to Pompeo.

            Trump’s former national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, had a US government security detail due to threats from Iran, like Pompeo and other former Trump officials, but that detail was dropped last summer, according to sources familiar with the matter. O’Brien is now paying for his own private security detail, sources said. Lawmakers were not given a specific reason for the decision, which led to frustration. O’Brien did not respond to a request for comment.

            For months, law enforcement officials have been concerned about the persistent threat of Iran potentially attempting to assassinate former Trump officials and the former president himself, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. But the recent intelligence suggested a significant uptick in the threat, the sources told CNN.

They expect 80% of customers to have their power by Wednesday night.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Woodlawn resident Louis Reed, who lost his power Monday night, has been taking advantage of a breeze outside and a game of dominos to pass the time until his power is restored.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">And waiting is all Abdeel Bedeeh can do. He works at the Twin Spot at the corner of 63rd and Vernon.

One person had to be transported to an area hospital with injuries, police said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The view from Chopper 7 shows the magnitude of the damage there. The winds that swept through Channahon, apparently in a relatively narrow band Monday night, tossed a tanker truck upside down and ripped much of the roof off a trucking company.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The winds also ripped down numerous high-tension, high-power ComEd electricity lines. Those lines now stretch across the roads, including I-55.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"We had 10 tornados, broken tree limbs, down power lines," said ComEd Vice President Neena Hemmady.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">ComEd has brought in reinforcements, including some 1,400 employees from around the country and around 300 from Canada. They have restored many of the more than 400,000 customers without power, but this situation in Channahon will likely take at least another full day and night. That's due, in part, to the heavy current these lines carry.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In the meantime, the closure of I-55 has inconvenienced countless people, from drivers to those expecting commerce to be delivered to and from the Chicago area. Driver Derrick Scott, who deliver those goods, is unable to move his truck out of the parking lot Tuesday evening.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"I'm an owner/operator, so for every day my truck sits, I lose money.

            Although the election was inconclusive, it was heralded as a victory for the French mainstream and a measure of voters’ overwhelming desire to keep the far right from gaining power.

            But, after a week of political bargaining that saw more than 200 centrist and left-wing candidates withdraw to avoid splitting the vote, the RN slumped to third place in the second round. In a shock result, the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) alliance won the most seats of any bloc.

            The hastily assembled alliance, which formed just days after Macron called the election last month, comprises several parties straddling vast ideological ground, from the hard-left France Unbowed party to the more moderate Socialist Party and Place Publique.

            But, more than a week after the vote, the alliance has still not put forward a prime ministerial candidate, in a potential sign of the divisions within the capacious – and potentially fractious – coalition

            France Unbowed won the most seats of any party within the NFP, and so might have been expected to be called on to put forward a candidate to succeed Attal. But Macron’s allies have repeatedly said they will not work with its leader, the populist firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon, saying his party is just as extreme – and therefore unfit to govern – as the RN.

            Even if Macron does appoint a prime minister from the NFP, the party will still need to enter into yet another coalition – likely with Ensemble – in order to pass laws.

            Another option is a “technocratic” government. Macron is not constitutionally obliged to appoint a prime minister from the largest bloc, and so could call on a candidate outside of mainstream politics to manage day-to-day matters. Italy took this option when it appointed Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, to run its government.

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- Stocks hit all-time highs as bets the Federal Reserve will soon start cutting rates fueled a rush into riskier corners of the market.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>Wall Street extended a pattern of money rotating into small caps and out of the megacap “safety” since last week’s soft inflation data. Over the past four sessions, the Russell 2000 has beaten the Nasdaq 100 by almost 12 percentage points — a feat not seen since 2011. An equal-weighted version of the S&amp;P 500 — where the likes of Nvidia Corp. carry the same heft as Dollar Tree Inc. — outpaced the US equity benchmark. That index is less sensitive to gains from the biggest companies — providing a glimpse of hope the rally will broaden out.</p><p>“Rotation is the name of the game,” said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. “This is consistent with the increased perception of cutting rates.”</p><p>Brenner highlighted the fact that around 4 a.m. New York time, Russell 2000 futures spiked — while contracts on the Nasdaq 100 slipped. “This means that overseas money, big money, made a very large rotation trade overnight,” he said.</p><p>To Solita Marcelli, at UBS Global Wealth Management, if the Federal Reserve can cut rates significantly in the context of a soft landing, there will be better prospects for a re-acceleration in earnings growth for lower quality and cyclical segments of the market. At Interactive Brokers, Jose Torres cited another potential reason for the rally in smaller firms: they tend to be domestically oriented and perceived to benefit “disproportionately” if Donald Trump wins the election.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 rose to 5,667 — its 38th record this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.85%. The Russell 2000 gained 3.5%, notching its biggest five-day run since 2020. The Nasdaq 100 was little changed. US 10-year yields fell seven basis points to 4.16%. Gold hit a record high.</p><p>Traders also waded through earnings. Bank of America Corp. gave a forecast for net interest income that exceeded expectations. Morgan Stanley’s traders joined the party across Wall Street in the second quarter even as the firm’s larger wealth business fell short of expectations. Charles Schwab Corp. warned it will have to shrink itself in order to protect profits.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="17"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>While the broadening out in the US stock rally is seen as a positive sign, the surge in small caps in such a short span is showing signs of overheating. In only five days, the Russell 2000 has jumped almost 12% — hitting the most-overbought level since 2017.</p><p>“History was made today as the Russell 2000 closed 4.4 standard deviations above its 50-DMA,” according to Bespoke Investment Group. “No other major US index (Dow since 1900, S&amp;P 500 since 1928, and Nasdaq since 1971) has ever closed at that much of an extreme.”</p><p>Matt Maley at Miller Tabak says the gauge has reached the kind of overbought condition that has been followed by declines over the past two years.</p><p>“Thus, this could be signaling that the small-cap sector is due for some sort of short-term breather,” he noted. “At the very least, investors should be careful about chasing these stocks over the near-term.”</p><p>In such case, he says it will be interesting to see if there’s a reversal of the “rotation” move. Tech stocks are coming off their own overbought condition, so there’s no guarantee they will advance during a pullback in the small-cap names, he said.</p><p>The bottom line? If both tech stocks and small caps decline at the same time, it could cause “some problems for the overall market,” he noted.</p><p>The move on the Russell 2000 is bullish, but investors should be ready for a potential potential profit-taking or consolidation in the sessions ahead, according to Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott.</p><p>“The longer-term monthly chart on the Russell shows a better picture of its potential,” he noted. “We believe the Russell 2000 can trade back toward its all-time highs as mean reversion in relative strength highlights further bandwidth for the sector against this year’s leadership (tech/AI/Mag7).”</p><p>Wantrobski also pointed out that broader market breadth/participation has been improving since the CPI rally last week.</p><p>“The battle between the broader markets and 2024 leadership is set to continue over the short run in our view, as relative strength disparities between these groups show the potential for more rotation ahead,” Wantrobski said. “This cannot be confirmed as a long-term trend/investment theme at this time. So for now, we continue to treat this as a trading opportunity (mean reversion move).”</p><p>Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler says it is too early to determine whether a sustainable rotation can be maintained. More time and technical evidence are needed to confirm sustainable broadening participation that can lift the market higher is underway.</p><p>“The current (and long-awaited) broadening of equity gains is welcome, but elevated valuations will limit further market upside to low single digits overall for the remainder of the year,” said Robert Teeter at Silvercrest Asset Management.</p><p>To Lori Calvasina at RBC Capital Markets, the earnings season will be a “key test” for the rotation trade. She added that valuations and positioning have set the stage for an eventual shift to a new leadership, but there have been several false starts.</p><p>The relative performance of the Nasdaq versus the Russell 2000 has been on a wild ride since 2020, with each besting the other by more than 40 percentage points over different one-year holding periods since the pandemic crisis, according to Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research. Dramatic small-cap outperformance has only occurred after a tech stock crash or when retail investors created a small-cap bubble, he said.</p><p>“Neither setup is relevant now. We believe the Nasdaq will outperform the Russell by its 2003–2019 average of two points over the next year,” he noted.</p><p>As for whether the S&amp;P 500 or Russell 2000 will outperform over the rest of the year, his view is that both will now do equally well — but not at the same time due to their low correlation.</p><p>“For the moment, small caps have the better momentum because money managers cannot afford to stay as underweight as they have been forced to be over the last 18 months,” Colas said. “Once their reweighting is done, the S&amp;P should be able to play catch-up.”</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has gone 351 sessions through Tuesday without a 2% decline. If the equity benchmark reaches 352 by Wednesday’s close, it will be the longest stretch since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007. The index went roughly 950 sessions from May 2003 to February 2007 without such a slide.</p><p>The strength of the equity market has been underpinned by optimism the economy has withstood the worst of Fed tightening. In this regard, Tuesday’s better-than-estimated retail sales report was a “healthy” development, according to Bret Kenwell at eToro. It’s better to see the Fed cutting rates on falling inflation than to see the central bank rushing to bolster a weakened economy, he noted.</p><p>The Dow Average also had an “outstanding day” on hopes of rate cuts and lower taxes and regulations — which may be on the horizon, according to Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance. He also cited hopes the market rally will broaden from a narrow set of technology shares into “an array of companies.”</p><p>Corporate Highlights:</p><ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"><li><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. joined rival JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. in the tapping the US investment-grade market after reporting second-quarter earnings.</p></li><li><p>PNC Financial Services Group Inc. notched its first increase in net interest income since the end of 2022, setting itself up for what it expects to be a record year of NII growth in 2025.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft Corp.’s investment into Inflection AI will get a full-blown UK antitrust probe, after the watchdog said it needed to take a closer look at the hiring of former employees from the artificial intelligence startup.</p></li><li><p>Philip Morris International Inc. is expanding production of Zyn in the US as the popular oral nicotine pouch becomes increasingly hard to find because of soaring demand.</p></li><li><p>Starboard Value became the third activist investor this year to take a stake in Match Group Inc., the owner of the dating app Tinder whose paying customer base has shrunk for six straight quarters.</p></li><li><p>Adidas AG raised its annual profit target for the second time in three months amid soaring demand for classic sneakers like the Samba and more sales from the shrinking stockpile of Yeezy footwear.</p></li></ul><p>Key events this week:</p><ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"><li><p>Eurozone CPI, Wednesday</p></li><li><p>US housing starts, industrial production, Wednesday</p></li><li><p>Fed Beige Book, Wednesday</p></li><li><p>Fed’s Thomas Barkin speaks, Wednesday</p></li><li><p>ECB rate decision, Thursday</p></li><li><p>US initial jobless claims, Philadelphia Fed manufacturing, Conference Board LEI, Thursday</p></li><li><p>Fed’s Mary Daly, Lorie Logan and Michelle Bowman speak, Thursday</p></li><li><p>Fed’s John Williams, Raphael Bostic speak, Friday</p></li></ul><p>Some of the main moves in markets:</p><p>Stocks</p><ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"><li><p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6% as of 4 p.m. New York time</p></li><li><p>The Nasdaq 100 was little changed</p></li><li><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.85%</p></li><li><p>The MSCI World Index rose 0.4%</p></li><li><p>The Russell 2000 Index rose 3.5%</p></li></ul><p>Currencies</p><ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"><li><p>The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed</p></li><li><p>The euro was little changed at $1.0901</p></li><li><p>The British pound was little changed at $1.2974</p></li><li><p>The Japanese yen fell 0.2% to 158.39 per dollar</p></li></ul><p>Cryptocurrencies</p><ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"><li><p>Bitcoin rose 2.2% to $65,153.51</p></li><li><p>Ether rose 1.1% to $3,474.43</p></li></ul><p>Bonds</p><ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"><li><p>The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined seven basis points to 4.16%</p></li><li><p>Germany’s 10-year yield declined five basis points to 2.43%</p></li><li><p>Britain’s 10-year yield declined five basis points to 4.05%</p></li></ul><p>Commodities</p><p>This story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.</p><p>--With assistance from Lu Wang, Esha Dey, Jessica Menton and Sophie Caronello.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>
