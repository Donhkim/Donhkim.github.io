  <p>Hallie Biden told the court she found the firearm when she was clearing out his car, which she often searched for drugs and alcohol.

<p>After she threw out the gun, she said she didn't tell him, and she said she was going to "pretend" it wasn't her. But Hallie said Hunter then texted her when he noticed the gun was missing. </p><p>Prosecutors also went through texts from the next day, in which Hunter Biden told her that he was "buying" drugs, and one from a day later, when he sent a message that he was "sleeping on a car smoking crack." The messages appear to contradict the defense team's assertions that Hunter Biden was not using drugs in October 2018, when the firearm was purchased. </p><p>Hunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from his alleged purchase of a revolver in October 2018. Two of the charges are related to accusations that he made false statements on a federal gun form about his drug use, certifying he was not a user of or addicted to any controlled substance during a period when prosecutors allege he was addicted to crack cocaine. The other charge is for allegedly owning the gun unlawfully. He was allegedly in possession of the gun for 11 days before Hallie Biden discarded the weapon. </p><p>Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges. </p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/06/939c069a-2add-492d-b1d8-72f3449e54ef/thumbnail/620x349/282ca7ed1428ce2883b1f37c342916c8/pxl-20240606-1707058242.jpg?v=94cbb61397dbf7eca3740fa55510ba88#" alt="pxl-20240606-1707058242.jpg " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/06/939c069a-2add-492d-b1d8-72f3449e54ef/thumbnail/620x349/282ca7ed1428ce2883b1f37c342916c8/pxl-20240606-1707058242.jpg?v=94cbb61397dbf7eca3740fa55510ba88 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/06/939c069a-2add-492d-b1d8-72f3449e54ef/thumbnail/1240x698/ebb300a8bf5457e1b02f9c144a0f61c0/pxl-20240606-1707058242.jpg?v=94cbb61397dbf7eca3740fa55510ba88 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

<p>"It was a terrible experience that I went through and I'm embarrassed and ashamed, and I regret that period of my life," she said. </p><p>In contrast to earlier witnesses who said that Hunter Biden did not show a change in demeanor while on drugs, she described him as "agitated" and "high-strung," but she also suggested he could still function at times while on the drug.</p><p>Under cross examination by Lowell, Hallie Biden said she had stopped using drugs by August 2018, and she acknowledged that she and Hunter Biden had an "intense" and "complicated" on-again, off-again relationship. She said she had trouble believing him, particularly when he told her where he was, and when she was shown the text again in which he said he was smoking crack or with dealers around the date he bought the gun, she acknowledged she couldn't be sure he was actually where he said he was. </p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/06/a10aaef3-ee80-48bd-96c9-3fafc27ad211/thumbnail/620x413g2/4f06fd3869ad3706fc338558d1ab6fb6/ap24158478621098.jpg?v=94cbb61397dbf7eca3740fa55510ba88#" alt="Hallie Biden arrives at court for Hunter Biden's trial on gun charges " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/06/a10aaef3-ee80-48bd-96c9-3fafc27ad211/thumbnail/620x413g2/4f06fd3869ad3706fc338558d1ab6fb6/ap24158478621098.jpg?v=94cbb61397dbf7eca3740fa55510ba88 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/06/a10aaef3-ee80-48bd-96c9-3fafc27ad211/thumbnail/1240x826g2/4ced71c6236adf289e3494ace62c27e3/ap24158478621098.jpg?v=94cbb61397dbf7eca3740fa55510ba88 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E"></span>

              </figcaption></figure><p>Hallie Biden had trouble recalling the sequence of events from Oct. 6, when Hunter Biden had returned from Los Angeles, through Oct. 23, the day she allegedly discarded the gun. She said she remembered she had seen him at some point around Oct. 22 or 23, describing him as "exhausted," but she couldn't pin down exactly when that was, relative to when she threw out the gun. The defense attempted to show that Hunter Biden may have stayed at a hotel that night, rather than at her home, where his truck was parked.</p><p>Hallie Biden did maintain she did not see him using drugs during this time. </p><h2>Earlier testimony and statements in the case</h2><p>Cleveland, the man who sold Hunter Biden the gun, testified on Wednesday that Hunter Biden did not seem confused by the form. Hunter Biden's attorney Abbe Lowell pressed Cleveland on the condition of the form at the center of the case and the rules required for any changes made after submission. </p><p>Lowell said Tuesday in opening statements that many addicts are in "denial" about their drug use, indicating that his client did not intend to lie on the form. Prosecutor Derek Hines, meanwhile, in his opening statement noted that "addiction may not be a choice, but lying and buying a gun is a choice."</p>

<p>Lowell sought earlier Wednesday to cast doubt on the authenticity of personal text messages allegedly taken from Hunter Biden's personal devices. Under questioning from Lowell, FBI special agent Erika Jensen said she could not verify the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop admitted into evidence were not tampered with before law enforcement collected it from a repair shop. </p><p>On Wednesday, Hunter Biden's ex-wife Kathleen Buhle and his former girlfriend Zoe Kestan testified about his drug use. Buhle testified that while they were still married she confronted Hunter Biden after she found a "crack pipe" and said that, although she never saw him use drugs, he confirmed his drug use to her. </p><h2>Other charges against Hunter Biden </h2><p>Separately, Hunter Biden faces nine federal tax charges in the central district of California in a second indictment brought by Weiss' office where federal prosecutors allege Hunter Biden engaged in a "four-year scheme" to avoid paying at least $1.4 million in federal taxes. References to the tax charges are not admissible in his gun trial in Delaware. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges.</p><h2>Biden family reaction</h2><p>President Biden has not attended his son's trial, but he was in Wilmington over the weekend with the family, including Hunter. While in France for events <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-80th-anniversary-d-day-normandy/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">commemorating the 80th anniversary of the D-Day</a></span> invasion, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-tells-muir-wont-pardon-son-hunter/story?id=110904482" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">President Biden told ABC News' David Muir</a> "yes" that he would accept the outcome of the trial. When asked if that meant he would rule out a pardon, Mr. Biden again said "yes." </p><p>President Biden's sister, Valerie Biden, was present in the courtroom on Thursday, while the president's daughter and Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden attended earlier in the week, although she appeared emotional at times before eventually leaving. First lady Jill Biden also attended earlier in the week, but then traveled to France to attend the D-Day commemoration events. </p>

Israel frequently identifies militants it targeted in airstrikes, but it is rare for the US to urge it to do so.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"The government of Israel has said that they are going to release more information about this strike, including the names of those who died in it," Mr Miller said. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"We expect them to be fully transparent in making that information public." </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On Thursday evening, Israeli army spokesperson Daniel Hagari gave the names of nine Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters he said were killed in the strike. He claimed more would be identified after work to “verify the information”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The strike comes just a week after 45 people were killed in an Israeli strike in the Gazan city of Rafah. </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Local journalists and residents said Thursday's strike took place in the early hours of Thursday at al-Sardi school, which is in a south-eastern area of the densely-populated, decades-old camp, where the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, provides services.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Videos shared on social media showed the destruction of several classrooms in one of the school's buildings, as well as bodies wrapped in white shrouds and blankets.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Dead and wounded people were rushed to the al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Hospital, in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, which has been overwhelmed since the Israeli military began a new ground operation against Hamas in central Gaza this week.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The BBC is working to verify the details of the strike in Nuseirat camp. Reports on the exact number of dead have varied. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said 40 people were killed, including 14 children and nine women, and 74 others were injured. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Meanwhile, Unrwa's commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini, said that at least 35 people were killed and many more injured. The agency’s director of communications, Juliette Touma, told the BBC that "the figures are coming from our own Unrwa colleagues on the ground".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Witnesses described a scene of devastation following the strike. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“I was asleep when the incident occurred. Suddenly, we heard a loud explosion and shattered glass and debris from the building fell on us,” Udai Abu Elias, a man who was living at the school, told BBC Arabic.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“Smoke filled the air and I couldn't see anything. I didn't expect to make it out alive. I heard someone calling for survivors to come out from under the rubble. I struggled to see as I stumbled over the bodies of the martyrs.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Unrwa said 6,000 displaced people were sheltering in the school complex at the time. Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the strike through a spokesperson, saying that UN premises must be "inviolable" and protected by "all parties" during conflicts. </p></div><figure></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said jets had conducted a "precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside" the school. An annotated aerial photograph highlighted classrooms on two upper floors of the building, which the IDF said were the “locations of the terrorists”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But speaking in Washington late on Thursday, Mr Miller said: "We've seen the claims that 14 children were killed in this strike, and certainly, when you see - if that is accurate - that 14 children were killed, those aren't terrorists." </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Meanwhile, US officials have continued to lobby for a what US President Joe Biden called an Israeli ceasefire proposal.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The three-part plan would begin with a six-week ceasefire in which the Israeli military would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza. There would also be a "surge" of humanitarian aid, as well as an exchange of some hostages for Palestinian prisoners.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The deal would eventually lead to a permanent "cessation of hostilities" and a major reconstruction plan for Gaza. Germany, France and Britain re-affirmed their support for the deal in a joint statement with the US on Thursday and called for "an enduring end to the crisis". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">CIA Director William Burns met mediators from Egypt and Qatar in Doha on Thursday to discuss the plans, but senior Cairo officials told the Reuters news agency that there had been no sign of a breakthrough on the deal. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">At least 36,470 people have been killed in Gaza in almost eight months of fighting, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others hostage during its 7 October attacks on southern Israel.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><i id="Additional reporting by Rushdi Abu Alouf in Istanbul and David Gritten in London.

<ol>
<li>Stephen K. Bannon, a longtime adviser to former President Donald J. Trump, has been ordered by a federal judge to surrender by July 1 to start serving a four-month prison term for disobeying a congressional subpoena.</li>
<li>Bannon was sentenced in October 2022 on contempt of Congress charges after he refused to give testimony to the House committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.</li>
<li>Judge Carl J. Nichols allowed Bannon to remain free while he appealed the conviction, but last month, a federal appeals court in Washington decided that his guilty verdict was proper.</li>
<li>The appeals court upheld the guilty verdict, ruling that Bannon's decision to ignore the House committee's demand for his testimony was contemptuous.</li>
<li>Bannon has lost his first round of appeal, and he must now report to prison to serve his four-month sentence.</li>

Sacks and Palihapitiya are two of the four hosts of the popular All-In podcast.</p><p>The event sold out and is expected to raise $12 million for Trump. Sacks declined to comment. Palihapitiya didn’t return requests for comment by the time of publication.</p><p>The fundraiser in the heart of the tech capital represents a growing shift in sentiment toward Trump, especially in what’s been historically a liberal stronghold. Though Sacks has long been a conservative, he donated to Democrat <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/hillary-clinton/">Hillary Clinton</a> in 2016. In recent years, he’s thrown his support behind the Republican party and started publicly backing Trump when it was clear he’d be the Republican nominee. Palihapitiya donated more than $250,000 to Biden in 2020, according to campaign records. </p><p>“I know there’s going to be a lot of people who support Trump, but they don’t want to admit it,” Sacks said on the podcast last week. “And I think that this event is going to break the ice on that.

One of Trump’s signature accomplishments in his term centered around <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/18/trump-tcja-tax-cuts-are-slated-to-expire-after-next-year.html">hefty tax cuts</a>, and he got tough on China while carving out exemptions to protect tech companies from tariffs.

Under Biden, the SEC has taken measures against cryptocurrencies and his antitrust regulators have cracked down on mega-cap tech companies. </p><p> For those in Sacks’ camp, there’s a laundry list of issues.</p><p>“Biden came into office promising a return to normalcy,” Sacks <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/1797324200094626233" target="_blank">posted on X</a> on June 2. “What has he actually given us? A decelerating economy. A spike in inflation. A world on fire. Vindictive partisan witch hunts.

Additionally, prosecutors say they recovered a "planning document" on a hard drive in his basement used to "methodically blueprint" his killings.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The all-caps document features a series of checklists with tasks to complete before, during and after the killings, as well as practical lessons for "next time." Among the dozens of entries written are reminders to clean the bodies and destroy evidence, to "get sleep before hunt" and to "have story set."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">One section, titled "things to remember," appears to highlight lessons from previous killings, prosecutors said, such as using heavier rope and limiting noise in order to maximize "play time." A "body prep" checklist includes, among other items, a note to "remove head and hands."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Prosecutors believe that entry may connect Heuermann to yet another victim, Valerie Mack, whose partial skeletal remains were discovered near the body of Taylor after her disappearance in 2000.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Heuermann has not been charged in the death of Mack. But asked during a news conference after Thursday's hearing if he was a suspect, District Attorney Ray Tierney replied, "That's fair to say."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">He added that investigators are still working the case, noting that the "method of the crime scene" in Mack's killing was consistent with those of the other victims.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Heuermann pleaded not guilty to killing Taylor and Costilla during the hearing and was ordered held without bail.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Court documents said that Taylor was decapitated and her arms had been severed from her torso.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Investigators believe the mutilations, "were acts perpetrated by Rex A. Heuermann to inhibit the identification of the victim via facial recognition, fingerprints and/or tattoo identification," according to a newly unsealed court document.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Taylor's skull, hands, and forearm were discovered along Ocean Parkway, just east of Gilgo Beach, near the spot where the remains of other victims were discovered.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Investigators linked Heuermann to her death in part through DNA from a male human hair recovered from her body, specifically from a surgical drape that had been underneath the victim, according to the court document.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Investigators also said phone records established that Heuermann's wife and children were out of town at the time Jessica Taylor was killed.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"Accordingly, the murders of all four charged victims, and now the murder of Ms. Taylor, occurred at times when Defendant Heuermann's wife and children were located out of state, which would have allowed Defendant Heuermann unfettered time to execute his plans for Ms. Taylor, which included the decapitation, dismemberment, and transportation of her remains, without any fear that his family would uncover or learn of his involvement in these crimes," the court document said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The charges involving Costilla, who was killed 30 years ago, indicate that prosecutors believe Heuermann was killing victims for much longer longer than previously thought. Unlike the other victims, Costilla's remains were not among those discovered at Gilgo Beach, but were found in a wooded area in Southampton, Long Island.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Since late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people - mostly female sex workers - whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Tierney said the planning document was recovered in March of this year, providing the impetus for the recent searches at the suspect's home and in Manorville.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Prosecutors also said they found a book in Heuermann's possession by the retired FBI agent John Douglas, "The Cases That Haunt Us." They say the planning document referenced specific pages in another work by Douglas, "Mind Hunter," that allude to the personality types of serial killers and profiles of those who use mutilation and sexual violence.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Investigators have also used Heuermann's significant collection of violent, bondage, and torture pornography, currently dating back to 1994.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"The pornographic images accessed by Heuermann," court records said, "notably and largely coincide with how the remains of Sandra Costilla, Jessica Taylor and Valerie Mack were discovered."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">There has been a sweeping expansion of the investigation into Heuermann, a former New York City architect, following his arrest last summer.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">At least 11 sets of human remains have been found in Long Island's Suffolk County, including the four women Heuermann is accused of killing: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Costello, and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Their remains were found near Gilgo Beach along Ocean Parkway.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to all murder charges.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">He was remanded without bail. His next court date is July 30.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">---</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy"><em>Some information from ABC News and the Associated Press</em></p><h3 class="vPZug oPAle xcLAU bunQU uhXXI PjNjV lNbol LBPRq">FOLLOW TO THE EYEWITNESS TO GILGO BEACH PODCAST</h3><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy"><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">Discover more podcasts from abc7NY here</a></p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">----------</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">* <strong class="vtkaO"><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/long-island/" target="_blank">More Long Island news</a></strong></p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">* <strong class="vtkaO"><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://7ny.tv/submitnewstip" target="_blank">Send us a news tip</a></strong></p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">* <strong class="vtkaO"><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/apps/" target="_blank">Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts</a></strong></p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">*<strong class="vtkaO"><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrlIS7z20CnVaCrMvdkig_g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Follow us on YouTube</a></strong></p><h2 class="RxNCg PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq">Submit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News</h2><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

<li>The fraud scheme involved a network of individuals and organizations, including Minnesota-based nonprofits Feeding Our Future and Partners in Quality Care, which allegedly spent the funds on luxury items rather than feeding children.</li>

<li><strong>The top Treasury civil servant has also objected to the Conservatives presenting their accusation as if it had been produced by impartial civil servants</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>In an interview for ITV's Tonight, Prime Minister Sunak replied "no" when asked by presenter Paul Brand if he was "willing to lie in order to stay in power"</strong>, suggesting that he denies intentionally lying about Labour's tax plans.</li>

                    <p>OMAHA BEACH, France (AP) — As young soldiers, they waded ashore in Normandy through gunfire to battle the Nazis. On Thursday, a dwindling number of World War II veterans in a parade of wheelchairs joined a new generation of leaders to honor the dead, the living and the fight for democracy in moving commemorations on and around those same beaches where they landed exactly 80 years ago on D-Day.</p>
<p><strong>Watch the ceremony live in our player above.</strong></p>
<p>The war in Ukraine shadowed the ceremonies, a grim modern-day example of lives and cities that are again suffering through war in Europe.</p>
<p>The break of dawn eight decades after Allied troops landed on five code-named beaches — Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword — started the day of remembrance by Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/d-day-veterans-return-to-normandy-for-80th-anniversary-of-allied-invasion"><strong>WATCH:</strong> D-Day veterans return to Normandy for 80th anniversary of Allied invasion</a></p>
<p>World War II ally Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wasn’t invited, and U.S. President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-promises-support-for-ukraine-at-d-day-80th-anniversary-ceremony-near-beaches-of-normandy">directly linked Ukraine’s fight</a> for its young democracy to the battle to defeat Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>“To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable,” Biden said. “If we were to do that, it means we’d be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.”</p>
<p>With the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/d-day-anniversary-shines-a-spotlight-on-rosie-the-riveter-women-who-built-the-weapons-of-wwii"><strong>READ MORE:</strong> D-Day anniversary shines a spotlight on ‘Rosie the Riveter’ women who built the weapons of WWII</a></p>
<p>“There are things worth fighting for,” said Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. “Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.”</p>
<p>“We’ll learn one of these days, but I won’t be around for that,” he said.</p>
<p>As now-centenarian veterans revisited old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s presence at the international D-Day commemoration was met with loud applause, fusing World War II’s awful past with the fraught present. More applause followed when a giant screen showed the Ukrainian leader speaking with U.S. veterans.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron awarded the Legion of Honor to 11 U.S. veterans and a British female veteran. Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.</p>
<p>“You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,” Macron said. “You came here to make France a free nation. You’re back here today at home, if I may say.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/week-of-ceremonies-for-d-days-80th-anniversary-kick-off-with-parachute-jump-over-normandy"><strong>READ MORE:</strong> Week of ceremonies for D-Day’s 80th anniversary kicks off with parachute jump over Normandy</a></p>
<p>Macron also bestowed the Legion of Honor on 103-year-old Christian Lamb, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral who was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father called her back to London. There, Lamb created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.</p>
<p>The French president bent down to Lamb in a wheelchair, pin the medal and kiss her on both cheeks, describing her as one of the “heroes in the shadows.”</p>
<p>Conscious of the inevitability of age and time for World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary. At the international ceremony later, the veterans received a standing ovation as they were paraded before the stands in a stately line of wheelchairs to avoid the long walk across the beachfront promenade.</p>
<p>“We just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,” said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta. She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.</p>
<p>In a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France’s Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.</p>
<p>“To forget them is to let them die all over again,” the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.</p>
<p>“All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn’t know for an ideology — democracy, freedom — that is under severe strain now,” he said.</p>
<p>For Warren Goss, a 99-year-old American veteran of D-Day who landed in the first waves on Utah Beach, a visit years later to the same place where he watched a comrade fall to incoming fire confirmed that the sacrifice was worthy.</p>
<p>“I looked at the beach and it was beautiful, all the people, the kids were playing and I see the boys and girls were walking, holding hands, with their life back,” he told the Danish king and prime minister, who hung on his every word.</p>
<p>The fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.</p>
<p>But at the 80th, they’re the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler’s defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.</p>

<em>A few days before D-Day, a pilot in Sergeant Melvin “Mel” Jenner’s squadron asked if Jenner would fly a top-secret mission on June 6. Accepting the invitation, Melvin was tasked with flying up and down the French coast photographing the historic invasion. 80 years later, during a visit back to Normandy, France, Jenner recounted his memories of D-Day and the heroes, he said, who gave there lives that day.</em></p>
<p>“They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,” said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting on Utah Beach.</p>
<p>Farther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom’s King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops at Juno Beach.</p>
<p>In his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation “did not flinch” when they were called upon.</p>
<p>“Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,” he said.</p>
<p>Speaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the “unimaginable number” of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.</p>

<p>Those who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.</p>
<p>Feted everywhere they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.</p>
<p>“We weren’t doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country,” said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers. “We ended up helping save the world.”</p>
<p><em>Jill Lawless in London, and Jeffrey Schaeffer, Mark Carlson, Bela Szandelszky, Helena Alves and Alex Turnbull along the Normandy coast, contributed to this report.</em></p>

"Destroying Hamas as a governing authority is an achievable and attainable military objective," he added.</p><h2>HAMAS LEADERS SINWAR AND DEIF</h2><p>Netanyahu and his government are under pressure from Washington to agree to a ceasefire plan to end the war, which began on Oct. 7 when Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and seizing over 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p><p>Israel's subsequent ground-and-air campaign in Gaza has left the territory in ruins and killed more than 36,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.

The labyrinth, dubbed the Gaza metro by the Israeli military, is roughly half the length of the New York subway system. Equipped with water, power and ventilation, it shelters Hamas leaders, command and control centers, and weapons and ammunition stores.</p><p>The Israeli military said last week that it had taken control of the entire Gaza-Egypt land border to prevent weapons smuggling. About 20 tunnels used by Hamas to carry arms into Gaza were found within the zone, it added.</p><p>Egypt's State Information Service didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Israel's claims of arms-smuggling from the country.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned that the absence of such a roadmap could trigger lawlessness in the enclave.</p><p>One Arab official told Reuters that criminal gangs had already emerged in Gaza amid the power vacuum, seizing food deliveries and conducting armed robberies.</p><p>The official and two other Arab government sources, who all requested anonymity to speak freely, said the IDF could face similar threats to those encountered by America in the city of Falluja in 2004-2006 following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.</p><p>A broad insurgency in Falluja swelled the ranks first of al Qaeda and then Islamic State, miring Iraq in conflict and chaos from which it has yet to fully emerge two decades later.</p><p>Washington and its Arab allies have said they are working on a post-conflict plan for Gaza which involves a time-bound, irreversible path to Palestinian statehood.</p><p>When the plan, part of a "grand bargain" envisioned by the United States that aims to secure a normalizing of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, is complete, Washington aims to put it to Israel, the U.S. officials said.</p><p>A United Arab Emirates official with direct knowledge of the discussions said a Palestinian invitation was needed for countries to assist Gaza in an emergency operation, as well as an end to hostilities, full Israeli disengagement, and clarity on Gaza's legal status, including control of borders.</p><p>The emergency process could last a year and be potentially renewable for another year, according to the UAE official who said the aim was to stabilize the enclave rather than rebuild it.</p><p>For reconstruction to begin, a more detailed roadmap towards a two-state solution was needed, he added, as well as serious and credible reform of the Palestinian Authority.</p><p>How the United States aims to overcome Netanyahu's repeated rejection of a two-state solution, which Riyadh says is a condition to normalizing ties, is unclear.</p><p>David Schenker, a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, dismissed any suggestion of a clean IDF pullout from the Palestinian territory.</p><p>"Israel says it's going to maintain security control which means that it's going to constantly fly drones over Gaza and they're not going to be limited if they see Hamas re-emerging, they're going to go back," said Schenker, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute U.S.-based think-tank.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p><p>Gadi Eisenkot, a former Israeli military chief serving in Netanyahu's war cabinet, has proposed an Egyptian-led international coalition as an alternative to Hamas rule in Gaza.</p><p>In a closed-door briefing last week to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, he emphasized the complex nature of anti-militancy warfare.</p><p>"This is a religious, nationalistic, social, and military struggle with no knock-out blow but rather protracted warfare that will last many years," he said.</p>  </div> </div>

                                        <p>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank cut its key interest rate Thursday by a quarter-point, moving ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve as central banks around the world lean toward lowering borrowing costs — a shift with far-reaching consequences for home buyers, savers and investors.</p><p>The ECB cut its benchmark rate to 3.75% from a record high of 4% at a meeting of the bank’s 26-member rate-setting council in Frankfurt.</p><p>Speaking afterward at a news conference, ECB President Christine Lagarde said inflation had eased enough for the central bank to start lowering rates. </p><p>But with annual inflation at 2.6% in May and expected to remain above the ECB 2% target into next year, Lagarde declined to indicate how fast or how deep any future rate cuts might be. </p><p>“We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary,” she said. “We are not committing to a particular rate path.” </p>
    

<p>“Are we today moving into a dialing-back phase? I wouldn’t volunteer that,” she said. </p><p>Rate increases combat inflation by making it more expensive to borrow in order to buy goods, lowering demand and taking the pressure off prices. But high rates also hold back growth, which has been in short supply in the eurozone.</p>



<p>With inflation coming down but taking its time to reach levels central bankers like, the question now is, how soon, how fast and how deep future rate cuts from the Fed, the ECB and others will be. </p>
    
<p>Analysts say the ECB will likely leave rates unchanged when it next meets on July 18, while it awaits further confirmation that inflation is under control.</p><p>“Today’s cut doesn’t necessarily mark the start of an easing cycle,” said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, the Dutch banking firm. </p><p>Though the annual inflation rate for May is well below a peak of 10.6% in October 2022, the decline has slowed in recent months. Inflation even ticked up slightly from 2.4% in April. Inflation in the services sectors, a broad category that includes everything from medical care and haircuts to hotels, restaurants and concert tickets, remains particularly elevated at 4.1%.</p>
    

<p>The ECB’s move represents a switch from the onset of the inflation surge, when the Fed took the lead in tightening credit by raising rates starting in March 2022, sending mortgage costs higher but also boosting returns for savers with money in certificates of deposit or money market funds. The ECB started four months later.</p><p>Major central banks around the world now are leaning toward lowering interest rates. Central banks in smaller economies have already cut rates, including in Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.

Japan, an economic outlier among the world big economies, has started raising rates after years of below-zero rates and low inflation.</p><p>Lower rates can mean lower mortgage costs and credit card charges for consumers.

The U.S. consumer price index is at an annual 3.4%, some way from the Fed’s goal, also 2%.</p>
    

<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the bank expects to cut rates this year from the current benchmark level of 5.25%-5.5%, but no change is expected at the Fed’s policy meeting next week.
