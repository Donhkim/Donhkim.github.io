<ol>
<li><strong>President Biden announces expansive immigration action</strong>: President Joe Biden has ordered a program to offer potential citizenship to hundreds of thousands of immigrants without legal status in the US, aiming to balance his recent crackdown on the southern border.</li>
<li><strong>Eligible immigrants can apply for permanent residency and eventual citizenship</strong>: The program will allow certain US citizens' spouses without legal status to apply for permanent residency and eventually citizenship without having to depart the country first. This could affect around half a million immigrants.</li>
<li><strong>Set up as a political contrast with Trump</strong>: Biden's action sets up a significant political contrast with presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has taken a hardline stance on immigration and has called for mass deportations and portrayed migrants as dangerous criminals.</li>
<li><strong>Criticism from Trump</strong>: Trump has criticized Biden's handling of immigration and vowed to "rip up" the new policy if he is re-elected. Trump has accused Biden of supporting "amnesty" and has promised to strengthen border security.</li>
<li><strong>Latino organizations plan to mobilize immigrant communities</strong>: The new policy is expected to trigger a months-long effort by Latino organizations to encourage immigrants to apply for the program and to mobilize communities to advocate for immigration reform.</li>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a></span> ordered expansive election-year action Tuesday to offer potential citizenship to hundreds of thousands of immigrants without legal status in the U.S., aiming to balance his recent <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-asylum-ban-halt-border-mexico-1905e3565b2da1cffb8f38a778c07118">aggressive crackdown on the southern border</a></span> that enraged advocates and many Democratic lawmakers.</p><p>The president announced that his administration will, in the coming months, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/president-joe-biden-immigration-border-dreamers-509d520529867db6a77ddcf2dcebe2a3">allow certain U.S. citizens’ spouses</a></span> without legal status to apply for permanent residency and eventually citizenship without having to first depart the country. The action by Biden, a Democrat, could affect upwards of half a million immigrants, according to senior administration officials.</p><p>“The Statue of Liberty is not some relic of American history. It still stands for who we are,” Biden said from a crowded East Room at the White House, filled with advocates, congressional Democrats and immigrants who would be eligible for the program. “But I also refuse to believe that for us to continue to be America that embraces immigration, we have to give up securing our border. They’re false choices.”</p>
    

<p>Biden’s action, which amounts to the most expansive federal protection for immigrants in over a decade, sets up a significant political contrast with presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, whose hardline stance on immigration includes a push for mass deportations and rhetoric casting migrants as dangerous criminals “poisoning the blood” of America.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Biden accused “my predecessor” of preying on fears about immigrants as he chastised Trump administration moves, such as a zero-tolerance policy at the southern border that led to the separation of families. But Trump has leaned into his own policies as Biden has faced disapproval of his handling of immigration throughout his presidency. At a rally in Racine, Wisconsin, on Tuesday, Trump proclaimed, “When I’m reelected, Joe Biden’s illegal amnesty plan will be ripped up and thrown out on the very first day that we’re back in office.”</p>
    
<p>Because the shadow of a second Trump administration looms over Biden’s new policy, Tuesday’s actions will set off a months-long sprint by Latino organizations to get as many people to apply for the program as possible before next January.</p>
    

<p>To qualify for Biden’s actions, an immigrant must have lived in the United States for 10 years and be married to a U.S. citizen, both as of Monday. If a qualifying immigrant’s application is approved, he or she would have three years to apply for a green card and receive a temporary work permit and be shielded from deportation in the meantime.</p><p>About 50,000 noncitizen children with parents who are married to U.S. citizen could also potentially qualify for the process, according to senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity. There is no requirement on how long the couple must have been married, but no one becomes eligible after Monday. That means immigrants who reach that 10-year mark after Monday will not qualify for the program, according to the officials.</p>
    

<p>Senior administration officials said they anticipate the process will be open for applications by the end of the summer. Fees to apply have yet to be determined.</p><p>Biden formally unveiled his plans at a Tuesday <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/president-joe-biden-immigration-border-immigrants-11486c86ba620a04ae9dc66a3d44f346">event at the White House</a></span>, which also marked the 12th anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, a popular Obama-era directive that offered deportation protections and temporary work permits for young immigrants who lack legal status.</p><p>The announcement was welcome news to families with mixed immigration status, such as Antonio and Brenda Valle in Los Angeles. They have been married for nearly 12 years and have two sons who are U.S. citizens, but they have lived with the worry every two years that Brenda Valle’s status as a DACA recipient will not be renewed.</p><p>“We can start planning more long-term, for the future, instead of what we can do for the next two years,” she said.</p><p>Foday Turay was among those invited to the White House Tuesday for the announcement. He came to the U.S. when he was 10 years old from Sierra Leone, and is now a father to a young son and married to a third-generation U.S. citizen. Although he’s enrolled in DACA and working as an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia, his status doesn’t provide relief from the constant worry of deportation.</p>
    

<p>“My wife is tremendously impacted by this,” Turay said Tuesday before the ceremony. “You know, every day she talks to me about what’s going to happen. What if I get deported? You know, how are we going to raise our son? What country are we going to raise him?” </p><p>Republicans were making their own sharp contrasts with Biden’s plan. In a likely preview of GOP campaign ads, Rep. Richard Hudson, chair of House Republicans’ campaign arm, called the Biden policy a “mass amnesty plan.” Other Republicans, such as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, anticipated that this latest directive would be struck down by the courts.</p>
    

<p>Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who is under consideration to be Trump’s pick for vice president, forcefully advocated for legislation in 2012 that would have offered legal status to young immigrants, but on Tuesday he said “the world is different” now because immigration numbers have risen.</p><p>Tuesday’s announcement came two weeks after <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-asylum-migration-immigration-mexico-border-dec5f83b468b5795479bf1f5e49799d5">Biden unveiled a sweeping crackdown</a></span> at the U.S.-Mexico border that effectively halted asylum claims for those arriving between officially designated ports of entry. Immigrant-rights groups <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/president-joe-biden-immigration-asylum-border-50d007832d87078bf74971aefe7d4e14">have sued the Biden administration</a></span> over that directive, which a senior administration official said Monday had led to fewer border encounters between ports.</p><p>Biden’s allies believe that the approach he is taking with his twin actions on immigration this month will resonate with voters. </p><p>“The only party that is being serious about border security is the Democrats. The only party that’s being thoughtful and compassionate about what to do with people who are living in the shadows are the Democrats,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who helped author a bipartisan border bill earlier this year. “The Republican Party has decided to take a walk on border security.”</p><p>Among advocates, Gustavo Torres, the executive director of CASA, said Biden’s announcement would energize Latino communities to get out and support him.</p><p>“This is what our communities have needed to rally behind President Biden for reelection,” he said.</p><p>Biden also announced new regulations that will allow certain <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals-program">DACA beneficiaries</a></span> and other young immigrants to more easily qualify for long-established work visas. That would allow qualifying immigrants to have protection that is sturdier than the work permits offered by DACA, which is currently facing legal challenges and is no longer taking new applications.</p><p>The power that Biden is invoking with his Tuesday announcement for spouses is not a novel one. The policy would expand on authority used by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama to allow “parole in place” for family members of military members, said Andrea Flores, a former policy adviser in the Obama and Biden administrations who is now a vice president at FWD.us, an immigration advocacy organization.</p><p>The parole-in-place process allows qualifying immigrants to get on the path to U.S. permanent residency without leaving the country, removing a common barrier for those without legal status but married to Americans. Flores called it “the biggest win for the immigrant rights movement since the announcement of DACA 12 years ago.”</p><p>The same progressives who were infuriated with Biden’s asylum order praised the president on Tuesday. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who leads the Congressional Progressive Caucus, commended Biden and said the actions would help keep American families together. </p><p>“Many Americans would be shocked to hear that when a U.S. citizen marries an undocumented person, their spouse is not automatically eligible for citizenship,” she said. ”Imagine loving someone, marrying them, and then still continuing to fear you would be separated from them.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Christine Fernando in Racine, Wis., Valerie Gonzalez in McAllen, Texas, and Stefanie Dazio in Los Angeles contributed to this report.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has written a memoir, "On Call: A Doctor's Journey in Public Service", which chronicles his public service career.</li>
<li>Fauci has been in the public eye for decades, but became a household name during the COVID-19 pandemic as a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.</li>

            Fauci was in the public eye for decades as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health,<strong> </strong>but he<strong> </strong>became a veritable household name at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as part of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, which was charged with monitoring and mitigating the spread of the virus.
    </p>

            Fauci spoke frequently to the worried and bewildered American public at government news conferences, giving status updates and offering guidance on face masks, social distancing, school closures, hospitalization rates and, eventually, vaccines. Many credit him with helping the country navigate the uncharted waters of the coronavirus crisis with his medical expertise, calm demeanor and signature Brooklyn-tinged gravelly voice.
    </p>

            At the same time, Fauci was navigating his own political headwinds – some from his boss, former President Donald Trump, who tried to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/19/politics/donald-trump-anthony-fauci-coronavirus/index.html">play down the threat</a> of SARS-CoV-2 even as he initiated <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/29/politics/operation-warp-speed-coronavirus-vaccine/index.html">Operation Warp Speed</a>, the $10 billion-plus public-private partnership focused on rapidly developing vaccines as well as therapeutics.

            Speaking to CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Fauci described how “painful” it was at one point to correct Trump about hydroxychloroquine to prevent Covid-19 during a news conference early in the pandemic, a move that upset some of the President’s aides.
    </p>

            But Trump’s attention was elsewhere, Fauci said: When he called the doctor to his office, the President surprised him by talking about how many people were watching the news conferences.
    </p>

            As the pandemic continued, many coronavirus deniers, conspiracy theorists and antivaxxers blamed Fauci personally for struggles with school closures, mask mandates and vaccine recommendations. Even now, Fauci recently testified, he still <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/fauci-covid-19-pandemic-hearing-threats-cnntv/index.html">faces death threats</a>.

            The pandemic was not the first time Fauci found himself in the center of a political and medical maelstrom. He was in the hot seat during the HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s, when his agency spearheaded the effort to fight the widening epidemic. HIV/AIDS activists called him and the entire medical establishment out for not doing enough or moving quickly enough to help people infected with the virus.

            Yet throughout his career, Fauci seems to have taken public criticism in stride and used it, even, to build something better. It was an attitude he learned in childhood.

            “The Jesuit priests, when you thought that all of a sudden the whole world was pounding on you, they would say ‘Illegitimi non carborundum,’<em> </em>which means ‘don’t let the bastards wear you down,’ which … lately, that is a very relevant and appropriate saying,” Fauci told Gupta.

            Fauci recently sat down for a conversation with Gupta — one of the many they have shared over the years — to discuss his life’s work and his legacy. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity.

            <strong>Dr. Sanjay Gupta:</strong> You talk about this interesting press briefing that you did. This is in March of 2020. And you had to correct the record, even if the President was talking. How challenging is that?
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxknm0fy00053b6jd3ytpzj8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            <strong>Dr. Anthony Fauci</strong>: I said to myself, “I have a responsibility to preserve my own personal integrity and a responsibility to the American public.” … So when I walked up to the podium, I said, “Here it goes!”
    </p>

            That was painful to me, to have to do that, but there was no doubt that I had to do it. I mean, it wasn’t like, “Well, maybe you should, and maybe you shouldn’t.” There was no doubt that I had to do it, because I would actually be just relinquishing my responsibility. And what happened is that the President was less upset about that than the people around him, who <em>really</em> got upset.
    </p>

            But then he called me in his office once when he wanted to ask me another question, and he was looking at three different televisions, and he says, “My God, these ratings are amazing. They’re better than cable; they’re better than network.”
    </p>

            The President — it’s no secret. I’m not divulging a secret about the President — he was very, very fixated on image and ratings. And he thought that the amount of attention that was given to the press briefings was really terrific.

            <strong>Gupta:</strong> I want to talk about the 54 years of public service — almost 40 years, as you say, as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Go back to June 5, 1981. That was a date you really talked a lot about in the book. What’s the significance of that?
    </p>

            <strong>Fauci: </strong>I was in my office in the clinical center at the NIH, and I read the June 5 [<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5021a1.htm#:~:text=Twenty%20years%20ago%2C%20on%20June,homosexuals%22%3B%20two%20had%20died." target="_blank">issue of the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</a>, which described five cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia among five gay men in LA] and I looked at it and I said, “Gosh, what a curiosity. This is strange that they’re all gay men.” But maybe there was talk about using poppers or drugs to enhance your sexual experience that maybe somehow had the collateral effect of suppressing their immune system.
    </p>

            But it bothered me. Boy, you really have got to suppress the immune system a lot to get pneumocystis [a serious lung infection caused by a common fungus]. … So I put it aside, saying “it’s probably a fluke, and it’s just going to disappear.”
    </p>

            The real transforming thing came one month later, in July of 1981, when <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/1265" target="_blank">the second MMWR</a> came; this time, 26 — curiously — all young, otherwise healthy gay men, not only from L.A. but from San Francisco and New York City, who presented not only with pneumocystis but with Kaposi’s sarcoma and multiple other opportunistic infections.

            I can say — retrospectively, when you try to evaluate the different landmarks in your life, in your career — reading that MMWR totally transformed my professional career because I made the decision right there, even though I had a very successful career up to that point … I said, “this is a brand new disease.  And even though I don’t know what it is, there’s no doubt it’s an infection. … And it seems to be destroying the immune system.” And here I am: boards in internal medicine, boards in infectious diseases, boards in clinical immunology. I said, “If there’s one disease that I have to study, is this disease.”

            <strong>Gupta:</strong> I don’t think many people who sort of know you from Covid realize that in many ways, you went through some of these same challenges before with HIV/AIDS. Not just new disease, trying to find new therapeutics, but the activists. What was that part of your life like?
    </p>

            <strong>Fauci:</strong> Well, naturally, people ask about the difference or similarity between the pushing back against me and the government in HIV and pushing back against the government and me as the face of Covid. … It is as different as peanuts and watermelons.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxjjc3zi000m3b6jwm5hbkt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            It just is very different because the [HIV/AIDS] activists were trying to get the attention of the authorities, the scientific authorities and the regulatory authorities, that the time-proven way of approaching the development of interventions for a new disease doesn’t work well for a disease that’s rapidly killing themselves and their friends and their loved ones.
    </p>

            So they wanted a seat at the table. … So their confrontation to us was based on a good thing. I think back to <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2020/07/remembering-john-lewis-the-power-of-good-trouble/" target="_blank">John Lewis’ “good trouble”</a> versus bad trouble. They made good trouble for us because they wanted us to just put ourselves in their shoes. …

            Again, one of the best things I did in my career was to, instead of running away from them the way most of the scientific community did … I said to myself, “This can’t work, so let me put aside the theatrics and the disruption and listen to what they have to say.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxjjc3zi000p3b6jvnp12kj6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            And what they had to say made absolutely perfect sense to me. And I said to myself, “If I were in their shoes, I would be doing exactly what they’re doing.” That’s when I invited them in to sit down with us and said “let’s start talking.” … It became such that they became an important part of the community scientific effort to address HIV with therapeutics, with prevention, with regulation, to the point now where they’re on all of our advisory committees. They’re part of the discussion. And quite frankly, many of them turned out to be some of my closest friends.

            <strong>Gupta:</strong> But just to punctuate this point, though, at that time, going back 40 years, did you feel that way, the way you’re describing it now? I mean, this idea that, “Hey, look, there might be something to be gained from these confrontations”?
    </p>

            <strong>Fauci:</strong> The thing that drove me was empathy, which has been something that has driven my motivation about medicine and about anything that I’ve done, that goes back to my family, that I describe in the book: my parents and my training in the Jesuit schools. There’s empathy for people who are in trouble and people who are suffering.

            When you combine empathy with listening to them — just forget the screaming and the yelling. Just listen to what they’re saying. And I’ve got to tell you, it just made perfect sense to me. So my interaction and my response to them, as I often get asked, is dramatically different than someone, on the basis of no evidence, accuses you of killing people or that scene <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/video/dr-fauci-covid-hearing-marjorie-taylor-greene-src-digvid">of Marjorie Taylor Greene at the hearing</a>.

            <strong>Fauci: </strong>I’ve thought about that, and when I think about legacies — I really, honestly mean this — I will leave that to other people to decide. I know what I’ve done … with the development of drugs for HIV, with the development of the vaccine for Covid. I know that, but that’s not [for me to] say, “I want my legacy to be this,” because people are going to have different interpretations of that …

            But what I would want my legacy to be, something that I am certain of, is that I have given it 100% every single day.

I just gave everything I could for the discipline I’m in, which is science, medicine and public health. <em>That’s</em> what I’d like my legacy to be.

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>LAUSD votes to ban cellphone use during school hours</strong>: The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) has voted to ban cellphone use during the school day, effective as early as January 2025. The ban includes not only phones but also social media use.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Possible litigation against social media giants</strong>: The LAUSD is considering litigation against social media companies, accusing them of contributing to children's addiction to social media and creating a "public nuisance".</p>

<p><strong>Concerns about enforcement from some board members</strong>: Only two board members voted against the motion, citing concerns about how difficult it would be for employees to enforce the ban and stay on top of it.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Similar policies already in place at some schools</strong>: Nick Melvoin, the LAUSD school board member who spearheaded the ban, noted that some schools within the district, such as Marina Del Rey Middle School, are already implementing similar policies.</p>

The policy will go into effect as early as January 2025.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Schools will be able to decide how to implement the phone ban, such as requiring that phones be placed in a locker or pouch during the day. The resolution directs staff to develop and present policies and a plan to the public before the board approves them within 120 days.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The plan includes possible litigation against social media giants, which LAUSD accuses of pumping out content, causing kids to become addicted to social media.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"No matter what we bring to the board in the next four months, it will come with an awareness campaign for all stakeholders including students, but advances also the critical element of pursuing litigation against social media giants for their careless, irresponsible and immoral actions that have put kids across the country in the position they're in today," said LAUSD Superintendent Alberto Carvalho.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Only two members voted against the motion, citing how difficult it would be for employees of the second largest school district in the country to enforce the ban and stay on top of it.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Nick Melvoin, the LAUSD school board member for District 4, spearheaded the ban.

I also hear the same, which is that more and more time is being spent on policing student phone use. There's not a coherent enforcement and they're looking for some support from the board and from the district," Melvoin said Tuesday. "The schools that have gone farther and that have already implemented a phone-free school day report incredible results. Kids are happier, they're talking to one another, their academics are up."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The move is drawing mixed reactions from parents. Some want to be able to communicate with their child during schools hours and others think the ban could improve learning and lead to less bullying.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">This comes after <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7.com/post/surgeon-general-vivek-murthy-calls-health-warnings-social/14964380/">U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy's op-ed calling for warning labels for younger users on social media platforms</a>.</p></div><p class="copyright">Copyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

They shook hands and embraced, and Kim later joined Putin in his car to personally guide him to Pyongyang’s Kumsusan State Guest House, North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said. The agency described their meeting as a historic event that demonstrates the “invincibility and durability” of the two nations’ friendship and unity. </p><p>Putin, making his first trip to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/north-korea">North Korea</a></span> in 24 years, said in comments that appeared in its state media hours before he landed that he appreciates the country’s firm support of his <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">military actions in Ukraine</a></span>. The Kremlin launched a full-scale invasion of the neighboring country in 2022.</p>
    

<p>He said the countries would continue to “resolutely oppose” what he described as Western ambitions “to hinder the establishment of a multipolar world order based on justice, mutual respect for sovereignty, considering each other’s interests.”</p>



<p>Putin’s visit comes amid <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-us-munitions-ukraine-war-7091eaba254b680888a9b1ec8a68135f">growing concerns </a></span> about an arms arrangement in which Pyongyang provides Moscow with badly needed munitions to fuel Russia’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">war in Ukraine</a></span> in exchange for economic assistance and technology transfers that would enhance the threat posed by Kim’s nuclear weapons and missile program.</p>
    
<p>In the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, the streets were decorated with portraits of Putin and Russian flags. A banner on a building said: “We warmly welcome the President of the Russian Federation.”</p><p>Putin also said in his published remarks that Russia and North Korea will develop trade and payment systems “that are not controlled by the West” and jointly oppose sanctions against the countries, which he described as “illegal, unilateral restrictions.”</p>
    

<p>North Korea is under heavy U.N. Security Council economic sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile programs, while Russia is also grappling with sanctions by the United States and its Western partners over its aggression in Ukraine.</p><p>Putin said the countries will also expand cooperation in tourism, culture and education.</p><p>Before heading to North Korea, Putin traveled to Yakutsk, a city in eastern Russia, where he met regional Gov. Aisen Nikolayev, and received briefings on technology and defense-related projects. He also met with young professionals working in Russia’s Far East.</p><p>Putin is being accompanied by several top officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Denis Mantrurov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, according to his foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov. He said a number of documents will be signed during the visit, possibly including an agreement on a comprehensive strategic partnership.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

<p>U.S. and South Korean officials accuse the North of providing Russia with artillery, missiles and other military equipment for use in Ukraine, possibly in return for key military technologies and aid. Both Pyongyang and Moscow deny accusations about North Korean weapons transfers, which would violate multiple U.N. Security Council sanctions that Russia previously endorsed.</p><p>Along with China, Russia has provided political cover for Kim’s continuing efforts to advance his nuclear arsenal, repeatedly blocking U.S.-led efforts to impose fresh U.N. sanctions on the North over its weapons tests.</p><p>In March, a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/un-us-north-korea-russia-sanctions-monitoring-72f8cbac116dea7c795d9a3357fc45f3">Russian veto at the United Nations </a></span> ended monitoring of U.N. sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear program, prompting Western accusations that Moscow is seeking to avoid scrutiny as it buys weapons from Pyongyang for use in Ukraine. U.S. and South Korean officials have said they are discussing options for a new mechanism for monitoring the North.</p>
    

<p>Earlier this year, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-putin-limousine-3e8f46cf12bc65b422ee7868e1956d80">Putin sent Kim a high-end Aurus Senat limousine,</a></span> which he had shown to the North Korean leader when they met in September. Observers said the shipment violated a U.N. resolution banning the supply of luxury items to North Korea.</p><p>In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Putin’s visit to North Korea illustrates how Russia tries, “in desperation, to develop and to strengthen relations with countries that can provide it with what it needs to continue the war of aggression that it started against Ukraine.”</p><p>“North Korea is providing significant munitions to Russia ... and other weapons for use in Ukraine. Iran has been providing weaponry, including drones, that have been used against civilians and civilian infrastructure,” Blinken told reporters following a meeting with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday. </p>
    

<p>Stoltenberg reiterated concerns about the “potential support that Russia provides to North Korea when it comes to supporting their missile and nuclear programs.”</p><p>Lim Soosuk, spokesperson of South Korea’s Foreign Ministry, said Seoul has been stressing to Moscow that any cooperation between Russia and North Korea must not “proceed in a direction that violates U.N. Security Council resolutions or undermines peace and stability in the region.”</p><p>Tensions on the Korean Peninsulas are at their highest point in years, with the pace of both Kim’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-missile-test-kim-jong-un-tensions-89bbe080f9670093a4d9b47e66fd65fc">weapons tests and combined military exercises</a></span> involving the United States, South Korea and Japan intensifying in a tit-for-tat cycle.

Moscow’s ties with North Korea weakened after the 1991 Soviet collapse. Kim Jong Un first met with Putin in 2019 in Russia’s eastern port of Vladivostok.</p><p>After North Korea, the Kremlin said Putin will also visit Vietnam for talks that are expected to be focused on trade. The United States, which has spent years strengthening ties and accelerating trade with Vietnam, criticized Putin’s planned visit.</p><p>“As Russia continues to seek international support to sustain its illegal and brutal war against Ukraine, we reiterate that no country should give Putin a platform to promote his war of aggression and otherwise allow him to normalize his atrocities,” a U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Vietnam said in a statement.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel have regularly traded fire across the Israel-Lebanon border over the last eight months. Last week, the Lebanese group fired hundreds of rockets and drones at Israeli military sites after one of its commanders was killed.</p>
<p>Speaking after meeting with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a close ally of Hezbollah, Hochstein called for “urgent” de-escalation.</p>
<p>“We have seen an escalation over the last few weeks. And what President Biden wants to do is avoid a further escalation to a greater war,” Hochstein told reporters.</p>

<p>The US envoy had travelled to Beirut following <a href="/news/2024/6/17/us-envoy-meets-with-israeli-leaders-as-tensions-with-hezbollah-escalate">meetings in Israel</a> on Monday. Israel’s Haaretz reported that he had warned Israeli officials that continuing the Israeli-Hezbollah confrontation could lead to a “wide-scale Iranian attack”.</p>
<p>In Beirut, Hochstein said it is in “everyone’s interest” to resolve the conflict quickly and diplomatically. “That is both achievable and it is urgent.”</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<h2 id="iplomatic-framework">‘Diplomatic framework’</h2>
<p>Hochstein’s visit came Hezbollah unilaterally suspended its attacks for two days during the Eid al-Adha Muslim holiday, which began on Sunday. But that pause ended on Tuesday with Hezbollah saying that it targeted an Israeli tank with a suicide drone.</p>
<p>The Lebanese group also released a nine-minute video of what it said was footage its surveillance drones brought back from Israel. The video showed and identified military facilities in the north of the country as well as key infrastructure in Haifa – Israel’s third largest city – including a power plant and commercial port.</p>
<p>Hezbollah has said it will not halt its attacks into northern Israel unless there is a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said Hezbollah was boasting about the footage it captured from the Haifa port and threatening to attack international companies in it.</p>
<p>“We are very close to the moment of decision to change the rules against Hezbollah <a href="/features/2024/6/7/explainer-are-lebanon-and-israel-on-the-cusp-of-war">and Lebanon</a>. In an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed and Lebanon will be severely hit,” Katz wrote in a social media post on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“The State of Israel will pay a price on the front and home fronts, but with a strong and united nation, and the full power of the [Israeli military], we will restore security to the residents of the north.</p>
<p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also <a href="/news/2024/6/5/netanyahu-says-israel-prepared-for-very-intense-operation-near-lebanon">said</a> earlier this month that “one way or another, we will restore security to the north”, and his hardline nationalist coalition partners have called for an aggressive military response.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said on Monday that it killed a “central operative” in Hezbollah’s rocket division in a drone strike.</p>
<p>The US State Department said late on Monday that it is advancing a proposal to avert a large-scale conflict.</p>
<p>“There is a diplomatic framework that we believe is reachable that would resolve this conflict without a full-on war,” a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>In Beirut, Hochstein called for the adoption of the Gaza <a href="/news/2024/6/17/us-says-hamas-is-to-blame-for-ceasefire-delay-but-is-it-hamas-or-israel">ceasefire proposal</a> being pushed by Biden’s administration in the hope that it would quickly bring peace across the “Blue Line”, referring to the disputed Israel-Lebanon border.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<p>“A ceasefire in Gaza and, or, an alternative diplomatic solution could also bring the conflict across the Blue Line to an end” and allow the return of displaced civilians to southern Lebanon and northern Israel, he said.</p>
<p>Hezbollah recently said that it has carried out more than 2,100 military operations against Israel since October 8. The Lebanese group started its attacks with the outbreak of the war in Gaza in what it says is an effort to support Palestinians.</p>
<p>The Israel-Lebanon border violence has killed at least 473 people on the Lebanese side, most of them fighters but also including 92 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>
<p>Israeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country’s north.</p>
