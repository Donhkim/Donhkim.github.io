She testified that she discovered her husband was using drugs when she found a crack pipe in an ashtray on their porch on July 3, 2015, a day after their anniversary. When she confronted him, “he acknowledged smoking crack,” she said.</p><p></p><p>The trial has quickly become a highly personal and detailed tour of the mistakes and drug use of Hunter Biden, whose struggles have been tabloid fodder for years and were used publicly by Republicans, including in their stalled impeachment effort against the president.</p><p></p><p>The proceedings are unfolding as <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024">the 2024 election</a></span> looms, and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-hunter-laptop-ba96537a686d04dc3773552cfa13deeb">allies worry about the toll it will take on President Joe Biden</a></span>, who is deeply concerned about the health and sustained sobriety of his only living son.

<p></p><p>Buhle, who was subpoenaed, was on the stand for about 20 minutes. She remained composed but seemed upset as she recounted how she searched his car about a dozen times for drugs, whenever the children were driving it.</p>
    

<p></p><p>“Did you ever see Hunter using drugs?” defense attorney Abbe Lowell asked Buhle.</p><p></p><p>“No,” she replied.</p>
    

<p></p><p>Then prosecutor Leo Wise asked Buhle how she knew Hunter was using drugs.</p><p></p><p>“He told me,” she said.</p>
    


    

<p></p><p>Prosecutors also called Zoe Kesten, who testified under immunity and matter-of-factly about meeting Hunter Biden in December 2017 at a strip club in New York where she worked. During a private session, he pulled out a pipe and began smoking what she assumed was crack.</p><p></p><p>Jurors were also shown a photo of Hunter, bare-chested in a bubble bath they shared, but he was cropped out of other images of a crack pipe in a hotel bathroom.</p><p></p><p>“He was incredibly charming and charismatic and friendly, and I felt really safe around him,” she said. “I remember after he had smoked it, nothing had changed. He was the same charming person.”</p><p></p><p>Kesten detailed for jurors when she saw him use drugs, buy drugs, talk about drugs or possess drug paraphernalia. Prosecutors asked her where he stored his drugs and pipes, and she testified he kept them in pouches and other places, such as a sunglasses cases.</p>
    

<p></p><p>On cross-examination, Kestan acknowledged that she had no contact with him in October 2018, the period when he bought the gun.</p>
    

<p></p><p>Jurors have been shown dozens of pages of Hunter Biden’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-ukraine-firm-memoir-beautiful-things-40d98f7edf2e72f84ba2f12856327c5e">memoir, “Beautiful Things,”</a></span> written in 2021 after he got sober. And they heard lengthy audio excerpts from the book, which traces his descent into addiction following <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-d8f69eb645d74b7886387f713981b739">the death of his brother</a></span>, Beau Biden, in 2015 from cancer. The memoir covers the period he bought the gun, though it doesn’t mention the weapon specifically.</p><p></p><p>Lowell has said Hunter Biden’s state of mind was different when he wrote the book than when he purchased the gun, when he didn’t believe he had an addiction. And the prosecutors must prove he had a drug problem when he filled out the document at the time of purchase. </p><p></p><p>An FBI agent, Erika Jensen, testified about her job to establish that Hunter Biden had a drug problem when he purchased the gun in October 2018. Lowell went through a large number of Hunter’s texts to establish that there were few messages that involved seeking or using drugs in the weeks before the gun purchase. He also raised questions about how the FBI could prove Hunter Biden was being truthful with family when he texted about seeking or using drugs.</p><p></p><p>And he pointed out several liquor store purchases in October 2018, the month Hunter Biden bought the gun. Lowell has suggested that references in his memoir to “relapsing” refer to alcohol abuse, not drug use. A drinking problem does not preclude the purchase of a gun.</p><p></p><p>The Delaware trial comes after the collapse of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-plea-deal-taxes-gun-drugs-690d38f1ffae4dfce2c171d21e7d3594">a plea deal with prosecutors</a></span> that would have resolved the gun case and a separate California tax case and avoided the spectacle of a trial. Hunter Biden has since pleaded not guilty and has said he’s being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans slammed the now-defunct plea agreement as a sweetheart deal for the Democratic president’s son.</p><p></p><p>In Congress, Republicans have for months pursued an impeachment inquiry seeking to tie the Democratic president to his son’s business dealings. So far, GOP lawmakers have failed to uncover evidence directly implicating President Biden in any wrongdoing. But on Wednesday, House Republicans accused Hunter and the president’s brother James Biden <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-impeachment-house-republicans-hunter-james-e310269a42abd4a28a7e105b43f9c05a">of making false statements</a></span> to Congress as part of the inquiry.</p><p></p><p>In the trial, Jensen, the FBI agent, read aloud some of Hunter Biden’s personal messages, including some that came from a laptop he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. In 2020, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-wilmington-elections-coronavirus-pandemic-45e0fe89ff7302a2a14afdba2d91b531">the contents</a></span> made their way to Republicans and were publicly leaked, revealing some highly personal messages about his work and his life. He has since sued over the leaked information.</p><p></p><p>Prosecutors asked whether there was any evidence to suggest the laptop had been tampered with, and Jensen said no. But under questioning from Lowell, she conceded there was no way to verify whether it had been altered.</p><p></p><p>In addition, jurors are expected to hear from the James Biden, who is close with Hunter and helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past. They will also get details on how Beau Biden’s widow, Hallie Biden, became addicted to crack during a brief relationship with Hunter after her husband’s death.</p><p></p><p>Hallie took the gun from Hunter and tossed it into the garbage at a nearby market, afraid of what he might do with it. The weapon was later found by someone collecting cans and eventually turned over to police.</p><p></p><p>First lady Jill Biden went to court for the third consecutive day to support Hunter, ahead of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-france-ukraine-896f00db3dcb40e2f165bd7ddecd1347">her trip to France to meet President Joe Biden</a></span>, who was in Europe to mark the anniversary of D-Day.</p><p></p><p>If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it’s unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.</p><p></p><p>The trial is unfolding shortly after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0">convicted of 34 felonies</a></span> in New York City.

            The 12-month heat streak was “shocking but not surprising” given human-caused climate change, said Carlo Buontempo, the director of Copernicus, who warned of worse to come. Unless planet-warming fossil fuel pollution is slashed, “this string of hottest months will be remembered as comparatively cold,” he said.

            Copernicus released its data the same day as United Nations Secretary General António Guterres made an impassioned speech in New York about climate change, slamming fossil fuel companies as the “godfathers of climate chaos” and, for the first time, explicitly calling on all countries to ban advertising their fossil fuel products.

            Guterres urged world leaders to swiftly take control of the spiraling climate crisis or face dangerous tipping points. “We are playing Russian roulette with our planet,” he said Wednesday. “We need an exit ramp off the highway to climate hell.”

            The recent heat offers “a window into the future with extreme heat that challenges the limits of human survivability,” said Ben Clarke, a researcher at Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute. “It is vital people understand that every tenth of a degree of warming exposes more people to dangerous and potentially deadly heat,” he told CNN.

            Humanity is having an outsized impact on the<strong> </strong>world, he said, likening it to the meteor that began the process of wiping out dinosaurs 66 million years ago.

            Global temperatures are expected to start dropping below record-breaking levels in the next few months as El Niño — a natural climate phenomenon that tends to boost the planet’s average temperature — weakens.

            But that won’t mean an end to the long-term trend of rising temperatures as humans continue to burn planet-heating fossil fuels. “While this sequence of record-breaking months will eventually be interrupted, the overall signature of climate change remains and there is no sign in sight of a change in such a trend,” Buontempo said.

            Guterres’ speech also referenced new data released by the World Meteorological Organization, which found a nearly 86% chance that at least one of the years between 2024 and 2028 will break the hottest-year record, set in 2023.
    </p>

            The WMO also calculated a nearly 50% chance that global average temperatures over the entire five-year period between 2024 and 2028 would be more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. That would bring the world closer to breaching the longer-term 1.5-degree limit at the heart of the Paris Agreement.

            Guterres laid blame for the climate crisis firmly at the doorstep of fossil fuel companies that “rake in record profits and feast off trillions in taxpayer-funded subsidies,” he said.

            These companies have spent billions of dollars over decades “distorting the truth, deceiving the public and sowing doubt,” he added.

            He called on world leaders to take immediate action, including huge cuts in planet-heating pollution and an immediate end to any new coal projects.

            “We cannot accept a future where the rich are protected in air-conditioned bubbles, while the rest of humanity is lashed by lethal weather in unliveable lands,” Guterres said.

            The issue, now before Cannon in the Southern District of Florida federal court, is likely to remain in the political debate at least until Cannon holds a hearing on the legal power of the special counsel to prosecute a defendant, on June 21.

            Cannon has already taken a drastically different tack from other trial-level federal judges who have handled criminal cases charged by recent special counsel’s offices – of which there have been five since Trump became president.

            While others have moved swiftly to trial – including special counsel David Weiss trying his case against Hunter Biden in Delaware this week, eight months after indictment – Cannon has moved slowly on pre-trial issues from Trump and his two co-defendants. Many of the most substantive legal questions to be decided in the classified records case, which the Justice Department first brought against Trump last June, aren’t yet ripe for a decision.
    </p>

            And it is highly unusual for a federal trial judge to allow a third-party group unaffiliated with a criminal case to argue in court as part of a defendant’s legal challenges to the case itself. That work is essentially reserved for defendants’ teams to bring and argue in courts across the country, opposite Justice Department prosecutors. Allowing third parties to argue in court is even rare in appeals situations.

            “The fact these motions are even being entertained with a hearing is itself ridiculous. That third parties are being allowed to opine at the hearing is absurd,” Bradley Moss, a national security law expert based in Washington, DC, told CNN.

            But Cannon has been convinced by three separate groups of lawyers that they should be able to argue before her. Two of those groups support Trump’s position to dismiss the case against him and say the special counsel, for various constitutional reasons, doesn’t have authority to prosecute. A third group says the Department of Justice’s use of a special counsel should be upheld.

            Two former Republican-appointed US attorneys general, Edwin Meese and Michael Mukasey, are part of the groups of so-called “friends of the court” that side with Trump and whom Cannon will hear from. The three groups will be allowed to argue, in addition to Justice Department and defendants’ lawyers, for 30 minutes each, according to the court record.

            Trump’s legal team is angling to convince the judge to force the government to turn over <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/16/politics/trump-white-house-records-mar-a-lago-documents-case/index.html">more records from far-flung offices</a> of the executive branch.

<h2>A CHALLENGE FOR BIDEN AMONG DEMOCRATS AND LATINOS</h2>
    
<p>The border has been a top issue for voters throughout the presidential campaign so far.</p><p>According to Gallup’s monthly data, Americans named immigration as the top issue facing the country in February, March, and April, surpassing even the share who cited the economy despite persistently higher prices. Immigration came up less frequently as a top issue in Gallup’s May poll as attention turned to Trump’s criminal trial and as the number of illegal crossings ebbed. The issue was still tied with the government and the economy as what voters saw as the nation’s most important problem. </p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

<p>Most Americans, 56%, say Biden’s presidency has hurt the country on the issue of immigration and border security, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in April. That’s far higher than the number — 37% — who said the same about Trump’s time in office.</p><p>Even among Democrats, only about 3 in 10 say that Biden’s presidency has done more to help the country on immigration and border security, while about the same share say it has hurt. Nearly 9 in 10 Republicans say Trump’s presidency helped on this issue.</p>



<p>Hispanic adults are also more likely to think Trump’s presidency helped the country with immigration and border security, compared to Biden’s. About half of Hispanic adults in March said that Biden’s presidency had done more to hurt the country on immigration and border security — a potentially alarming number as Trump’s campaign works to chip away at Democrats’ advantage with Hispanic voters.</p><p>“President Biden had no choice. He saw what was going on at the border. The numbers were higher than ever in terms of people trying to come here to seek asylum, and he knew he had to do something,” said Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist.</p>
    


    

<p>Frank Luntz, a longtime pollster who has previously worked for Republicans, said immigration seemed to be especially resonating earlier this spring across the political spectrum in a way it never had before.</p><p>He said he believes Biden is especially vulnerable with African American men under 40 who are worried about newcomers competing for jobs and Latinos who may resent those entering illegally.</p><p>“The reason why immigration matters so much to so many is that it is a living, breathing illustration of the failure of Washington to solve what everyone else in America sees as a crisis,” he said Tuesday. “Biden‘s decision seems too little and too late. The public doesn’t think he cares, and therefore thinks he doesn’t get it.”</p>

<p>“This executive order from Biden can only be understood as a pro-invasion, pro-illegal migration executive order,” said former Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller, who orchestrated some of Trump’s most hard-line immigration policies, during a call with reporters organized by the campaign ahead of Biden’s announcement.</p><p>Trump pollster John McLaughlin said the campaign believes the issue resonates especially among a group he calls “safety moms” — suburban, college-educated women who are worried about crime and the safety of their families.</p><p>“There’s a sense of insecurity,” he said. “It’s not just the border communities, it’s all over the country.”</p><p>Trump has always turned to alarmist rhetoric on the border in election years. The difference now, according to Trump campaign aides and pollsters, is the reality voters are seeing day to day.</p><p>Crime overall is down and immigrants — even those who entered the country illegally — commit fewer crimes than those born in the U.S., according to studies of available data. But in Democratic-led cities like New York, local news reports were flooded earlier this year with images of migrants clashing with police and alarm over strained city budgets and resources to care for an influx of people coming from the border.</p><p>Conservative media and Trump’s campaign also seized on high-profile incidents like the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/laken-riley-university-georgia-death-nursing-student-a88e92600ab4dcce1a88e121b7b9c722">killing of nursing student Laken Riley</a></span>.

<li>
<p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has made his first public appearance since being seriously wounded in an assassination attempt three weeks ago. He made a prerecorded speech on his Facebook page, ahead of the European Parliament election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fico stated that the attack has caused serious damage to his health and that it will be a small miracle if he returns to work in several weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fico revealed that he is planning to return to work at the end of June or beginning of July. He also expressed forgiveness towards his attacker and has no plans to take legal action against him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fico blamed the opposition and others, alleging that his attacker was a "messenger of evil and political hatred" due to his views on Russia's war on Ukraine and other issues that differ from the European mainstream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fico has been recovering from multiple wounds after being shot in the abdomen while greeting supporters in the town of Handlova on May 15. The attacker, identified as 71-year-old Juraj C, was arrested on the spot and charged with attempted premeditated murder.</p>

<p>Fico has been recovering from multiple wounds after being shot in the abdomen as he greeted supporters on May 15 in the town of Handlova, about 140km (87 miles) northeast of the capital, Bratislava.</p>
<p>The attacker, identified by prosecutors as 71-year-old Juraj C, was arrested on the spot and charged with attempted premeditated murder.</p>
<p>Seemingly in good shape as he spoke, Fico pledged to be back at work at the end of June or beginning of July, and said he felt “no hatred” towards his attacker.</p>
<p>“I forgive him,” he said, adding he planned no legal action against the assailant.</p>

<p>Still, he slammed the opposition and others, saying: “After all, it’s evident that he only was a messenger of evil and political hatred.”</p>
<p>Fico suggested that his views of Russia’s war on Ukraine and other issues that sharply differ from the European mainstream had made him a victim.</p>
<p>Fico was released from hospital in the central city of Banska Bystrica last week, and taken to his home in Bratislava, where he continues to recuperate.</p>

<p>Fico immediately underwent a five-hour surgery, followed by another two-hour surgery two days later.</p>
<p>The incident has highlighted the deep polarisation of politics in the central European country of 5.4 million people.</p>
<p>Opposition parties have led protests against Fico’s government as it shifts policy by stopping military aid to Ukraine, ending a special prosecutor’s office despite rule of law concerns, and revamping the state television and radio broadcaster.</p>

            The bulletin, released by the Office of the Director for National Intelligence, warns that Beijing has used private companies that often hide their ties to the Chinese military to attract western pilots, contacting them via headhunters or professional networking sites and offering “lucrative contracts and the opportunity to fly exotic aircraft.” Military pilots, flight engineers, and air operations center personnel, as well as “technical experts with insight into Western military tactics,” it said, have been “the most sought-after targets.”

            These private companies have set up notionally independent operations in third countries like South Africa, Singapore and Laos, according to the US official. Former western pilots — which number at least in the dozens — are training Chinese military officials who then return to China and, in turn, train more pilots there, this person said.

            The US has sought to crack down on the tactic, in part by sanctioning some of the third-party companies. But China has adapted, according to intelligence officials.
    </p>

            “There have been efforts to incorporate entities in different locations under different names,” said an NCSC official. “There have also been variations in recruitment pitches and approaches.”

            The bulletin caps years of growing concern by the US and its allies that the PLA was seeking to gain insight into western military tactics and technology by recruiting its former pilots.

            It also comes as tensions have continued to grow between China and Taiwan, just weeks after China launched large-scale military drills surrounding the island in what it said was punishment for “separatist acts” after Taiwan elected a new president.

            Adm. John Aquilino, the former head of US Indo-Pacific Command, told Congress in March that combined, the PLA Navy and PLA Air Force “constitute the largest aviation force in the Indo-Pacific.”

            In September, Gen. Charles Q. Brown — then the Air Force chief of staff and now the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff — <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/08/politics/us-general-china-service-members-warning/index.html">warned in a letter</a> to the Air Force that foreign companies were “targeting and recruiting US and NATO-training military talent” to assist the People’s Liberation Army.

            “By essentially training the trainer, many of those who accept contracts with these foreign companies are eroding our national security, putting the very safety of their fellow servicemembers and the country at risk, and may be violating the law,” Brown said. “Just as I am asking for your help, I have also asked for help from our allied Air Chiefs to address the same issue within their ranks.

            The issue burst into the public consciousness in October of 2022, when former US Marine fighter jet pilot <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/12/australia/duggan-us-marine-pilot-australia-chinese-hacker-intl-latam/index.html">Daniel Duggan was arrested in Australia</a> for allegedly training PLA pilots how to land on aircraft carriers.

            He has been held in a maximum-security prison in Australia since 2022, CNN has previously reported, after he worked in Beijing for six years. An indictment in 2017 alleged that Duggan trained Chinese pilots while he was still a US citizen, between November 2009 and November 2012.
    </p>

            That same month, the UK Ministry of Defense issued a security alert after several of its military pilots were also found to have been training the PLA Air Force. The pilots had been contracted through a private South African company that offered high salaries. Canada and Australia announced investigations into the practice that same year.
    </p>

            The US is seeking Duggan’s extradition and is awaiting a final decision from the Australian Attorney General. The Arms Export Control Act, which bans weapons sales, also prohibits the training of foreign military personnel without explicit authorization.

            The bulletin on Wednesday also comes after multiple US service members have been arrested for allegedly leaking classified intelligence to China. In March, a US Army sergeant was charged with allegedly leaking classified information about advanced US weapons in exchange for $42,000.
    </p>

            Matt Olson, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for national security, said in a press conference at the time that the charges against the two sailors “demonstrate the (People’s Republic of China’s) determination to obtain information that is critical to our national defense by any means, so it can be used to their advantage.”
