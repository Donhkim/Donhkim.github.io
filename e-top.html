                                        <p>OBBÜRGEN, Switzerland (AP) — Nearly 80 countries called Sunday for the “territorial integrity” of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">Ukraine</a></span> to be the basis for any peace agreement to end Russia’s two-year war, though some key developing nations at a Swiss conference did not join in. The way forward for diplomacy remains unclear.</p><p>The joint communique capped a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-ukraine-peace-summit-switzerland-biden-41cb00bba18a80ca88abf9e5b378110a">two-day conference</a></span> marked by <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-putin-switzerland-peace-conference-3e88cb56e3bd66bb37acd99b2e9425c5">the absence of Russia,</a></span> which was not invited. Many attendees expressed hope that Russia might join in on a road map to peace in the future.</p><p>The <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-offensive-aid-16e276766b7100485fe97b674700ac6c">all-out war</a></span> since President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has killed or injured hundreds of thousands of people, unsettled markets for goods like grain and fertilizer, driven millions from their homes and carved a wedge between the West — which has sanctioned Moscow — and Russia, China and some other countries.</p><p>About 100 delegations, mostly Western countries, attended the conference that was billed as a first step toward peace. They included presidents and prime ministers from France, Germany, Britain, Japan, Poland, Argentina, Ecuador, Kenya and Somalia. The Holy See was also represented, and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-ukraine-peace-summit-switzerland-biden-41cb00bba18a80ca88abf9e5b378110a">Vice President Kamala Harris</a></span> spoke for the United States.</p>
    

<p>India, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates — represented by foreign ministers or lower-level envoys — were among countries that did not sign the final document, which focused on issues of nuclear safety, food security and the exchange of prisoners. Brazil, an “observer,” did not sign on but Turkey did. China did not attend.</p>



<p>The final document signed by 78 countries said the U.N. Charter and “respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty … can and will serve as a basis for achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine.” That has been a nonstarter for Putin, who wants Ukraine to cede more territory and back away from its hopes of joining the NATO military alliance.</p>
    
<p>Viola Amherd, the Swiss president, told a news conference the “great majority” of participants agreed to the final document, which “shows what diplomacy can achieve.” Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said Switzerland would reach out to Russian authorities but did not say what the message would be.</p>
    

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the “first steps toward peace” at the meeting and said Ukraine was in talks with some countries, which he did not name, that had offered to host a “second peace summit.” No timetable was laid out.</p><p>Zelenskyy <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-philippines-president-ferdinand-marcos-jr-switzerland-peace-summit-713a05c244d01f1258e3bb4f67ec3b5c">earlier this month</a></span> accused China, backed by Russia, of attempting to undermine the Swiss conference, a claim denied by Beijing.</p><p>Allies of Ukraine now face the task of trying to keep up momentum toward peace. Zelenskyy said national security advisers would meet in the future, and “there will be a specific plan” afterward.</p><p>Testifying to war fatigue and other preoccupations, only about half of U.N. member countries took part. It’s a far cry from March 2022, when condemnation of Russia’s invasion led to passage of a non-binding resolution at the U.N. General Assembly by 141 countries calling for Russian troops to leave Ukraine.</p>
    

<p>It wasn’t clear why some developing countries attending didn’t line up behind the final statement, but they may be hesitant to rankle Russia or have cultivated a middle ground between Moscow, its ally China and Western powers backing Kyiv.</p><p>“Some did not sign — even though very few — since they are playing ‘Let’s have peace based on concessions’ game, and they usually mean concessions by Ukraine, and basically accommodating Russian demands,” said Volodymyr Dubovyk, a Ukraine expert and senior fellow at Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington-based think tank. “They also like this ‘neutrality’ positioning.”</p><p>Dubovyk said the way forward for Ukraine was to receive aid — weapons and humanitarian assistance — that could improve its situation on the ground and thus give it a better negotiating position.</p><p>At the Swiss event, the challenge was to talk tough on Russia but open the door for it to join a peace initiative.</p>
    

<p>“Many countries ... wanted the involvement of representatives of the Russian Federation,” Zelenskyy said. “At the same time, the majority of the countries do not want to shake hands with them (Russian leaders) ... so there are various opinions in the world.”</p><p>Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union’s executive Commission, said peace won’t be achieved in a single step and asserted that Putin isn’t serious about ending the war.</p><p>“He is insisting on capitulation. He is insisting on ceding Ukrainian territory -- even territory that today is not occupied by him,” she said. “He is insisting on disarming Ukraine, leaving it vulnerable to future aggression. No country would ever accept these outrageous terms.”</p><p>Analysts suspected the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-switzerland-russia-war-peace-conference-burgenstock-2a8abeb9e6e2714f6af032593706d9e5">conference</a></span> would have little concrete impact toward ending the war because <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-switzerland-summit-peace-burgenstock-zelenskyy-5df2e62407ed50dc324965ad66e3f9ae">Russia, was not invited</a></span>. China and Brazil have jointly sought to plot alternative routes toward peace.</p>
    

<p>Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said Saturday that his rich Gulf country hosted talks with both Ukrainian and Russian delegations on the reunification of Ukrainian children with their families. It has so far resulted in 34 children being reunited.</p><p>The Ukrainian government believes that 19,546 children have been deported or forcibly displaced, and Russian Children’s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova previously confirmed that at least 2,000 were taken from Ukrainian orphanages.</p><p>In Kyiv, at a regular demonstration by relatives of soldiers captured by Russia, the response to the Swiss gathering was muted.</p><p>“I would really like to believe that this (conference) will have an impact, but some very important countries did not sign the communique,” said Yana Shyrokyh, 56, whose army serviceman son has been in captivity since 2022. “I would really like them to find powerful levers of influence on Russia.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press journalists Derek Gatopoulos, Illia Novikov and Dmytro Zhyhinas in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></span></p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Military "pause" announced</strong>: The Israeli army announced a "local, tactical pause of military activity for humanitarian purposes" from 08:00 to 19:00 local time along a key route in Gaza, allowing humanitarian aid to be delivered.</li>
<li><strong>Criticism from far-right government ministers</strong>: The announcement was met with a fierce political backlash from far-right government ministers, who accused the military of signaling an end to the fighting in southern Gaza and compromising Israel's defense.</li>
<li><strong>Denial from the Israeli army</strong>: The Israeli army quickly defended its decision, insisting that the pause did not signal an end to the fighting in southern Gaza or any change to the entry of humanitarian aid.</li>
<li><strong>Aid waiting to be delivered</strong>: The pause was specifically designed to allow aid to be delivered to Gaza, with aid waiting at the Kerem Shalom crossing point.</li>
<li><strong>Gaza conflict ongoing</strong>: The conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza continues, with the pause in military activity seen as a temporary reprieve aimed at allowing humanitarian aid to reach the Palestinian population.</li>

            Former President Donald Trump had pushed for the ban in response to a 2017 mass shooting that killed 58 people at an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas. But it was successfully challenged by a Texas gun store owner who purchased two of the devices in 2018 and turned them over to the government after the prohibition before suing to get them back.

            Bump stocks allow a shooter to convert a semi automatic rifle into a weapon that can fire hundreds of rounds a minute.

            “This is a Republican administration that banned bump stocks. At the time, Republicans in the Senate and the House were supportive of it,” the Connecticut Democrat said Sunday. “But now that they have got a Supreme Court that seems ready to unwind the entirety of the Second Amendment and take away from Congress or the executive branch the ability to keep our communities safe, they’re once again lining up behind the gun industry.”

            Murphy’s comments echo the response of gun control advocacy groups, which argued Friday that the court’s ruling will have a dangerous impact in a country constantly reeling from gun violence.

            The overwhelming majority of Republicans, however, celebrated the court’s decision, arguing that they long believed the ban on bump stocks was unconstitutional. While the action was taken under the Trump administration, many Republicans argued it was the wrong move at the time.

            GOP Sen. Tom Cotton told Tapper in a separate interview Sunday that the bump stock ban “treads close” to an infringement of the Second Amendment. “I would suggest before we infringe on the rights of law-abiding American citizens, we should crack down on violent crime and gang crimes,” he said.

            Though the case didn’t rely on the Second Amendment, it did put the debate about guns back on the court’s docket in one of the most closely watched controversies this year. In that sense, the decision was the latest from the high court to side with gun rights groups.

            Still, Murphy – who has made gun safety legislation his life’s work following the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut – said “there is good news to celebrate today,” pointing to dropping urban gun homicide rates.

            “We have a lot of work to do to make sure that something like Sandy Hook never happens again, that every kid gets the chance to graduate,” he said. “But we have some reason to believe that this country is starting to turn the corner and change our laws in a way that makes our kids and our families safer.”

                                        <p>MINA, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Masses of pilgrims on Sunday embarked on a symbolic stoning of the devil in Saudi Arabia under the soaring summer heat. The ritual marks the final days of the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/b7fef33d791a15a21193e696c0fe8cc1">Hajj, or Islamic pilgrimage,</a></span> and the start of the Eid al-Adha celebrations for Muslims around the world.</p><p>The stoning is among the final rites of the Hajj, which is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. It came a day after more than 1.8 million <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/77b05b14674d6997b25b7b58df0d8052">pilgrims congregated at a sacred hill, known as Mount Ararat,</a></span> outside the holy city of Mecca, which Muslim pilgrims visit to perform the annual five-day rituals of Hajj.</p><p>Fourteen Jordanian pilgrims have died from sunstroke during the Hajj, according to Jordan’s state-run Petra news agency. The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it has coordinated with Saudi authorities to bury the dead in Saudi Arabia, or transfer them to Jordan.</p>
    

<p>Mohammed Al-Abdulaali, spokesman for the Saudi Health Ministry, told reporters that more than 2,760 pilgrims suffered from sunstroke and heat stress on Sunday alone. He said the number was likely to increase and urged attendees to avoid the sun at peak times and drink water. “Heat stress is the greatest challenge,” he said.</p>



<p>The pilgrims left Mount Arafat on Saturday evening to spend their night in a nearby site known as Muzdalifa, where they collected pebbles to use in the symbolic stoning of pillars representing the devil.</p>
    
<p>The pillars are in another sacred place in Mecca, called Mina, where Muslims believe Ibrahim’s faith was tested when God commanded him to sacrifice his only son Ismail. Ibrahim was prepared to submit to the command, but then God stayed his hand, sparing his son. In the Christian and Jewish versions of the story, Abraham is ordered to kill his other son, Isaac.</p><p>On Sunday morning, crowds headed on foot to the stoning areas. Some were seen pushing disabled pilgrims on wheelchairs on a multi-lane road leading to the complex housing the large pillars. Most pilgrims were seen sweltering and carrying umbrellas to protect them against the burning summer sun.</p>
    

<p>An Associated Press reporter saw many pilgrims, especially among the elderly, collapsing on the road to the pillars because of the burning heat. Security forces and medics were deployed to help, carrying those who fainted on gurneys out of the heat to ambulances or field hospitals. As the temperature spiked by midday, more people required medical help. The heat had reached to 47 C (116.6 F) in Mecca, and 46 C (114.8 F) in Mina, according to Saudi meteorological authorities.</p><p>Despite the suffocating heat, many pilgrims expressed joy at being able to complete their pilgrimage. </p><p>“Thank God, (the process) was joyful and good,” said Abdel-Moaty Abu Ghoneima, an Egyptian pilgrim. “No one wants more than this.”</p><p>Many pilgrims will spend up to three days in Mina, each casting seven pebbles at three pillars in a ritual to symbolize the casting away of evil and sin.</p><p>While in Mina, they will visit Mecca to perform their “tawaf,” or circumambulation, which is circling the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque counterclockwise seven times. Then another circumambulation, the Farewell Tawaf, will mark the end of Hajj as pilgrims prepare to leave the holy city. </p>
    

<p>The rites coincide with the four-day Eid al-Adha, which means “Feast of Sacrifice,” when Muslims with financial means commemorate Ibrahim’s test of faith through slaughtering livestock and animals and distributing the meat to the poor.</p><p>Most countries marked Eid al-Adha on Sunday. Others, like Indonesia, will celebrate it Monday.</p><p>President Joe Biden in a statement wished Muslims around the world a blessed Eid al-Adha and noted the holiday is a time of prayer, reflection and sacrifice.</p><p>“The Hajj and Eid al-Adha remind us of our equality before God and the importance of community and charity — values that speak directly to the American character,” it said. “The United States is blessed to be home to millions of American Muslims who enrich our nation in countless ways, from medicine to technology, education, public service, the arts, and beyond.”</p>
    

<p>Once the Hajj is over, men are expected to shave their heads and remove the shroud-like white garments worn during the pilgrimage, and women to snip a lock of hair in a sign of renewal and rebirth.</p><p>Most of the pilgrims then leave Mecca for the city of Medina, about 340 kilometers (210 miles) away, to pray in Prophet Muhammad’s tomb, the Sacred Chamber. The tomb is part of the prophet’s mosque, one of the three holiest sites in Islam, along with the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.</p><p>All Muslims are required to make the Hajj once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. Many wealthy Muslims make the pilgrimage more than once. The rituals largely commemorate the accounts of Prophet Ibrahim and his son Prophet Ismail, Ismail’s mother Hajar and Prophet Muhammad, according to the Quran, Islam’s holy book.</p>
    

<p>More than 1.83 million Muslims performed Hajj in 2024, Saudi Hajj and Umrah Minister Tawfiq bin Fawzan al-Rabiah said in a briefing, slightly less than last year’s figures when 1.84 million made the rituals.</p><p>Most of the Hajj rituals are held outdoors with little if any shade. It is set for the second week of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month in the Islamic lunar calendar, so its time of the year varies. And this year the pilgrimage fell in the burning summer of Saudi Arabia. </p><p>This year’s Hajj came against the backdrop of the devastating <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">Israel-Hamas war</a></span>, which has pushed the Middle East to the brink of a regional conflict. </p><p>Palestinians in the Gaza Strip weren’t able to travel to Mecca for Hajj this year because of the closure of the Rafah crossing in May when Israel extended its ground offensive to the city on the border with Egypt.

They were surrounded by debris and rubble of collapsed houses. In the nearby town of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, Muslims held their prayers in a school-turned shelter. Some, including women and children, went to cemeteries to visit the graves of loved ones.</p><p>“Today, after the ninth month, more than 37,000 martyrs, more than 87,000 wounded, and hundreds of thousands of homes were destroyed,” Abdulhalim Abu Samra, a displaced Palestinian, told the AP after wrapping up the prayers in Khan Younis. “Our people live in difficult circumstances.”</p><p>Also in the occupied West Bank, Palestinians convened for the Eid prayers in Ramallah, the seat of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. “We suffer greatly and live through difficult moments with (what’s happening to) our brothers in Gaza,” said Mahmoud Mohana, a mosque imam.</p><p>In Yemen’s Houthi-held capital of Sanaa and in Iraq’s capital, Baghdad, Muslims celebrated and prayed for the war-weary Palestinians in Gaza. </p><p>“We are happy because of Eid but our hearts are filled with anguish when we see our brothers in Palestine,” said Bashar al-Mashhadani, imam of al-Gilani Mosque in Baghdad. "(We) urge the Arabic and Islamic countries to support and stand beside them in this ordeal.”</p><p>In Lebanon, where the militant Hezbollah group has traded near-daily attacks with Israel, a steady stream of visitors made their way into the Palestine Martyrs Cemetery near the Shatila Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut early Sunday morning, bearing flowers and jugs of water for the graves of their loved ones, an annual tradition on the first day of Eid.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Wafaa Shurafa in the Gaza Strip and Abby Sewell in Beirut contributed to this report. </p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://bit.ly/ap-twir" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaboration</a></span> with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

<ol>
<li>The Labour Party has pledged to provide an additional £2 billion per year to tackle NHS waiting lists and end nearly a decade of failure to meet cancer treatment targets.</li>
<li>Labour's plan has been criticized for not including detailed costings, with health think tank Nuffield Trust and the Institute for Fiscal Studies warning that health plans from both Labour and the Conservatives would "almost certainly" need much more cash.</li>
<li>Labour's shadow health minister, Judith Streeting, acknowledged that the party's manifesto did not include plans for raising money to fund social care, despite pledging to "get a grip" on the issue.</li>
<li>Streeting said that Labour's first steps in government would include negotiating a fair pay agreement for carers to increase the workforce and tackle delayed discharges from hospitals, but did not provide details on how to fund social care.</li>
<li>The article also highlights the lack of consistency on social care funding from the Liberal Democrats, with their leader Sir Ed Davey having previously been a minister in a government that made significant cuts to adult social care.</li>

"I know the Conservatives have baked into their plans council tax rises, that’s in the government’s spending forecast."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Asked about the think tanks suggesting that Labour's sums don't add up, Mr Streeting said Labour's manifesto was “not a spending review”, implying there could be more spending "if conditions allow". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Harper claimed that Mr Streeting had “let the cat out of the bag a bit about Labour’s plans”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He said his comments showed Labour's manifesto "actually wasn’t the whole story" but was "a document to get them through the election campaign" </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"And he’s confirmed that there are more spending promises to come, and that can only mean one thing," he said. "It means more taxes.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Under Conservative governments since 2010, Ms Kuenssberg pointed out, people are paying 51% more in cash terms on council tax in England, which is forecast to increase by £10bn over the next five years.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Harper said Conservative councils delivered better services with lower council tax than Labour ones, but was challenged by Ms Kuenssberg.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">She said the average Band D property tends to be higher in Labour-run councils but the overall average council tax bill tends to be lower in Labour councils.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He was also challenged over criticism from former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who had said voters are switching to Reform because taxes are too high, the criminal justice system is too lenient and public services are too inefficient, despite 14 years of Tory government.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Yes, our record is important, I think in many areas our record is very impressive," he said. "But elections are about the future and they’re about choices.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"They’re about whether you want to cut taxes - our manifesto has a clear costed plan to do that, Labour’s is about raising taxes - ours is about cutting migration, legal and illegal, a clear plan to do so, Labour’s is not - that’s a very clear choice for people."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Reacting to the BBC interviews, Greater Manchester's Labour Mayor Andy Burnham told the programme he was "encouraged" by Mr Streeting's pledges on fixing social care, including a pay rise for carers, but called for an end to "point-scoring" because both Labour and the Tories "have failed on it".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"It's a difficult inheritance for the Labour Party," Mr Burnham said.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"In the end the only answer is to provide social care on NHS terms and to ask for a contribution from people that is proportionate to their assets."</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li><strong>Bond market crisis</strong>: The bond market has experienced a painful bear market due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes, with the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index down roughly 50% from its July 2020 peak.</li>
<li><strong>Attractive yields</strong>: Despite the challenges, some top fixed-income investors believe this is the best time in a generation to get into bonds, with yields offering a solid 7% return and moderate volatility.</li>

<p>After keeping interest rates near zero for almost a decade after the Great Financial Crisis and again during the COVID era, the Federal Reserve began aggressive rate hikes to fight inflation in March 2022. That led to a <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/01/12/investing-was-universally-horrible-in-2022-but-there-are-5-things-we-can-learn-from-a-truly-awful-year/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20stock%20market%20fell,bonds%20crashed%20more%20than%2030%25." target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/01/12/investing-was-universally-horrible-in-2022-but-there-are-5-things-we-can-learn-from-a-truly-awful-year/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20stock%20market%20fell,bonds%20crashed%20more%20than%2030%25." class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">painful fixed-income bear market</a> due to the inverse relationship between bond prices and yields (which move with the Fed funds rate). </p>



<p>It’s now been 46 months since the bond market last reached a record high, and the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index is down roughly 50% from that July 2020 peak. But with bonds finally offering solid yields, some of the world’s top fixed-income investors believe this is the best time in a generation to get into bonds.</p>



<p>“The entry point is just very, very attractive,” Anders Persson, CIO of fixed income at the global asset manager Nuveen, told <em>Fortune</em> in a recent interview. “I mean, basically, yields, as you know well, are the most attractive that we’ve seen in 15 plus years.”</p>



<p>As Rick Rieder, global CIO of fixed income and head of the asset allocation team at <a href="https://fortune.com/company/blackrock/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/blackrock/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">BlackRock</a>, noted, the Fed’s rate hikes have essentially “put the fixed back into fixed income.”</p><p></p>



<p>“You can create a portfolio with a close to 7% yield with volatility that’s pretty moderate. It’s been decades since you’ve been able to do that,” he told <em>Fortune</em> last month.</p>



<p>After investors lock in those yields, bond prices could also rally when the Fed starts cutting rates later this year or next. It’s a golden opportunity for a mix of steady income and price appreciation, according to these bond market gurus.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why the bond investors are bullish</h2>



<p>Persson and Rieder—who are collectively responsible for roughly $2.8 trillion in assets, or about 23 times more than the value of every NBA team put together—are bullish on bonds even as PIMCO co-founder and “bond king” Bill Gross has cautioned that without rate cuts to boost prices, bond market investors will merely be “<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bond-king-bill-gross-says-112000079.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bond-king-bill-gross-says-112000079.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">clipping coupons</a>,” or collecting interest income from yields. </p>



<p>Those coupons are quite juicy in many sub sectors. </p>



<p>“When you’re looking at 6% or so for broader fixed income, 7% for preferred, 8% for high yield, and almost 10% for senior loans, those entry levels are really, really attractive from a historic basis,” Nuveen’s Persson emphasized.</p><p></p>



<p>He added that, historically, there’s a high correlation between future total returns for fixed-income investors and how high yields were when they began investing. To that point, NYU Stern’s <a href="https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">annual return chart</a> shows that bonds tend to outperform after peaks in the Fed’s hiking cycles (i.e. when yields are high). </p>



<p>Corporate bonds, for example, offered 15%-plus returns to investors for five straight years after then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker famously raised interest rates to a peak of 19% in 1981 to fight runaway inflation. And they outperformed stocks three out of five of those years as well.</p>



<p>Rieder also said there’s serious price appreciation potential in bonds because rate cuts are likely on the way once data eventually confirms the Fed has defeated inflation.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>Persson, who is forecasting one or two rate cuts this year, said that if the economy starts to crack, the Fed will have to cut aggressively. “And then you get the total return aspect, or the capital appreciation side, of that investment,” he told <em>Fortune</em>, adding that “in most scenarios, you’re seeing a pretty healthy return potential here over the next 12 months.”</p>



<p>There is also evidence that bonds could still outperform even if interest rates stay where they are, with the Fed maintaining its current wait-and-see mode for longer than expected. In a <a href="https://www.lpl.com/newsroom/read/weekly-market-commentary-still-waiting-on-fed-to-be-done-raising-rates.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.lpl.com/newsroom/read/weekly-market-commentary-still-waiting-on-fed-to-be-done-raising-rates.html" rel="noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">note to clients</a> last summer, LPL Financial’s chief fixed income strategist, Lawrence Gillum, noted that the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index has performed well during periods when the Fed has paused its rate hikes historically.</p><p></p>



<p>“Since 1984, core bonds were able to generate average 6-month and 1-year returns of 8% and 13%, respectively, after the Fed stopped raising rates. Moreover, all periods generated positive returns over the 6-month, 1-year, and 3-year horizons,” he wrote.</p>



<p>For Rieder, that’s one reason why the current environment, where the Fed is stuck in a holding pattern, is a Goldilocks zone for fixed income investors. “You have this incredible gift, because inflation is staying where it is, we’re getting to buy credit assets cheaper than we should be,” he explained. </p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>
