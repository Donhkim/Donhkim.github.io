after he began playing a version of the game and made several Instagram posts about weapons, Josh Koskoff, the attorney representing the families, alleged.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"This three-headed monster knowingly exposed him to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it," Koskoff said in a statement.</p><p

without turning to horrific acts.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The suit contends the "Call of Duty" franchise contains realistic depictions of gun violence where "the weapons are authentic"</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"They are designed to perfectly imitate their real-life counterparts in look, feel, recoil and accuracy," the suit contends.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The attorneys added, "With Instagram's blessing and assistance, purveyors of assault weapons can inundate teens with content that exalts lone gunmen, exploits tropes of sex and hypermasculinity and directs them where to buy their Call of Duty-tested weapon of choice."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"According to one firearms marketing agency, 'there are some major loopholes in … advertising regulations for Facebook and Instagram,' allowing organic posts promoting firearms to infiltrate the platform," the suit alleges.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The shooter, who was killed during the shooting by law enforcement, was "being courted through explicit, aggressive marketing," on Instagram, the suit alleged.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">He downloaded the 2019 game "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare," in November 2021, the suit claimed. He has been playing a mobile offshoot of the game since he was 15, according to the suit.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">After he purchased the game, the shooter allegedly began "researching firearms on his phone and browsing Daniel Defense's website," according to the suit.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The shooter allegedly created an account on Daniel Defense's website and put the DDM4 V7 in his cart, the lawsuit contends.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"The shooter became consumed with anticipation, compulsively googling how many days remained until his birthday on May 16," the suit alleges.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Friday's suit is the latest in the court criminal and civil court actions taken since the shooting.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">This week, 19 families reached a settlement with the city of Uvalde. The city will pay out a total of $2 million from its insurance coverage.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">As a part of the settlement, the families said they were involved in the efforts to improve the Uvalde Police Department.

<ol>
<li>Judge denies Alec Baldwin's motion to dismiss the indictment in his involuntary manslaughter trial related to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the film "Rust" in 2021.</li>
<li>Baldwin's defense had argued that prosecutors flouted the rules of grand jury proceedings to divert attention away from exculpatory evidence and witnesses, but the judge rejected these claims, finding no prejudice against Baldwin.</li>
<li>The judge's decision means that the case will proceed to trial, with Baldwin's lawyers Alex Spiro and Luke Nikas issuing a statement saying they "look forward to our day in court".</li>
<li>Baldwin was indicted on two counts - involuntary manslaughter and negligent use of a firearm - in January 2023, and was charged in connection with the accidental shooting of Hutchins on the film set in October 2021.</li>
<li>Baldwin's legal team had claimed that the prosecution did not follow the rules during the grand jury process, including allegations that witnesses were not adequately notified ahead of the grand jury proceedings.</li>

"I considered her a friend as well."</p><p>Higgins said at the Waterfall that night, he texted Read something like "ummm, well" and told the jury, "to be honest with you, it was a flirty text."</p>

    </p>
<p>Higgins said after leaving the Waterfall, he never saw Read or O'Keefe again that night. He also said he believed he was the first to leave the after-party at 34 Fairview. He said he stopped at the Canton Police Department to move police vehicles out of the way of plows and ended up at home in West Roxbury at about 2 a.m. </p><p>Higgins testified Brian Albert called him at about 6:30 a.m. to say that O'Keefe had been found on the front lawn. </p><p>"It didn't make sense to me," Higgins said. "I couldn't do the math in my head, because I knew John O'Keefe and the defendant, they never - they never showed up. It didn't make sense."</p><h2>Texts between Brian Higgins and Karen Read</h2><p>The prosecution had Higgins read dozens texts between himself and Karen Read in January 2022, before O'Keefe's death. Higgins said she got his number and initiated the conversation.</p><p>In one of the texts, Read tells Higgins "you're hot."</p><p>"Are you serious or messing with me?" Higgins replies.</p><p>"No I'm serious," Read says.</p><p>Higgins then said that after watching a Patriots game at O'Keefe's house on a Saturday night in January, Read "planted a kiss" on him. </p>

    </p>
<p>"Not like a friend," Higgins testified. "Lip to lip."</p><p>In another series of messages, Read texts Higgins "Come over to my house."</p><p>Read told Higgins she never wanted kids and texted about how O'Keefe taking care of his niece and nephew were complicating their relationship. </p><p>In one message, Higgins told Read he assumed she was happy with her situation.</p><p>"I was. But things have deteriorated," she replied. </p><p>Read also texted Higgins that O'Keefe had shown her video of her interacting with Higgins.</p><p>"He's like 'Christ, are you guys hooking up??'" Read's message says.</p>

    </p>
<p>The weeks of texts show Higgins constantly asked what Read wanted from him. He was single and told Read he wanted "the real deal," but says he was confused.</p><p>"I'm not proud of these text messages, it is what it is, I take responsibility for them. But John was a friend at the same time ... If they were at the end of their relationship, they were at the end of their relationship. But I wasn't going to have somebody utilize me and weaponize me against someone that I liked. It was just a weird experience."</p><p>The last message shown in court between the two was Read texting Higgins, "John died."</p><figure class="embed embed--type-video embed--type-content_video is-video embed--float-left embed--size-medium ">

                                        <p>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Egypt said Friday it has agreed to send U.N. humanitarian aid trucks through Israel’s main crossing into Gaza, but it remained unclear if they will be able to enter the territory as fighting raged in the southern <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/rafah">city of Rafah</a></span> amid Israel’s escalating offensive there.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bodies of three more hostages killed on Oct. 7 were recovered overnight from Gaza, Israel’s army said Friday. The CIA chief met in Paris with Israeli and Qatari officials, trying to revive negotiations for a cease-fire and a hostage release.</p><p>Gaza’s humanitarian crisis has spiraled as the U.N. and other aid agencies say the entry of food and other supplies to them has plunged dramatically since Israel’s Rafah offensive began more than two weeks ago. On Friday, the top U.N. court — the International Court of Justice — <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-palestinians-court-ceasefire-01d093d21a1eadaa31af5708cf1cbf38">ordered Israel to halt the Rafah offensive</a></span>, though Israel is unlikely to comply.</p>
    

<p>At the heart of the problem lie the two main crossings through which around 300 trucks of aid a day had been flowing into Gaza before the offensive began.</p><p>Israeli troops seized the Rafah crossing into Egypt, which has been inoperative since. The nearby Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza has remained open, and Israel says it has been sending hundreds of trucks a day into it. But while commercial trucks have successfully crossed, the U.N. says it cannot reach Kerem Shalom to pick up aid as it enters because fighting in the area makes it too dangerous.</p>



<p>As a result, the U.N. says it has received only 143 trucks from the crossing in the past 19 days. Hundreds of truckloads have been sitting on the Gaza side of the crossing unretrieved, according to Israeli officials, who say U.N. manpower limitations are to blame. U.N. and other aid agencies had to rely on the far smaller number of trucks entering daily from a single crossing in northern Gaza and via a U.S.-built pier bringing supplies by sea.</p>
    
<p>Humanitarian groups are scrambling to get food to Palestinians as some 900,000 people flee Rafah, scattering across central and southern Gaza. Aid workers warn Gaza is <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-famine-world-food-program-israel-hamas-war-476941bf2dc259f85a706408b2a665ff">near famine.</a></span> UNRWA, the main U.N agency in the humanitarian effort, had to halt food distribution in Rafah city because it had run out of supplies.</p>
    

<p>The Egyptian announcement appeared to resolve a political obstacle on one side of the border.</p><p>Israel says it has kept the Rafah crossing open and asked Egypt to coordinate with it on sending aid convoys through it. Egypt refused, fearing the Israeli hold will remain permanent, and demanded Palestinians be put back in charge of the facility. The White House has been pressing Egypt to resume the flow of trucks.</p><p>In a phone call with U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi agreed to allow trucks carrying humanitarian aid and fuel to go to the Kerem Shalom crossing until a solution is found for the Rafah crossing, el-Sissi’s office said in a statement.</p><p>But it remained unclear whether the U.N. will be able to access additional trucks coming from Egypt.</p>
    

<p>UNRWA did not immediately reply to requests for comment. In a post on social media outlet X on Thursday, it said, “We could resume (food distribution in Rafah) tomorrow if the crossing reopened &amp; we were provided with safe routes.”</p><p>Mercy Corps, an aid group operating in Gaza, said in a statement Friday that the offensive had caused the “functional closure … of the two main lifelines” of aid and “has brought the humanitarian system to its knees.”</p><p>“If dramatic changes do not occur, including opening all border crossings to safely surge aid into these areas, we fear that a wave of secondary mortality will result, with people succumbing to the combination of hunger, lack of clean water and sanitation, and the spread of disease in areas where there is little medical care,” it said.</p><p>Fighting appeared to escalate in Rafah. Bombardment intensified Friday in eastern parts of the city, near Kerem Shalom, but shelling was also taking place in central, southern and western districts closer to the Rafah crossing, witnesses said.</p>
    

<p>Israeli leaders have said they must uproot Hamas fighters from Rafah to complete the destruction of the group after its Oct. 7 attack.</p><p>Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducted around 250 others in the Oct. 7 attack.

</div><p>Israel’s campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza has killed more than 35,800 Palestinians and wounded more than 80,200, the Gaza Health Ministry said Friday.

He was killed in his car as he went to get his 4-year-old granddaughter from a site near Gaza that came under attack by the militants.</p><p>Oryon Hernandez Radoux, 30, and Yablonka, 42, a father of two, were both killed as they tried to escape the Nova music festival, where the attackers killed hundreds of people. Hernandez Radoux had been attending the festival with his partner, German-Israeli Shani Louk, whose body was among those found by the army earlier. </p><p>Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of at least 39 more, while 17 bodies of hostages have been recovered. </p><p>The group representing the families of the hostages said the bodies had been returned to their families for burial. Israeli Prime Minister <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a></span> said the country had a duty to do everything to return those abducted, both those killed and those who are alive.</p><p>French President <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron</a></span> gave condolences to the family of Hernández-Radoux, a French-Mexican citizen, saying France remains committed to releasing the hostages. </p><p>CIA Director Bill Burns was meeting in Paris on Friday with Israeli and Qatari officials in informal talks aimed at getting hostage and cease-fire negotiations back on track, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive discussions. Burns is in close contact with Egyptian officials, who like the Qataris have acted as mediators with Hamas, the U.S. official said.</p><p>Cease-fire talks ground to a halt at the beginning of the month after a major push by the U.S. and other mediators to secure a deal, in hopes of averting a planned Israeli invasion of the southern city of Rafah. The talks were stymied by a central sticking point: Hamas demands guarantees that the war will end and Israeli troops will withdraw from Gaza completely in return for a release of all the hostages, a demand Israel rejects. </p><h2>___</h2><p>Keath and Magdy reported from Cairo.

Both flags were carried by rioters who violently stormed the Capitol in January 2021 echoing Trump’s false claims of election fraud.</p>

<li>
<p>Kabosu, the Japanese Shiba Inu dog, has died at the age of 18. Her owner, Atsuko Sato, announced the news on Friday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to Sato, Kabosu "fell into a deep sleep" on Friday morning, with birds singing outside the window on a beautiful morning. Sato, a kindergarten teacher, describes Kabosu as the "happiest dog in the world."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kabosu became famous on the internet in 2010 when a photo of her posing with folded paws and a quizzical expression spread across online forums, including Reddit. This sparked a proliferation of "doge" memes, featuring Kabosu's face on pastries, landmarks, and other animals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The intentional misspelling of the word "dog" to "doge" became a signature component of these memes.</p>
</li>

																										<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk flipped his stance on China tariffs during a conference on Thursday. In January, Musk said that measures would need to be taken so that Chinese automakers did not “demolish” global competitors.</p>
<p>Now, the Biden Administration is <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/white-house-hike-tariffs-chinese-ev-fend-off-cheap-imports/">enforcing tariffs to prioritize U.S. manufacturing</a>, and Musk believes they are the wrong step to take as he said things that limit a foreign country’s ability to do business in other regions are disadvantageous for the market.</p>
<p>At the Viva Technology Conference in Paris, Musk detailed his thoughts:</p>
<p><em>“Neither Tesla nor I asked for these tariffs; in fact, I was surprised when they were announced. Things that inhibit freedom of exchange or distort the market are not good. Tesla competes quite well in the market in China with no tariffs and no deferential support. I’m in favor of no tariffs.”</em></p>

<p>It is a major switch up from what Musk said just a few months ago in January, where he detailed a need for barriers that would protect domestic companies:</p>
<p><em>“If there are no trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.”</em></p>
<p>In mid-May, the Biden Adminsitration <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/stellantis-biden-tariff-china-electric-vehicles/">launched a new tariff program</a> that would equate to a 100 percent rate on EVs, while other sectors were impacted less.</p>
<p><em>The Washington Post</em> said in its report of the tariffs that the program would impact $18 billion in Chinese products and was being done “to protect American workers and businesses.”</p>

<p></p>
<p>It is not the first time Musk has talked about tariff programs between the U.S. and China. In April 2018, he said that China’s plan to lower import tariffs was a “very important action” and would help to avoid “a trade war.”</p>
<p>The Trump Adminsitration in 2020 had aimed to impose tariffs on car parts, which <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-sues-trump-china-import-tariffs/">Tesla challenged in court</a>.</p>
