Trump denies having sex with Daniels.</p>
    

<p>Daniels’ testimony, even if sanitized for a courtroom setting and stripped of tell-all details, is by far the most-awaited spectacle in a trial that has toggled between tabloidesque elements and dry record-keeping details. Her turn on the witness stand will represent a remarkable moment legally and politically. Courtroom testimony from an adult film performer about an intimidate encounter she says she had with a former American president adds to the long line of historic firsts in this case.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

<p>Trump and his campaign were reeling from the Oct. 7, 2016, publication of the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-access-hollywood-hush-money-new-york-2c52279a45ede2a111ff1fe447d2fdac">never-before-seen 2005 “Access Hollywood” footage</a></span> in which he boasted about grabbing women’s genitals without their permission. He spoke with Cohen and Hope Hicks, his campaign’s press secretary, by phone the next day as they sought to limit damage from the tape and keep his alleged affairs out of the press.</p><p>Cohen paid Daniels after her lawyer at the time, Keith Davidson, indicated she was willing to make on-the-record statements to the National Enquirer or on television confirming a sexual encounter with Trump. National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard alerted publisher David Pecker and then, at Pecker’s direction, told Cohen that Daniels was agitating to go public with her claims, prosecutors said. Daniels had previously sought to sell her story to another celebrity gossip magazine, Life &amp; Style, in 2011.</p>
    

<p>Pecker testified earlier in the trial that he balked at having the Enquirer pay a “catch and kill” fee for Daniels that Cohen later made.</p><p>The jury on Monday heard from two witnesses, including a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-c41df6a82434247352fe7a110daae981">former Trump Organization controller</a></span>, who provided a mechanical but vital recitation of how the company reimbursed payments that were allegedly meant to suppress embarrassing stories from surfacing and then logged them as legal expenses in a manner that Manhattan prosecutors say broke the law.</p><p>The testimony from Jeffrey McConney yielded an important building block for prosecutors trying to pull back the curtain on what they say was a corporate records cover-up of transactions designed to protect Trump’s Republican presidential bid during a pivotal stretch of the race. It focused on a $130,000 payment from Cohen to Daniels and the subsequent reimbursement Cohen received.</p>




    

<p>McConney and another witness testified that the reimbursement checks were drawn from Trump’s personal account. Yet even as jurors witnessed the checks and other documentary evidence, prosecutors did not elicit testimony Monday showing that Trump dictated that the payments would be logged as legal expenses, a designation that prosecutors contend was intentionally deceptive.</p><p>McConney acknowledged during cross-examination that Trump never asked him to log the reimbursements as legal expenses or discussed the matter with him at all. Another witness, Deborah Tarasoff, a Trump Organization accounts payable supervisor, said under questioning that she did not get permission to cut the checks in question from Trump himself.</p><p>“You never had any reason to believe that President Trump was hiding anything or anything like that?” Trump attorney Todd Blanche asked.</p>
    

<p>”Correct,” Tarasoff replied.</p><p>The testimony followed a stern warning from Judge Juan M. Merchan that additional violations of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hush-money-trial-gag-order-fae616037d3606cc60abbffb0e91f7ee">a gag order barring Trump from inflammatory out-of-court comments</a></span> about witnesses, jurors and others closely connected to the case could result in jail time.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Social Security's financial sustainability is extended</strong>: According to the Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report, Social Security's timeline to replenish its trust funds has been extended, with benefits not expected to be cut until 2035, which is one year later than previously forecasted.</li>
<li><strong>Improved economic conditions contribute to the improved outlook</strong>: Commissioner of Social Security Martin O'Malley attributed the improved forecast to "impressive wage growth, historic job creation, and a steady, low unemployment rate", which has contributed to stronger trust fund reserves.</li>
<li><strong>Social Security's trust funds are still drawing down</strong>: While the trust funds' reserves are growing due to stronger economic conditions, they are still drawing down, primarily due to the increasing cost of providing benefits to an aging population and the wave of baby boomer retirements.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits won't disappear if the trust funds are depleted</strong>: If the trust funds are depleted, Social Security beneficiaries will still receive benefits, but with a reduction in their monthly checks. Currently, the agency projects that recipients would lose 17% of their current benefits if the trust funds are depleted.</li>
<li><strong>Advocates are urging Congress to take action to shore up the program</strong>: Advocates for older Americans, such as AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins, are praising the improved outlook but are still urging Congress to take action to ensure the long-term sustainability of the program, emphasizing that the stakes are too high to do nothing.</li>

    <div><section class="content__body"><p>The timeline to replenish Social Security is being extended. The federal retirement program said Monday it may not need to cut benefits until 2035, one year later than previously forecast, because of stronger performance by the U.S. </p><p>The new projection, from the Social Security Board of Trustees' <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">annual report,</a> amounts to "good news" for the program's 70 million beneficiaries, said Martin O'Malley, Commissioner of Social Security, in a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/releases/2024/?utm_content=pressrelease&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#5-2024-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">statement.</a> Even so, he urged Congress to take steps to shore up the program to ensure it can pay full benefits "into the foreseeable future."</p><p>Social Security relies on its trust funds to provide monthly checks to beneficiaries, with the funds primarily financed through the payroll taxes that workers and businesses provide with each paycheck. But the funds' reserves are drawing down because spending is outpacing income, partly due to the wave of baby boomer retirements and an aging U.S. population. </p>    
  <p>Experts underscore that if the trust funds are depleted, benefits won't suddenly disappear. Instead, Social Security beneficiaries will face a cut to their monthly checks, with the agency on Monday projecting that recipients would lose 17% of their current benefits.</p><p>That would be painful for millions of retired and disabled Americans, but it represents a modest improvement from last year, when the Social Security Administration projected that benefits <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-medicare-trust-funds-financial-challenges-shortfall/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">could be slashed by 23%</a></span> if the trust funds reached the point of depletion.</p>

    </p>
<p>Advocates for older Americans praised the improved outlook, while pressing Congress to take action on shoring up the program. </p><p>"Congress owes it to the American people to reach a bipartisan solution, ensuring people's hard-earned Social Security benefits will be there in full for the decades ahead," AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins said in a statement. "The stakes are simply too high to do nothing."</p><h2>Economic boost</h2><p>O'Malley attributed the improved Social Security forecast to the stronger economy, pointing to what he called "impressive wage growth, historic job creation, and a steady, low unemployment rate." In other words, a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jobs-report-april-2024/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">healthy job market</a></span> is resulting in more Social Security taxes going into the funds' coffers.</p><p>The report comes as Social Security's financial outlook has become a political lightning rod, with Republicans proposing that the retirement age <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/house-republican-study-committee-proposes-raising-social-security-retirement-age/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">be raised</a></span> — effectively cutting benefits for millions of current workers — and former President Donald Trump indicating he would be open to cuts to Social Security and Medicare. </p>

    </p>
<p>Democrats argue that there are other ways to fix the program without cutting benefits, such as raising the cap on payroll taxes. Currently, individual income over $168,600 is exempt from the Social Security payroll tax. </p><h2>Medicare's "go broke" date</h2><p>Meanwhile, Medicare's go-broke date for its hospital insurance trust fund was pushed back five years to 2036 in the latest report, thanks in part to higher payroll tax income and lower-than-projected expenses. Medicare is the federal government's health insurance program that covers people age 65 and older and those with severe disabilities or illnesses. It covered more than 66 million people last year, with most being 65 and older.</p><p>Once the fund's reserves become depleted, Medicare would be able to cover only 89% of costs for patients' hospital visits, hospice care and nursing home stays or home health care that follow hospital visits.</p><p>In a statement on Monday, President Joe Biden credited his administration's economic policies for Social Security and Medicare's stronger outlook. </p><p>"Since I took office, my economic plan and strong recovery from the pandemic have helped extend Medicare solvency by a decade, with today's report showing a full five years of additional solvency," he said. "I am committed to extending Social Security solvency by asking the highest-income Americans to pay their fair share without cutting benefits or privatizing Social Security."</p><p><em>—With reporting by the Associated Press.</em></p>

The deal, which was put forward by Egypt and Qatar, would come in three stages that would see an initial halt in the fighting leading to lasting calm and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Palestinian territory.</p>
<p>The proposed agreement would also ensure the release of Israeli captives in Gaza as well as an unspecified number of Palestinians held in Israeli jails.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 3 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>Israel has said that it does not agree to the proposal but that it will engage in further talks to secure an agreement – all while pushing on with its assault on Gaza.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the United States, which is also involved in the negotiations, said <a href="/news/2024/5/6/us-reviewing-gaza-ceasefire-proposal-says-it-opposes-rafah-invasion">it is reviewing</a> the Hamas response.</p>

<p>Here’s the text of the proposed deal:</p>

<p>The basic principles for an agreement between the Israeli side and the Palestinian side in Gaza on the exchange of captives and prisoners between them and the return of sustainable calm.</p>
<p>The framework agreement aims at: The release of all Israeli captives in the Gaza Strip, civilians or military, alive or otherwise, from all periods, in exchange for a number of prisoners held by Israel as agreed upon, and a return to a sustainable calm that leads to a permanent ceasefire and a withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, its reconstruction and the lifting of the siege.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>The framework agreement consists of three related and interconnected stages, which are as follows:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2885084" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2885084" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2885084" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/INTERACTIVE-Gaza-ceasefire-proposal-approved-by-Hamas-1715080051.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C769&amp;quality=80" alt="INTERACTIVE - Gaza ceasefire proposal approved by Hamas-1715080051" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2885084" class="wp-caption-text">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="the-first-stage-42-days">The first stage (42 days)</h2>
<p>[Herein] a temporary cessation of military operations between the two parties, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces eastward and away from densely populated areas to a defined area along the border all along the Gaza Strip (including Wadi Gaza, known as the Netzarim Corridor, and Kuwait Roundabout, as below).</p>
<p>All aviation (military and reconnaissance) in the Gaza Strip shall cease for 10 hours a day, and for 12 hours on the days when captives and prisoners are being exchanged.</p>
<p>Internally displaced people in Gaza shall return to their areas of residence and Israel shall withdraw from Wadi Gaza, the Netzarim corridor, and the Kuwait Roundabout:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the third day (after the release of three captives), Israeli forces are to withdraw completely from al-Rashid Street in the east to Salah al-Din Street, and dismantle military sites and installations in this area.</li>
<li>Displaced persons (unarmed) shall return to their areas of residence and all residents of Gaza shall be allowed freedom of movement in all parts of the Strip.</li>
<li>Humanitarian aid shall be allowed in via al-Rashid Street from the first day without any obstacles.</li>
<li>On the 22nd day (after the release of half the living civilian captives in Gaza, including female soldiers), Israeli forces are to withdraw from the centre of the Gaza Strip (especially the Netzarim/Martyrs Corridor and the Kuwait Roundabout axis), from the east of Salah al-Din Street to a zone along the border, and all military sites and installations are to be completely dismantled.</li>
<li>Displaced people shall be allowed to return to their places of residence in the north of Gaza, and all residents to have freedom of movement in all parts of the Gaza Strip.</li>
<li>Humanitarian aid, relief materials and fuel (600 trucks a day, including 50 fuel trucks, and 300 trucks for the north) shall be allowed into Gaza in an intensive manner and in sufficient quantities from the first day. This is to include the fuel needed to operate the power station, restart trade, rehabilitate and operate hospitals, health centres and bakeries in all parts of the Gaza Strip, and operate equipment needed to remove rubble. This shall continue throughout all stages.</li>
</ul>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<p>Exchange of captives and prisoners between the two sides:</p>
<p>During the first phase, Hamas shall release 33 Israeli captives (alive or dead), including women (civilians and soldiers), children (under the age of 19 who are not soldiers), those over the age of 50, and the sick, in exchange for a number of prisoners in Israeli prisons and detention centres, according to the following [criteria]:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hamas shall release all living Israeli captives, including civilian women and children (under the age of 19 who are not soldiers). In return, Israel shall release 30 children and women for every Israeli detainee released, based on lists provided by Hamas, in order of detention.</li>
<li>Hamas shall release all living Israeli captives (over the age of 50), the sick, and wounded civilians. In return, Israel shall release 30 elderly (over 50) and sick prisoners for every Israeli captive, based on lists provided by Hamas, in order of detention.</li>
<li>Hamas shall release all living Israeli female soldiers. In return, Israel shall release 50 prisoners (30 serving life sentences, 20 sentenced) for every Israeli female soldier, based on lists provided by Hamas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scheduling the exchange of captives and prisoners between the parties in the first stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hamas shall release three Israeli detainees on the third day of the agreement, after which Hamas shall release three other detainees every seven days, starting with women as much as possible (civilians and female soldiers). In the sixth week, Hamas shall release all remaining civilian detainees included in this phase. In return, Israel shall release the agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners, according to lists Hamas will provide.</li>
<li>Hamas will provide information about the Israeli detainees who will be released at this stage by the seventh day (if possible).</li>
<li>On the 22nd day, the Israeli side shall release all prisoners from the <a href="/news/2011/10/18/hamas-and-israel-exchange-prisoners">Shalit deal</a> who have been re-arrested.</li>
<li>If there are fewer than 33 living Israeli detainees to be released, a number of bodies from the same categories shall be released to complete this stage. In return, Israel will release all women and children who were arrested from the Gaza Strip after October 7, 2023 – provided this is done in the fifth week of this stage.</li>
<li>The exchange process is linked to the extent of commitment to the agreement, including the cessation of military operations, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the return of displaced persons, as well as the entry of humanitarian aid.</li>
<li>All necessary legal procedures to ensure that freed Palestinian prisoners are not re-arrested on the same charges are to be completed.</li>
<li>The steps of the first stage above do not constitute a basis for negotiating the second stage. Punitive measures and penalties that were taken against prisoners and detainees in Israeli prisons and detention camps after October 7, 2023, are to be lifted and their conditions improved, including individuals who were arrested after this date.</li>
<li>No later than the 16th day of the first phase, indirect talks will begin between the parties to agree on the details of the second phase of this agreement, with regard to the exchange of prisoners and captives from both parties (soldiers and remaining men), provided that they are completed and agreed upon before the end of the fifth week of this stage.</li>
</ul>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<p>The United Nations and its agencies, <a href="/news/2024/4/22/no-evidence-of-unrwa-staff-links-terrorist-groups-independent-review">including UNRWA</a>, and other international organisations, are to continue providing humanitarian services across the Gaza Strip. This shall continue throughout all stages of the agreement.</p>
<p>Infrastructure (electricity, water, sewage, communications and roads) across the Gaza Strip shall be rehabilitated, and the equipment needed for civil defence allowed into Gaza to clear rubble and debris. This shall continue throughout all stages of the agreement.</p>
<p>All necessary supplies and equipment to shelter displaced people who lost their homes during the war (a minimum of 60,000 temporary homes – caravans – and 200,000 tents) shall be allowed into Gaza.</p>
<p>Throughout this phase, an agreed-upon number (not fewer than 50) of wounded military personnel will be allowed to travel through the Rafah crossing to receive medical treatment, and an increased number of travellers, sick and wounded, shall be allowed to leave through the Rafah crossing as restrictions on travellers are lifted. The movement of goods and trade will return without restrictions.</p>
<p>The necessary arrangements and plans shall be put in place for the reconstruction of homes, civilian facilities, and civilian infrastructure that was destroyed due to the war, as well as arrangements to compensate those affected, under the supervision of a number of countries and organisations, including: Egypt, Qatar, and the United Nations.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All measures in this stage, including the temporary cessation of military operations, relief and shelter, withdrawal of forces, etc., shall continue in the second stage until a sustainable calm (cessation of military and hostile operations) is declared.</p>
<h2 id="the-second-stage-42-days">The second stage (42 days):</h2>
<p>A return to sustainable calm (a permanent cessation of military and hostile operations) must be announced and take effect before the exchange of captives and prisoners – all remaining living Israeli men (civilians and soldiers) in exchange for an agreed-upon number of prisoners and detainees in Israeli prisons and detention camps.</p>
<p>Israeli forces shall withdraw completely from the Gaza Strip.</p>
<h2 id="the-third-stage-42-days">The third stage (42 days):</h2>
<p>An exchange of the bodies and remains of the dead on both sides after they have been retrieved and identified.</p>
<p>The reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip over a period of three to five years – including homes, civilian facilities, and infrastructure – and compensating all those affected begins, under the supervision of several countries and organisations, including: Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations.</p>
<p>A complete end to the siege of the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Guarantors of the agreement:</p>
<p>Qatar, Egypt, the United States, and the United Nations.</p>

<li>Columbia University cancelled its graduation ceremony due to anti-Israel protests on campus.</li>
<li>A senior at Columbia University, Katie, is disappointed that she will not get to walk at her college graduation due to the protests.</li>
<li>Katie missed out on her high school graduation due to COVID and had been looking forward to her college graduation ceremony.</li>
<li>The protests were sparked by the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel and have been ongoing for 7 months, creating a "terrible" atmosphere on campus.</li>

<ol>
<li>Hundreds of students from Berkeley High School walked out of their classrooms on October 18 to protest the conflict in Gaza and express support for the Palestinian cause.</li>

<li>One of the teachers, Becky Villagran, thanked the crowd and reminded them to remember the human impact of the conflict in Gaza, which has resulted in the loss of many lives.</li>
<li>The protest was held at a nearby park, with around 150 students participating.</li>
<li>The walkout and protest were likely sparked by the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which has resulted in significant loss of life and destruction on both sides.</li>

<ol>
<li>Chinese President Xi Jinping is visiting Serbia on the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by NATO forces during the Kosovo War in 1999.</li>
<li>The bombing, which occurred on May 7, 1999, killed three Chinese nationals and injured 20 others, and has strained relations between China and the US ever since.</li>
<li>The bombing was attributed to faulty intelligence by the US, which claimed that the target was actually the headquarters of a Serbian arms exporter located nearby, but many in China have questioned the official account and speculated that it was intentional.</li>
<li>The incident has caused lasting mistrust between China and the US, with some in China continuing to view the bombing as a deliberate attack and an attack on Chinese sovereignty.</li>
<li>The bombing has, however, brought China and Serbia closer together, with China emerging as Serbia's largest provider of foreign direct investment and second-largest trading partner after the EU.</li>

                                        <p>BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-france-xi-macron-visit-c7f48d55fd9ccb345fc6e9eda105f89b">Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s</a></span> visit to European ally Serbia on Tuesday falls on a symbolic date: the 25th anniversary of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during NATO’s air war over Kosovo.</p><p>U.S. jets dropped five bombs on the Chinese Embassy compound in the Serbian capital on May 7, 1999, setting it ablaze and killing three Chinese nationals. Twenty other people were injured in the incident, which has burdened relations between the two powers ever since.</p><p>Xi referred to the bombing in an op-ed published in Serbia’s Politika newspaper on Tuesday, saying that “we must not forget that 25 years ago today, NATO brazenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia,” according to translations carried by Chinese state media. </p><p>“The Chinese people value peace but will never allow historical tragedies to happen again,” Xi added.</p>
    

<p>The Western military alliance had launched the air war in March that year to force then Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a brutal onslaught against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo.</p><p>The U.S. at the time apologized and said the embassy bombing was a mistake that happened due to faulty intelligence. The intended target, Washington said, was the headquarters of a Serbian state arms exporter located on the same street, a few blocks away.</p>



<p>“Imagine that somebody would, even by accident, strike an American Embassy somewhere around the world. The reaction would be immediate,” said Sven Biscop, a professor of European foreign and security policy at the Ghent University and Egmont Institute. </p>
    
<p>“So for a country like China, it is also clear that this is a big thing,” he added. “And, of course, it has not been forgotten.”</p><p>Angry protesters in China stormed U.S. diplomatic installations as the bombing fueled anti-American sentiments and speculation that the attack was intentional rather than accidental. Mistrust over the incident has endured to this day.</p>
    

<p>“We will probably never really conclusively know either way,” Biscop said. “But one thing is sure. In war, incidents like that do happen, and I usually tend to go for the most simple explanation rather than try to invent complicated theories.”</p><p>While straining Beijing’s relations with the U.S., the embassy bombing brought China and Serbia closer together. China has emerged as Serbia’s largest provider of foreign direct investment and its second-largest trading partner after the European Union.</p><p>Beijing opposed the NATO bombing campaign and has since backed Belgrade’s bid to counter the Western-backed push for independence in Kosovo, a former Serbian province. In return, Serbia has been a loyal ally to Beijing and has opened its doors without restraint to billions of dollars of Chinese investment, even as it formally seeks EU membership. </p><p>“The friendship forged in blood between the peoples of China and Serbia has become the common memory of the two peoples and will inspire both sides to move forward together,” Xi wrote. “We are willing to work with our Serbian friends to stay true to our original aspirations, join hands in progress, write a new chapter in national development and revitalization, and build a China-Serbia community with a shared future for mankind in the new era.” </p>
    

<p>Signs of pro-China sentiments were clearly visible ahead of Xi’s visit on Tuesday and Wednesday. In Belgrade, a huge Chinese flag was placed on a skyscraper along a roadway leading into the city from the airport. Smaller Chinese and Serbian flags could be seen downtown and along a highway.</p><p>Xi will arrive <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/france-china-xi-macron-pyrenees-cb11669133518a61e3d291532ec96a66">from France</a></span> and will later travel to Hungary as part of his first European tour in five years.</p><p>He is expected to visit the site of the former embassy on the anniversary date and pay his respects to the bombing victims. A Chinese cultural center now stands at the spot where the embassy was once located.</p><p>The sprawling complex reportedly includes a Confucius Institute, workshops, exhibitions, offices, residential space and a hotel. It is seen as a symbol of China’s growing influence in Serbia and across Europe.</p>
    

<p>Near the institute, a group of visitors from China last weekend bowed in front of a simple black-marble monument and laid flowers in honor of the victims of the 1999 bombing. An inscription on the monument in both Chinese and English reads: “Honor Martyrs, Cherish Peace.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Sylvain Plazy in Brussels and Christopher Bodeen in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report. </p>

            The inauguration ceremony, held Tuesday in the Kremlin, was attended by Russia’s top military and political brass, but the United States and many European nations declined to send a representative after dismissing Russia’s elections as a sham.

            “We certainly did not consider that election free and fair, but he is the president of Russia and is going to continue in that capacity,” US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday.

            Putin’s first inauguration ceremony, held in 2000, was heralded as the first time in Russia’s history that power within the Kremlin changed hands through an electoral process. In his <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/21399" target="_blank">speech</a> then, Putin said his election “proved that Russia is becoming a modern democratic state.”

            Twenty-four years on, Putin has since remained in power as president or prime minister, and tinkered with Russia’s constitution to remove term limits and extend each term’s length from four years to six.

            While Putin received 53% of the vote in the 2000 presidential election, deemed by the US Embassy in Moscow to be “reasonably” free and fair, he won 87% in March’s election – a figure the US called “farcical.”

            In the days after March’s vote, Putin appeared on stage in Moscow’s Red Square alongside the three opponents allowed to run against him. The men sang Russia’s national anthem shoulder to shoulder, as if to confirm the illusion of competition.

            In a terse speech Tuesday, held the day after he again rattled his saber by announcing a non-strategic nuclear weapons exercise, Putin said Russia does not refuse dialogue with Western countries, but “the choice is theirs” whether to pursue aggression or peace.
    </p>

            Putin has strived to keep Russians isolated from the effects of the war, by recruiting soldiers from Russia’s prisons and more rural regions and trying to keep its urban centers stuffed with goods despite Western sanctions.

            But pockets of dissent have pierced the veneer of normality. The most direct challenge to Putin’s rule was made by then-Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin who, angered by Russian military blunders in Ukraine, ordered his mercenaries to march on Moscow in a bizarre spectacle that briefly threatened to undermine Putin’s monopoly on power. Within 24 hours, Prigozhin had called off his mutiny. Two months later, he was confirmed dead in a plane crash. The Kremlin denied involvement in the incident.

            Alexey Navalny, Putin’s most formidable political opponent, also died before the most recent election. Navalny died in an Arctic prison in February after he “felt unwell after a walk” and lost consciousness “almost immediately,” Russia’s prison service said. The Kremlin denied involvement.

            After officially taking office, Putin will attend a parade of the Presidential Regiment on Cathedral Square in the Kremlin.

<p>It targeted a third-party payroll system used by the Defence Ministry and included the names and bank details of current and former service personnel of the armed forces, Sky News and the BBC reported.</p>
<p>Defence Secretary Grant Shapps is expected to give further details to parliament later in the day.</p>
<p>“The MoD [Ministry of Defence] has acted very swiftly to take this database offline. It’s a third-party database and certainly not one run directly by the MoD,” Stride told Sky. The ministry first discovered the cyberattack several days back.</p>
<p>Tobias Ellwood, a former minister in the Conservative government, said the incident has the hallmarks of a Chinese cyberattack.</p>
<p>“Targeting the names of the payroll system and service personnel’s bank details, this does point to China because it can be as part of a plan, a strategy to see who might be coerced,” the former soldier and ex-chairman of a parliamentary defence committee told BBC Radio.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stride said the government was not currently pointing the finger at Beijing.</p>
<p>“That is an assumption … we are not saying that at this precise moment,” he added.</p>

<h2 id="china-refutes-claims-as-utter-nonsense">China refutes claims as ‘utter nonsense’</h2>
<p>China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian said Beijing opposed all forms of cyberattacks and rejected any attempt to use the issue of hacking for political ends to smear other countries.</p>
<p>“The remarks by relevant British politicians are utter nonsense,” Lin said on Tuesday. “China has always firmly opposed and cracked down on all types of cyberattacks.</p>
<p>The two countries have increasingly sparred over the issue of hacking, with Britain saying in March that Chinese hackers and a Chinese entity were behind two high-profile attacks in recent years – the targeting of parliamentarians critical of China, and an assault on the country’s electoral watchdog.</p>
<p>It has strained ties as Britain sought to strike a delicate balance between trying to neutralise security threats posed by China while maintaining or even enhancing engagement in some areas such as trade, investment and climate change.</p>
<p>But there has been growing anxiety about its alleged espionage activity in Britain, particularly before general elections expected later this year, and some British politicians have become increasingly vocal over the threat that they say China poses.</p>
