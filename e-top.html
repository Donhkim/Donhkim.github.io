    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Supreme Court has ruled unanimously to preserve access to mifepristone, a medication used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the US last year.</li>
<li>The ruling came in a case brought by abortion opponents seeking to sue the FDA over its approval of mifepristone and subsequent actions to ease access to the medication.</li>
<li>The court held that abortion opponents lacked the legal right to sue the FDA over its approval of mifepristone, and that federal courts are not the appropriate forum for addressing concerns about FDA actions.</li>
<li>The decision is significant because it could affect access to mifepristone across the country, including in states where abortion remains legal. Abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy in 14 states and after about six weeks in three others.</li>
<li>The ruling also underscores the stakes of the 2024 election, with the possibility that an FDA commissioner appointed by Republican Donald Trump could consider tightening access to mifepristone, including prohibiting its use through the mail.</li>

The case had threatened to restrict access to mifepristone across the country, including in states where abortion remains legal. </p><p>Abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy in 14 states, and after about six weeks of pregnancy in three others, often before women realize they’re pregnant.</p><p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was part of the majority to overturn Roe, wrote for the court on Thursday that “federal courts are the wrong forum for addressing the plaintiffs’ concerns about FDA’s actions.” </p>
    

<p>The opinion underscored the stakes of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024">the 2024 election</a></span> and the possibility that an FDA commissioner appointed by Republican Donald Trump, if he wins the White House, could consider tightening access to mifepristone, including prohibiting sending it through the mail.</p>



<p>Kavanaugh’s opinion managed to unite a court deeply divided over abortion and many other divisive social issues by employing a minimalist approach that focused solely on the technical legal issue of standing and reached no judgment about the FDA’s actions. Kavanaugh’s seven “pro-life” references to abortion opponents may have been the only language in his opinion that revealed anything of his views on abortion.</p>
    
<p>While praising the decision, President Joe Biden signaled Democrats will continue to campaign heavily on abortion ahead of the November elections. “It does not change the fact that the right for a woman to get the treatment she needs is imperiled if not impossible in many states,” Biden said in a statement.</p>
    

<p>Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, expressed disappointment with the ruling, but trained her fire on Democrats. “Joe Biden and the Democrats are hell-bent on forcing abortion on demand any time for any reason, including DIY mail-order abortions, on every state in the country,” Dannenfelser said.</p><p>About two-thirds of U.S. adults oppose banning the use of mifepristone, or medication abortion, nationwide, according to a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-march-2024-abortion-in-the-2024-election-and-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KFF poll conducted in February</a></span>. About one-third would support a nationwide ban.</p><p>The high court is separately considering another abortion case, about whether <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-abortion-medical-emergencies-idaho-8ca89d7de0c1fa9256dcd27d1847e144">a federal law on emergency treatment</a></span> at hospitals overrides state abortion bans in rare emergency cases in which a pregnant patient’s health is at serious risk.</p><p>More than 6 million people have used mifepristone since 2000.

        AP AUDIO: Unanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication
    </h1>
    
    
    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports the Supreme Court has unanimously approved access to a widely used abortion medication.</p>

<p>Jillian Phillips, of North Brookfield, Massachusetts, took mifepristone after she suffered a miscarriage eight years ago. She eventually passed the remains of her nine-week pregnancy, which she buried in a memorial garden.</p><p>“It should have never been something we had to win,” Phillips, a 42-year-old mother of three, said. “These are decisions that should be happening in a medical exam room, not courtrooms.”</p><p>Health care providers have said that if mifepristone is no longer available or is too hard to obtain, they would switch to using only misoprostol, which is somewhat less effective in ending pregnancies.</p><p>Biden’s administration and drug manufacturers had warned that siding with abortion opponents in this case could undermine the FDA’s drug approval process beyond the abortion context by inviting judges to second-guess the agency’s scientific judgments. The Democratic administration and New York-based Danco Laboratories, which makes mifepristone, argued that <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mifepristone-abortion-pill-supreme-court-1d2221251197a391c9bca833918e4554">the drug is among the safest</a></span> the FDA has ever approved.</p>
    

<p>The decision “safeguards access to a drug that has decades of safe and effective use,” Danco spokeswoman Abigail Long said in a statement.</p><p>The plaintiffs in the mifepristone case, anti-abortion doctors and their organizations, argued in court papers that the FDA’s decisions in 2016 and 2021 to relax restrictions on getting the drug were unreasonable and “jeopardize women’s health across the nation.” </p><p>Kavanaugh acknowledged what he described as the opponents’ “sincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to elective abortion and to FDA’s relaxed regulation of mifepristone.”</p><p>Federal laws already protect doctors from having to perform abortions, or give any other treatment that goes against their beliefs, Kavanaugh wrote. “The plaintiffs have not identified any instances where a doctor was required, notwithstanding conscience objections, to perform an abortion or to provide other abortion-related treatment that violated the doctor’s conscience since mifepristone’s 2000 approval,” he wrote.</p>
    

<p>In the end, Kavanaugh wrote, the anti-abortion doctors went to the wrong forum and should instead direct their energies to persuading lawmakers and regulators to make changes.</p><p>Abortion rights advocates mainly breathed a sigh of relief after the decision, but they echoed Biden about the impact of the decision two years ago. </p><p>“In the end, this ruling is not a ‘win’ for abortion — it just maintains the status quo, which is a dire public health crisis in which 14 states have criminalized abortion,” Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement.</p><p>The mifepristone case began five months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. Abortion opponents initially won a sweeping ruling nearly a year ago from <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-judge-matthew-kacsmaryk-abortion-pill-fda-75964b777ef09593a1ad948c6cfc0237">U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk</a></span>, a Trump nominee in Texas, which would have revoked the drug’s approval entirely. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals left intact the FDA’s initial approval of mifepristone. But it would reverse changes regulators made in 2016 and 2021 that eased some conditions for administering the drug.</p><p>The Supreme Court put the appeals court’s modified ruling on hold, then agreed to hear the case, though Justices Samuel Alito, the author of the decision overturning Roe, and Clarence Thomas would have allowed some restrictions to take effect while the case proceeded. But they, too, joined the court’s opinion Thursday.</p><p>The push to restrict abortion pills likely won’t stop with the Supreme Court’s ruling, said the lawyer who represented anti-abortion doctors and their organizations in the case.</p><p>The decision that the doctors don’t have the legal right to sue leaves open the way for lawsuits from others, including three other states that Kacsmaryk had previously allowed to join the case, said Erin Hawley, an attorney for the group Alliance Defending Freedom.</p><p>Hawley said she expects Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to continue the lawsuit originally filed in Texas.</p><p>Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, a Republican, asserted in a statement that the states have “standing that the doctors did not,” confirming that he will press ahead with the case in Kacsmaryk’s court.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Lindsay Whitehurst, Linley Sanders and Kimberlee Kruesi contributed to this report.

            Trump’s allies on Capitol Hill immediately sprung into action following the guilty verdict –proposing to defund the Department of Justice and even shut down the government.

And one legislative proposal Republican leaders are now actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move state-level cases to federal court. The legislation passed out of committee last September, but GOP leaders only started formally whipping the bill this week – on the eve of Trump’s Capitol Hill visit and two weeks<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/trump-conviction-consequences-analysis/index.html"> after his conviction.</a>

            “Anybody who thought that this President was going to be down after the sham trial, after that crooked trial that we saw in New York, I think, again, it’s only given him even more energy,” Emmer said. “And what he did for us upstairs just now is, he showed us that energy and he showed us that positive outlook, despite all the garbage they’ve been throwing at him with their lawfare and their nonsense.”

He had arrived at Miami International Airport at about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn’t get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight.</p>
    
<p>“It was a zoo,” said Carlisle, a public affairs specialist. He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. “Nothing against the (airport) employees — there is only so much they can do.”</p><p>So he used his phone to book an afternoon flight out of Fort Lauderdale. He took a shuttle the 20 miles north, only to find that flight had been canceled. He was now heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn’t get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry.</p>

<li><strong>Labour's election manifesto focuses on economic growth</strong>: Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer has unveiled the party's election manifesto, which promises to "rebuild Britain" by boosting economic growth.</li>
<li><strong>Streamlining planning rules and increasing business investment</strong>: The manifesto highlights the need to "streamline planning rules" and "increase business investment" to boost wealth creation.</li>
<li><strong>No new policy surprises</strong>: The manifesto does not contain any new policies beyond those already announced, and Sir Keir Starmer has made a virtue of the lack of policy fireworks.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on wealth creation</strong>: The Labour leader has emphasized the importance of wealth creation, stating that "the main priority" is to create more wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Contrast with past Labour manifestos</strong>: Sir Keir Starmer's approach contrasts with Labour's past election manifestos, which included more radical policies such as giving workers a 10% stake in all large companies and free full-fibre broadband for all.</li>

<p>It was the largest attack by the Iran-aligned group since the outbreak of violence between the two sides on October 8, a Hezbollah source told Al Jazeera Arabic on Thursday.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 3 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>The group said the attack in northern Israel was in retaliation for the assassination of senior commander Taleb Abdullah – known as Abu Taleb – in an Israeli air raid in the southern Lebanese village of Jouaiya earlier this week.</p>
<p>The source said the “compound attack” also aimed to establish deterrence after the killing of Abdullah.</p>
<p>The Lebanese group used 150 rockets and 30 explosive drones to target 15 Israeli positions, including some in the occupied Golan Heights, the source said.</p>
<p>Israeli media outlets reported that Hezbollah rockets wounded at least two people and started 15 fires.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said in a post on X that “numerous” launches were intercepted and that some ignited fires.</p>
<p>In an official statement, Hezbollah said the operation was “in support of the steadfast Palestinian people and their courageous and honourable resistance in Gaza and in the context of the response to the assassination that the Zionist enemy carries out in Jouaiyya”.</p>
<p>One of the Israeli units targeted in the attack is responsible for planning assassinations, Hezbollah said.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Hezbollah had also fired a barrage <a href="/news/2024/6/12/hezbollah-rains-rockets-on-israel-after-senior-commander-killed">of 200 rockets</a> at Israel.</p>
<p>There have been near-constant reports of rocket sirens being activated in northern Israel since Abdullah was killed along with three other fighters late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hezbollah does not reveal details about its military structure or ranks, but Abdullah was only the second slain fighter from the group to be eulogised as a “commander” in the past months – after <a href="/news/2024/1/8/hezbollah-says-israel-kills-top-commander-amid-fears-of-gaza-war-escalation">Wissam al-Tawil</a>, who was killed in an Israeli attack in January.</p>
<p>Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad paid tribute to Abdullah on Wednesday, lauding his efforts to confront Israel.</p>
<p>Hezbollah started attacking military bases in northern Israel after the outbreak of the war on Gaza in what it says is a “support front” to back Palestinian armed groups.</p>
<p>Israel has responded by bombing villages across south Lebanon and targeting Hezbollah’s positions. Despite the near-daily exchange of fire, the confrontations have largely been limited to the border area.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people in <a href="/features/2023/10/13/israel-hamas-war-sparks-south-lebanon-exodus-as-people-flee-border-areas#:~:text=Since%20Sunday%2C%20thousands%20of%20residents,told%20Al%20Jazeera%20by%20phone.">south Lebanon</a> and northern Israel have fled their homes to escape the violence.</p>
<p>Late last month, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah portrayed the Lebanese front with Israel as historically decisive.</p>
<p>“This battle concerns Palestine, but also concerns the future of Lebanon and its water and oil resources,” <a href="/news/2024/5/31/lebanon-front-is-pressuring-israel-hezbollah-chief-nasrallah-says">Nasrallah said</a>. “This front is a support front that is part of the battle that will determine the fate of Palestine, Lebanon and the region strategically.”</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>Aided by Iran, the Lebanese organisation has grown in strength in recent years. Hezbollah fought a years-long war against Israel, culminating in the withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of south Lebanon they occupied for nearly two decades.</p>
<p>In 2006, Israel launched a major offensive to disarm Hezbollah after the group carried out a deadly cross-border attack against Israeli forces. The conflict ended without major changes to the status quo. But Hezbollah has grown both its rocket arsenal and regional influence since then.</p>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Hezbollah deputy chief Sheikh Naim Qassem <a href="/news/2024/6/4/hezbollah-ready-for-an-all-out-war-with-israel-deputy-head-says">told Al Jazeera</a> that the group is “ready” for war if Israel intensifies its attacks.</p>
<p>“Any Israeli expansion of the war on Lebanon will be met with devastation, destruction and displacement in Israel,” he said. “If Israel wants to fight an all-out war, we are ready for it.”</p>
<p>Israeli officials have pledged to push Hezbollah fighters further away from the country’s borders, including by force if necessary.</p>
<p>“Israel will respond with force to all aggressions by Hezbollah,” Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said on Thursday. “Whether through diplomatic efforts or otherwise, Israel will restore security on our northern border.”</p>
<p>A war with Hezbollah, which has demonstrated sophisticated military capabilities, including the use of guided rockets and precision drones, could prove more costly to Israel than the continuing conflict in Gaza.</p>
<p>Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said Hezbollah has been stepping up its attacks not only to respond to the killing of its commander but also to strengthen Hamas’s negotiating position amid <a href="/news/2024/6/12/blinken-slams-hamas-says-us-still-pushing-for-gaza-truce-deal">ceasefire talks</a> and warn Israel against launching a major offensive in Lebanon.</p>
<p>“So this is also about deterrence on the part of Hezbollah,” Khodr said.</p>
<p>“No doubt, this is a dangerous escalation of this ongoing conflict,” referring to the Israeli promise to respond to the latest attacks.</p>

            <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/29/politics/evan-gershkovich-one-year-russian-detention/index.html">Evan Gershkovich</a>, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, will stand trial in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg after prosecutors formally accused him of spying for the CIA.

            The Russian Prosecutor General’s office said Thursday it had approved the indictment, more than a year after Gershkovich was first detained. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison.

            Gershkovich, the US government and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, have vehemently denied the charges against him. Less than two weeks after his arrest, Gershkovich was designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department, which called for his immediate release.
    </p>

            Russian prosecutors said the country’s federal security service (FSB) had “established and documented” that Gershkovich was acting on CIA instructions in the month he was arrested, alleging he had “collected secret information” about a Russian tank factory.
    </p>

            US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Thursday said the allegations against Gershkovich have “absolutely zero credibility.”

            “We have been clear from the start that Evan has done nothing wrong. He should never have been arrested in the first place. Journalism is not a crime. The charges against him are false, and the Russian government knows that they’re false. He should be released immediately,” Miller said at a State Department briefing.

            In the year since his arrest, the 32-year-old journalist has been imprisoned in Moscow’s notorious Lefortovo Prison, and his pre-trial detention period had been extended numerous times.
    </p>

            On Thursday, the State Department’s top hostage official confirmed “as of today, Evan’s detention and the investigative process has ended.”

            Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens said Gershkovich was likely to be moved from Lefortovo to Yekaterinburg – more than 800 miles away –before the end of June, and was then likely to stand trial in that city.
    </p>

            “If it’s anything like what happened to Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan, Trevor Reed, there’ll be a period when he leaves Lefortovo where we won’t have any contact with him,” Carstens explained, referencing other Americans wrongfully detained in Russia.

            “It’ll almost be like it’s gone dark, but eventually, an American or I would say, a detainee surfaces in Yekaterinburg and we’ll have a chance to reestablish that connectivity from there,” Carstens said at a congressional hearing.

            Responding to Thursday’s announcement, WSJ Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker said Gershkovich is facing a “false and baseless” charge.

            “Russia’s latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous. Evan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job. Evan is a journalist. The Russian regime’s smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime. Evan’s case is an assault on free press,” Tucker said in a statement.

            Reporters Without Borders, an international group promoting press freedom, denounced Gershkovich’s indictment. “The espionage accusations must be abandoned and Evan immediately liberated,” it said in a statement.

            US Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy, speaking after Gershkovich’s pre-trial detention was extended in March, said: “Evan’s case is not about evidence, due process, or rule of law. It is about using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.” She called on the Kremlin “to let Evan go.”

            Miller, the State Department spokesperson, reiterated on Thursday that the US would continue to pursue Gershkovich’s release, as well that of Whelan, a former US marine who was arrested in Moscow in 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges he and the US deny.

            “We put a substantial offer on the table to secure the release of Evan and Paul Whelan some months ago, as we said,” Miller said. “Obviously, we’re continuing to work to secure their release. We don’t talk about all the details of that publicly.”

            Russian President Vladimir Putin hinted earlier in the year that “an agreement can be reached” with the United States to release Gershkovich, as he brought up the conviction of a “patriotic” Russian hitman in Germany.

            Speaking in a lengthy and at times ponderous interview with American right-wing pundit Tucket Carlson in February, Putin alluded to the case of Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel from Russia’s domestic spy organization who was convicted of assassinating a former Chechen fighter in broad daylight in Berlin in 2019.

            Speaking to CNN in Berlin to mark the year since Gershkovich’s detention, Polina Ivanova – one of his closest friends and a reporter at the Financial Times – said he was doing “remarkably well” and passing most of his time writing letters “trying to make us feel better.”
