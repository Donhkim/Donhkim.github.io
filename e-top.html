<p>MILWAUKEE (AP) — Former President <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></span> chose <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/jd-vance">Sen. JD Vance</a></span> of Ohio as his running mate on Monday, picking a onetime critic who became a loyal ally and is now the first millennial to join a major-party ticket at a time of deep concern about the advanced age of America’s political leaders. </p><p>“After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network as the Republican National Convention got underway in Milwaukee.</p><p>Hours later, Vance formally received his party’s formal nomination after walking onto the floor of the convention to Merle Haggard’s “American First.” </p><p>The 39-year-old Vance rose to national fame with the 2016 publication of his memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.” He was elected to the Senate in 2022 and has become one of the staunchest champions of the former president’s “Make America Great Again” agenda, particularly on trade, foreign policy and immigration. </p>
    

<p>But he is largely untested in national politics and is joining the Trump ticket at an extraordinary moment in American history. An <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-assassination-attempt-thomas-matthew-crooks-shooter-881581c46c07025898027143fc9132e5">attempted assassination</a></span> of Trump at a rally Saturday has shaken the campaign, bringing new attention to the nation’s coarse political rhetoric and reinforcing the importance of those who are one heartbeat away from the presidency. </p>



<p>Vance himself faced criticism in the wake of the shooting for a post on X that suggested President Joe Biden was to blame for the violence.</p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know about the 2024 Election Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020.

    <div class="Infobox-items RichTextBody"><p><b>What to know about the 2024 Election</b><br></p></div>
    
</div>
<p>“The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a></span> is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,” Vance wrote. “That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.”</p>
    
<p>Law enforcement has not yet specified a motivation for the shooting. </p>
    

<h2>Why Vance was chosen over the other finalists</h2><p>The pick is sure to energize Trump’s loyal base. Vance has become a fixture on the conservative media circuit and frequently spars with reporters on Capitol Hill, helping establish him as the kind of leader who could carry Trump’s mantle into the future, beginning with the next presidential election in 2028.</p><p>But the pick also means that two white men will now lead the Republican ticket at a time when Trump has sought to make inroads with Black and Latino voters. </p><p>In his post announcing his pick, Trump said Vance “will be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American Workers and Farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond.” Several of those Midwestern states are expected to play a critical role in November’s election.</p>
    
<p>But Vance also had another advantage: his chemistry with Trump. Personal relationships are extremely important to the former president and he and Vance have developed a strong rapport, speaking on the phone regularly.</p><p>Trump has also complimented Vance’s looks, saying he reminded him of “a young Abraham Lincoln.”</p>
    

<p>Trump and Vance spoke about 20 minutes before the Truth Social post and Trump formally offered him the job, according to a person familiar with the call who requested anonymity to share the private conversation.</p><p>Trump had long said he wanted to dramatically reveal his pick onstage at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-republican-national-convention-58c09e396b79751c44baed14a1b432a8">the convention</a></span>, which he said would make it more “interesting” and “exciting.” The timing is later than in recent cycles, but hardly unprecedented. In 1980, Ronald Reagan made his decision less than 24 hours before he formally accepted the GOP nomination, and George H.W. Bush waited until his convention in 1988.</p><p>Biden’s reelection campaign issued a statement calling out Vance for saying, had he been vice president, he would have allowed “multiple slates of electors” to challenge Biden’s victory over Trump four years ago. Trump repeatedly promoted falsehoods about election fraud before and after Jan. 6, 2021, when rioters loyal to the former president stormed the Capitol to try to stop the certification of his loss. </p>
    

<p>“Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance as his running mate because Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,” Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in the statement.</p><p>Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, the other contenders on Trump’s shortlist, had been informed earlier Monday afternoon that they were not his pick, according to people familiar with their conversations.</p><p>Trump had spent months testing the field, assessing how his contenders performed on television, at fundraisers and on rally stages. Several, including Burgum and Vance, joined him at his criminal hush money trial in New York. Others were there at the debate last month, where Biden’s disastrous performance upended his campaign, leading to widespread calls for him to step aside in favor or a younger candidate.</p>
    

<p>In “Hillbilly Elegy,” Vance detailed life in Appalachian communities that drifted from a Democratic Party many residents found disconnected from their daily travails. While the book was a bestseller, it was also criticized for sometimes oversimplifying rural life and ignoring the role of racism in modern politics.</p><h2>Vance once was a harsh Trump critic</h2><p>The relationship between Vance and Trump has been symbiotic.</p><p>Vance’s fame grew in tandem with Trump’s unlikely rise from a reality television star to Republican presidential nominee and eventually president. During the early stages of Trump’s political career, Vance cast him as “a total fraud,” “a moral disaster” and “America’s Hitler.”</p><p>But like many Republicans who sought relevance in the Trump era, Vance eventually shifted his tone. He said he was proved wrong by Trump’s performance in office and evolved into one of his most steadfast defenders.</p><p>“I didn’t think he was going to be a good president,” Vance recently told Fox News Channel. “He was a great president. And it’s one of the reasons why I’m working so hard to make sure he gets a second term.”</p><p>Vance was rewarded for his turnaround during his bid for an open Senate seat in 2022, during which he landed Trump’s coveted endorsement and rode it to victory in a crowded Republican primary and a general election hard fought by Democrats. He is close to Trump’s son Donald Jr.</p><p>“Listen, I’ve seen him on TV,” Donald Trump Jr. said of Vance, speaking to CNN from the convention floor. “I’ve seen him prosecute the case against the Democrats. No one’s more articulate than that. And I think his story, his background, really helps us in a lot of the places that you’re going to need from the Electoral College standpoint.”</p><p>Vance is now a Trump loyalist who has challenged the legitimacy of criminal prosecutions and civil verdicts against him and questions the results of the 2020 election. </p><p>He told ABC News in February that, if he had been vice president on Jan. 6, 2021, he would have told states where Trump disputed Biden wins “that we needed to have multiple slates of electors, and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there.”</p><p>“That is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020,” he said.</p><p>Many states adopted emergency measures four years ago to allow people to vote safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. But judges, election officials in both parties and Trump’s own attorney general have concluded there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. </p><h2>Vance’s book vaulted him to national prominence</h2><p>Vance’s book — subtitled “A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis” — was embraced for its <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-business-arts-and-ohio-8c7a70bad96c48df9544049a38584cb8">insights into Trump’s appeal in middle America</a></span>, where manufacturing job losses and the opioid crisis had driven many families like his into poverty, abuse and addiction. </p><p>The tale of Vance’s hardscrabble childhood in Middletown, Ohio, where he was born, and his familial eastern Kentucky hills region also captivated Hollywood. Ron Howard made it into a 2020 movie starring Amy Adams as Vance’s mother and Glenn Close as his beloved “Mamaw.” </p><p>With his grandmother’s encouragement, Vance went on to serve in the Marine Corps, including in Iraq, and to graduate from Ohio State University and Yale Law School. From there, he joined a Silicon Valley investment firm before returning to Ohio to launch a nonprofit that he said would aim to develop opioid addiction treatments that might be “scaled nationally.”</p><p>Ultimately, Our Ohio Renewal <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-entertainment-health-175153d8a80d93b2c9c6654a6a730de9">failed at that mission</a></span> and was shuttered. During the 2022 campaign, then-U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, his Democratic rival, charged that the charity was little more than a front for Vance’s political ambitions. Ryan pointed to reports that the organization made payments to a Vance political adviser and conducted public opinion polling, even as its actual efforts to address addiction largely floundered. Vance denied the characterization. </p><p>As a senator, Vance has shown some willingness to work across the aisle. He and Ohio’s senior senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown, have teamed up on a number of issues important to the state, including fighting for funding for a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-lifestyle-games-video-games-cb3e3a36f48416a25b5d00baa405f91a">$20 billion chip facility Intel is building</a></span> in central Ohio and introducing <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/derailment-ohio-safety-senate-legislation-brown-vance-82c55dc95aca9524d6ae8e6d01336dbe">rail safety legislation</a></span> in response to the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-ohio-evacuations-fires-5d399dc745f51ef746e22828083d8591">fiery derailment in East Palestine, Ohio</a></span>.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Smyth reported from Butler, Pennsylvania.

Many have specifically cited Mr Biden's "bullseye" comment. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">JD Vance, who was announced as Trump's presidential running mate on Monday, said in the wake of the shooting that Democratic rhetoric about the Republican candidate "led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">According to Politico, Mr Biden had said on the donor call: "I have one job, and that's to beat Donald Trump. I'm absolutely certain I'm the best person to be able to do that. So, we're done talking about the debate. It’s time to put Trump in a bullseye."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">President Biden, in an Oval Office address on Sunday, denounced the attack and called for Americans to "take a step back", warning that "political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">When asked in the NBC interview if he had also taken a step back to examine his past remarks for anything "that could incite people who are not balanced", Mr Biden said the inflammatory rhetoric had not come from him. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"I've not engaged in that rhetoric," Mr Biden said. "Now, my opponent is engaged in that rhetoric."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"How do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a president says things like he says?

If they see that it's a threat and they did that in that instance," she said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN">"And I applaud the fact that they made that decision and didn't have to check with anybody and thankfully neutralized the threat."</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Romania's parliament approved the culling of almost 500 bears</strong> this year to control the protected species' "overpopulation" after a deadly attack on a 19-year-old hiker sparked nationwide outcry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The bear attack occurred on July 1, 2024</strong>, when a 19-year-old female tourist was killed while hiking with her boyfriend in the Bucegi Mountains. The bear attacked and dragged her into vegetation, eventually dropping her into a chasm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Romania is home to Europe's largest brown bear population outside of Russia</strong>, with an estimated 8,000 bears according to the environment ministry. Over the last 20 years, bears have killed 26 people and severely injured 274 others in the country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The bear that attacked the hiker was killed after trying to attack rescuers</strong>, who arrived at the scene. The incident has sparked widespread outrage and calls for the culling of bears to prevent further attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experts attribute the increased bear attacks to overpopulation and human-bear conflict</strong>. As human settlements and infrastructure expand, they encroach on bear habitats, leading to increased interactions between humans and bears.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>New law to make spiking a specific criminal offence</strong>: The UK government is set to introduce a new law to make spiking a specific criminal offence in this week's King's Speech, which will be included in more than 35 bills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spiking is already a crime</strong>: While spiking is already covered by other legislation, including the 1861 Offences against the Person Act, Labour's manifesto and the Conservatives' manifesto both advocated for creating a new, specific offence to help police respond better to incidents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased reports of spiking</strong>: According to police data, reports of drink spiking increased by 13% in July to December 2023 compared with the same period in 2022, with the majority of cases happening in public places, particularly bars and nightclubs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Underreported and hard to investigate</strong>: The National Police Chief’s Council has said that spiking is underreported and cases can be hard to investigate because drugs pass through the system quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other key priorities in the programme</strong>: The King's Speech will not only focus on economic measures, but also other key priorities, including the introduction of Martyn's Law, which would require venues and local authorities to have preventative plans to deal with terror attacks.</p>

A few Prime Days ago Amazon started offering invite-only deals for Prime members. To get these deals, you need to log into your Prime account and request an invite. You then have to wait and check your inbox to see if Amazon "invites" you to purchase the deal. Last year, they had an amazing 43" 4K TV deal for $99. Alas, they didn't bring that deal back for Prime Day 2024, but you can check out this year's top invite-only deals below. On a side note, I signed up for that $99 TV deal last year and although I didn't get invited to buy it, I do recall receiving an Amazon credit just for signing up. I can't guarantee they'll do that again this year, but you got nothing to lose!  </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/sales-events/hurry-these-5-invite-only-prime-day-deals-disappear-soon-sign-up-now" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/sales-events/hurry-these-5-invite-only-prime-day-deals-disappear-soon-sign-up-now" data-component-tracked="1"><strong>Prime Day invite only deals</strong></a><strong> — 5 deals to sign up for now</strong></p>

This is Louis here taking over our Prime Day live blog from deals expert Millie. So technically, Prime Day is still a few hours out. It starts on July 16 at 12:01 a.m. (PT), which would be 2:59am here on the East Coast. However, there are hundreds of Amazon deals you can get right now. Likewise, there are plenty of junk deals out there. The purpose of our live blog is to weed out those bad deals and only focus on the good ones. The entire Tom's Guide team will be surfacing those epic deals on items we own or have reviewed. So all that said.....let's continue with the deal hunting! </p>

<p>Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is in talks to buy cybersecurity start-up Wiz for about $23 billion, in what would be the largest acquisition in the tech group’s history, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Alphabet’s discussions to acquire Wiz are still weeks away from completion, said one person with direct knowledge of the matter, while people briefed about the transaction said there was still a chance the deal would fall apart, with a number of details still needing to be addressed in talks.</p><p class="teads-adCall"></p>
<p>If a deal were to be reached it would be a test case for antitrust regulators, which in recent years have been cracking down on tech groups buying out emerging companies in the sector. Alphabet’s last big deal came more than a decade ago with the $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Wiz would mark a further big push into cyber security for Alphabet, two years after it acquired Mandiant for $5.4 billion.</p>
<p>New York-headquartered Wiz has raised about $2 billion from investors since its founding four years ago, according to data provider PitchBook. The start-up, led by Israeli founder and former Microsoft executive Assaf Rappaport, was most recently valued at $12 billion. Its backers include venture capital firms Sequoia and Thrive.</p>
<p>Wiz, which counts multinational groups including Salesforce, Mars, and BMW as customers, helps companies secure programs in the cloud. That has led to a surge in revenue as corporations increasingly operate their software and store data online—Wiz has said it has hit about $350 million in annual recurring revenue, a metric often used by software start-ups.</p>
<p>A deal would be among the largest acquisitions of a company backed by venture capital.</p>
<p>Wiz declined to comment on the talks, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
