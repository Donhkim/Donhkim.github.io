                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — The jury in Donald Trump’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-opening-stormy-daniels-6beee9b99114898ee0dd60185d43bac5">hush money trial</a></span> ended its first day of deliberations without a verdict Wednesday but asked to rehear testimony from key witnesses about the alleged hush money scheme at the heart of the history-making case.</p><p>The 12-person jury was sent home around 4 p.m. after about 4 1/2 hours of deliberations. The process is to resume Thursday, when jurors are expected to rehear the requested testimony and at least part of the judge’s legal instructions meant to guide them on the law.</p><p>The notes sent to the judge with the requests were the first burst of communication with the court after the panel of seven men and five women was sent to a private room just before 11:30 a.m. to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-trial-jury-deliberations-38642e8b525477b49c6cc1320f10f25b">begin weighing a verdict</a></span>. </p><p>“It is not my responsibility to judge the evidence here. It is yours,” Judge Juan M. Merchan told jurors before dispatching them to begin deliberations, reminding them of their vow during the selection process to judge the case fairly and impartially.</p>
    

<p>It’s unclear how long the deliberations will last. A guilty verdict would deliver a stunning legal reckoning for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee as he seeks to reclaim the White House while an an acquittal would represent a major win for Trump and embolden him on the campaign trail. Since verdicts must be unanimous, it’s also possible that the case ends in a mistrial if the jury cannot reach a consensus after days of deliberations.</p>
    
<p>Trump struck a pessimistic tone after leaving the courtroom following the reading of jury instructions, repeating his assertions of a “very unfair trial” and saying: “Mother Teresa could not beat those charges, but we’ll see. We’ll see how we do.”</p><p>He remained inside the courthouse during deliberations, where he posted on his social media network complaints about the trial and quoted legal and political commentators who view the case in his favor. In one all-capital-letters post, he proclaimed that he didn’t even “know what the charges are in this rigged case,” even though he was present in the courtroom as the judge detailed them to jurors.</p>
    

<p>He did not testify in his own defense, something the judge told jurors they could not take into account.</p><p>Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records at his company in connection with an alleged scheme to hide potentially embarrassing stories about him during his 2016 Republican presidential campaign.</p><p>The charge, a felony, arises from reimbursements paid to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-cohen-hush-money-stormy-daniels-735aadfd1ce015e05ba955c203a96f1b">then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen</a></span> after he made a $130,000 hush money payment to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-gag-order-d853768fff5fafbdee55623579889140">porn actor Stormy Daniels</a></span> to silence her claims that she and Trump had sex in 2006. Trump is accused of misrepresenting Cohen’s reimbursements as legal expenses to hide that they were tied to a hush money payment.</p><p>Trump has pleaded not guilty and contends the Cohen payments were for legitimate legal services. He has also denied the alleged extramarital sexual encounter with Daniels.</p><p>To convict Trump, the jury would have to find unanimously that he created a fraudulent entry in his company’s records, or caused someone else to do so, and that he did so with the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/175.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intent of committing or concealing another crime.</a></span></p>
    

<p>The crime prosecutors say Trump committed or hid is a violation of a New York election law making it illegal for two or more conspirators “to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.”</p><p>While the jury must unanimously agree that something unlawful was done to promote Trump’s election campaign, they don’t have to be unanimous on what that unlawful thing was.</p><p>The jurors — a diverse cross section of Manhattan residents and professional backgrounds — often appeared riveted by testimony, including from Cohen and Daniels. Many took notes and watched intently as witnesses answered questions from prosecutors and Trump’s lawyers.</p><p>Jurors started deliberating after a marathon day of closing arguments Tuesday. A prosecutor spoke for more than five hours, underscoring the burden the district attorney’s office faces in needing to establish Trump’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
    

<p>The Trump team need not establish his innocence to avoid a conviction but must instead bank on at least one juror finding that prosecutors have not sufficiently proved their case.</p><p>While giving the jury instructions in the law Wednesday morning, Merchan offered some guidance on factors the panel can use to assess witness testimony, including its plausibility, its consistency with other testimony, the witness’ manner on the stand and whether the person has a motive to lie.</p><p>But, the judge said, “there is no particular formula for evaluating the truthfulness and accuracy of another person’s statement.”</p><p>The principles he outlined are standard but perhaps all the more relevant after Trump’s defense leaned heavily on questioning the credibility of key prosecution witnesses, including Cohen.</p>
    

<p>Jurors asked in the afternoon to rehear at least part of those instructions. They also asked to revisit select key episodes in the trial, though it was not clear why.</p><p>The requests covered testimony from Cohen and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-national-enquirer-d44d4a7ce66cc08edb5981b3afb882ba">former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker about an August 2015 meeting</a></span> with Trump at Trump Tower where the tabloid boss pledged to be the “eyes and ears” of his fledgling presidential campaign.</p><p>Pecker testified that the plan included identifying potentially damaging stories about Trump so they could be squashed before being published. That, prosecutors say, was the beginning of the “catch-and-kill” scheme at the heart of the case.</p><p>Jurors also want to hear Pecker’s account of a phone call he said he received from Trump in which they discussed a rumor that another outlet had offered to buy former <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/karen-mcdougal">Playboy model Karen McDougal’s story alleging that she had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s</a></span>. Trump has denied the affair.</p><p>Pecker testified that Trump told him, “Karen is a nice girl” and asked, “What do you think I should do?” Pecker said he replied: “I think you should buy the story and take it off the market.” He added that Trump told him he doesn’t buy stories because they always get out and that Cohen would be in touch.</p><p>The publisher said he came away from the conversation thinking Trump was aware of the specifics of McDougal’s claims. Pecker said he believed the story was true and would have been embarrassing to Trump and his campaign if it were made public.</p><p>The National Enquirer’s parent company, American Media Inc., eventually paid McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story in an agreement that also included writing and other opportunities with its fitness magazine and other publications.</p><p>The fourth item jurors requested is Pecker’s testimony about his decision in October 2016 to back out of an agreement to sell the rights to McDougal’s story to Trump through a company Cohen had established for the transaction. Such an agreement is known as an “assignment of rights.”</p><p>“I called Michael Cohen, and I said to him that the agreement, the assignment deal, is off. I am not going forward. It is a bad idea, and I want you to rip up the agreement,” Pecker testified. “He was very, very, angry. Very upset. Screaming, basically, at me.”</p><p>Pecker testified that he reiterated to Cohen that he wasn’t going forward with the agreement.</p><p>He said that Cohen told him: “The boss is going to be very angry at you.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow the AP’s coverage of former President Donald Trump at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump</a></span>.</p>

In addition, he says, neither he nor his wife knew of the meanings that are now being ascribed to the flags.</p><p>"A reasonable person who is not motivated by political or ideological considerations or a desire to affect the outcome of Supreme Court cases would conclude that this event does not meet the applicable standard for recusal," Alito wrote in the letters to Democrats. "I am therefore duty-bound to reject your recusal request."</p>    
  <p>Democrats had seized on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/us/justice-alito-flag-appeal-to-heaven.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">New York Times reports</a> that an upside-down American flag had flown outside the Alitos' Virginia home and a separate "Appeal to Heaven" flag had flown outside his vacation home. They argued the two incidents create an appearance of impropriety that require Alito recuse himself from any matters related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot or the 2020 election.</p><p>But going back to 2021, Alito, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by President George W. Bush, has consistently said he had nothing to do with the flying of any flag, which he has said was solely an interest of his wife's. He emphasized that point in both of his letters.</p>

    </p>
<p>On the upside-down American flag that flew briefly outside his Virginia home in 2021, he said in the letters that he had asked her to take it down, and she eventually agreed to do so.</p><p>"My wife's reasons for flying the flag are not relevant for present purposes," he wrote, "but I know she was greatly distressed at the time due, in large part, to a very nasty neighborhood dispute in which I had no involvement."</p><p>Alito wrote that a house on the street displayed a sign attacking his wife personally, and a man living there at the time followed her down the street and "berated her in my presence using foul language, including what I regard as the vilest epithet that can be addressed to a woman."</p><p>"My wife is a private citizen, and she possesses the same First Amendment rights as every other American," Alito continued. "She makes her own decisions, and I have always respected her right to do so."  </p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'>
    </p>
<p>That is consistent with the Alitos' position dating back to 2021, when they were confronted as they were leaving their home by a Washington Post reporter who had been tipped off by a neighbor three years ago about the upside-down flag.</p><p>When the reporter asked about the flag, the Post said Martha-Ann Alito yelled, "it's an international signal of distress!"</p><p>The Post detailed the incident <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/25/alito-flag-martha-ann-washington-post/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">in a piece Saturday</a>, explaining why it decided not to publish the story in 2021.</p><p>"The justice denied the flag was hung upside down as a political protest, saying it stemmed from a neighborhood dispute and indicated that his wife had raised it," the Post said.</p><p>The Post then proceeded to describe the reporter's 2021 encounter with the Alitos outside their home, saying Martha-Ann Alito told the reporter, in apparent reference to the neighbors, "Ask them what they did!'"</p><p>The Post reporter then observed Martha-Ann Alito get out of the car "and then brought out from their residence a novelty flag, the type that would typically decorate a garden. She hoisted it up the flagpole. 'There! Is that better?' she yelled."</p><p>That reporting in 2021 is consistent with Tuesday's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/us/justice-alito-neighbors-stop-steal-flag.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">most recent New York Times story</a> detailing the neighborhood dispute. The Post said it did not publish the story because it was an ongoing neighborhood dispute with Matha-Ann Alito that did not implicate the justice.</p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'>
    </p>
<p>"My wife and I own our Virginia home jointly. She therefore has the legal right to use the property as she sees fit, and there were no additional steps that I could have taken to have the flag taken down more promptly," Alito wrote in the letters.</p><p>On the "Appeal to Heaven" flag, Alito says it also was flown by Martha-Ann Alito. He said he had nothing to do with it, and neither of them saw other meanings in the flags.</p><p>He also said she did not fly it to associate herself with "Stop the Steal" or any other group.</p><p>"As I said in reference to the other flag event, my wife is an independently minded private citizen," Alito wrote. "She makes her own decisions, and I honor her right to do so. Our vacation home was purchased with money she inherited from her parents and is titled in her name. It is a place, away from Washington, where she should be able to relax."</p><p>The justice told House and Senate Democrats that his wife was responsible for the flagpoles put up at their Virginia home and New Jersey vacation house, and said she has displayed a variety of flags in the past, including patriotic flags, college flags, those supporting sports teams, flags from places they've visited, and religious flags. </p><p>"My wife is fond of flying flags," Alito wrote. "I am not."</p><p>He said that Martha-Ann Alito may have mentioned that the "Appeal to Heaven" flag dates back to the American Revolution, but he assumed it was being displayed to express a "religious and patriotic message."</p>

    </p>
<p>"She did not fly it to associate herself with that or any other group, and the use of an old historic flag by a new group does not necessarily drain that flag of all other meanings," Alito wrote.</p><p>One of the letters was addressed to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin and subcommittee head Sheldon Whitehouse, who <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-democrats-seek-meeting-chief-justice-john-roberts-alito-flag/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">requested a meeting</a></span> with Chief Justice John Roberts and urged him to take steps to ensure Alito recused himself from cases pending before the Supreme Court involving Trump's claim of presidential immunity and the Jan. 6 attack. </p><p>The second letter was sent to a group of House Democrats who called for Alito to step aside in the cases.</p><p>Last year, in response to a similar request to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-john-roberts-senate-judiciary-durbin-ethics-reform/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">chief justice said</a></span> because of separation of powers concerns, it would be inappropriate for him to appear to discuss ethics or other matters that may go before the court.</p><p>A meeting with members of only one party to discuss issues that may relate to pending cases before the court would be unprecedented for a chief justice.</p><p><em>Melissa Quinn contributed to this report</em></p>

<p>The European Parliament is the most equal parliament in the bloc, with around 40% women MEPs in 2024, compared to almost 16% in 1979. Still, EU lawmakers can't claim parental leave, can't vote remotely, and can't appoint a temporary replacement.</p>
<p>“If we want a gender-balanced system where fathers, not just mothers, can combine childcare and political activity, we need to recognise the right to a family life,” Raquel García Hermida-van der Walle, candidate for the EU elections in The Netherlands for D66 (Renew Europe), told Euronews.</p>
                    
    




<p>Current electoral laws and the European Parliament’s internal rules don’t envisage the possibility for temporary MEP replacements for maternity, paternity or parental leave nor may votes be transferred by proxy to another member.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Parliament adopted a proposal for a regulation on the election of MEPs which would introduce this possibility. However the proposal remains stalled with the council two years later.</p>
<p>“Parental leave is not about making elected representatives' mandate more comfortable. It's about ensuring the continuity of a mandate conferred by the people to represent them,” MEP Leïla Chaibi (France/The Left) told Euronews.</p>
<p>Chaibi is one of 13 MEPs who last year called for the EU institution to reform its rules to adapt to modern times in a manifesto signed by Parliament President Roberta Metsola (Malta/EPP).</p>
<p>Following the manifesto, Metsola introduced a specific provision for MEPs on maternity leave who missed votes, making the reason for their absence transparent.</p>



<p>From now on, an asterisk next to MEPs' names will indicate those who can't attend votes due to maternity, paternity or parental leave - but further measures are still to come.</p>           <p data-ad-id="adzone-outstream_1" data-ad-type="outstream" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label js-adzone outstream"></p>
  

<p>One of the main asks of the manifesto was the introduction of provisions to enable remote voting, a system already installed and used during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>According to the European Parliament's press services, Metsola has been looking into the possibility of extending use for MEPs on maternity, paternity or parental leave with an internal working group on information and technology innovation strategy.</p>
<p>In a letter dated 2 April 2024, the working group concluded that the introduction of hybrid voting in plenary raises a number of technical, organisational and procedural challenges that need to be further assessed.</p>
<p>The group identified the authentication method, the quality of the remote network connection and the real-time nature of the voting process as the main challenges.</p>
<p>The potential solutions identified were seen as risky even if applied to a small number of voters and as a threat to the essential trust provided by the current voting system.</p>         <p data-ad-id="adzone-native_1" data-ad-type="native" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label advertising--native js-adzone"></p>
  

<p>“This [lack of parental leave] does not encourage the participation of young people or people starting their family life, especially women,” García Hermida said, adding that “you might think twice about running if you are a young politician and you want to have children, or if you have just had children”.</p>
<p>But the EU institution argues that, regardless of gender, no "leave authorisation" is necessary or possible, as MEPs organise the exercise of their free mandate themselves.</p>
<p>“The European Parliament has facilities in Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg to allow parents to work leaving their children in adapted family rooms,” a Parliament spokesperson told Euronews when asked whether they were planning any internal reforms.</p>
<p>For the French left-wing lawmaker, who last year became a mother, the absence of reforms raises a problem of representation.</p>
<p>“This lack of measures does not encourage young people, especially women, to stand for election,” Chaibi argued.</p>

<p>In fact, the average age of an MEP in May 2024 is 53 years old, and only three of them are under 30 years old.</p>



<p>The Parliament said it will keep looking for possible solutions to this issue during the next mandate, as 14 member states already explicitly entitle MEPs to these leave arrangements, including Belgium, Germany, Italy and Sweden.</p>
<p>In Germany, members of the Bundestag are entitled to up to six weeks of maternity leave before the birth of a child and a further eight weeks after, while in Spain, although not officially recognised, MPs can vote remotely while they are absent from parliament.</p>
<p>“The European parliament should be an example of what we expect from companies and citizens," said Chaibi, who is standing for re-election. “By not taking any action to replace elected representatives on parental leave, the EU institution is sending out the wrong signal”.</p>

<p>At Girard College, which has a predominantly Black student body, Biden warned about the threat he said a second Trump presidency would pose and cited some of the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-trump-racism-election-obama-018824651613">racial controversies</a></span> fanned by the presumptive Republican nominee during his life.</p>



<p>“This is the same guy who wanted to tear gas you as you peacefully protested George Floyd’s murder. The same guy who still calls the Central Park Five guilty, even though they were exonerated,” Biden told the crowd. “He’s that landlord who denies housing applications because of the color of your skin.” </p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know about the 2024 Election Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020.

<p>The Philadelphia visit was the start of what the Biden campaign describes as a summerlong effort to engage Black student organizations, community groups and faith centers. It reflects in part how much of their support of him has frayed as Trump aims to make inroads into the longtime Democratic constituency. </p>
    
<p>The issue of abortion rights and the judiciary also featured in the remarks from Biden and Harris. Biden pledged to codify the protections of Roe vs. Wade, the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0">now-nullified</a></span> Supreme Court decision that had legalized the right to an abortion, if he and enough Democratic lawmakers are elected, while Harris noted that Trump dramatically shaped the Supreme Court as she invoked the name of Thurgood Marshall, the high court’s first Black justice.</p>
    

<p>Trump, she said, “handpicked three members of the Supreme Court — the court of Thurgood — with the intention that they would overturn Roe vs. Wade,” the landmark abortion rights ruling. “And as he intended, they did.”</p><p>“Who sits in the White House matters,” she said.</p><p>Underscoring that point later, Biden said the next president is “going to be able to appoint a couple justices.” With some vacancies on the Supreme Court, Biden said he could “put in really progressive judges, like we’ve always had.” </p><p>“Tell me that won’t change your life,” he said. </p><p>Among Black adults, Biden’s approval has dropped from 94% when he started his term to just 55%, according to an <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnorc.org/projects/2024-the-publics-priorities-and-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a></span> poll published in March.</p>
    

<p>The economy has been a particular thorn in Biden’s side since 2022, when <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/key-inflation-report-highest-level-in-four-decades-c0248c5b5705cd1523d3dab3771983b4">inflation hit a 40-year high</a></span>. But there have also been signs of discontent in the Black community more recently over Biden’s handling of the seven-month <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">Israel-Hamas war.</a></span></p><p>Turning out Black voters could prove pivotal for Biden’s chances in what’s expected to be among the most closely contested states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden beat Trump in all six states in 2020, but he could face a more difficult climb this year.</p><p>Trump has been offering himself as a better president for Black voters than Biden.

<p>“No matter how much Biden lies, he cannot gaslight Pennsylvanians into supporting him — his approval ratings are abysmal,” RNC Chair Michael Whatley said. “President Trump continues to lead in polls in Pennsylvania and across the country. Pennsylvanians are ready to Make America Great Again, and they will vote for President Donald J. Trump in November.”</p><p>The Biden campaign wants to use the new engagement effort in part to remind Black voters of some of the Democratic administration’s achievements during his term. On Wednesday, Biden repeated the refrain “because you voted” as he rattled off a litany of his accomplishments for Black Americans, including record funding for historically Black colleges and universities, forgiveness of federal student loan debt and pardons for simple possession of marijuana. </p>
    

<p>“Black voters placed enormous faith in me,” Biden said. “I’ve tried to do my best to honor that trust.” </p><p>Biden later visited with Black business owners at SouthSide, an event space, and greeted supporters there while continuing to tout his accomplishments for Black voters and, in particular, the economic gains under his presidency. In the more intimate gathering, jointly hosted by the African-American Chamber of Commerce of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, he also stressed to the crowd that “there’s not a damn thing that a white man can do that a Black man can’t do, or do better.” </p><p>The Black unemployment rate sits at 5.6%, according to the latest federal government data, compared with an average of about 8% from 2016 to 2020 and 11% from 2000 to 2015.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>A defendant, Corey Harris, was participating in a virtual court hearing in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to discuss his case involving driving with a suspended driver's license.</li>
<li>Harris was caught by surprise by Judge Cedric Simpson, who spotted Harris driving while dialing into the hearing on Zoom.</li>
<li>When questioned by Simpson, Harris claimed he was only parking his vehicle and brought it to a stop before continuing the hearing.</li>
<li>Simpson expressed shock at the situation, pointing out the irony of the case, in which the defendant was driving with a suspended license, and Harris' attorney asked for an adjournment to discuss a potential plea deal.</li>
<li>The incident highlights the unexpected nature of remote court hearings and the potential for defendants to engage in reckless behavior, despite being aware of the consequences of their actions.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Charges dismissed</strong>: All charges against professional golfer Scottie Scheffler have been dismissed, following a thorough review of the case by the Jefferson County Attorney's office.</li>
<li><strong>Arrest details</strong>: Scheffler was arrested earlier this month while in Louisville, Kentucky, for the PGA Championship, after allegedly ignoring an officer's traffic command and injuring the officer with his vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>No criminal wrongdoing</strong>: The prosecution determined that Scheffler's actions did not satisfy the elements of any criminal offenses, and his account of the incident as a "big misunderstanding" was corroborated by the evidence.</li>
<li><strong>Case dismissed with prejudice</strong>: The case was dismissed with prejudice, meaning the charges cannot be brought again. Scheffler's attorney, Steve Romines, stated that this was something they required.</li>
<li><strong>Context</strong>: The arrest occurred hours before Scheffler's second-round tee time at the PGA Championship, and shortly after a fatal accident near the golf course, in which a man was struck and killed by a shuttle bus.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Precision bomb used in Gaza strike</strong>: Four weapon experts analyzed visual evidence and concluded that Israel's military used a U.S.-made precision bomb, SDB GBU-39, in a strike that killed at least 45 people in southern Gaza on Sunday.</li>
<li><strong>250-pound small-diameter precision munition</strong>: The fragments of the SDB GBU-39, a 250-pound small-diameter precision munition, were found near the site of the strike on an encampment in Rafah, where witnesses described the sounds of planes overhead and successive explosions.</li>
<li><strong>Israel's explanation</strong>: Israel said the attack was a "targeted" strike against two Hamas militants, conducted using "the smallest munition" Israeli fighter jets can use. It acknowledged that a fire broke out at the camp, but said it was "unexpected and unintended" and is investigating the possibility that secondary explosions ignited the blaze.</li>
<li><strong>Dispute over bomb size</strong>: While Israel claims it used the smallest possible munition, the weapon experts believe that the SDB GBU-39 is a 250-pound bomb, contradicting Israel's assertion that it used a small munition.</li>
<li><strong>Five people killed</strong>: The strike killed at least 45 people and injured many more, according to witnesses and local reports.</li>

    <div><section class="content__body"><p>A temperature reading collected in Delhi, India's capital territory, may have broken national records as the country grapples with a blistering heat wave. The reading — 52.9 degrees Celsius or 126.1 degrees Fahrenheit — was preliminary and technically an outlier compared with others taken in Delhi on the same day, <a href="https://mausam.imd.gov.in/Forecast/marquee_data/Press%20Release_Delhi%20Temp.%20dated%20%2029-05-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">officials said</a>. But, if confirmed, it would be the highest temperature ever registered anywhere in India.</p><p>The temperature reading came from a substation in Mungeshpur, a neighborhood in Delhi. Located in the northwest, India's capital territory — which includes its capital city, New Delhi — is home to almost 30 million people and covers about 600 square miles of land. The Indian Meteorological Department said in a news release that the reading out of Mungeshpur could be due to a sensor issue or some other error, and that it would examine the data and the sensor. In Delhi, substations in various locations generally registered temperatures between 45.2 degrees and 49.1 degrees Celsius, which corresponds roughly to 113 degrees and 120 degrees Fahrenheit.   </p><p>Amid the heat wave, people in Delhi as well as the northern states Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh were advised to avoid heat exposure under a "red" weather alert issued on Tuesday and Wednesday by the Indian Meteorological Department. The <a href="https://mausam.imd.gov.in/imd_latest/contents/subdivisionwise-warning.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">red alert</a>, designating "heat wave to severe heat wave" conditions, urged people to keep cool if possible and stay hydrated, as at least three deaths have been reported so far in connection with the weather, according to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c166xxd4y36o" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the BBC</a>, a CBS News partner. </p>

<p>Heat waves are most common in India during this time of year, according to the meteorological service, which says they tend to happen between March and June, with peak heat in May. But heat waves in the region have been especially treacherous recently. In April, <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/asia-deadly-heat-wave-india-bangladesh-climate-change/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">hundreds of people across Asia died</a></span> as a result of extremely high temperatures, in India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Gaza, as well as other places. In India, that heat wave drove triple-digit temperatures in a number of areas, including in the eastern city of Bhagora where the temperature <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heat-wave-asia-2024-deaths-india-severe-weather-climate-change/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">approached 115 degrees Fahrenheit</a></span>. The weather damaged crops and forced school closures that came prematurely, weeks ahead of the planned summer break.</p><p>A <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/climate-change/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">study on the extreme weather</a></span> released earlier this month by the organization World Weather Attribution said climate change amplified what may have already been a strong heat wave to make it especially severe. Around that time, Raghu Murtugudde, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Technology Mumbai, told CBS News that El Niño may have played a role as well.</p><p>"I think it's a mix of El Niño, global warming and the seasonality," Murtugudde said. "<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-el-nino-and-la-nina-and-how-do-they-affect-temperatures/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">El Niño is transitioning to La Niña</a></span>. This is the time when the maximum warming happens towards the Indian Ocean. So, all these things are basically adding steroids to the weather."</p><p><em>Arshad R.

The group was at that point allowed to re-take their seats on their original flight.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">American Airlines said in a statement: "We take all claims of discrimination very seriously and want our customers to have a positive experience when they choose to fly with us. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Our teams are currently investigating the matter, as the claims do not reflect our core values or our purpose of caring for people."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The lawsuit adds that while the men waited outside the plane, the pilot made an announcement telling passengers that there was a delay due to an issue with "body odour". The plaintiffs say the claim about odour was false.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Throughout the flight - from the moment of their reboarding, in each interaction with the white male flight attendant, and continuing until landing - Plaintiffs experienced profound feelings of embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, anger, and distress," the lawsuit states. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"The act of returning to their seats after the unwarranted delay, navigating past the predominantly white passengers, several of whom eyed them with anger and undue suspicion, compounded their humiliation."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The lawsuit says that the airline should be forced to pay unspecified damages for the "trauma" the men endured. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">One of the men suing, Mr Joseph, told the BBC that the “alienating” experience reminded him of Civil Rights hero Rosa Parks being forced to move to the back of an Alabama bus in 1955 due to state-sanctioned racial discrimination.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“It's a strange, crazy story that in 2024 we are still going through stuff like this,” said Mr Joseph.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He added that the lawsuit is necessary to make sure American Airlines does not end up “with a slap on the wrist”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In 2017, the NAACP, a civil rights group, issued a travel advisory telling black Americans to avoid American Airlines due to discrimination. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">They lifted the advisory the following year after the carrier announced it had made changes to its operations.</p></div></div>
