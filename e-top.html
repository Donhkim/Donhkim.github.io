            Hamas said it has accepted a ceasefire deal proposed by Egypt and Qatar which seeks to halt the seven-month war with Israel in <a href="https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-05-06-24-intl-hnk/index.html">Gaza</a>.

            Shortly afterwards, Israel said the proposal Hamas had accepted was still far from the “necessary requirements,” but that it would send a delegation to the mediators. It also reiterated its commitment to launch an offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, saying its war cabinet had “unanimously decided” to continue with the operation “to exert military pressure on Hamas.”

            The most recent framework, which Israel helped craft but has not fully agreed to, calls for the release of between 20 and 33 hostages over several weeks in exchange for a temporary ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners.

            After the initial exchange, according to that framework, there would follow what sources describe as the “restoration of sustainable calm” during which the remaining hostages, captive Israeli soldiers and the bodies of hostages would be exchanged for more Palestinian prisoners.

            A diplomatic source familiar with the talks told CNN that after a day-long meeting in Doha, Qatar’s capital, between CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, mediators had convinced Hamas to accept a three-part deal.

            The White House on Monday confirmed that there had “been a response from Hamas” to a proposed hostage deal in Israel, and that US President Joe Biden had been briefed on that response, but otherwise declined to weigh in specifically on what a deal could entail.

            Biden is “aware of where the situation and where the process is,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby told a press briefing. CIA Director Bill Burns remains in the region “working in real time on the ground,” Kirby added.

            “We still believe that reaching an agreement is the absolute best outcome not only for the hostages, but for the Palestinian people and we’re not going to stop working to that outcome,” he said.

            The news comes just hours after Israel <a href="https://cnn.com/2024/05/06/middleeast/israel-gaza-eastern-rafah-evacuation-notice-hnk-intl/index.html">ordered</a> Palestinians living in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza, to “evacuate immediately.”

            The order raised fears that Israel’s long-threatened assault on the city could be imminent. More than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel’s destruction of much of the north of Gaza.
    </p>

            A source familiar with Israeli plans told CNN that a limited incursion into Rafah was intended to keep pressure on Hamas to agree a deal that would bring about a ceasefire and a hostage release.

            Asked whether Hamas’ acceptance of a deal could change Israel’s plans for Rafah, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the military would continue to operate in Gaza. He said operations are ongoing, but that the IDF is making every effort in the negotiations to bring the hostages home as “fast as possible.”

            Netanyahu has come under fierce pressure from the more extreme wing of his coalition not to accept the ceasefire proposal outlined last week, and to focus instead on destroying Hamas in Rafah.
    </p>

            Orit Strook, Israel’s settlements minister and a member of the far-right Religious Zionism party, said last week that accepting the deal would “throw” Israel’s military progress “in the trash.”

            Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel’s national security minister, said Netanyahu had “promised that Israel would enter Rafah, assured that the war would not end, and pledged that there would be no reckless deal.”
    </p>

            But large parts of the Israeli public have demanded Netanyahu accept a deal. Families and supporters of the hostages blocked the Ayalon Highway in Tel Aviv last week, holding a banner reading: “Rafah or the hostages – choose life.”
    </p>

            Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s war cabinet but seen as a rival and possible successor to Netanyahu, said the return of hostages was more urgent that entering Rafah.

            Responding to Monday’s announcement, the Hostages Families Forum said: “Now is the time for all that are involved, to fulfil their commitment and turn this opportunity into a deal for the return of all the hostages.”

The move was designed to enforce the gag order barring Trump from commenting on witnesses, jurors, or the family members of anyone involved.

Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its Atlanta campus to a suburban arena. But others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/campus-protests-commencement-8c83175f17a26535c2cb029edaab1350">with few disruptions.</a></span></p><p>Columbia’s decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May 15 saves its president, Minouche Shafik, from having to deliver a commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled a protest encampment last week. </p>
    

<p>Noting that the past few weeks have been “incredibly difficult” for the community, the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan said it made the decision after discussions with students. </p>



<p>“Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,” officials said. “They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school’s invited guest speakers.”</p>
    
<p>Most of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north at Columbia’s sports complex, officials said.</p><p>Speakers at some of Columbia’s still-scheduled graduation ceremonies include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright James Ijames, former CNN anchor Poppy Harlow, political scientist Ian Bremmer and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, director of the National Institutes of Health. Also, actor Michael J. Fox is scheduled to receive a medal for distinguished service from Columbia’s Teachers College.</p>

    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP correspondent Julie Walker reports Columbia University cancels its main commencement following pro-Palestinian campus protests.</p>
    
</div><p>The University of California, Los Angeles, alerted students Monday that all classes were moving online due to ongoing disruptions following the dismantling of a pro-Palestinian encampment last week. The university police force reported 44 arrests but there were no specific details, UCLA spokesperson Eddie North-Hager said in an email to The Associated Press.</p>
    

<p>Also Monday, police cleared a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of California, San Diego, and arrested more than 30 people, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported.</p><p>The protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages.

Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.</p>
    

<p>Emory’s 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests over the war.</p><p>Ceremonies scheduled for May 13 will now be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university’s Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.</p><p>“Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,” Fenves wrote. “It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies — each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses.”</p>
    

<p>The university called outside police agencies to arrest 28 people after an encampment was erected on the campus quadrangle on April 25. After initially claiming the protesters were outsiders, the university later said 20 were Emory students and three were faculty members. Police used pepper balls and electric stun guns to subdue some of the people who were arrested. Fenves later apologized.</p><p>Protests have continued on the campus since then, including some additional arrests.</p><p>Schools are trying various tactics from appeasement to threat of disciplinary action to get protestors to take down encampments or move to campus areas where demonstrations would be less intrusive.</p><p>The School of the Art Institute of Chicago said in a Facebook post Sunday that it offered protesters “amnesty from academic sanction and trespassing charges” if they moved. </p><p>“Many protesters left the premises of their own accord after being notified by the police that they were trespassing and subject to arrest,” the school said. “Those that remained were arrested after multiple warnings to leave, including some of whom we recognized as SAIC students.”</p><p>A group of faculty and staff members at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill asked the administration for amnesty for any students who were arrested and suspended during recent protests. UNC Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine said in a media advisory that it would deliver a letter on behalf of more than 500 faculty who support the student activists.</p><p>Other universities took a different approach. </p><p>Harvard University’s interim president, Alan Garber, warned student’s Monday that those participating in a pro-Palestinian encampment in Harvard Yard could face “involuntary leave.” That means they may would not be allowed on campus, could lose their student housing and may not be able to take exams, Garber said. </p><p>At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, police restricted access to an encampment after a school deadline for them to leave had passed. About 200 protesters gathered outside the camp, chanting “MIT can’t you see? Palestine will be free” and other slogans.</p><h2>__</h2><p>Associated Press writer Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed to this report. </p><h2>___</h2><p>This story has been amended to change the first name of the president of Columbia University to reflect her preference, Minouche.</p>

    <div><div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC bOdfO " data-testid="prism-article-body"><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC"><span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB">MEXICO CITY -- </span>Relatives have identified three bodies found in a well as those of two Australian surfers and one American who went missing last weekend, Mexican authorities said Sunday.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Baja California state prosecutors said the relatives had viewed the corpses recovered from a remote well about 50 feet (15 meters) deep and recognized them as their loved ones.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Thieves apparently killed the three, who were on a surfing trip to Mexico's Baja peninsula, to steal their truck because they wanted the tires. They then allegedly got rid of the bodies by dumping them in a well near the coast.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The well was located some 4 miles (6 kilometers) from where the foreigners were killed, and also contained a fourth cadaver that had been there much longer.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Three suspects are being held in connection with the case, which locals said was solved far more quickly than the disappearances of thousands of Mexicans.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The three men were on a camping and surfing trip along a stretch of coast south of the city of Ensenada, posting idyllic photos on social media of waves and isolated beaches, before they went missing last weekend.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Chief state prosecutor María Elena Andrade Ramírez described what likely would have been moments of terror that ended the trip for brothers Jake and Callum Robinson from Australia and American Jack Carter Rhoad.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">She theorized the killers drove by and saw the foreigners' pickup truck and tents and wanted to steal their tires. But "when (the foreigners) came up and caught them, surely, they resisted."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">She said that's when the killers would have shot the tourists.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The thieves then allegedly went to what she called "a site that is extremely hard to get to" and allegedly dumped the bodies into a well they apparently were familiar with. She said investigators were not ruling out the possibility the same suspects also dumped the first, earlier body in the well as part of previous crimes.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"They may have been looking for trucks in this area," Andrade Ramírez said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The thieves allegedly covered the well with boards. "It was literally almost impossible to find it," Andrade Ramírez said, and it took two hours to winch the bodies out of the well.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers expressed sympathy for the Robinson family. "I think the whole country's heart goes out to all of their loved ones. It has been an absolutely horrendous, absolutely horrific ordeal and our thoughts are with all of them today," he said at a news conference Monday in the capital, Canberra.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The site where the bodies were discovered near the township of Santo Tomás was near the remote seaside area where the missing men's tents and truck were found Thursday along the coast. From their last photo posts, the trip looked perfect. But even experienced local expatriates are questioning whether it is safe to camp along the largely deserted coast anymore.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The moderator of the local Talk Baja internet forum, who has lived in the area for almost two decades, wrote in an editorial Saturday that "the reality is, the dangers of traveling to and camping in remote areas are outweighing the benefits anymore."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">But in a way, adventure was key to the victims' lifestyle.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Callum Robinson's Instagram account contained the following slogan: "If you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much room."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">At the news conference, Andrade Ramírez was questioned by one reporter who expressed approval that such a massive and rapid search was mounted for the foreigners, but asked why, when local people disappear in the area, little is often done for weeks, months, or years.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"Do you have to be a foreigner in Baja California in order for there to be an investigation if something happens to you? asked the reporter, who did not identify herself by name. "Every investigation is different," Andrade Ramírez replied.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">As if to underscore that point, dozens of mourners, surfers and demonstrators gathered in a main plaza in Ensenada, the nearest city, to voice their anger and sadness at the deaths.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"Ensenada is a mass grave," read one placard carried by protesters. "Australia, we are with you," one man scrawled on one of the half-dozen surf boards at the demonstration.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">A woman held up a sign that read "They only wanted to surf - we demand safe beaches."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Gabriela Acosta, a surfer, attended the protest "to show love, solidarity and respect for the three lives that were lost." Acosta said that surfers in Baja are aware of the dangers.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"We are women and we would sometimes like to surf alone," Acosta said. "But we never do that, because of the situation. We always have to go accompanied."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"I think that what happened to them is just an example of the lack of safety in this state," she said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Surfers later performed a "paddle-out" ceremony where they formed a circle on their boards in the ocean.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Baja California prosecutors had said they were questioning three people in the killings, two of them because they were caught with methamphetamines. Prosecutors said the two were being held pending drug charges but continue to be suspects in the killings.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">A third man was arrested on charges of a crime equivalent to kidnapping, but that was before the bodies were found. It was unclear if he might face more charges.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The third suspect was believed to have directly participated in the killings. In keeping with Mexican law, prosecutors identified him by his first name, Jesús Gerardo, alias "el Kekas," a slang word that means "quesadillas," or cheese tortillas. Andrade Ramírez said he had a criminal record, and that more people may have been involved.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Last week, the mother of the missing Australians, Debra Robinson, posted on a local community Facebook page, appealing for help in finding her sons. Robinson said Callum and Jake had not been heard from since April 27. They had booked accommodation in the city of Rosarito, not far from Ensenada.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Robinson said Callum was diabetic. She also mentioned that the American who was with them was named Jack Carter Rhoad, but the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City did not immediately confirm that. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports of a U.S. citizen missing in Baja, but gave no further details.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN">In 2015, two Australian surfers, Adam Coleman and Dean Lucas, were killed in western Sinaloa state, across the Gulf of California - also known as the Sea of Cortez - from the Baja peninsula. Authorities said they were victims of highway bandits. Three suspects were arrested in that case.</p></div><p class="copyright">Copyright © 2024 by The Associated Press.

Jean-Pierre, Biden’s press secretary, told a White House briefing. “We find them absurd. This is a country that loves dogs and you have a leader that talks about putting dogs down, killing them.”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Noem’s bizarre threat is contained in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/26/trump-kristi-noem-shot-dog-and-goat-book" data-link-name="in body link">No Going Back</a>, a campaign book that generated unusual buzz after the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/26/trump-kristi-noem-shot-dog-and-goat-book" data-link-name="in body link">revealed</a> how Noem describes in detail the day she shot dead her dog, Cricket, which she deemed untrainable and dangerous, and an unnamed goat.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">The revelation sparked a political firestorm, widely held to have incinerated Noem’s chances of being named running mate to Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">But as the book neared publication on Tuesday, it became clear Noem was not done when she closed her chapter on killing Cricket, a 14-month-old female wirehaired pointer, and the unnamed male goat, which Noem says was smelly and aggressive and dangerous to her children.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">At the end of No Going Back, Noem asks: “What would I do if I was president on the first day in office in 2025?”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Remarkably, she writes that “the first thing I’d do is make sure Joe Biden’s dog was nowhere on the grounds. (‘Commander, say hello to Cricket for me.’)”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Noem adds that her own dog, Foster, “would sure be welcome” at the White House.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">“He comes with me to the [state] capitol all the time and loves everyone,” she writes.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Regardless, a governor widely held to have designs on the presidency in 2028 has at least implied, in print, that she would have a predecessor’s dog killed – whether by herself with a shotgun, like Cricket and the goat, or not.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Noem has defended her description of killing Cricket and the goat as evidence of her willingness to do unpleasant but necessary things in farm life as well as in politics.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Commander, a German shepherd owned by Joe and Jill Biden, was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/21/politics/commander-biden-secret-service-bites-white-house/index.html" data-link-name="in body link">removed from the White House</a> after biting Secret Service agents.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">On Monday, Jean-Pierre said: “Commander’s living with family members.”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">The day before, Noem doubled down.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Her host on CBS’s Face the Nation, Margaret Brennan, quoted Noem’s apparent threat to kill Commander and asked: “Are you doing this to try to look tough? Do you still think that you have a shot at being a VP?”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Noem said: “Well, number one, Joe Biden’s dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people. So, how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog and what to do with it?”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Brennan said: “Well, he’s not living at the White House any more.”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Noem said: “That’s a question that the president should be held accountable to.”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Brennan said: “You’re saying he [Commander] should be shot?”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20" class="dcr-jzxpee">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-20" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note" class="dcr-jzxpee">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Noem said: “That what’s the president should be accountable to.”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Noem tried to move on, to talk about Covid in South Dakota. But she also said she was “so proud” of a book that contained “a lot of truthful stories”.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Elsewhere, though, Noem’s publisher, Center Street, <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GM2L3vQWoAATM-K?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" data-link-name="in body link">said</a> that at Noem’s request it was removing from her book “a passage regarding Kim Jong-un … upon a reprint of the print edition and as soon as technically possible on the audio and ebook editions”.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">In her book, Noem writes: “I remember when I met with North Korean dictator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/kim-jong-un" data-link-name="in body link">Kim Jong-un</a>. I’m sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I’d been a children’s pastor, after all).”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">As first <a href="https://www.thedakotascout.com/p/gov-kristi-noems-account-of-meeting" data-link-name="in body link">reported by the Dakota Scout</a>, no such meeting occurred.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Noem told CBS: “What bothers me the most about politicians is when they’re fake.”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Brennan said: “But if you have to retract … parts of [the book] …”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Noem, whose publisher said it would retract part of her book, said: “I’m not retracting anything.”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Brennan said: “OK.”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">On Saturday, Noem attended a Trump Florida fundraiser featuring a host of vice-presidential contenders.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Noem was “somebody I love”, NBC <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-biden-administration-gestapo-private-donor-event-rcna150743" data-link-name="in body link">reported</a> Trump as saying, adding: “She’s been with me, and a supporter, and I’ve been a supporter of hers for a long time.”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">But unlike other hopefuls, among them the South Carolina senator Tim Scott and the New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Noem was not called to the stage.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">She <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-biden-administration-gestapo-private-donor-event-rcna150743" data-link-name="in body link">reportedly</a> left early.</p></div></div>

<p>“These folks have suffered much, people,” Trinity County Sheriff Woody Wallace said Sunday during a Facebook livestream as he rode a boat through a rural flooded neighborhood. Partially submerged cars and street signs peeked above the water around him.</p><p>Areas near Lake Livingston, located northeast of Houston, received upwards of 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/flooding-texas-houston-rain-6ce0245bee07ab15509a631ece95675e">over the past week</a></span>, National Weather Service meteorologist Jimmy Fowler said.</p>




    
<p>In Johnson County, south of Fort Worth, a 4-year-old boy died when he was swept away after the vehicle he was riding in became stuck in swift-moving water near the community of Lillian just before 2 a.m. Sunday, an official said. The Tarrant County medical examiner’s office said the cause of death of the child, who would have turned 5 later this month, was drowning.</p><p>The child and two adults were trying to reach dry ground when they were swept away. The adults were rescued around 5 a.m. and taken to a hospital, while the child was found dead around 7:20 a.m. in the water, Johnson County Emergency Management Director Jamie Moore wrote in a social media post.</p>
    

<p>Storms brought 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain in a span of six to eight hours in some areas from central Texas to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Stalley said.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth="">

    </div><p>Since last week, storms have forced numerous high-water rescues in the Houston area, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes.</p><p>Greg Moss, 68, stayed put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River. A day earlier, he had packed up many of his belongings and left before the road to his home flooded.</p><p>“I would be stuck for four days,” Moss said. “So now at least I can go get something to eat.”</p><p>Moss moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor’s home, where he planned to stay until the waters recede. The floodwaters had already gone down by a couple of feet and he wasn’t worried his home would flood because it’s located on higher ground, Moss said Sunday.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin recently announced <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/putin-visit-china-ukraine-war-97c6790d093ecfe1234044841b462a78">plans to visit China this month</a></span>.</p><p>Last year, Macron appealed to Xi to “bring Russia to its senses,” but the call wasn’t followed by any apparent action by Beijing.</p><p>Both leaders also expressed their concerns regarding the situation in the Middle East, where Macron said France and China share the “same goals,” that is “to achieve an immediate cease-fire to release hostages, protect the populations, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, encourage a regional deescalation and reopen a political perspective.”</p>
    
<p>Xi called <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">the Israel-Hamas war</a></span> a “tragedy” that is “a test of human conscience.”</p><p>“The international community must do something. We call for an immediate, comprehensive and sustainable cease-fire in Gaza,” he said.</p><p>In addition, Xi expressed China’s willingness to work with France “to take the Paris Olympics as an opportunity to advocate a global cease-fire and cessation of war during the Games.”</p>

<p>“For trade to be fair, access to both markets needs to be reciprocal,” von der Leyen said after the meeting. “Our market is and remains open to fair competition and to investments, but it is not good for Europe if it harms our security and makes us vulnerable.”</p><p>She said that Europe “will not waver from making tough decisions needed to protect its economy and its security.”</p><p>The discussions were expected to be closely watched from Washington, a month before U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to pay his own state visit to France.</p><p>Xi’s European trip, the first in five years, seeks to rebuild relations at a time of global tensions.

<p>Several groups — including International Campaign for Tibet and France’s Human Rights League — urged Macron to put human rights issues at the heart of his talks with Xi. Protesters demonstrated in Paris as Xi arrived on Sunday, calling for a free <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/tibet">Tibet</a></span>.</p><p>Amnesty International called on Macron to demand the release of Uyghur economics professor <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/775669bd984a44d1bcc203f4bda45d3b">Ilham Tohti</a></span>, who was jailed in China for life in 2014 on charges of promoting separatism, and other imprisoned activists.</p><p>On Monday, media watchdog Reporters Without Borders staged a protest in front of the Arc de Triomphe monument to denounce Xi’s visit, calling the Chinese president “one of the greatest predators of press freedom.” The group says 119 journalists are imprisoned in the country.</p>
    

<p>Macron said in an interview published Sunday that he would raise human rights concerns. He didn’t mention the issue in his public comments Monday. </p><p>The second day of the visit is meant to be more personal. Macron has invited Xi to visit the Tourmalet Pass in the Pyrenees mountains, where the French leader spent time as a child to see his grandmother. The trip is meant to be a reciprocal gesture after Xi took Macron last year to the residence of the governor of Guangdong province, where his father once lived.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Barbara Surk in Nice, Angela Charlton in Paris and Ting Fu in Washington, contributed to this story.</p>

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons — massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric expressed concern that various parties have been talking about issues regarding nuclear weapons more and more recently.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“Current nuclear risks are at an alarmingly high level,” Dujarric said. “All actions that could lead to miscalculation, escalation with catastrophic consequences, must be avoided.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine’s Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine’s Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">French President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn’t exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv’s forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron’s recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“It’s a new round of escalation,” Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. “It’s unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Russia’s Foreign Ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors. It urged the British ambassador “to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Sweden’s Foreign Minister Tobias Billström said the nuclear exercises “contribute to increasing instability.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“In the current security situation, Russia’s actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,” Billström told Swedish news agency TT.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia’s Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a “global catastrophe.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">It wasn’t the first time Europe’s military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.’s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The ministry said the exercise is intended to “increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks” and will be held on Putin’s orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: “Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin’s regime; it does not constitute major news.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Western officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance’s soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Peskov dismissed those claims as “new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Germany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s party. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Meanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia’s Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv’s forces in recent months.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">One of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">It was not possible to independently confirm the report.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">While Ukraine’s army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Russia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine’s air force said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">___</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN">Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Afghanistan's only female diplomat, Zakia Wardak, has resigned after being caught by Indian authorities trying to smuggle £1.6 million worth of gold into India.</li>
<li>Wardak was appointed as Afghanistan's Consul-General in Mumbai before the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021 and had been acting as the country's most senior representative in India since the Afghan embassy in New Delhi shut down in November.</li>
<li>Wardak was stopped by airport authorities in Mumbai with her son, who was carrying 25kg of gold, but due to her diplomatic immunity, she was not arrested, and the gold was confiscated by India's Directorate of Revenue Intelligence.</li>
<li>Wardak did not mention the gold in her resignation statement, instead criticizing the "numerous personal attacks and defamation" she had faced over the past year, which she said had targeted women in Afghan society.</li>
<li>The incident has highlighted the difficulties faced by Afghan diplomats, who have refused to cede official buildings and positions to the new Taliban authorities and have remained in post, issuing visas and paperwork.</li>
