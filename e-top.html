<ol>
<li><strong>George Clooney calls for Joe Biden to quit the presidential race</strong>: The Hollywood actor and Democratic Party fundraiser wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times that Biden's age and declining performance make it unlikely for him to win in November.</li>
<li><strong>Nancy Pelosi also raises doubts about Biden's candidacy</strong>: The former House Speaker dodged questions about whether Biden should continue his candidacy, saying that "time is running short" for him to make a decision and that it's up to Biden to decide if he will run.</li>
<li><strong>Clooney says Biden is not the same man he used to be</strong>: Clooney, who met with Biden at a fundraising event, said that the president seemed to be a different person and was no longer the energetic and confident leader he once was.</li>
<li><strong>Growing dissent within the Democratic Party</strong>: The article mentions that public dissent is growing within the Democratic Party, with many party leaders and members expressing concerns about Biden's candidacy and his ability to beat Donald Trump in November.</li>
<li><strong>Biden's campaign is adamant that he will continue his candidacy</strong>: Despite the growing dissent, Biden's campaign remains firm that he will continue to run for president and beat Trump in November, based on a letter he sent to Democrats in Congress stating his commitment to his candidacy.</li>

He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020." </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate," Clooney said. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The fundraising event, held in Los Angeles, brought in a single-night record of roughly $30m (£23.3m) for the Biden campaign.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"This is about age. Nothing more," he continued. "We are not going to win in November with this president."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Clooney added that his concerns matched those of "every" member of Congress he had spoken to.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Asked to respond, Mr Biden's campaign referred to a letter the president sent Democrats in Congress that said he was "firmly committed" to his candidacy and beating Trump.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Yet public dissent continues to grow within Mr Biden's party as he faces scrutiny while hosting the Nato summit in Washington.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mrs Pelosi, still one of the most powerful Democrats on Capitol Hill, on Wednesday appeared to disregard Mr Biden's insistence that he was determined to continue.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">When asked if he should stay in the election race, she told MSNBC's Morning Joe: "I want him to do whatever he decides to do." </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run. We are all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A Biden campaign spokesperson referred to Mrs Pelosi's comments on Tuesday, in which she said that she had "always been committed" to the president.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Around a dozen elected Democrats have suggested he abandon his campaign since his 27 June debate with Trump.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On Tuesday, Michael Bennet of Colorado became the first Democratic senator to publicly dissent. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Although he did not call for Mr Biden to quit outright, he said Trump would win the election, possibly by a "landslide". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">When asked about Mr Bennet's comments, the Biden campaign repeated the president's statement that he was "running this race to the end". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Others have been more direct. Mikie Sherril, a congressman for North Jersey, said in a statement: "I am asking that he declare that he won’t run for re-election." </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Acknowledging the demands on the president, Ms Pelosi told MSNBC: "I said to everyone - let's just hold off. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I am very proud of the president."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Pat Ryan, a congressman from New York, later wrote on X: “For the good of our country, for my two young kids, I’m asking Joe Biden to step aside."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Overall support from elected Democrats remains robust, however. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Gavin Newsom, the California governor who was named by Clooney as a potential replacement, said he was still “all in” with Mr Biden. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Congressional Black Caucus, a group of roughly 60 politicians, and newer House members like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, have publicly backed him. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On Tuesday, Chuck Schumer, the leading Democrat in the Senate, said: "I'm with Joe."</p></div></div>

<p>The BBC said on Wednesday that the women killed were the family of its main radio racing commentator, John Hunt – his 61-year-old wife Carol Hunt and their daughters Louise and Hannah, aged 25 and 28 respectively.</p>
<p>“Following extensive inquiries, the suspect has been located and nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time,” said Detective Inspector Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit.</p>
<p>“This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims’ family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened,” she added.</p>
<p>Jenkins said the investigation is moving “at pace” and that formal identification of the victims is yet to take place. She also said that the “premature” naming of the victims “caused great upset”.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson called the incident “horrific”, telling reporters a crossbow and possibly other weapons were believed to have been involved.</p>
<p>John Hunt is BBC radio’s main horse-racing commentator, his voice known to millions through his coverage of the world-famous Grand National and the Derby.</p>
<p>British media reported that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse, which is just south of London.</p>
<p>Police did not say if Clifford, who is from London, is connected to the women.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>

<li><strong>A 2-year-old girl died</strong> after her father left her in a hot car in Marana, Arizona on Tuesday afternoon, with temperatures reaching 111 degrees.</li>
<li><strong>The father allegedly knowingly left the child</strong> in the car, running errands and returning home to find the car with the air conditioning still on, but the child unresponsive.</li>
<li><strong>The cause of death was determined</strong> to be a heat-related tragedy, with the child pronounced dead at the hospital after being taken there by paramedics.</li>
<li><strong>This is a recurring issue</strong> across the US, with at least 9 children dying in hot cars so far this year and 1,093 children dying in hot cars since 1990, with 88% of those children being 3 years old or younger.</li>
<li><strong>No charges have been filed</strong> at this time, but interviews are ongoing and police are looking for surveillance video to aid in their investigation.</li>

                                        <p>HOUSTON (AP) — Houston’s biggest utility came under mounting pressure Wednesday over its response to Hurricane Beryl, as nearly 1.4 million area homes and businesses remained without power and residents searched for places to cool off, fuel up and find something to eat.</p><p>City Council member Abbie Kamin called the extended lack of power a “life safety concern.”</p><p>“We say ‘everything we can do’ to get the lights back on. In my opinion, respectfully, they should be on,” Kamin told a CenterPoint Energy executive during a council meeting.</p><p>“This was a Category 1 (storm),” Kamin said, referring to the weakest type of hurricane. ”We know that this severe weather, the extreme weather due to climate change, is real and we’ve known for some time.”</p><p>Power outages peaked at 2.7 million customers after the storm made landfall in Texas on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. Brad Tutunjian, vice president for regulatory policy for CenterPoint Energy, defended the company’s response and told council members that more than 1 million customers had their power restored by Wednesday morning, although the company’s online tracker put the figure at just under a million at the time.</p>
    

<p>“To me, I think that’s a monumental number right there,” he said.</p>



<p>The company has acknowledged that most of the 12,000 workers it brought in to help the recovery effort were not in the Houston area when the storm arrived. Initial forecasts had the storm blowing ashore much farther south along Gulf Coast, near the Texas-Mexico border, before heading toward Houston.</p>
    
<p>The company would not ask third-party workers from other companies and municipalities to pre-position and “ride out” the storm, “because that is not safe,” he said.</p><p>“We ask you to get as close as possible, so you can respond as efficiently as practical,” he said of the instructions given to the workers.</p><p>Tutunjian noted how difficult it is to quickly restore power that was cut off by falling trees and branches. </p>
    

<p>“When we have storms such as this, with the tree completely coming down … taking out our lines and our poles, that’s where all the time comes in to do the restoration work,” he said.</p><p>Council members pressed Tutunjian about why the company, which has been the Houston area for about 100 years, hasn’t lain more of its power lines underground. He replied that it has been laying all new lines underground in residential areas for decades.</p><p>Two council members said they received a text about a house that burned down after reporting a downed power line. The texts reported the fire department said it could not do anything, and the utility company did not respond. </p><p>Beryl has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths — one in Louisiana and six in Texas — and at least 11 in the Caribbean.

    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP correspondent Jennifer King reports Houston is sweltering as utilities work to restore power after Beryl.</p>
    
</div><p>A flood watch was in effect for parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. The storm spawned suspected tornadoes in parts of Indiana and Kentucky.</p>
    

<p>In the Houston area, Beryl compounded and repeated the misery of May, when <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/houston-texas-storms-power-outages-86643a6d7decd28e971774e03b52e51d">storms killed eight people</a></span> and left nearly a million customers without power.</p><p>High temperatures in Houston on Wednesday were expected to climb into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius), with humidity making it feel even hotter.</p><p>People coped as best they could. Kyuta Allen took her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet.</p><p>“During the day, you can have the doors open. But at night, you’ve got to board up and lock up — lock yourself like into a sauna,” she said. </p><p>Raquel Desimone, who sought relief in a cooling center, has lived in the Houston area since about 2000 and has been through multiple hurricanes and tropical storms. Still, was surprised and frustrated having to scrambled yet again for power and shelter from the heat.</p><p>“I went through Rita, Ike, Imelda and Harvey,” Desimone said. “That the infrastructure can’t handle a basic storm, leaving for a Category 1, (it) is sort of crazy to me that I’m having to do this.”</p>
    

<p>Nim Kidd, head of the state’s division of emergency management, stressed that restoring power was the top priority. </p><p>Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is overseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals ran on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p><p>State officials planned to use a sports and event complex to temporarily hold up to 250 hospital patients who are awaiting discharge but cannot be released to homes with no power. </p><p>Patrick said Tuesday that he would wait until after the recovery effort to focus on CenterPoint’s response and whether the company was poorly prepared.</p><p>“CenterPoint will have to answer for themselves, if they were prepared, if they were positions. Their company is responsible for that. The state was in position,” he said. “I’ll tell you whether I’m satisfied or not when I have a full report of where their crews were when they were asked to come in.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Vertuno reported from Austin.</p>

        </div><p></p><p>“This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,” said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.</p>
    

<p></p><p>Tuesday’s high temperature tied the mark of four straight days above 115 F (46.1 C) set in July 2005. And Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.</p><p></p><p>Keith Bailey and Lee Doss met early Wednesday morning at Las Vegas park to beat the heat and exercise their dogs Breakie, Ollie and Stanley.</p>
    
<p></p><p>“If I don’t get out by 8:30 in the morning, then it’s not going to happen that day,” Bailey said, wearing a sunhat while the dogs played in the grass.</p><p></p><p>Alyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas.

One was an 83-year-old man in Washington County and the other was a 72-year-old man in Multnomah County. Seven of the deaths were men and one was a woman.

<p>Stubb and Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs both said the language was expected in the final summit declaration from all 32 NATO allies.</p><p>“I think it’s very important to give a message to the Kremlin from here — that Ukraine’s path and bridge towards NATO membership is now irreversible,” Stubb told reporters.</p>



<p>Zelenskyy, fearing his country would otherwise be left to fight a stronger Russia indefinitely, has <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-nato-summit-russia-war-7f6a042e323af10e0425239ea5a023c3">battled for at least a firm guarantee</a></span> from NATO that Ukraine can join the military alliance. </p>
    
<p>The U.S. and some other countries have opposed membership for Ukraine during the conflict with Russia to avoid an escalation of tensions that could lead to a larger war. They also have stressed that Ukraine must take <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-war-democracy-elections-corruption-96ba4df874521bb7b3ca1cf54dd99598">significant steps to address corruption</a></span> as well as other systemic reforms.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has long bitterly opposed neighboring Ukraine’s fight to join the Western alliance, declaring it an encroachment on Russia’s security and interests.</p>
    

<p>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg underlined that Ukraine <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nato-ukraine-summit-membership-russia-weapons-26bea768680e784a43d79172ebdefa30">will not join the alliance’s ranks immediately</a></span>. But he insisted that must happen after the war is over to ensure that Russia never attacks Ukraine again.</p><p>“I strongly believe that when the fighting stops, we need to ensure that Ukraine has the capabilities to deter future aggression from Russia, and they need security guarantees,” Stoltenberg said.</p><p>President Joe Biden, who later appeared on stage with Stoltenberg, reaffirmed U.S. support for Ukraine but also more broadly the importance of NATO. He reiterated that since he took office, the number of allies spending at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defense has <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nato-defense-spending-stoltenberg-biden-5246409eec70745e6e936d997073a6f4">increased from nine to 23</a></span> and that the number of battle groups has doubled on NATO’s eastern flank. </p><p>“We can and will defend every inch of NATO territory, and we will do it together,” Biden said.</p><p>Zelenskyy, in Washington for the NATO summit, had stressed what he called Ukraine’s urgent need for the F-16 fighter jets in a speech to friendly Republican lawmakers Tuesday night. He said his country needed more than 100 to start to counter devastating Russian air attacks on Ukraine’s cities, energy infrastructure and other vital targets. He said Russia was using 300 jets to carry out the attacks.</p>
    

<p>In a post on X, Zelenskyy thanked the three countries “for taking practical steps to achieve the goal of all Ukrainians: to strengthen the Ukrainian air force with F-16s.” The first flight-ready jets were being transferred by the Netherlands and Denmark, and the White House said they would be “flying operational” this summer. </p><p>Zelenskyy also thanked Belgium and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/norway-ukraine-f16-fighter-jets-f75cdfeca4d4bcd7117ed7fdfafb4cf4">Norway for their commitment</a></span> to send more of the jets.</p><p>Six nations, including the United States, are training Ukrainians on the F-16s, but officials have not released precise numbers or all the locations.</p><p>According to a U.S. official, a small number of pilots have graduated from U.S. training at Morris Air National Guard Base in Tucson, Arizona. The U.S. has said it expects to train about a dozen by the end of the year. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to provide detail not disclosed publicly.</p>
    

<p>Zelenskyy, meanwhile, met behind closed doors with senators for nearly an hour Wednesday and requested more defense help, said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del.</p><p>“He thanked the strong bipartisan leadership of the Senate for providing robust funding and expressed concerns on making sure we actually deliver,” Coons said.</p><p>Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said he met two years ago with Ukrainian pilots who requested F-16s, including one who has since been killed. Zelenskyy said no F-16s have yet arrived in Ukraine, Sullivan said.</p><p>“This is one of the patterns that is so frustrating to people like me who have been supporting these national security supplementals, and more importantly to them, which is the delay of all these weapons systems,” he said. “It is really outrageous.”</p>
    

<p>Separately Wednesday, the U.S. and Germany announced they would begin “episodic deployments” of long-range missiles to Germany in 2026, including Tomahawk, SM-6 and hypersonic missiles.</p><p>The announcement is notable because land-based firing of some of those missiles from within Europe would have been banned under the former Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. They were banned because the conventional missiles could have been modified to be nuclear capable and their use on the European continent would have meant that potential targets would have had no time to react. </p><p>Kimball said while the deployment is likely being done to reassure allies, Russia may respond by deploying conventional or nuclear weapons of its own.</p><p>European and U.S. allies have <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-nato-summit-patriot-air-defense-6bf639e3a76e9ea8adbdadabd2660490">announced other new arms deliveries</a></span>, such as dozens of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-electricity-power-plant-russia-attack-air-defenses-d02555dd2e4f3f7c6447f26085ae4eb0">air defense systems</a></span>, including Patriots, this week. </p><p>The promises of new weapons come after opposition from Republican lawmakers allied to former President Donald Trump <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-aid-congress-republicans-trump-johnson-mcconnell-4cb76cfdefc38f35c1bda2ac8915b179">blocked a U.S. support package to Ukraine</a></span> for months earlier this year, allowing Russia to make battlefield gains against Ukrainian forces who were fighting with dwindling arms and ammunition.</p><p>Europeans and NATO, as a lesson from that setback, have vowed to take on more of the responsibility for ensuring a reliable flow of military support to Ukraine.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, was asked several times on Fox News Radio as he campaigns for a second term whether he wants the U.S. to exit NATO. He answered, “No, I want them to pay their bills.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Cook reported from Brussels.

While that is still historically low, it’s up from 3.4% early last year.</p><p><em>Read more: </em><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/how-does-the-labor-market-affect-inflation-205628202.html" data-ylk="slk:How does the labor market affect inflation?;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link" data-rapid_p="14"><em>How does the labor market affect inflation?</em></a></p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks before House lawmakers Wednesday.
