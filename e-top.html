                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The House voted Wednesday to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/garland-contempt-biden-classified-documents-justice-department-bc2fb71b225ae672eb257ee2055cfa67">contempt of Congress</a></span> for refusing to turn over audio of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-classified-documents-age-trump-2024-4791639cc06cc0affee55aba80c7e6b3">President Joe Biden’s interview in his classified documents</a></span> case, Republicans’ latest and strongest rebuke of the Justice Department as partisan conflict over the rule of law animates the 2024 presidential campaign. </p><p>The 216-207 vote fell along party lines, with Republicans coalescing behind the contempt effort despite reservations among some of the party’s more centrist members. Only one Republican — Rep. David Joyce of Ohio — voted against it.</p><p>Garland said in a statement late Wednesday, “It is deeply disappointing that this House of Representatives has turned a serious congressional authority into a partisan weapon. Today’s vote disregards the constitutional separation of powers, the Justice Department’s need to protect its investigations, and the substantial amount of information we have provided to the Committees.”</p>
    

<p>He added, “I will always stand up for this Department, its employees, and its vital mission to defend our democracy.”</p><p>Garland is now the third attorney general to be held in contempt of Congress. Yet it is unlikely that the Justice Department — which Garland oversees — will prosecute him. The White House’s decision to exert executive privilege over the audio recording, shielding it from Congress, would make it exceedingly difficult to make a criminal case against Garland. </p>



<p>Nonetheless, Speaker Mike Johnson defended the decision to push ahead with what is now a mostly symbolic effort. </p>
    
<p>“Look, we did our job on the contempt, and I think it sends an important message,” the Louisiana Republican said following the vote. “We’ll see what happens next, but, I mean, the House has to do its work and I’m pleased with the outcome today.”</p><p>The White House and congressional Democrats have slammed Republicans’ motives for pursuing contempt and dismissed their efforts to obtain the audio as purely political. They also pointed out that Rep. Jim Jordan, the GOP chair of the House Judiciary Committee, defied his own congressional subpoena last session. </p>
    

<p>“This contempt resolution will do very little, other than smear the reputation of Merrick Garland, who will remain a good and decent public servant no matter what Republicans say about him today,” New York Rep. Jerry Nadler, the top Democrat on Judiciary Committee, said during floor debate. </p><p>Garland has defended the Justice Department, saying officials have gone to extraordinary lengths to provide information to the committees about Special Counsel Robert <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-hur-biden-special-counsel-classified-documents-0f8e4a9d99f8b7d035f75f78e9b8d3d3">Hur’s</a></span> classified documents investigation, including a transcript of Biden’s interview with him.</p><p>“There have been a series of unprecedented and frankly unfounded attacks on the Justice Department,” Garland said in a press conference last month. “This request, this effort to use contempt as a method of obtaining our sensitive law enforcement files is just most recent.” </p><p>Republicans were incensed when Hur <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-hur-biden-special-counsel-classified-documents-0f8e4a9d99f8b7d035f75f78e9b8d3d3">declined to prosecute</a></span> Biden over his handling of classified documents and quickly opened an investigation. GOP lawmakers — led by Jordan and Rep. James Comer — sent a subpoena for audio of Hur’s interviews with Biden during the spring. But the Justice Department only turned over some of the records, leaving out audio of the interview with the president. </p>
    

<p>On the last day to comply with the Republicans’ subpoena for the audio, the White House blocked the release by invoking executive privilege. It said that Republicans in Congress only wanted the recordings “to chop them up” and use them for political purposes.</p><p>Executive privilege gives presidents the right to keep information from the courts, Congress and the public to protect the confidentiality of decision-making, though it can be challenged in court.</p><p>Administrations of both political parties have long held the position that officials who assert a president’s claim of executive privilege can’t be prosecuted for contempt of Congress, a Justice Department official told Republicans last month. </p>
    

<p>Assistant Attorney General Carlos Felipe Uriarte cited a committee’s decision in 2008 to back down from a contempt effort after President George W. Bush asserted executive privilege to keep Congress from getting records involving Vice President Dick Cheney.</p><p>Before Garland, the last attorney general held in contempt was Bill Barr in 2019. That was when the Democratically controlled House voted to issue a referral against Barr after he refused to turn over documents related to a special counsel investigation into Trump. </p><p>Years before that, then-Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt related to the gun-running operation known as <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ab23eac5b2264f67a40b0c98ab17cdfd">Operation Fast and Furious</a></span>. In each of those instances, the Justice Department took no action against the attorney general. </p><p>The special counsel in Biden’s case, Hur, spent a year investigating the president’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-michael-pence-us-federal-bureau-of-investigation-9c2d7f472b8ff63f76f2c9fbb03dfde2">improper retention of classified documents</a></span>, from his time as a senator and as vice president. The result was a 345-page report that questioned Biden’s age and mental competence but recommended no criminal charges for the 81-year-old. Hur said he found insufficient evidence to successfully prosecute a case in court.</p>
    

<p>In March, Hur stood by his no-prosecution assessment in testimony before the Judiciary Committee, where he was grilled for more than four hours by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers.</p><p>His defense did not satisfy Republicans, who insist that there is a politically motivated double standard at the Justice Department, which is prosecuting former President Donald Trump over his retention of classified documents at his Florida club after he left the White House.</p><p>But there are major differences between the two probes. Biden’s team returned the documents after they were discovered, and the president cooperated with the investigation by voluntarily sitting for an interview and consenting to searches of his homes. </p><p>Trump, by contrast, is accused of enlisting the help of aides and lawyers to conceal the documents from the government and of seeking to have <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-classified-documents-justice-department-special-counsel-2025feb3f0f4e3820d14387c67ce4316">potentially incriminating evidence</a></span> destroyed.</p><p>__ Associated Press writers Kevin Freking and Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report. </p>

The proposed amendment was by far the most animating issue headed into this year’s SBC annual meeting, one that even colored other decision-making — including the election for SBC president.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">If the measure passed, more churches were expected to <a href="https://baptistnews.com/article/the-sunday-we-left-the-southern-baptist-convention/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">voluntarily leave</a> the Nashville-based denomination. For some, it would be due to a message downplaying women’s contributions to the church, while others saw the SBC becoming overbearing about certain doctrinal beliefs.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Is this amendment necessary for the convention to respond when churches in our convention act in a way contrary to our complementarian doctrine?" North Carolina pastor Spence Shelton said in the only speech against the measure during a brief floor debate.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We showed last year we have an effective mechanism," Shelton said. "It allows us to act with conviction and unity when it comes to this issue.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Had the measure succeeded, it would have allowed SBC leaders to more strictly enforce doctrinal beliefs surrounding the role of women in ministry by disfellowshipping churches that do not adhere to those standards. But even without the constitutional change, the SBC has disfellowshipped seven churches over these standards. The most high-profile cases were that of Southern California megachurch Saddleback Church and Louisville's Fern Creek Baptist Church, which both unsuccessfully appealed their ouster at the 2023 SBC annual meeting.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We are also grieved that this vote has ever even taken place," Meredith Stone, executive director of Baptist Women in Ministry, a nonprofit with partners across various Baptist denominations, said in <a href="https://myemail-api.constantcontact.com/A-Statement-from-BWIM-on-the-failure-of-the-SBC-s-Law-Amendment.html?soid=1102474630869&amp;aid=JqXdAjRNCwc" data-type="link" data-id="https://myemail-api.constantcontact.com/A-Statement-from-BWIM-on-the-failure-of-the-SBC-s-Law-Amendment.html?soid=1102474630869&amp;aid=JqXdAjRNCwc" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">a statement on Wednesday</a>.

"And he wrote His word for the flourishing of both men and women."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">On Tuesday, the convention overwhelmingly approved the ouster of First Baptist Church Alexandria in Virginia for holding to an egalitarian view of women in ministry instead of complementarianism — referring to a belief that men and women have different assigned roles.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“First Baptist Alexandria stands before you as a testament that we can maintain a fruitful partnership with churches that take a different stance on women in ministry,” said FBC Alexandria senior pastor Robert Stephens during a floor debate Tuesday afternoon.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/religion/2024/06/11/southern-baptist-convention-gathers-in-indianapolis-for-annual-meeting/74013144007/" data-t-l=":l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - Southern Baptist Convention meets in Indianapolis for denomination's top legislative event" data-g-r="nav_mo" data-g-tn="pgcss" data-g-mtn="pg74013144007" data-g-moh="hpgm" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" data-c-id="74013144007"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/11/PIND/74056629007-061124-sb-cindy-kmw-009.JPG?crop=3115,1752,x0,y105&amp;width=660&amp;height=372&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/11/PIND/74056629007-061124-sb-cindy-kmw-009.JPG?crop=3115,1752,x0,y105&amp;width=1320&amp;height=744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt=""><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="50"><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg__ca"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"></use></svg><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_expand"></use></svg></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="Southern Baptist Convention meets in Indianapolis for denomination's top legislative event" aria-label="Nation's largest Protestant denomination gathers in Indianapolis to take up decisions on women pastors, abuse reform and SBC presidential election."></p></a><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Local church autonomy is an important belief among Southern Baptists, and the idea of partnership, or cooperation, was a major theme going into this week’s SBC annual meeting mostly due to the Law Amendment. Critics warned against the SBC becoming overly prescriptive about certain doctrine for autonomous churches, while proponents said cooperation shouldn’t come at the risk of adherence to certain tenets.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">SBC President Bart Barber and the SBC Cooperation Group, an ad hoc task force that Barber appointed to study the denomination’s standards of affiliating with churches, admonished the convention to extend a spirit of generosity across differences. But even if Southern Baptists took that message to heart, the resolution to this debate came down to cold, hard numbers.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Messengers voted 61% in favor of the Law Amendment on Wednesday morning, falling short of the required two-thirds majority for constitutional amendments.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/11/PIND/74063456007-061124-sb-cindy-kmw-039.JPG?width=300&amp;height=301&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/11/PIND/74063456007-061124-sb-cindy-kmw-039.JPG?width=600&amp;height=602&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Lauren Buss, from the First Baptist Church in Okmulgee, OK, joins others in song during the Southern Baptist Convention, Tuesday, June 11, 2024 at the Indiana Convention Center."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Lauren Buss, from the First Baptist Church in Okmulgee, OK, joins others in song during the Southern Baptist Convention, Tuesday, June 11, 2024 at the Indiana Convention Center." data-c-credit="Kelly Wilkinson/IndyStar"></p></figure><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Battle over women’s authority in church to persist</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Specifically with the debate on women’s authority in the church, the fallout of Wednesday’s decision likely won’t deviate much from the current climate.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We know that even though the amendment failed, women who pastor in Southern Baptist churches will continue to be diminished, demeaned, and denigrated," Stone said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Stone's nonprofit organized a virtual prayer vigil on Monday night and a demonstration outside the Indiana Convention Center as the SBC met.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/11/PIND/74063026007-061124-sb-cindy-kmw-025.JPG?width=660&amp;height=652&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/11/PIND/74063026007-061124-sb-cindy-kmw-025.JPG?width=1320&amp;height=1304&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Meredith Stone, executive director with the Baptist Women in Ministry, reads community prayers of solidarity and affirmation as the group protests, while standing outside the Southern Baptist Convention, Tuesday, June 11, 2024."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Meredith Stone, executive director with the Baptist Women in Ministry, reads community prayers of solidarity and affirmation as the group protests, while standing outside the Southern Baptist Convention, Tuesday, June 11, 2024." data-c-credit="Kelly Wilkinson/IndyStar"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“We swallowed our grief when we were told we weren’t ready to lead,” speaker Anjie Hong said during the prayer vigil on Monday. “These untruths and these lies have hurt us. These lies have wounded us, made us question ourselves and worse, made us question the God who created us in God’s image.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">If anything, the past couple years have cemented the means by which the SBC can exclude churches with women pastors. The mechanism the denomination uses to initiate that exclusion, a group that evaluates reports against churches called the SBC Credentials Committee, was initially reformulated in 2019 to only address sexual abuse and racism in churches.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This conflict over policy limiting church leadership to men isn’t exclusive to the SBC. The Presbyterian Church in America, a smaller yet similarly influential evangelical Christian denomination, is <a href="https://byfaithonline.com/general-assembly-updates-for-tuesday-june-11/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">set to deliberate</a> a legislative proposal to add a clause to the denomination’s policies that “only qualified men may be invited to preach in any of the churches under our care.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><em>Liam Adams covers religion for The Tennessean.

    <div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told Hamas that it is "time for the haggling to stop", after its leaders proposed "numerous changes" to a plan for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He told reporters in Doha that some of the changes were "workable" and others were not, but that the US and mediators Qatar and Egypt would "try to close this deal".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Hamas said on Tuesday that it was ready to "deal positively" with the process but stressed the need for Israel to agree to a permanent ceasefire and full withdrawal from Gaza.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Israeli government did not comment, but an anonymous official said the Palestinian armed group’s response amounted to a rejection.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Israel’s prime minister has not yet publicly endorsed the proposal, which US President Joe Biden said had been offered by the country when he outlined it 12 days ago.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But Mr Blinken said Benjamin Netanyahu had "reaffirmed his commitment" during a meeting in Jerusalem on Monday.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The UN Security Council also passed a resolution supporting the proposal that day, adding to the diplomatic pressure that Washington is exerting.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The BBC is part of the travelling press pool on the US secretary of state’s visit to Qatar - a glittering Gulf location that belies the sense of regional crisis he is attempting to solve with a diplomatic tour taking place at breakneck speed.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There was an embrace and smiles Mr Blinken met the Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">His country is a key player in this crisis, having hosted the political offices of Hamas for more than a decade and been a conduit for negotiations with Israel.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Blinken seemed exasperated as he told a joint news conference that they had been discussing the changes requested by Hamas to the US-backed ceasefire proposal.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"A deal was on the table that was virtually identical to a proposal that <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68964108" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">Hamas put forward on 6 May</a> - a deal that the entire world is behind, that Israel has accepted, and Hamas could have answered with a single word: 'yes'," he said.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Instead, Hamas waited nearly two weeks and then proposed more changes, a number of which go beyond positions that it had previously taken and accepted. As a result, the war that Hamas started… will go on, more people will suffer, Palestinians will suffer, more Israelis will suffer."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Blinken did not clarify what changes he said Hamas was demanding, nor did a brief statement issued by the group itself on Tuesday evening.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The statement did, however, reiterate a demand for what Hamas called "a complete halt of the ongoing aggression against Gaza" and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A member of Hamas's political bureau, Izzat al-Rishq, said the response was "responsible, serious and positive" and that it opened up "a wide pathway" to reach an agreement.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Israeli prime minister’s office did not release an on-record reply.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But a statement was issued by an anonymous Israeli official, who said that Hamas had "changed all of the main and most meaningful parameters" and "rejected the proposal for a hostage release that was presented by President Biden".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In a later statement on Wednesday, cited by Reuters news agency, Hamas said it had shown "full positivity" in its efforts to reach an agreement, adding that it had urged Mr Blinken to put "direct pressure" on Israel.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Despite the setbacks, Mr Blinken said the US, along with Qatar and Egypt, would "try to close this deal".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"I believe those gaps are bridgeable. But that doesn't mean they will be bridged because, ultimately, Hamas has to decide."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Sheikh Mohammed said both Hamas and Israel needed to make some concessions.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"We are witnessing a shift in this conflict in the recent period and there is a clear and firm call to end this war," he noted.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Blinken also said it was crucial to develop plans for the “day after the conflict” in Gaza as soon as possible in order to achieve an enduring end to the war.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"In the coming weeks, we will put forward proposals for key elements of a 'day after plan', including concrete ideas for how to manage governance, security, reconstruction," he added.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">More than 37,200 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 of the hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 116 hostages are still being held, 41 of whom are presumed dead.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Biden said <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cw8860gn1nwo" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">the new proposal involved three phases</a>.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The first would involve an initial six-week ceasefire, when Hamas would release some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - in exchange for Israel releasing an undefined number of Palestinian prisoners. There would also be a withdrawal of Israeli forces "from all populated areas of Gaza" and a "surge" in humanitarian assistance.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The second phase would see all remaining living hostages released and the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza as part of a “permanent cessation of hostilities", but the latter would still be subject to further negotiations.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">During the third phase, the remains of any dead hostages would be returned and a major reconstruction plan for Gaza would commence.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">While the White House is in effect trying to bounce the sides into progress on an agreement, Israel’s leadership remains deeply sceptical about it.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Far-right ministers are pressuring Mr Netanyahu to ignore Washington’s diplomacy and have threatened to quit his governing coalition and trigger its collapse if the US-backed proposal goes forward, seeing it as a surrender to Hamas.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The prime minister has not unequivocally voiced support for the plan, which he has acknowledged was authorised by his war cabinet.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The actual Israeli proposal - reportedly lengthier than the summary presented by Mr Biden - has not been made public and it is unclear whether it varies from what the president conveyed. It was presented to Hamas days before Mr Biden's speech.</p></div></div>

                                        <p>PHOENIX (AP) — Republicans are responding to Hunter Biden’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-gun-trial-federal-charges-delaware-5dd8a9380235c6360a1ddb691ef24a06">conviction</a></span> on federal gun charges with some version of, “That’s it?”</p><p>Loyal to Donald Trump, they largely echoed the former president’s claim that the Justice Department has treated President Joe Biden’s son with kid gloves while <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/manhattan-district-attorney-alvin-bragg-trump-122d18a4ae43e3190df54a4b7ec297ff">zealously prosecuting</a></span> Trump. Using the attention given to Hunter Biden’s conviction for charges related to buying a gun while addicted to drugs, they pressed unsubstantiated or debunked allegations that Joe Biden — while vice president — acted to advance his family members’ foreign business interests.</p><p>The GOP’s argument that Joe Biden is ordering prosecutors to target political opponents has been hurt by the Biden-led Justice Department prosecuting the president’s son — with Biden declining to stop the investigation or pardon Hunter Biden. But in making that case, Republicans may be trying to deflect from Trump’s own stated intentions to wield the criminal justice system against opponents if he returns to the White House.</p>
    

<p>While president, Trump tried to undercut the Justice Department investigation into his campaign’s alleged ties to Russia and issued pardons to a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/steve-bannon-trump-pardons-broidy-66c82f25134735e742b2501c118723bb">raft of former campaign aides, friends and donors</a></span>. And on the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-guilty-republicans-vengeance-a05db7fa2512a62afe035992f2baaf16">declared he is the victim of a “rigged” system</a></span> and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-retribution-indictment-documents-biden-american-democracy-5a8ec37b359fee85d0f0956139d79f51">promised to appoint a special prosecutor</a></span> to target Biden and his family. </p>



<p>House Republicans <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/garland-contempt-congress-vote-biden-classified-documents-20f5e8f48cfd8390eb695d13079ca306">voted Wednesday</a></span> to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/garland-contempt-biden-classified-documents-justice-department-bc2fb71b225ae672eb257ee2055cfa67">contempt of Congress</a></span>, further escalating their battle with the Justice Department. </p>
    
<p>And Trump sent a fundraising email with the subject line, “Haul out the Guillotine!” The email claimed Trump’s critics have a “Sick Dream” to see him beheaded, the latest example of Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric since his hush money conviction. </p><p>In a deal with prosecutors last year, Hunter Biden was supposed to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses and avoid prosecution in the gun case if he stayed out of trouble for two years. But the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-criminal-case-joe-biden-2024-015cba20dfba90930706fc8a7d4ae38d">deal fell apart</a></span> after the judge, who was nominated by Trump, questioned unusual aspects of the proposed agreement, and the lawyers could not resolve the matter.</p>
    

<p>He was convicted Tuesday and faces a potential 25 years in prison, though as a first-time offender he is likely to get far less time or avoid prison entirely. </p><p>He still faces a trial in September in California on <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-federal-tax-case-california-bb2e2eb41eb2cd30206a47c40ba6044e">charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes</a></span>, and congressional Republicans have signaled they will keep going after him in their stalled impeachment effort into the president. The president has not been accused or charged with any wrongdoing by prosecutors investigating his son.</p><p>Biden definitively ruled out pardoning his son during an ABC News interview last week. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday did not rule out the president issuing a potential commutation that might reduce or erase a sentence while leaving the conviction intact. </p><p>Hunter Biden’s conviction came weeks after a New York jury found Trump <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0">guilty of 34 counts</a></span> related to a hush money payment to a porn actor during the 2016 campaign. Trump falsely claims the verdict was “rigged.” Biden said he accepted his son’s verdict. </p>
    

<p>Trump’s campaign issued a statement calling the Hunter Biden verdict “nothing more than a distraction from the real crimes of the Biden Crime Family.” Several of his allies followed. </p><p>“Remember this was Joe Biden’s corrupt DOJ that tried to negotiate outside immunity unrelated to this case,” said Rep. Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican and a contender to be Trump’s vice presidential running mate. “Today is the first step in delivering accountability for the Biden Crime Family.”</p><p>Sen. J.D. Vance, an Ohio Republican and another vice presidential contender, shared a post by Ohio Republican Senate candidate Bernie Moreno saying the gun charges were meant to “insulate and protect” the president. </p><p>Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said the guilty verdict was “appropriate” and didn’t undercut his own <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-verdict-republicans-revenge-1c35203e6fd5a62d490969bea1eb9174">criticism</a></span> of a two-tiered system of justice for Trump and the Bidens.</p>
    

<p>“Every case is different,” Johnson said. “And clearly the evidence was overwhelming here. I don’t think that’s the case in the Trump trial, and all the charges that have been brought against him have been obviously brought for political purposes. Hunter Biden is a separate incident.”</p><p>Democrats did not attack the Justice Department or the courts. Said Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., the No. 3 House Democrat: “Hunter Biden sat before a jury of his peers, a verdict was rendered and House Democrats believe in the rule of law, and so we respect that ruling.”</p><p>As president, Trump repeatedly sought to shape the criminal inquiry into whether his 2016 presidential campaign had conspired with Russia.</p><p>He fired the FBI director who led the investigation, berated the attorney general he appointed for recusing himself from overseeing the probe and directed his White House counsel to seek the termination of special counsel Robert Mueller. Those acts, and others, contributed to an investigation into whether he had illegally sought to obstruct the Russia inquiry; Mueller did find evidence of obstruction but declined to make a finding about whether Trump had broken the law.</p>
    

<p>More recently, Trump and allies have suggested that if elected he might advocate the imprisonment of political opponents, something he championed even before he became president.</p><p>In a Fox &amp; Friends interview this month, he falsely asserted that he had not used the words “lock her up” in reference to Hillary Clinton and his 2016 opponent’s use of a private email server to transmit sensitive information as secretary of state. He said he could’ve sought to have her jailed but that it “would have been a terrible thing.”</p><p>He suggested things are different now that he faces four felony indictments, including the New York case that resulted in a conviction. </p><p>“And then this happened to me, and so I may feel differently about it,” he said.</p><p>The charges against Hunter Biden stem from a dark period in his life, during which he acknowledges a spiraling descent following the death of his brother, Beau Biden, to cancer in 2015. Jurors found him guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer when he bought a revolver in 2018, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.</p><p>Many in Trump’s Republican Party are staunchly against gun control and some of his supporters have questioned whether Hunter Biden should have been tried on the gun charges. </p><p>Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and high-profile Trump supporter, posted on X, “The Hunter Biden gun conviction is kinda dumb.”</p><p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters at the Capitol that the gun charge was a “waste of time,” though he said other accusations related to Hunter Biden’s taxes were “serious.”</p><p>“I just think he’s being punished,” Graham said, adding the average person would be “put in drug diversion or something.”</p><p>Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., made similar comments. </p><p>“Hunter might deserve to be in jail for something, but purchasing a gun is not it,” Massie posted on X. “There are millions of marijuana users who own guns in this country, and none of them should be in jail for purchasing or possessing a firearm against current laws.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Tucker reported from Washington.

Bob Menendez as he was being vetted for the prosecutor’s job in late 2020, months after he was among the dozens of guests at the senator’s intimate wedding ceremony.</p></div><p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"></p><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K3JSLYCUEJDXPG3WUO3YDORHNE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Sellinger, a prosecution witness in Menendez’s corruption trial in Manhattan federal court, described himself as a longtime friend and fundraiser for the New Jersey Democrat.

Daibes is now a co-defendant in the trial, accused of bribing Menendez and his wife with gold bars and cash.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-bHCGeL-isStandardLayoutAd-true article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="cb db dn-ns" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-mobile"><div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-md mt-sm pt-sm pb-sm ad-mobile"><div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"><p class="dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md">Story continues below advertisement</p></div><p class="relative flex flex-column justify-center w-100"><wp-ad id="slug_mob_bigbox" class="chromatic-ignore" data-chromatic="ignore" data-slot="/701/wpni.national-security/justice" aria-hidden="true" data-renderbehavior="never" data-refresh="true" data-json='{"targeting":{"zeus_rendercount":"1","zeus_slot":"slug_mob_bigbox.init.dsk","kpi":"ctr","pos":"mob_bigbox","ctr":["zeus_mob_bigbox"],"wp_ad_refresh":"0","wp_refresh":"mob_bigbox_0","pwt":["mob_bigbox_mab_0"]}}'></wp-ad></p></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZD4A5CA4NRESZKLOGZ74GCEIQE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">When Sellinger called Menendez to invite him to his investiture ceremony, the senator flatly turned him down, he testified.

The two men discussed his priorities and vision for the top prosecutor’s job, as well as civil rights, violent crime and candidates for Sellinger’s leadership team. Then Menendez said Daibes “was being treated unfairly” by the federal prosecutors and asked Sellinger to “look at it carefully” if he were confirmed.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J3KPT74MMZCT5LBSGS7MV6QSMA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">In a phone call the next day, Sellinger testified, he told Menendez he would look at all cases carefully, before adding that he might have to recuse himself from the Daibes prosecution.

We are not a toy in their hands. Our sons, daughters, and families killed without a reason. For what?” </p>
    

<p>More than 1 million people have fled Israel’s invasion of the southern Gaza city Rafah, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.</p><p>“Every day there is a truce, there is no truce. We want a solution. We want to return to our homes,” said a displaced man, Salama Abu al-Qumbuz. “We are tired of this life, sleeping in the street, transporting water. Our lives have become very boring.”</p><p>The United Nations says over one million people in Gaza face desperate hunger and don’t have enough clean drinking water.</p><p>Other residents of Deir al-Balah took a more cynical view of the back-and-forth truce talks.</p><p>“I expect the war to continue. There are no negotiations,” said Abu Jamil al-Maqadma. “The negotiations are false.”</p>
    

<h2>Palestinian shot and severely wounded in Jerusalem’s Old City during an argument with Israelis, including off-duty troops, authorities say</h2><p>JERUSALEM — A Palestinian man was shot and severely wounded when a group of Israelis opened fire during an argument with a group of men in Jerusalem’s Old City on Wednesday, police and hospital officials said, the latest spasm of violence in the already tense district.</p><p>Four armed Israeli men — an off-duty soldier, two off-duty reservists and a civilian — got into an altercation with Palestinians that included throwing objects and physical violence, according to the police. Three other men were injured.</p><p>“Those involved fired shots, some of which are suspected to have hit at least one of those involved,” the police report said. The man was taken to a hospital for medical treatment. Israeli media reported he was a shop owner in the Old City.</p><p>One of the soldiers who opened fire claimed he felt threatened during the episode, police said. The shooting is under investigation and because a soldier was involved, a report was sent to the army’s criminal investigation unit. There was no indication this was a terrorist attack, police said.</p>
    

<p>Video posted on social media shows the wounded man bleeding on the ground in a narrow shop-lined street as people shouted at each other, including at least three armed Israelis. Police rush in and seek to separate the groups. Bystanders use pieces of cloth to stem the man’s bleeding.</p><p>The shooting in Jerusalem, the emotional heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, took place as tensions are high over the war in Gaza.

He communicates with us very willingly, laughs and jokes,” said Kozlov.</p><p>For Israel, the most successful hostage rescue so far brought nationwide elation and removed some of the stain from the army’s unprecedented collapse on Oct. 7, when Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people and took approximately 250 others hostage.</p><p>For Palestinians, however, the rescue marked a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-06-09-2024-61eb1be9a9d0cf2dbf250cd4a8ed4dbf">day of horror</a></span>. The operation sent hundreds of dead and wounded flooding into already beleaguered hospitals. Palestinian health officials say at least 274 Palestinians, including dozens of women and children, were killed in the operation.</p><p>While Kozlov says his son is smiling and looks physically well, Andrey told his parents there are things he’ll never divulge about his time in captivity.</p><p>What he’s described so far involved often harsh conditions, crammed into a small room with two of the other rescued hostages, at times with their hands and feet bound.</p><p>If they did anything wrong they were punished, such as being forced to lie under blankets in the heat for hours until they became dehydrated, said Kozlov. They could also speak only in whispers, not allowed to communicate with each other.</p><p>Since being rescued, his son is most preoccupied with the other hostages, especially since the guards told him his conditions were “very good” compared to the others, said Kozlov.</p><p>About 120 hostages remain in Gaza, with 43 pronounced dead. Those believed to still be alive include about 15 women, two children under age 5 and two men in their 80s.</p><p>Cease-fire negotiations have been at an impasse for months.</p><p>Kozlov said that even if a deal was reached, his son wouldn’t have been among the first released, with women, the injured and elderly as priorities.</p><p>He was doubtful he’d ever see his child again.</p><p>“This is very emotional because we weren’t counting on this outcome,” he said.</p><h2>Blinken says some of Hamas’ proposed changes to a cease-fire plan in Gaza are workable and some not</h2><p>DOHA, Qatar — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that mediators would keep trying to close an elusive cease-fire deal after <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-06-11-2024-d3733d55c6a66222da1a4a051997094c">Hamas proposed numerous changes</a></span> to a U.S.-backed plan, some of which he said were “workable” and some not.</p><p>The back-and-forth laid bare frustration over the difficulty of reaching an accord that can bring an end to eight months of war that has decimated Gaza, killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and left scores of Israeli hostages still languishing in militant captivity.

Blinken did not spell out what changes Hamas was seeking but he said the mediators — Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. — will keep trying to “close this deal.” He put the onus on Hamas, accusing it of changing its demands.</p><p>“Hamas has proposed numerous changes to the proposal that was on the table. ... Some of the changes are workable. Some are not,” Blinken told reporters in Qatar. “I believe that they (the differences) are bridgeable, but that doesn’t mean they will be bridged because ultimately Hamas has to decide.”</p><p>The Palestinian militant group says the “amendments” aim to guarantee a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. </p><p>Those provisions are included in the proposal announced by U.S. President Joe Biden, but Hamas has expressed wariness whether Israel will implement the terms. And although the U.S. says Israel has accepted the proposal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-netanyahu-biden-politics-ca984e5fc518f4f5f0fbd041b5c39ddb">given conflicting statements</a></span>, saying Israel is still intent on its goal of destroying Hamas. </p><p>The proposal’s three-phase plan would begin with a six-week cease-fire and the release of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas and Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes. Aid distribution would also increase.</p><p>At the same time, negotiations would start over the second phase, which is to bring “a permanent end to hostilities” and “full withdrawal” of Israeli troops from Gaza in exchange for the release of all remaining hostages.</p><p>A major hitch for both sides appears to be the negotiations for the second phase. Phase three would see the launch of a reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of remains of deceased hostages.</p><h2>Over 200 rockets fired from Lebanon after Israel kills Hezbollah commander</h2><p>BEIRUT — Hundreds of rockets were fired from Lebanon toward northern Israel on Wednesday morning, hours after Israeli airstrikes killed four officials from the militant Hezbollah group including a senior military commander.</p><p>The Israeli military said that about 215 projectiles were detected. It said that some were intercepted, and that several fires were caused by the strikes.</p><p>Taleb Sami Abdullah, 55, who was known within Hezbollah as Hajj Abu Taleb, was the most senior commander killed since fighting began eight months ago. His death came amid rising escalation along the Lebanon-Israel border that has seen Hezbollah intensify its attacks on northern Israel while Israeli airstrikes have struck deep inside Lebanon.</p><p>Hezbollah’s Al-Manar TV reported that rockets were being fired from south Lebanon into northern Israel. Sirens were sounded in northern Israel, according to Israeli media.</p><p>A Hezbollah official said Abdullah was the most senior commander to be killed in Lebanon since the latest round of violence along the Lebanon-Israel border began in October adding that he was the commander of the group’s Nasr Unit that is charge of parts of south Lebanon close to the Israeli border.</p><p>The Israeli strike destroyed a house in Jwaya where Abdullah and three other officials were holding a meeting, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border, late on Tuesday.</p><p>The Hezbollah official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said Abdullah was more senior than a commander who was killed in January, Wissam al-Tawil.</p><p>Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed over 400 people, most of them Hezbollah members, but the dead also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed since the war in Gaza began.</p><p>— AP writer Bassem Mroue contributed. </p><h2>Lebanese militant group Hezbollah says a senior commander has been killed</h2><p>BEIRUT — Lebanese militant group Hezbollah announced early Wednesday the death of one of its commanders, identified as Taleb Sami Abdullah or “Hajj Abu Taleb.”</p><p>The group did not give details on the location and circumstances of his death, but identified him as a “martyr on the road to Jerusalem,” the term it uses for those killed in the current conflict with Israel. Hezbollah published a photo of Abdullah alongside Wissam al-Tawil, another senior commander killed in an Israeli strike in January.</p><p>The Israeli military did not immediately comment on Abdullah’s death.</p><p>Cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has intensified in the past month, as Israel launched its offensive into the key southern Gaza city of Rafah. Hezbollah has also stepped up its attacks, striking deeper inside Israel and introduced new and more advanced weaponry.</p><p>Israeli drone strikes have killed hundreds of Hezbollah members since exchanges of fire began on Oct. 8, a day after the Israel-Hamas war began in Gaza.</p><p>Since then, more than 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah members. The dead also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, at least 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed.</p>

Higher rates helped to push the average rate on 30-year mortgages above 8% for the first time in decades last year. Borrowing costs for everything from home equity lines of credit, auto loans and credit cards have also spiked.</p><p><a href="https://foxbusiness.onelink.me/Zkcx?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxbusinesssaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxbusiness.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong><u>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</u></strong></a></p><p>Yet the rapid rise in rates has not stopped consumers from spending or businesses from hiring.
