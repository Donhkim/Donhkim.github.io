<p>“This case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,” prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told jurors.</p><p>The trial featured allegations that Trump and his allies conspired to stifle potentially embarrassing stories during the 2016 presidential campaign through hush money payments <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-gag-order-d853768fff5fafbdee55623579889140">, including to a porn actor</a></span> who alleged that she and Trump had sex a decade earlier. Trump has denied having sex with both women. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hush-money-trial-michael-cohen-witness-091b0e50af2738eb261f395e9d658505">nor the Trump attorney who paid her</a></span> can be trusted in their testimony.</p>




    

<p>“President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,” Blanche said.</p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hush-money-stormy-daniels-michael-cohen-2723054e49944eecb6c86008ec4adabd">Following more than four weeks of testimony</a></span>, the daylong summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. The political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden’s campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.</p>
    
<p>Steinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. He acknowledged that Daniels’ account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times “cringeworthy” but said the details she offered — including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump’s toiletry kit — were full of touchstones “that kind of ring true.”</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

Trump has spent the majority of his time as a criminal defendant sitting nearly motionless for hours, leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed. It is in part a strategy in response to warnings that behaving like he has in past trials could backfire. Trump has also been able to speak several times a day to a gaggle of media camped outside the courtroom, giving him an outlet to vent his frustrations. (Michael M.

<img class="Image" alt="Jurors take notes as Stormy Daniels testifies in Manhattan criminal court, Tuesday, May 7, 2024, in New York. The testimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. The deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in an process that's intentionally opaque.

<p>Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It’s unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.</p><p>Though the case featured seamy details about sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges turn on something more mundane: reimbursements Trump signed for Cohen for the hush money payments.</p><p>The reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election. Defense lawyers say Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family.</p>
    

<p>In his own hourslong address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump’s “deny everything” approach, Blanche attacked the entire foundation of the case. </p><p>He said Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organization for reimbursement and that there was no proof that Trump knew what staffers were doing with the payments. He disputed the contention that Trump and Daniels had sex, and he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.</p><p>“Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,” Blanche said.</p><p>But as expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Cohen, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-michael-cohen-ec08be1219703deb3cd10604844deacb">with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination</a></span>.</p><p>Mimicking the term “GOAT,” used primarily in sports as an acronym for “greatest of all time,” Blanche labeled Cohen the “GLOAT” — greatest liar of all time. The lawyer also called Cohen “the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.” That language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
    

<p>“He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,” Blanche said.</p><p>The attorney’s voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Blanche sought to unravel Cohen’s claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.</p><p>Cohen said he had contacted Trump’s bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Blanche asserted that at the time Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem.</p><p>“It was a lie,” Blanche said. “That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.”</p><p>In his testimony, Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump. But he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost: “My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result,” he said.</p><p>Steinglass used a bit of stagecraft to challenge the defense’s assertion that Cohen was lying about the subject of that phone conversation, demonstrating a hypothetical version of the call to show jurors how Cohen and the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, could have covered multiple subjects in less than a minute.</p><p>Cohen’s actual call to Schiller’s phone number lasted 96 seconds, according to phone records. Steinglass showed, with his hypothetical, that Cohen could’ve spoken to Schiller about the prank calls, asked him to pass the phone to Trump and then discussed the Daniels deal with Trump, all in 49 seconds.</p><p>The New York prosecution is one of four <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/trump-investigations-civil-criminal-tracker/index.html">criminal cases</a></span> pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Biden.

<p>Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said that the day would "remain etched in Spanish history" after the Cabinet approved the move.</p>

<p>Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide also hailed the "milestone" moment as the decision to recognize a Palestinian state came into effect.</p>

<p>The three European countries had planned a simultaneous recognition in the hopes that its symbolism would spur other countries to also commit to recognition, however, on the same day the Danish parliament voted down a proposal for such a move.</p>

<p>"It's the only way of advancing toward what everyone recognizes as the only possible solution to achieve a peaceful future, one of a Palestinian state that lives side by side with the Israeli state in peace and security," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address before the Cabinet meeting.</p>

<p>Israel has repeatedly condemned the move and on Tuesday its foreign minister accused Sanchez of inciting the genocide of Jews.</p>

<p>Israel's operations in Gaza, especially its most recent move into Rafah, have left it increasingly isolated on the international stage.</p>

<p>Following recognition by Spain, Norway and Ireland, the <a class="internal-link" href="/en/which-countries-recognize-palestinian-statehood/a-69168152">number of UN member states that recognize a Palestinian state</a> has increased to 146 out of 193, according to Albares. Three permanent UN Security Council members — France, the UK and the US — do not recognize it, though.</p>

She said the fixes will take “at least over a week” and then the pier will need to be anchored back into the beach in Gaza.</p><p>“From when it was operational, it was working, and we just had sort of an unfortunate confluence of weather storms that made it inoperable for a bit,” Singh said. “Hopefully just a little over a week, we should be back up and running.”</p><p>The pier, used to carry in humanitarian aid arriving by sea, is one of the few ways that free food and other supplies are getting to Palestinians who the U.N. says are <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-famine-world-food-program-israel-hamas-war-476941bf2dc259f85a706408b2a665ff">on the brink of famine</a></span> amid the nearly 8-month-old <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">war between Israel and Hamas</a></span> in Gaza.</p>

The pier and two crossings from Israel in northern Gaza are where most of the incoming humanitarian aid has entered in the past three weeks.</p>




    
<p>The setback is the latest for the $320 million pier, which only began operations in the past two weeks and has already had three U.S. service members injured and had four vessels beached due to heavy seas. Two of the service members received minor injuries but the third is still in critical condition, Singh said.</p><p>Deliveries also were <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/us-pier-gaza-famine-israel-1feae14dac670bb4de0467988799c5c6">halted for two days</a></span> last week after crowds rushed aid trucks coming from the pier and one Palestinian man was shot dead.</p>
    

<p>The pier was fully functional as late as Saturday when heavy seas unmoored four of the Army boats that were being used to ferry pallets of aid from commercial vessels to the pier. The system is anchored into the beach in Gaza and provided a long causeway for trucks to drive that aid onto the shore.</p><p>Two of the vessels got stuck on the coast of Israel. One has already been recovered and the other will be in the next 24 hours with the help of the Israeli military, Singh said. The other two boats were stranded on the beach in Gaza and were expected to be recovered in the next two days, she said.</p><div class="AudioEnhancement" data-separate-event="audioModule" data-separate-value="AP AUDIO: Aid deliveries suspended after rough seas damage US-built temporary pier in Gaza, US officials say" data-module="" data-gtm-region="AP AUDIO: Aid deliveries suspended after rough seas damage US-built temporary pier in Gaza, US officials say" data-align-center="" data-module-number="3" data-main-module-number="3">

A prosecutor in Plymouth District Court on Tuesday said he "briefly stepped out of the vehicle and publicly urinated."</p><p>During an argument with a male employee at the drive-thru window, Ravizza lunged out of his car and stabbed the worker with what appeared to be a long kitchen knife, the prosecutor said. After that, Ravizza was said to have parked his car, walked into the restaurant and stabbed a female employee behind the counter. Both workers are in stable condition after being treated at the hospital.</p><p>"He stabbed me ... and then I run to the safe room," the female employee told WBZ-TV.</p>

            American Tyler Wenrich was sentenced to three weeks in jail and fined Tuesday after he had pleaded guilty earlier this month to possession of ammunition while traveling to Turks and Caicos.

            The Virginia resident was fined $9,000, Kimo Tynes, the director of communications for the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands, said in a news statement.

            The 31-year-old American faced as much as a 12-year prison sentence. But the Hon.

            Trump’s campaign, for instance, sent a fundraising email on Tuesday that claimed FBI agents were “locked and loaded” and that he “nearly escaped death” at Mar-a-Lago.

            While Trump has told his supporters he could have been in danger because of the policy, it is standard protocol for FBI searches and limits how agents may use force in search operations. The same standard FBI policy was used in the searches of President Joe Biden’s homes and offices in a separate classified documents investigation.

            Though many outside legal experts have been critical of Cannon’s approach to the classified documents case in the past, in this instance, Cannon was “right,” said Mark Schnapp, a south Florida defense attorney not involved in the case, who pointed to the court’s local rules for meeting and conferring.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwqpkofs00023b6jnz9mzg0w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Schnapp said it “just looks bad” for the prosecutors to move forward with filing the motion on a Friday night of a holiday weekend when the defense team had offered to discuss the gag order request on Monday.

            “Was it going to be a futile exercise? Yes,” said Schnapp. “But it wasn’t the kind of thing that they should have filed without following the rules.”

<p>Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide also hailed the "milestone" moment as the decision to recognize a Palestinian state came into effect.</p>

<p>The three European countries had planned a simultaneous recognition in the hopes that its symbolism would spur other countries to also commit to recognition, however, on the same day the Danish parliament voted down a proposal for such a move.</p>

<p>"It's the only way of advancing toward what everyone recognizes as the only possible solution to achieve a peaceful future, one of a Palestinian state that lives side by side with the Israeli state in peace and security," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address before the Cabinet meeting.</p>

<p>Israel has repeatedly condemned the move and on Tuesday its foreign minister accused Sanchez of inciting the genocide of Jews.</p>

<p>Israel's operations in Gaza, especially its most recent move into Rafah, have left it increasingly isolated on the international stage.</p>

<p>Following recognition by Spain, Norway and Ireland, the <a class="internal-link" href="/en/which-countries-recognize-palestinian-statehood/a-69168152">number of UN member states that recognize a Palestinian state</a> has increased to 146 out of 193, according to Albares. Three permanent UN Security Council members — France, the UK and the US — do not recognize it, though.</p>
