<ol>
<li>Ohio Senator JD Vance attended Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday to show his support for the former president.</li>
<li>Vance said he was there to be a "friendly face" in the courtroom and to support a friend, despite knowing that Trump is innocent and it's a "depressing way to spend five, six weeks of your life".</li>
<li>Vance denied rumors that he was in talks to be Trump's running mate, saying he has "never spoken" to Trump about the possibility and that it didn't come up when he appeared in court with Senator Tommy Tuberville.</li>
<li>Vance used strong language to describe Michael Cohen, Trump's ex-attorney, saying he was a "serial perjurer".</li>
<li>Vance also criticized the gag order in the trial, describing it as an "insult to Trump and the American people".</li>

Shortly after leaving Baltimore early on March 26, the ship <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/baltimore-bridge-collapse-53169b379820032f832de4016c655d1b">crashed</a></span> into one of the bridge’s supporting columns because another power outage caused it to lose steering and propulsion at the exact worst moment.</p><p>The report provides new details about how the ship’s crew addressed the power issues it experienced while still docked in Baltimore. A full investigation could take a year or more, according to the safety board.</p>
    

<p>Testing of the ship’s fuel did not reveal any concerns related to its quality, according to the report.</p>



<p>The Dali was headed from Baltimore to Sri Lanka, laden with shipping containers and enough supplies for a monthlong voyage.</p><p>After the initial blackout caused by the closed exhaust damper, investigators say a backup generator automatically came on. It continued to run for a short period — until insufficient fuel pressure caused it to kick off again, resulting in a second blackout. That’s when crew members made changes to the ship’s electrical configuration, switching from one transformer and breaker system that had been in use for several months to another that was active upon its departure, according to the report.</p>
    
<p>Investigators stopped short of drawing a direct line between those earlier power issues and the blackout that ultimately caused the bridge collapse.</p>
    

<p>“The NTSB is still investigating the electrical configuration following the first in-port blackout and potential impacts on the events during the accident voyage,” investigators wrote.</p><p>The safety board launched its investigation almost immediately after the collapse, which sent six members of a roadwork crew plunging to their deaths. Investigators boarded the ship to document the scene and collect evidence, including the vessel’s data recorder and information from its engine room, according to board chair Jennifer Homendy. Investigators also interviewed the captain and crew members.</p><p>“Our mission is to determine why something happened, how it happened and to prevent it from recurring,” Homendy said at a news conference days after the disaster. </p><p>The preliminary report details the chaotic moments prior to the bridge collapse while crew members scrambled to address a series of electrical failures that came in quick succession as disaster loomed.</p><p>At 1:25 a.m. on March 26, when the Dali was a little over half a mile away from the bridge, electrical breakers that fed most of the ship’s equipment and lighting unexpectedly tripped, causing a power loss. The main propulsion diesel engine automatically shut down after its cooling pumps lost power, and the ship lost steering. </p>
    

<p>Crew members were able to momentarily restore electricity by manually closing the tripped breakers, the report says. </p><p>Around that time, the ship’s pilots called for tugboats to come help guide the wayward vessel. The tugboats that guided it out of the port had peeled off earlier per normal practice, according to the report. Crew members also started the process of dropping anchor, and the pilots’ dispatcher called the Maryland Transportation Authority Police and relayed that the ship had lost power. The pilots’ dispatcher notified the Coast Guard. </p><p>The ship was less than a quarter of a mile from the bridge when it experienced a second power blackout because of more tripped breakers, according to the report. The crew again restored power, but it was too late to avoid striking the bridge. </p><p>One of the pilots ordered the rudder turned at the last minute, but since the main engine remained shut down, there was no propulsion to assist with steering, the report says. They also made a mayday call that allowed police to stop traffic to the bridge. </p>
    

<p>At 1:29 a.m., the 1.6-mile steel span came crashing down into the Patapsco River. The construction workers were sitting in their vehicles during a break when disaster struck.</p><p>The last of the victims’ bodies was recovered last week. </p><p>One member of the seven-person roadwork crew survived the collapse by somehow freeing himself from his work truck. He was rescued from the water later that morning. A road maintenance inspector also survived by running to safety in the moments before the bridge fell.</p><p>On Monday, crews conducted a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/baltimore-bridge-collapse-controlled-demolition-1575472095b90256ce00bc69a88d5acb">controlled demolition</a></span> to break down the largest remaining span of the collapsed bridge, which landed draped across the Dali’s bow, pinning the grounded ship amid the wreckage. The ship is expected to be refloated and guided back to the Port of Baltimore in the coming days.</p>
    

<p>It arrived in the U.S. from Singapore on March 19, a week before the crash, according to the report. It made stops in Newark, New Jersey, and Norfolk, Virginia, before coming to Baltimore. Investigators said they were not aware of any other power outages occurring in those ports.</p><p>They said they’re working with Hyundai, the manufacturer of the ship’s electrical system, to “identify the cause(s) of the breakers unexpectedly opening while approaching the Key Bridge and the subsequent blackouts.” </p><p>The board’s preliminary report released Tuesday likely includes a fraction of the findings that will be presented in its final report, which is expected to take more than a year. </p><p>The FBI has also <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/baltimore-bridge-collapse-fbi-investiagation-58188d524035c756872603055f309c78">launched a criminal investigation</a></span> into the circumstances leading up to the collapse.</p>

</div>
<p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — Incumbent Rep. Carol Miller has seen plenty of political challengers throughout her long, popular career, but perhaps not one as boisterous as Derrick Evans, her opponent in Tuesday’s Republican primary in West Virginia’s 1st Congressional District.</p>
    
<p>Evans was a participant in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, and his verbal attacks on the three-term congresswoman have grown louder as the election has neared. </p><p>Both are huge backers of former President Donald Trump, but that’s where the similarities may end.</p><p>Miller has kept a low profile compared to some of her more outspoken colleagues since becoming the third woman from West Virginia elected to Congress in 2018. The 73-year-old bison farmer and small business owner also served six terms in the West Virginia House of Delegates. Her father is the late U.S. Rep. Samuel Devine of Ohio. </p>
    

<p>In 2022, Miller received 66% of the vote in a five-candidate GOP primary en route to winning her third term in Congress. This time, Evans is her only opponent.</p><p>The 39-year-old Evans, whose campaign over the past month has pushed out emails almost daily highlighting his love for Trump and his attacks on Miller, was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates two months before the Jan. 6 riot. He calls himself the only elected official who “had the courage” to stand behind efforts to temporarily halt the certification of President Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. He livestreamed himself on Facebook cheering on what he described as a “revolution.” </p><p>Evans was arrested two days after the riot and resigned his seat a month before the 2021 legislative session. He pleaded guilty to a felony civil disorder charge and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-west-virginia-state-riots-9f62fe064158d9641fbe40100bd15300">served three months in prison</a></span>. At his sentencing hearing, Evans apologized for his actions, but he did an about-face upon leaving prison. He began portraying himself as a victim of a politically motivated prosecution. </p>
    

<p>Evans once called himself a Democrat, finishing sixth out of seven candidates in a state House primary in 2016. He then switched to the Libertarian Party in the general election and finished last among five candidates.</p><p>In the campaign against Miller, Evans <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/west-virginia-republican-primary-election-deniers-ad0395542d4d5ef2b8ad5bcdec5d8495">has called her a “commie RINO”</a></span> who “refused to stand and fight with President Trump,” as well as an “undocumented Democrat.” Miller was aligned with Trump in nearly 100% of her House votes while the former president was in office.</p><p>Evans has echoed false claims still made by Trump that the 2020 election was stolen. And in the hours after Evans and other rioters had stormed the Capitol, Miller voted to challenge the Electoral College results in two states Biden won. Miller said in a statement at the time that she had a constitutional duty to “ensure that all Americans have access to free, fair, and accurate elections.”</p>
    

<p>In an email to The Associated Press, Miller did not directly address the 2020 result. But she said she is the only candidate in the race who “has never been a registered Democrat or run for office as a Democrat.”</p><p>Charleston librarian Derek Faux is an independent voter who participated in the Republican primary, picking the candidates he believed were the most distanced from Trump. That included his vote for Miller.</p><p>“It’s a shame that so many of them seem to support Trump,” Faux said. “I just don’t trust him as a politician. And I think people who support him shouldn’t be trusted, either.”</p><p>Jody Roberts, whose husband, Mitch, was a longshot GOP candidate for governor on Tuesday, said she voted for Evans, whom she met along the campaign trail. Asked what made him stand out, Roberts said, “I think he was passionate.”</p>
    

<p>Roberts said Miller didn’t attend any of the campaign stops where she and her husband traveled to, and, “if I wasn’t with Mitch, he’s never mentioned her wherever he’s gone. I just never met her.”</p><p>Roberts said she wasn’t bothered by Evans’ involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection.</p><p>“No. I know that sounds stupid,” she said. ”Do I think they went in and did wrong? Yes. They went too far? Yes. But they have every right to go and protest.”</p><p>Retirees Kathy Showen, of Cross Lanes, and Ron Weddington, of Hurricane, both said they voted for Evans more because they were turned off by Miller.</p><p>Showen said she had forgotten about Evans’ participation in the Jan. 6 riot and said her vote was for the least detrimental option.</p><p>Weddington said “there wasn’t an overall thing that I really liked” about Evans. “Basically, it was, I guess, Carol Miller’s negatives were more monumental than his.”</p><p>Sandi Shrewsbury, a retired nurse and independent voter from Scott Depot, said she couldn’t support either candidate.</p><p>“Evans had a right to protest, but it’s the way he chose to protest,” she said. “Politicians have a level of decorum they need to hold themselves to.”</p><p>The winner of Tuesday’s race moves on to the Nov. 5 general election to face one of two Democrats from Charleston — Vietnam veteran Jim Umberger or educator Chris Reed.</p><p>In the 2nd Congressional District, state Treasurer Riley Moore was among five candidates seeking the GOP nomination for the seat being vacated by Republican Alex Mooney, who is running for U.S. Senate. Democrat Steven Wendelin was running unopposed.</p><p>West Virginia hasn’t elected a Democrat to the House since 2012 and was one of only two states where Trump won every county in 2016 and 2020.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writer Leah Willingham contributed to this report.</p>

                                        <p>KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sought Tuesday to rally the spirits of glum Ukrainians facing a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-kharkiv-donetzk-397dd892f936726bd1acbd45991a18a6">fierce new Russian offensive</a></span>, assuring them during a visit to Kyiv that they are not alone and that billions of dollars in American military aid on its way after months of political delays will make a “real difference” on the battlefield.</p><p>After a day of meetings with senior officials, civil society figures and university students when he exhorted them against being discouraged, Blinken took to the stage at a bar in Ukraine’s capital to play rhythm guitar and sing with a local band on Neil Young’s 1989 hit “Rockin’ in the Free World.”</p><p>The performance, and a series of sunny comments from Blinken about Ukraine’s battlefield prospects, was a startling juxtaposition to what analysts have called one of the most dangerous moments for Ukraine since <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">Russia’s full-scale invasion</a></span> in February 2022. Russian forces have taken swaths of territory along Ukraine’s northeast border, and thousands of civilians in the Kharkiv region have fled the increasingly intense attacks.</p>
    

<p>But Blinken told Ukrainian leaders during his unannounced visit to Kyiv that despite a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-mike-johnson-ukraine-israel-b72aed9b195818735d24363f2bc34ea4">lengthy delay in U.S. military aid</a></span> that left them vulnerable to these renewed Russian military strikes, more weaponry is coming and some has already arrived.</p><p>He made the case even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to him personally for <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-funding-war-russia-patriot-missiles-026fc8f9ee064ffb49bbee2422e2908b">more air defense systems</a></span> to protect civilians under intense Russian fire in the northeast. Blinken, on fourth trip to Kyiv since the war began, also lambasted Russian President Vladimir Putin for underestimating Ukraine’s determination to fight back.</p>




    
<p>“We meet at a critical moment,” he told students at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. “The coming weeks and months will demand a great deal of Ukrainians, who have already sacrificed so much. I’ve come to Ukraine with a message: You are not alone.”</p>
    

<p>He also pushed back on the notion that time is on Putin’s side.</p><p>“Putin has it wrong — time is on Ukraine’s side,” Blinken said. “As the war goes on, Russia is going back in time. Ukraine is moving forward.”</p><p>But the reality on the ground is that Moscow’s troops have captured about 100 to 125 square kilometers (40 to 50 square miles) in recent days in the northeast Kharkiv region, including at least seven villages, according to open-source monitoring analysts. People had already left most of those villages, but the fighting drove out thousands of others.</p><p>Seeking to take advantage of Ukrainian shortages in manpower and weapons while new U.S. assistance is in transit, Russian forces also have been making a concerted push in the east to drive deeper into the partly occupied Donetsk region. The main focus of Russian attacks Tuesday was Pokrovsk, just inside the Ukrainian border in Donetsk, where the Kremlin’s forces launched 24 assaults, the Ukrainian general staff said in a report.</p><p>“We know this is a challenging time,” Blinken told Zelenskyy after arriving on an overnight train from Poland. But, he added that U.S. military aid is “going to make a real difference against the ongoing Russian aggression on the battlefield.”</p>

Since then, the Biden administration has announced $1.4 billion in short-term military assistance and $6 billion in longer-term support.</p><p>Zelenskyy thanked Blinken for the aid but said more is necessary, including two Patriot air defense systems urgently needed to protect Kharkiv.</p><p>“The people are under attack: civilians, warriors, everybody.

In her 15 years, she gave us more light than we could have ever dreamed. While we cope with this unspeakable tragedy, we ask the public to give us our privacy as we mourn."</p><p>Adler was a freshman at <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/family-friends-remember-ella-adler-teen-girl-killed-while-water-skiing-in-key-biscayne/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Ransom Everglades High School</a></span> and a ballerina with the Miami City Ballet.</p><p>Loren Pearson, a close family friend, said his daughter was with Ella when it happened. He said the two girls were best friends and they are devastated.</p><p>"It's a tremendous loss. She had such a bright future. Just very sad. Very sad," he said."It comes in waves. Together with friends. It doesn't make any sense."</p><p>Pearson remembers Ella as a shining light in the community.</p><p>"A great dancer. My daughter's best friend," he said. "Happy, friendly, always a smile. That's how I remember her." </p>

<p> On Monday afternoon, the Miami City Ballet issued the following statement:</p><p> "We at Miami City Ballet and the Miami City Ballet School are utterly devastated by the heartbreaking news of this tragic accident. Ella Adler was not just a beloved student and a magnificent dancer who graced our stage in George Balanchine's The Nutcracker; she was an integral part of our family, radiating potential and promise whose kindness, warmth, and infectious joy were known to all. Our hearts go out to Ella's family, friends, and everyone who had the privilege of knowing and adoring her. As we come together, we will profoundly grieve the loss of Ella, and hold dear the precious memories we were fortunate enough to create with her." </p><p>The FWC said while significant progress has been made, this investigation remains open and the public's assistance is still needed. Anyone who saw the accident or anyone who might have video footage or information about it is urged to call the Wildlife Alert Hotline at 888-404-FWCC (3922) or Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS (8477).</p>

investigating possible technical solutions to inappropriate behaviour by a small minority of people,” the statement said.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">“Dublin city council had hoped to have a solution in place today, but unfortunately the preferred solution, which would have involved blurring, was not satisfactory.”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">The <a href="https://www.portals.org/" data-link-name="in body link">Portals.org</a> team was investigating other options, said the council. “As a result the Portal will be switched off at 10pm tonight and the team at Portals.org have told us they expect it will be switched back on later this week.”</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">The art installation has become a global phenomenon and source of controversy since launching on 8 May. Some people on the Irish side have thrown eggs, flashed body parts and displayed images of swastikas and the twin towers burning on 9/11, prompting the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">New York</a> Post to dub it the “portal to hell”.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">Designed by a Lithuanian artist, Benediktas Gylys, each structure has a screen with a diameter of 2.4 metres (8ft) and weighing 3.5 tonnes. The New York portal is at the junction of Broadway, Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street. Its counterpart in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland" data-link-name="in body link">Ireland</a>’s capital is at the corner of North Earl Street and O’Connell Street in the heart of the city.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">“It is important to note that the overwhelming majority of people interacting with the Dublin Portal have behaved appropriately,” said the council statement.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">That is accurate – most people simply wave and smile at people on the New York side. Some also dance, mime and hold up jokey signs in the sort of fleeting, playful interactions envisaged by authorities when they launched the project as a “bridge to a united planet”.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">However those who have mooned, hurled objects or shown provocative images have become viral sensations. The council did not elaborate on its efforts to blur imagery.</p><p class="dcr-ntq2eh">“Not even a week in and Dubliners have truly embarrassed us around the world,” Amy Donohoe lamented in an <a href="https://www.independent.ie/regionals/dublin/dublin-news/amy-donohoe-dublins-portal-with-new-york-should-be-a-source-of-pride-but-were-making-a-show-of-ourselves/a2027186536.html" data-link-name="in body link">Irish Independent column</a>. “Anyone who goes and stands in front of the portal is representing our little country, but if we’re showing off a drunken culture and being offensive, it could potentially affect tourism in Ireland in the long run. People may not want to come here if this is what they’re seeing.”</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The United Nations has revised its reported death toll in Gaza from the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflict, citing a lower number of deaths among women and children.</li>
<li>The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs previously reported that at least 9,500 women and 14,500 children were among the dead, out of an overall death toll of 34,735. However, the updated numbers indicate a significantly lower number of civilian casualties.</li>
<li>The change in numbers is attributed to the UN's switch to using the Gazan Ministry of Health as its source, rather than the Gaza Government Media Office, which is part of the Hamas-run government in the enclave.</li>
<li>The Gazan Ministry of Health reports that 24,840 individuals have been killed in the conflict, including 9,423 women and 5,799 children. However, the ministry also acknowledges that over 10,000 other deaths are not included in the breakdown due to a lack of identifying information.</li>
<li>Many international officials and experts consider the Gazan Ministry of Health's numbers to be generally reliable, as they are based on verification from morgues and hospitals across the territory. The change in numbers has added fuel to the debate over the credibility of casualty tallies in the conflict.</li>

    <div><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The United Nations has begun citing a much lower death toll for women and children in Gaza, acknowledging that it has incomplete information about many of the people killed during Israel’s military offensive in the territory.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">As recently as May 6, the U.N’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in its regularly updated <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-day-213" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">online report</a> that at least 9,500 women and 14,500 children were among the dead, out of an overall death toll of 34,735.</p><div class="css-1dv1kvn"><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The change in the U.N.’s numbers — and the confusion over the discrepancy — has added fuel to a debate over the credibility of the Gazan authorities’ tallies of fatalities in the war. The deaths of women and children are seen as an important, if incomplete, indication of how many civilians have been killed, a question that lies at the heart of the criticism of Israel’s conduct of the war.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure class="img-sz-large css-hxpw2c e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group"><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption" class="css-1g9ic6e ewdxa0s0"><span class="css-jevhma e13ogyst0">Palestinians recovering the body of a boy from the rubble of a destroyed building following a strike in Nuseirat, central Gaza, on Tuesday.</span><span class="css-1u46b97 e1z0qqy90"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mohammed Saber/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The change came because the United Nations switched to citing a more conservative source for its numbers — the Gazan Ministry of Health — rather than using Gaza’s Government Media Office, as it had in recent weeks. Both offices are part of the Hamas-run government in the enclave.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Many international officials and experts familiar with the way the health ministry verifies deaths in Gaza — drawing from morgues and hospitals across the territory — say its numbers are generally reliable.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The health ministry says its count of women and children killed is based on the total number of people whose identities it can fully verify — 24,840 individuals in all as of May 13.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">More than 10,000 other people have also been killed, the health ministry says, but it does not have their full names, official ID numbers or other information it needs to be certain of their identities. That is why they are not included in the breakdown of women and children killed that is now being cited by the U.N., officials said.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">“There’s about another 10,000-plus bodies who still have to be fully identified,” Farhan Haq, a spokesman for the U.N., said on Monday. He added: “The details of those — which of those are children, which of those are women — that will be reestablished once the full identification process is complete.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Mr. Haq said the United Nations was relying on the data coming out of the health ministry, as it has “in all previous conflicts.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure class="img-sz-large css-hxpw2c e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group"><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption" class="css-1g9ic6e ewdxa0s0"><span class="css-jevhma e13ogyst0">Members of the Abu Namous family searched for the freshly dug graves of their relatives who were killed and buried in the Deir al-Balah cemetery in November.</span><span class="css-1u46b97 e1z0qqy90"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Samar Abu Elouf for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">He added that the U.N. had started using figures from Gaza’s media office because there had been a pause in reporting from the health ministry. But now that the ministry’s casualty reporting was back on line, he said, the U.N. had returned to using its information.</p><h3 class="live-blog-post-content css-lhc8w e1gnsphs0" id="link-26d07f0b"><span>What do Israel and other critics say?</span></h3><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Israeli officials say they are suspicious of the Gazan health ministry’s count. A spokesman for the Israeli military, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, noted that the health ministry does not distinguish in its numbers between combatants and civilians. He also said that Israel sees every civilian death as a tragedy.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">After the United Nations issued a lower documented death toll for women and children, Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, called the new numbers “the miraculous resurrection of the dead in Gaza,” saying the United Nations had relied on “fake data from a terrorist organization.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Elliott Abrams, a veteran American conservative, <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/un-halves-its-estimate-women-and-children-killed-gaza" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in an article</a> for the Council on Foreign Relations on Sunday that it has become “increasingly clear that these numbers represent Hamas propaganda.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">But figures cited by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel are not drastically different from those used by the United Nations. He said last week that Israeli forces had killed about 14,000 Hamas combatants and 16,000 civilians, for a total of around 30,000, without elaborating on the source for those numbers.</p><h3 class="live-blog-post-content css-lhc8w e1gnsphs0" id="link-35a24b2e"><span>Are the new casualty numbers viewed as credible?</span></h3><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">In a sign that the U.S. government views casualty figures supplied by the Gaza health authorities as reliable, President Biden cited their overall death toll in his <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery-2/#:~:text=Israel%20must%20allow%20more%20aid,has%20to%20be%20a%20priority." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">State of the Union</a> speech in March. The United Nations <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-day-220" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publishes the health ministry’s figures</a> on a website and U.N. leaders refer to them frequently.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">A few weeks ago, the health ministry released its latest list detailing the identities of the dead that it had fully documented. It has also released a series of detailed reports explaining how it compiles casualty figures.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure class="img-sz-large css-hxpw2c e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group"><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption" class="css-1g9ic6e ewdxa0s0"><span class="css-jevhma e13ogyst0">Gaza officials have said thousands of people are still missing and presumed dead, believed to be buried under the rubble amid the vast destruction across Gaza.</span><span class="css-1u46b97 e1z0qqy90"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yousef Masoud for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Early in the war, when its figures were called into question, the health ministry released a list of names, ages and identification numbers of the dead. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine analyzed that data, in a report published in <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02713-7/fulltext" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">November in The Lancet</a>, and found “no obvious reason to doubt the validity of the data.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Airwars, a British organization that assesses claims of civilian harm in conflicts, has matched the names of those reported killed with lists of names released by the health ministry. The vast majority of names match up, said Emily Tripp, the group’s director. Airwars also analyzed a ministry of health list of names issued earlier in the conflict and found that the proportion of children, women and men reported by the ministry roughly aligned with its own data collection, she said.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Neta Crawford, a professor of political science at Oxford University and the founder of the Costs of War project, which examines the consequences of the post 9/11 wars, argued that the figures appeared to have been produced to professional standards.</p><h3 class="live-blog-post-content css-lhc8w e1gnsphs0" id="link-694a2941"><span>How are casualty numbers compiled?</span></h3><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">International experts who have worked with health officials in Gaza during this and other wars say that hospitals and morgues in the enclave <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/world/middleeast/gaza-children-israel.html)" title="">gather and report</a> the names, ID numbers and other details of people who have been killed in the territory.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure class="img-sz-large css-hxpw2c e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group"><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption" class="css-1g9ic6e ewdxa0s0"><span class="css-jevhma e13ogyst0">Bodies found in a mass grave at Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza lined up for identification in April.</span><span class="css-1u46b97 e1z0qqy90"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The detailed count excludes thousands of people reported at hospitals as missing but believed to be buried <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/world/middleeast/gaza-death-toll-israel.html" title="">under rubble</a>; they are counted as dead only when their bodies are found.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The Gaza media office has consistently provided an overall death toll similar to the one given by the ministry of health, but different and often higher figures for the number of women and children killed.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Ismail Al Thawabateh, the office’s director general, said in an interview that the health ministry listed and categorized an individual as dead only when all of their details had been documented and verified by a next of kin. He did not explain why his office used a breakdown of women and children based on the overall death toll.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">“The remaining 10,000 are bodies that have entered the hospitals but until this moment, the next of kin have not been reached yet to verify how they were martyred and completing their information,” he said.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">When reached, Ashraf al-Qudra, the Gaza health ministry’s spokesman referred questions to the Ministry of Health’s latest report from May 13.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-1smqmx3 etfikam0">Patrick Kingsley and Ameera Harouda contributed reporting.</p></div></div>

To opt out of mobile ad tracking from Nielsen or other third parties, you can do so by selecting the “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” (for Android devices) options in your device settings. </p>

<p><b> Connected Devices:</b> For connected devices, such as smart TVs or streaming devices, you should review the device’s settings and select the option that allows you to disable automatic content recognition or ad tracking.  Typically, to opt out, such devices require you to select options like “limit ad tracking” or to disable options such as “interest-based advertising,” “interactive TV,” or “smart interactivity”.  These settings vary by device type.  </p>

<p><b> Cross-Device Tracking:</b> If you would like to opt out of our browser-based cross-device tracking for advertising purposes, you may do so by using the various methods described above.  You must opt out separately on each device and each browser that you use.
