            Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz has resigned from Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, delivering a blow to the prime minister who has been celebrating the rare rescue of hostages held in Gaza.

            “Netanyahu prevents us from moving forward to a real victory [in Gaza],” Gantz said in a televised statement Sunday in which he described leaving the government as a “complex and painful” decision.

            Gantz – considered Netanyahu’s main political challenger – said he was quitting eight-months after the October 7 Hamas attacks because “the situation in the country and in the decision-making room has changed.”

            He accused Netanyahu of putting his own personal political considerations ahead of a post-war strategy for the Gaza Strip, claiming that “fateful strategic decisions are met with hesitancy and procrastination due to political considerations,” and urged the prime minister to hold an election in the coming months.
    </p>

            The decision by Gantz fulfils an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-05-18-24/h_323a8f114cf162c9f37ecd2400e7bfe0">ultimatum he gave the prime minister</a> last month calling on him to lay out a new plan for the war against Hamas by June 8.

            Gantz had been expected to resign on Saturday, but postponed the announcement following news that Israeli forces had rescued four hostages in an operation Gazan officials said left more than 270 Palestinians dead.

            His resignation comes despite Netanyahu calling on Gantz to stay in Israel’s emergency government, saying this is the time for unity, not division. Following Gantz’s announcement, Netanyahu urged him to change his mind.

            “Citizens of Israel, we will continue until victory and all the goals of the war have been achieved, most importantly, the release of all our hostages and the elimination of Hamas,” Netanyahu said.

            Netanyahu said his door remained open to any political party that is ready to share in the burden of fighting the war against Hamas, and will “help bring victory over our enemies and ensure the security of our citizens.”

            Gantz’s decision does not put Netanyahu’s government in immediate danger – his party was not part of the prime minister’s coalition, which retains a majority with 64-seats in the 120-member Knesset, Israel’s parliament. It would however leave the war cabinet, set up four days after Hamas’ October 7 attack, without representation from any party other than Netanyahu’s Likud.

            Gantz’ decision comes as Netanyahu faces growing calls from Israel’s Western allies and families of hostages held in Gaza to end the war and bring back the captives.

            Eight months since the war started, Israel is yet to achieve its stated objectives as most of Hamas’ top leadership remains at large and more than 100 hostages are held in the enclave.

            The United States has repeatedly called on the prime minister to present a tangible post-war plan for Gaza. US President Joe Biden, who laid out a three-pronged Israeli peace deal proposal last week, has suggested that Netanyahu is likely benefiting from prolonging the conflict.
    </p>

            Gantz, a 64-year-old former defense minister, said last month that Netanyahu should submit a plan that should include the elimination of Hamas, the return of hostages from Gaza, the establishment of an alternative government in the enclave, the return of displaced Israelis from the north of the country, and a plan to make progress on normalization with Saudi Arabia.

            As the war dragged on, with displaced residents of northern Israel unable to return home and hostages remaining captive in Gaza, Gantz may have realized he would lose popularity by staying in the cabinet, Pinkas said.

            “The longer Gantz remains in the government, the weaker Gantz will get,” Pinkas wrote. “The more identical his positions are to those of the prime minister, the more he’ll lose on both sides. Right-wingers will return home and centrists will seek other options.”

<p>In Germany, Scholz suffered such an ignominious fate that his long-established Social Democratic party fell behind the extreme-right Alternative for Germany, which surged into second place.</p><p>Adding insult to injury, the National Rally’s lead candidate, Jordan Bardella, all of 28 years old, immediately took on a presidential tone with his victory speech in Paris, opening with “My dear compatriots” and adding “the French people have given their verdict, and it’s final.”</p>
    

<p>Macron acknowledged the thud of defeat. “I’ve heard your message, your concerns, and I won’t leave them unanswered,” he said, adding that calling a snap election only underscored his democratic credentials.</p>

<p>The four-day polls in the 27 EU countries were the world’s second-biggest exercise in democracy, behind India’s recent election. At the end, the rise of the far right was even more stunning than many analysts predicted. The French National Rally stood at just over 30% or about twice as much as Macron’s pro-European centrist Renew party that is projected to reach around 15%.</p>

In comparison, the combined result for the three parties in the German governing coalition barely topped 30%. </p>
    

    

<p>Overall across the EU, two mainstream and pro-European groups, the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, remained the dominant forces.

  <p>According to the Hamas-run Gaza's Health Ministry, at least 274 Palestinians were killed and hundreds more were wounded in the raid. The Israeli military said its forces came under heavy fire during the complex daytime operation and that "under 100" Palestinians were killed, though it was not clear how many of them were militants or civilians.</p><h2><strong>A timeline of the raid</strong></h2><p>Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, told reporters on Saturday that the military has been planning the operation for several weeks, building precise models of the apartment buildings to repeatedly train.</p>

<p>The hostages, he said, were being held in two apartments about 200 meters (219 yards) away from each other.  They were targeted simultaneously in broad daylight because there was a "huge risk they'd kill hostages in the other one," Hagari said.</p><p>According to Hagari, the operation in the building where they found Argamani went smoothly, while in the second building with the three male hostages, they were met with crossfire from the guards – including from gunmen firing rocket-propelled grenades from within the neighborhood. He said the military responded with heavy force, including from aircraft, to extract the rescuers and the freed hostages.</p><p>An Israeli police special forces officer was critically injured and later died in this hospital. </p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/09/ed9f61c0-42c6-42e8-b48c-bd5fe51f362d/thumbnail/620x413/61787a59dda27a0d470b40f409e56e33/ap24160524730922.jpg?v=94cbb61397dbf7eca3740fa55510ba88#" alt="Israel Palestinians " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/09/ed9f61c0-42c6-42e8-b48c-bd5fe51f362d/thumbnail/620x413/61787a59dda27a0d470b40f409e56e33/ap24160524730922.jpg?v=94cbb61397dbf7eca3740fa55510ba88 1x, https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/09/ed9f61c0-42c6-42e8-b48c-bd5fe51f362d/thumbnail/1240x826/a391e4513acdd2886abb9400cd226625/ap24160524730922.jpg?v=94cbb61397dbf7eca3740fa55510ba88 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E"></span>

Two U.S. officials told CBS News that the U.S. pier was not used in the IDF operation. It is offshore to assist delivery of humanitarian aid. A U.S. official explained that the helicopter landed south of the facility on a beach but not within the cordoned area of the pier.</p><p>"The pier facility was not used in the operation to rescue hostages today in Gaza. An area south of the facility was used to safely return the hostages to Israel," a U.S. official said. "Any such claim to the contrary is false. The temporary pier on the coast of Gaza was put in place for one purpose only, to help get more urgently needed lifesaving assistance into Gaza."</p><p>Hagari, the IDF spokesperson, also said the rumor that Israeli forces came from the temporary pier was "completely false."</p><p>"We know it's a true ally that assists us against Hamas, against terrorists and it happens around the clock," he said about U.S. support during the operation.</p><h2><strong>Scenes of horror at Gaza hospital</strong></h2><p>In Gaza, medics described to the Associated Press scenes of chaos after Saturday's raid as wounded people overwhelmed hospitals that were already struggling to treat the wounded from days of heavy Israeli strikes in the area.</p><p>"We had the gamut of war wounds, trauma wounds, from amputations to eviscerations to trauma, to TBIs (traumatic brain injuries), fractures, and obviously, big burns," Karin Huster of Doctors Without Borders, an international charity working in Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, told the AP.</p>

<p>Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to be interviewed by New York probation officials Monday, a required step before his July sentencing in his criminal hush money case, according to three people familiar with the plan.</p>


<p>Trump will do the interview via a computer video conference from his residence at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, the people told The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to disclose the plans publicly.</p>


<p>One of Trump’s lawyers, Todd Blanche, will be present for the interview. People convicted of crimes in New York usually meet with probation officials without their lawyers, but the judge in Trump’s case, Juan Merchan, said in a letter Friday that he would allow Blanche’s presence.</p>


<p>The usual purpose of a pre-sentencing probation interview is to prepare a report that will tell the judge more about the defendant, and potentially help determine the proper punishment for the crime.</p>


<p>Such reports are typically prepared by a probation officer, a social worker or a psychologist working for the probation department who interviews the defendant and possibly that person’s family and friends, as well as people affected by the crime.</p>


<p>Presentence reports include a defendant’s personal history, criminal record and recommendations for sentencing. It will also include information about employment and any obligations to help care for a family member. It is also a chance for a defendant to say why they think they deserve a lighter punishment.</p>




<p>A jury convicted Trump of falsifying business records at his own company as part of a broader scheme to buy the silence of people who might have told embarrassing stories about him during the 2016 presidential campaign. One $130,000 payment went to a porn actor, Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had a sexual encounter with Trump, which he denied.</p>


<p>Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, says he is innocent of any crime and that the criminal case was brought to hurt his chances to regain the White House.</p>


<p>Trump’s campaign spokesman, Steven Cheung, said in statement Sunday that President Joe Biden’s Democratic Party allies “continue to ramp up their ongoing Witch-Hunts, further abusing and misusing the power of their offices to interfere in the presidential election.”</p>


<p>“President Trump and his legal team are already taking necessary steps to challenge and defeat the lawless Manhattan DA case,” he said.</p>




<p>Merchan has scheduled Trump’s sentencing for July 11. He has discretion to impose a wide range of punishments, ranging from probation and community service to up to four years in prison.</p>

<ol>
<li>Leonard Peltier, a 79-year-old Native American activist and federal prisoner, is due for a full parole hearing on Monday, his first in 15 years.</li>
<li>Peltier has maintained his innocence in the murders of two FBI agents almost half a century ago, and his supporters fear this may be his last chance to advocate for his release.</li>
<li>Peltier's lawyer, Kevin Sharp, believes that his client's declining health, including diabetes, hypertension, partial blindness from a stroke, and bouts of Covid, should be taken into account in the parole hearing.</li>
<li>The FBI has historically argued against Peltier's release, with an FBI official stating in 2009 that time has not diminished "the brutality of the crimes" and that Peltier has used "lies and half-truths" to sway public opinion.</li>
<li>Despite his poor health and the FBI's opposition, Peltier's supporters, including human rights leaders and Nobel Peace Prize winners like Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama, continue to back his release, citing concerns over the fairness of his trial and the length of his imprisonment.</li>

Both men were killed by bullets fired at close range. According to the officials, Peltier —  a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians and then an activist with the<a href="https://apnews.com/article/protests-and-demonstrations-united-states-government-south-dakota-religion-b3b62b1e89e713160ee0051c8b760459" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Indian Movement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="0"> American Indian Movement</a>, a grassroots Indigenous rights group — was identified as the only person in possession of a weapon on the reservation that could fire the type of bullet that killed the agents.</p><p>But dozens of people had participated in the gunfight; at trial, two co-defendants were acquitted after they claimed self-defense. When Peltier was tried separately in 1977, no witnesses were presented who could identify him as the shooter, and unknown to his defense lawyers at the time, the federal government had withheld a ballistics report indicating the fatal bullets didn’t come from his weapon, according to <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/609/1143/1886896/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:court documents filed by Peltier;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="0">court documents filed by Peltier</a> on appeal.</p><p>But the FBI has maintained his conviction was “rightly and fairly obtained” and “has withstood numerous appeals to multiple courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court.”</p><p>Still, other officials have spoken out in support of him over the years. Retired federal prosecutor James Reynolds, who supervised Peltier’s post-trial sentencing and appeals,<a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/From-US-Attorney-James-Reynolds.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wrote to President Joe Biden;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="0"> wrote to President Joe Biden</a> in 2021 asking him to commute Peltier’s sentence because it would “serve the best interests of justice and the best interests of our country.”</p><p>“He has served more than 46 years on the basis of minimal evidence, a result that I strongly doubt would be upheld in any court today,” Reynolds wrote.</p><p>Peltier, in a<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/leonard-peltier-imprisoned-native-american-activist-new-message-biden-rcna19731" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:phone interview from prison with NBC News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0"> phone interview from prison with NBC News</a> in 2022, said he had hoped mounting pressure from Democratic members of Congress would convince Biden to grant him clemency, and possibly allow him a new trial to prove his innocence.</p><p>“I have a last few years,” Peltier said, “and I got to fight.”</p><h2>Parole process</h2><p>Peltier falls into a small category of mostly elderly federal prisoners who committed their offenses before November 1987 and can petition for parole from the Justice Department’s<a href="https://www.justice.gov/uspc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parole Commission;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="0"> Parole Commission</a>. Congress eliminated federal parole for inmates who committed offenses after that date because of new sentencing guidelines.</p><p>At a hearing, an examiner is in charge of reviewing the inmate’s case and hearing from witnesses. The hearing examiner’s recommendation on whether to grant parole moves to at least one other examiner who does not attend the hearing, and the ultimate decision then falls to a parole commissioner — who is nominated by the president, confirmed by the Senate and may be a former law enforcement official, educator or lawyer.</p><p>If the parole commissioner agrees with the examiners’ recommendation, that becomes the official decision. But if the first parole commissioner disagrees, a second commissioner must concur with either that commissioner or the examiners.</p><p>Such a layered process can appear detrimental to inmates if “the thread is lost,” said Charles Weisselberg, a Berkeley Law professor who has written about the “dysfunction” of the commission.</p><p>In addition, the Parole Commission typically has five members, but it has had only two since about 2018, Weisselberg said.</p><p>The Senate has not moved on filling the commission’s vacant seats. Weisselberg said having fewer commissioners to deliberate gives “greater power” to the hearing examiner, and “as a practical matter, it virtually eliminates the right to a meaningful parole appeal.”</p><p>Weisselberg has suggested the process can be streamlined with a magistrate judge as the arbiter. The Parole Commission did not return a request for comment.</p><p>Peltier’s supporters are hoping for parole but say Biden, who has not commented on the case, can still have him released on compassionate grounds.</p><p>“Mr. Peltier deserves the dignity to live the rest of his life outside the confines of a federal prison cell,” said Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., adding that “it is not too late to grant him the remaining years of a life that the federal government wrongfully stole from him so many years ago.”</p><p>This article was originally published on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/leonard-peltier-native-activist-imprisoned-nearly-50-years-faces-may-l-rcna155618" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBCNews.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="0">NBCNews.com</a></p><p id="view-cmts-cta-eed4ab00-d693-32fd-8487-456995c5a927" class="view-cmts-cta-wrapper"><button class="link caas-button view-cmts-cta" data-ylk="sec:view-cmnts-cta;subsec:openweb;elm:cmmt_open;slk:View Comments;itc:1;g:eed4ab00-d693-32fd-8487-456995c5a927" data-uuid="eed4ab00-d693-32fd-8487-456995c5a927" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="0"><span> View comments </span></button></p></div></div>

<p>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (WFLA) — A hammerhead shark was caught chasing tarpons eerily close to beachgoers in St. Petersburg on Thursday, just a day before <a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-authorities-warn-of-shark-dangers-along-gulf-coast-beaches-after-3-people-are-attacked/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-authorities-warn-of-shark-dangers-along-gulf-coast-beaches-after-3-people-are-attacked/">three people were hurt in two separate shark attacks on Florida’s Gulf Coast</a>.</p>



<p>Drone video, captured by kayak company See Through Canoe on June 6, shows the hammerhead chasing tarpons underneath paddleboarders and close to beachgoers in the water as the fish swam near the shore.</p>





<p>“Hammerhead Shark chasing tarpon by people at the beach in St Petersburg,” the company <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=426159936910150" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=426159936910150">wrote on Facebook</a>. “The shark passed under a couple paddleboarders and some of the tarpon were swimming really close to the shoreline and through people in an effort to avoid the shark. Eventually the shark managed to catch a good sized tarpon.”</p>



<p>The video of the hammerhead shark in St. Pete comes a day before a 45-year-old woman lost part of her arm, and two teens were hurt in two shark attacks about four miles apart in Walton County on Friday. </p>







<p>According to Walton County Fire Rescue, the woman had to have her lower left arm amputated and sustained “significant” trauma to the mid-section and pelvic area. </p>



<p>A short time later, two girls between the ages of 15 and 17 were also injured in an attack, with one sustaining trauma to one upper and lower extremity. She is <a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/woman-teen-injured-by-sharks-at-florida-beaches-miles-apart/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/woman-teen-injured-by-sharks-at-florida-beaches-miles-apart/">reportedly in critical condition</a>. The second teen had flesh wounds to a foot.</p>





<p>“For two of these incidents to happen on the same day is highly unusual,” officials said. </p>



<p>At this time, it’s unclear if the woman and girls were attacked by the same shark. It is also unknown what type of shark they were attacked by. </p>





<p>While no shark attacks have been reported in the Tampa Bay area so far this year, officials are reminding beachgoers to stay vigilant while in the water, as last week’s shark attacks could be attributed to small fish traveling near the shore.</p>



<p>“Please swim carefully today, respect the Gulf, stay hydrated, and look out for your loved ones,” the South Walton Fire District posted on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=839620698200298&amp;set=a.295416235954083" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=839620698200298&amp;set=a.295416235954083">social media following the attacks</a>.</p>

                                        <p>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea on Sunday resumed anti-North Korean propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts in border areas in retaliation for the North sending over 1,000 <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trash-north-korea-south-balloons-tensions-1bcc854e438968a824b4838c519114a0">balloons </a></span> filled with trash and manure over the last couple of weeks. </p><p>The move is certain to anger Pyongyang and could trigger retaliatory military steps as tensions between the war-divided rivals rise while negotiations over the North’s nuclear ambitions remain stalemated.</p><p>Hours after the South resumed loudspeaker broadcasts, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned that the South created a “prelude to a very dangerous situation.” She said South Korea would witness an unspecified “new response” from the North if it continues with the broadcasts and fails to stop civilian activists from flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border.</p>
    

<p>“I sternly warn Seoul to immediately case its dangerous activities that would further provoke a crisis of confrontation,” Kim Yo Jong said in a statement published by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency.</p><p>It came shortly after South Korea’s military said it detected North Korea launching what appeared to be more trash-carrying balloons Sunday night. The military did not immediately confirm the number of suspected balloons or whether any of them had already landed in the South. </p>



<p>South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed that the military conducted a loudspeaker broadcast Sunday afternoon. It didn’t specify the border area where it took place or what was played over the speakers. </p>
    
<p>“Whether our military conducts an additional loudspeaker broadcast is entirely dependent on North Korea’s behavior,” it said. </p><p>The South had withdrawn loudspeakers from border areas in 2018, during a brief period of engagement with the North under Seoul’s previous liberal government. </p><p>At an emergency meeting led by national security director Chang Ho-jin, South Korean officials berated Pyongyang for attempting to cause “anxiety and disruption” by sending the balloons to the South and stressed that North Korea would be “solely responsible” for any future escalation of tensions. </p>
    

<p>The North said its balloon campaign came after South Korean activists sent over balloons filled with anti-North Korean leaflets, as well as USB sticks filled with popular South Korean songs and dramas. Pyongyang is extremely sensitive to such material and fears it could demoralize front-line troops and residents and eventually weaken leader Kim Jong Un’s grip on power, analysts say. </p><p>South Korea has in the past used loudspeakers to blare anti-Pyongyang broadcasts, K-pop songs and international news across the rivals’ heavily armed border. </p><p>In 2015, when South Korea restarted loudspeaker broadcasts for the first time in 11 years, North Korea fired artillery rounds across the border, prompting South Korea to return fire, according to South Korean officials. No casualties were reported.</p><p>Last week, as tensions spiked over the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-south-korea-balloon-trash-tensions-906eb673ded22501dc262c68f7a19e13">trash-carrying balloons</a></span>, South Korea also <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-south-korea-balloons-military-agreement-e98754a2d25b38cc501eefb46015cb98">suspended</a></span> a 2018 agreement to reduce hostile acts along the border, allowing it to resume propaganda campaigns and possibly restart live-fire military exercises in border areas.</p>
    

<p>South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik in a meeting with top military commanders called for thorough preparation against the possibility that the North responds to the loudspeaker broadcasts with direct military action, his ministry said in a statement. </p><p>North Korea continued to fly hundreds of balloons into South Korea over the weekend, a third such campaign since late May. </p><p>The South’s military said the balloons that did land dropped trash, including plastic and paper waste, but no hazardous substances were discovered.</p><p>In her statement, Kim Yo Jong claimed the North used about 1,400 balloons to drop 7.5 tons of trash from Saturday night to Sunday morning. She also complained that anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets flown from South Korean activists had been discovered in border areas in recent days.</p><p>She said the North had initially planned to halt its balloon launches on Sunday but decided to send more because the South restarted loudspeaker broadcasts. </p>
    

<p>The South’s military, which has mobilized chemical rapid response and explosive clearance units to retrieve the North Korean balloons and materials, alerted the public to beware of falling objects and not to touch balloons found on the ground but report them to police or military authorities.</p><p>In North Korea’s previous two rounds of balloon activities, South Korean authorities discovered about <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-trash-balloons-leaflets-tensions-7a9b372462a8390f279e5288923a8da3">1,000 balloons</a></span> that were tied to vinyl bags containing manure, cigarette butts, scraps of cloth, waste batteries and waste paper. Some were popped and scattered on roads, residential areas and schools. No highly dangerous materials were found and no major damage has been reported. </p>
    

<p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-balloons-trash-south-f66d6cdb14b1aff0e9d90e39641cfffb">A South Korean civilian group</a></span> led by North Korean defector Park Sang-hak said it launched 10 balloons on Thursday carrying 200,000 anti-North Korean leaflets, USB sticks with K-pop songs and K-dramas, and $1 bills. South Korean media reported another activist group also flew balloons with 200,000 propaganda leaflets toward North Korea on Friday. </p><p>Kim Jong Un in recent years has waged an intensifying campaign to eliminate South Korean cultural and language influences. In January, Kim declared the North would abandon its longstanding goal of a peaceful unification with the South and rewrite its constitution to cement the South as a permanent enemy. Experts say Kim’s efforts to reinforce the North’s separate identity may be aimed at strengthening the Kim family’s dynastic rule.</p>
