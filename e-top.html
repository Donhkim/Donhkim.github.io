            “It’s time for this war to end,” he said, a clear indication that – as far as he is concerned – Israel’s war goals have been met.

            But the Israeli government’s two most prominent far-right members, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, made it explicitly clear they reject an immediate ceasefire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also signaled he is not ready either, casting doubt over Biden’s proposal.

            In a statement on social media, Smotrich said he had “made it clear” to Netanyahu that he would not “be part of a government that will agree to the proposed outline and end the war without destroying Hamas and returning all the hostages.”

            National Security Minister Ben Gvir meanwhile described the deal as “reckless” and “a victory for terrorism,” as well as a security danger to Israel.

            “If the prime minister implements the reckless deal under the conditions published today, which mean the end of the war and the giving up on the elimination of Hamas, Otzma Yehudit will dissolve the government,” he said, referring to the far-right party he leads and which helps prop up Netanyahu’s majority in parliament.

            The proposal would first see hostages freed and Israel withdrawing from “all populated areas of Gaza,” and eventually culminate in a reconstruction plan for Gaza, which has been left in ruins from the fighting.

            The plan has been widely welcomed, with the UN and other international powers urging Israel and Hamas to accept it.

            On Sunday, the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant warned Israel will “not accept” any deal to end the war which would allow Hamas to rule over Gaza.

            However, Hamas has made it clear it will not accept any other group governing Gaza. On May 16, the group’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh noted that, in regards to “the day after the war,” there had been “calls to remove Hamas.”

He is charged with two counts related to false statements in purchasing the firearm and a third count of illegally obtaining a firearm while addicted to drugs.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">But Hunter Biden's legal team believes it can throw a wrench in Weiss' tidy narrative. At a recent pretrial hearing, an attorney for Biden suggested the firearm form at the heart of the case was "much more complicated than [the] special counsel indicates it is."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Jury selection for the trial is set to begin on Monday. And if 12 Delaware residents accept the government's story, the president's only living son could face a prison sentence.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The task of fighting that outcome falls to Abbe Lowell, a veteran defense attorney who has represented several other high-profile figures, including Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">How Lowell plans to fight the charges remains somewhat unclear. He has signaled to U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika that the contours of his case would depend in large part on how prosecutors proceed at trial.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">But in court records and at pretrial hearings, he has offered some tea leaves -- and suggested he will attempt to cast doubt on some of the government's most crucial evidence and witnesses.</p><h3 class="vPZug oPAle xcLAU bunQU uhXXI PjNjV lNbol LBPRq">'Tampered' or 'annotated'?</h3><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Lowell has, for example, latched onto revelations in court that two copies exist of the federal gun form at the heart of the case, called an ATF Form 4473. A shop employee created the original document when Hunter Biden purchased the firearm in 2018. It lists Biden's passport as the ID he presented to the shop employee.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Years later, however, a copy was made. The copy included a handwritten note, "DE Vehicle Registration," on a line left blank for "Supplemental Government Issued Documentation." Store employees did so in 2021 to rectify a requirement that gun buyers present a form of ID that includes an address, which passports do not.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Lowell contends that gun store employees "tampered with" the document, and that it raises questions about "who wrote what on the form, and when."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Weiss' office has said the gun shop employees merely "annotated" the document. But they took Lowell's argument seriously enough to re-interview the gun store owner, Ronald Palimere, on May 16.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">During the interview, according to notes filed on the case docket, Palimere said Hunter Biden's legal tribulations were becoming "a big scandal and there was intense attention on the incident," and that employees at the store "were all scared to death."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Palimere "felt it was necessary to annotate the Form 4473 because he felt they were going to get in trouble just for going up against Biden," according to the notes.</p><div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "><div><div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"><figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"><figcaption><div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"><div class="HXPPJ barbu IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "><span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"><span><span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ ">Hunter Biden departs the House Rayburn Office Building following a surprise a...</span><span class="Truncate__ShowMore--hidden" aria-hidden="true">Show more ---</span></span><button aria-hidden="false" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Show more" class="rmXUm rGbDS UbGlr fKEHm NQBmG kGyAC LDLer mrzbZ RzTJw hGXEb YKYa-d lqtkC HkWF HfYhe UoVV WtEci dSKvB seFhp NqeUA UzzHi YusgD gYkWv jIRH mLASH FSaCd VTMUD VTlC KgrzM nMMea bNYiy qEZfD hukhf GZviH aMUVL VwboG LpXnG eFRhh fzuTW hUXYk TsdbM TkDoS NJHde eWOet BZZZx " data-testid="truncate-button" type="button">Show more<svg aria-hidden="true" class="HUcap MYLGy QGyss lZur llpL stwOr " data-testid="prism-iconography" role="presentation" viewbox="0 0 32 32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" data-icon="caret-downSmall"><path fill="currentColor" d="M16 24L4 12.187l2.827-2.853L16 18.374l9.173-9.04L28 12.187 16 24z"></path></svg></button></span></div><p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh "><span class="YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh  gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ ">Kevin Lamarque/Reuters, FILE</span></p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">If jurors are persuaded by Lowell's tack, the argument could undermine the credibility of some key government witnesses -- the people who sold Biden the gun -- and potentially create a reasonable doubt that Hunter Biden was the one who actually checked that box.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">At least two gun store employees, including Palimere, are expected to testify at the trial.</p><h3 class="vPZug oPAle xcLAU bunQU uhXXI PjNjV lNbol LBPRq">The definition of 'is'</h3><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Lowell may also advance the argument that Hunter Biden may have been confused by the language on the ATF Form 4473. The box he checked "no" asked of the buyer, "Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to" various narcotics.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"The issue here is Mr. Biden's understanding of the question, which asks in the present tense if he 'is' a user or addict," Lowell wrote in court papers.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"The terms 'user' or 'addict' are not defined on the form and were not explained to him," he continued. "Someone like Mr. Biden, who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Finally, Lowell has raised "an issue of chain of custody" with a leather pouch that allegedly held the revolver Hunter Biden purchased. In court documents filed earlier this year, prosecutors said this pouch had cocaine residue on it.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">After purchasing the firearm in 2018, Hunter Biden possessed it for less than two weeks before his then-romantic partner, Hallie Biden – who is also the widow of his brother, Beau – discovered the weapon and the pouch, discarded them in a dumpster.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The gun was soon recovered by the authorities, but the pouch was not tested for drug residue until five years later, in 2023. Lowell said at the pretrial hearing that he wants to question witnesses about what happened to the pouch during those five years when it was in police custody to see if it was "tampered with."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">One of the witnesses Lowell plans to call for the defense is a chemical residue expert.</p><h3 class="vPZug oPAle xcLAU bunQU uhXXI PjNjV lNbol LBPRq">The government's case</h3><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Prosecutors hope these arguments fall flat, and that jurors rely on the voluminous evidence they plan to present to find Hunter Biden guilty of committing the three felony charges he faces.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Prosecutors seem poised to use Hunter Biden's own words against him -- excerpts from his 2021 memoir, "Beautiful Things," and text messages he exchanged around the time of the gun purchase -- to demonstrate that he was in fact a drug user when he filled out the ATF Form 4473 and procured the weapon.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In one text message prosecutors included in court filings, Hunter Biden wrote two days after allegedly purchasing the gun: "I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney," referring to an intersection in Wilmington.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Weiss' office also plans to show jurors the original ATF Form 4473, in which Biden represented that "he was not an unlawful user of, or addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance" -- despite allegedly knowing it not to be true.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Prosecutors indicated that they plan to call as many as <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/special-counsel-hunter-biden-case-plans-call-wife/story?id=110420238" target="_blank">12 witnesses</a>, including Hallie Biden and Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Lowell has not yet decided whether Hunter Biden will testify in his own defense.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The trial begins on Monday and is expected to last two to three weeks. If he's found guilty, Biden could face a prison sentence of up to 25 years, though legal experts suggest that, as a first-time and nonviolent offender, he would not likely serve time.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Weiss' office also charged Hunter Biden in December with nine felony and misdemeanor charges stemming from his failure to pay $1.4 million in taxes for three years during a time when he was in the throes of addiction. The back taxes and penalties were eventually paid in full by a third party, identified by ABC News as Hunter Biden's attorney and confidant, Kevin Morris. Hunter Biden has <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/hunter-biden-returning-court-arraignment-federal-gun-charges/story?id=103667562" target="_blank">pleaded not guilty</a> to all charges.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN">The trial in that case was scheduled to begin on June 20 in California, but Lowell successfully petitioned the judge to postpone it until Sept. 5 -- raising the likelihood that a jury could be deliberating whether to convict the president’s son on several felony counts in the waning weeks of the 2024 election.</p></div></div>

He has repeatedly called the trial rigged and politically motivated. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In an interview with Fox News over the weekend, Mr Trump vowed that success at the upcoming November US election would be his "revenge". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He is slated to be sentenced on 11 July, and plans to appeal the convictions. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Speaking to Fox on Sunday, Mr Trump said his New York legal battle has been particularly difficult on his wife. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The trial included lurid details of the alleged meeting between Mr Trump and Ms Daniels. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The details included Mr Trump greeting her in silk pyjamas at his hotel suite, and Ms Daniels' claims that he did not wear protection when they allegedly had sex. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In her testimony, Ms Daniels also claimed that Mr Trump and his wife sleep in different beds. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"She's fine, but I think it's very hard for her," Mr Trump said of his wife, adding that "in many ways, it's tougher on them [his family] than it is me". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Under New York law, each of the 34 felony counts Mr Trump was convicted of could result in up to four years in prison - though this is not considered a likely outcome. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In his interview on Fox, Mr Trump acknowledged the possibility of being imprisoned, saying that he is "okay with it" but that he is "not sure the public would stand for it". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"I think it would be tough for the public to take," he said. "You know, at a certain point there's a breaking point." </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In another interview published over the weekend, the woman at the heart of the New York case - former adult film actress Stormy Daniels - said she was "shocked" at how quickly the jury reached a verdict. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In her first public remarks since the convictions, Ms Daniels told UK newspaper The Mirror that she believes Mr Trump "should be sentenced to jail and some community service working for the less fortunate".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Or being the volunteer punching bag at a woman's shelter," she added. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Even after the conviction, Ms Daniels said that the case is "not over" for her. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"It's never going to be over for me," she said. "Trump may be guilty, but I still have to live with the legacy." </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Trump is still facing dozens of other charges in three other criminal cases, including a Georgia case in which he is accused of conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat by President Joe Biden in the state during the 2020 election. That case is currently tied up in appeals. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In Florida - where he faces a federal case over his alleged mishandling of classified documents - a judge has indefinitely postponed the trial, saying setting a date before resolving questions about evidence would be “imprudent”.</p></div></div>

<p>A witness at the scene, one of the few willing to talk in the aftermath of the shooting, told News 5 there were hundreds of people at the party enjoying themselves before shots were fired.</p><p>"Everyone was wearing white T-shirts; there were women on top of vehicles dancing. It looked like a scene from a spring break movie. It looked like everyone was having a good time. On our way back it was a completely different scene," the witness said.</p><p>Dispatchers received multiple 911 calls about numerous people being shot in the area, police said. Soon after, shooting victims started arriving at nearby hospitals.</p><p>Victims ranged in age from 19 to 43, police said.</p><p>According to the Cleveland Clinic, the hospital admitted nine patients early Sunday morning. One of those patients is in critical condition. The hospital was under a hard lockdown from just after midnight until around 3:30 a.m.</p><p>Cleveland Clinic said Sunday evening, one patient has been admitted to a regular floor following surgery, another person is out of surgery and remains in the intensive care unit in critical condition, and three were treated in the emergency room with non-life-threatening injuries and have since been released.</p><p>Summa Health said its hospital received 15 patients this morning, 13 of whom had non-life-threatening injuries. Some of those individuals have already been released from the hospital. One person remains in critical condition.</p><p><i>News 5 Reporter Elizabeth VanMetre was at the hospital Sunday morning with an update.</i></p><p class="InstagramEmbed">

    <h2>Victims' families react</h2>

<p>Security was tight at Akron General and Summa Health as they were flooded with patients.</p><p>“My heart dropped straight to my stomach,” Latika, the sister of one of the victims, said.</p><p>Latika’s sister was shot in the leg during the party.</p><p>“It’s just really devastating to hear because this is not something that she would really be into,” Latika said.</p><p>Latika and her mother were not able to get into the hospital to see her sister because of the lockdown.</p><p>“She’s just in a lot of pain; she couldn’t believe what happened,” Latika said.</p><p>She was briefly able to speak with her sister about the party before the shooting.</p><p>“She said they were just having a lot of fun. She’s not really sure why it happened,” Latika said.</p><p>Latika’s sister is expected to make a full recovery. A majority of families were able to come to the hospital and pick up their loved ones.</p>
    <h2><b>Condolences pour in</b></h2>

<p><b>Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb</b></p><p><b>"</b>My heart is with Akron today. I’m incredibly frustrated to see another community in pain—especially one so close to home. No one deserves this violence or to live in fear. I am confident that every resource is being deployed to bring those responsible to justice. This is yet another reminder that we must never give up the fight to get guns off our streets and out of the hands of harmful actors. But, I hope we can move past the reminders and onto action to finally put a stop to the senseless violence plaguing our communities. I am grateful to the first responders who acted without hesitation last night in Akron. My prayers are with every family member and community member affected."</p><p><b>The Cleveland Cavaliers</b></p><p>"We are horrified and devastated to learn of the tragic mass shooting that occurred in Akron, Ohio, in the early hours of this morning. Our hearts, love and support are with the individuals impacted by this horrific event. We also send our thoughts and prayers to their families, friends and the entire Akron community. These senseless acts of gun violence have no place in our community here in Northeast Ohio."</p><p><b>U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH)</b></p><p>"My thoughts are with the victims and those affected by the horrific shooting in Akron. My office has been in contact with local officials and we are continuing to monitor the situation. Grateful for the first responders who arrived on the scene quickly."</p><p><b>U.S. Senator J.D. Vance (R-OH)</b></p><p><b>"</b>Terrible situation in Akron last night. Our team is monitoring the situation and our hearts go out to everyone affected by this terrible shooting. We’re praying for everyone involved and that the death toll doesn’t rise."</p><p><b>U.S. Rep. Emilia Sykes (OH-13)</b></p><p>"I’m devastated to see this senseless act of violence in our Akron community. My heart and prayers are with the victims, their families, and our entire community who are attempting to make sense of a senseless act of violence. I’m grateful for the law enforcement officers who responded quickly to the scene, and I encourage anyone who may have any information to contact the authorities. Our community must work together to keep our neighborhoods safe from gun violence. My office will continue to monitor this situation as we learn more about this tragedy and will assist as needed."</p><p><b>U.S. Rep Shontel Brown (OH-11)</b></p><p>“On this Sunday, my prayers are with those injured, their families, and everyone harmed and hurt by this horrendous event in Akron. Thank you to all the first responders and medical professionals for your work last night.“The pain of gun violence continues to be felt across Northeast Ohio and it’s sickening to see another mass shooting so close to home. People can’t live like this, fearful they won’t be safe at a block party, church, school or work. While we await more details on this shooting, it is abundantly clear we have a national problem – and have had one for decades.“We need comprehensive gun safety legislation to strengthen background checks, close loopholes that keep allowing dangerous individuals to purchase guns, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and more. We’ve got to make sure the new Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which I voted for, is fully implemented, so we can crack down on gun trafficking, and we’ve got to provide more resources to local communities wracked by gun violence.“We can solve this problem and we owe it to our constituents to listen to the bipartisan majority that wants legislative action.”</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>ANC loses majority</strong>: The African National Congress (ANC) party, led by President Cyril Ramaphosa, has lost its majority in the South African parliament for the first time since apartheid ended 30 years ago. The party won 159 seats, down from 230 in the previous assembly.</li>
<li><strong>Coalition talks needed</strong>: With the ANC unable to form a government on its own, President Ramaphosa has called for coalition talks with other parties to form the next government. The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) has indicated it is open to talks, but only if key priorities are respected.</li>
<li><strong>ANC's electoral performance</strong>: The ANC won 40% of the vote, down from 58% in the previous election, making it the largest party in parliament but still short of a majority. Analysts had feared worse, with a worst-case scenario of 45%.</li>
<li><strong>New government formation</strong>: The parties have two weeks to negotiate a coalition deal, after which the new parliament will meet to choose a new president. President Ramaphosa has called on party leaders to find common ground and respect the will of the people.</li>
<li><strong>Implications for governance</strong>: The coalition-building process is likely to lead to a more fragmented government, which could make it challenging for President Ramaphosa to govern effectively. The opposition DA has signaled it is willing to work with the ANC, but only on specific issues, making it unclear what the ultimate outcome will be.</li>

class="dcr-iy9ec7">Zelenskiy said he was “disappointed” some world leaders had not yet confirmed attendance.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Russia was seeking to undermine the summit by warning countries not to attend and threatening a blockade of agricultural goods and food products, he said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">He later told media that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">China</a> had supported such efforts to deter leaders from participating. “Regrettably, Russia, using Chinese influence on the region, using Chinese diplomats also, does everything to disrupt the peace summit. It is unfortunate that such a big, independent, powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of Putin,” he said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Since a phone call between Zelenskiy and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, one year ago, Ukraine had sought meetings with Chinese officials at all levels, he said, but this had not been granted. He had not met Chinese officials despite their presence in Singapore.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Earlier on Sunday, the Chinese defence minister, Dong Jun, told attendees of the Shangri-La Dialogue his country had “been promoting peace talks with a responsible attitude”. “We have never provided weapons to either party of the conflict. We have put stricter control on the export of dual use items and have never done anything to fan the flames. We stand firmly on the side of peace and dialogue,” Dong said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">But Zelenskiy said: “With China’s support to Russia, the war will last longer and that is bad for the whole world. You cannot say that we accept sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and at the same time be on the side of the country that violates the principles of the UN charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Zelenskiy said on X he had met the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue on Sunday morning. “We discussed the key issues: the defence needs of our country, bolstering Ukraine’s air defence system, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/19/us-indicates-will-not-block-european-countries-export-f-16-jets-ukraine" data-link-name="in body link">F-16 coalition</a>, and drafting of a bilateral security agreement,” he said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">He said he was grateful to Joe Biden for his decision to allow Ukraine to use US-supplied weapons <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/31/moscow-decries-us-move-to-allow-its-weapons-to-be-used-on-targets-in-russia" data-link-name="in body link">against targets in Russia</a>. However, in comments to media he said that this was not enough as Ukraine still did not have the systems or permissions to target airfields from which Russia was “permanently firing”.</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li><strong>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</strong>, Iran's former President from 2005 to 2013, has signed up to run in the upcoming elections in Iran.</li>
<li>Ahmadinejad's motive for running is reportedly due to a "call from people from across the country", and he expressed confidence in his ability to resolve Iran's domestic and international issues.</li>
<li><strong>Ali Larijani</strong>, a moderate, and <strong>Saeed Jalili</strong>, an ultraconservative, are also among the candidates who have signed up to run in the elections.</li>
<li>The Guardian Council, a constitutional body, will vet all candidates and determine who is qualified to run in the elections.</li>
<li>Ahmadinejad was previously barred from running in the 2017 election, and his signing up for the election comes after the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.</li>

<p>The politician, who had been largely sidelined following his controversial terms in office, said he’s only heeding “a call from people from across the country” to run again, and he’s confident he can resolve Iran’s domestic and international issues.</p>
<p>“Don’t ask political questions,” he said with a grin when asked by reporters about his reaction if he were to be disqualified from running by the Guardian Council – the constitutional body that vets all candidates.</p>
<p>Despite Supreme Leader <a href="/news/2024/4/21/supreme-leader-khamenei-says-iran-demonstrated-its-power-against-israel">Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a> urging him to stay away in 2017, he signed up and was barred from running, but chose to not register for the 2021 election.</p>

<p>Ahmadinejad’s presidency was marked by economic malaise defined by massive inflation and currency devaluation, along with explosive tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme – which saw multilateral sanctions imposed on the country.</p>
<p>His 2009 re-election sparked <a href="/opinions/2013/6/12/what-happened-to-the-green-movement-in-iran">the Green Movement</a> of protests across the country amid claims of vote tampering, which were refuted by authorities as they mounted a crackdown.</p>
<h2 id="who-else-wants-to-be-in-the-race">Who else wants to be in the race?</h2>
<p>The dozens who signed up to run for president also include senior security official and former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, former three-time parliament speaker Ali Larijani, Tehran’s Mayor Alireza Zakani, and former central bank chief Abdolnasser Hemmati.</p>
<p>Jalili is now the Iranian supreme leader’s representative to the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) and used to be security chief from 2007 to 2013 at the height of the tensions surrounding the nuclear file. He has run for president unsuccessfully three times before.</p>
<p>Larijani, a conservative figure belonging to a powerful family, is perhaps the only relatively moderate candidate with any chance of garnering a considerable number of votes – that is if he is greenlit by the Guardian Council after being disqualified in 2021.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>Despite the disqualification last time, Larijani was the first major figure to announce his candidacy, signing up in Tehran on Friday with his campaign releasing a dramatic video containing cinematic shots of him in the process.</p>
<p>After the latest presidential and parliamentary elections produced the lowest turnouts in the near 45-year history of the Republic of Iran, turnout is expected to prove a challenging issue during this vote as well.</p>
<p>The research centre of the Iranian parliament announced on Sunday that 53.4 percent of people – responding to a survey it conducted – said they would vote in the June 28 presidential election, with 28.9 percent still on the fence.</p>
<p>This is just above the 48 percent that saw Raisi become president, and much higher than the 42 percent turnout announced <a href="/news/2024/3/2/conservatives-dominate-irans-parliament-assembly-elections">for the parliamentary election</a> in March.</p>
<p>The Guardian Council is scheduled to begin vetting the candidates from Tuesday for six days, after which the list of approved candidates will be announced on June 11.</p>
