    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>French President Emmanuel Macron refused to accept the resignation of the Prime Minister</strong>: Despite the chaotic election results, Macron asked the Prime Minister to remain temporarily as head of the government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The election result has left the government in limbo</strong>: The vote split the legislature on the left, center, and far right, with no faction having a majority to form a government, raising the risk of paralysis for the European Union's second-largest economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The election outcome was unexpected</strong>: Macron had hoped that calling an early election would bring "moment of clarification", but instead, the result showed the opposite. The outcome is a surprise less than three weeks before the start of the Paris Olympics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The French stock market reacted positively</strong>: Despite expectations of a worst-case scenario, the market fell upon opening but quickly recovered, possibly due to the fear of an outright victory for the far right or the leftist coalition not materializing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The uncertainty surrounding the government could have implications for the country's future</strong>: The crisis has raised questions about France's ability to govern effectively in the near future, with the country under an international spotlight during the Paris Olympics.</p>
</li>

Macron, who named him just seven months ago, immediately asked him to stay on “to ensure the stability of the country.” Macron’s top political allies joined the meeting with Attal at the presidential palace, which ended after about 90 minutes. </p>

<p>On Sunday, Attal made clear that he disagreed with Macron’s decision to call the surprise election. The results of two rounds of voting left no obvious path to form a government for the leftist coalition that came in first, Macron’s centrist alliance or the far right.</p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024 The year will test even the most robust democracies.

<p>Newly elected and returning lawmakers on Monday gathered at the National Assembly to begin negotiations over a new government in earnest. Macron himself will leave midweek for a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nato-summit-trump-biden-europe-ukraine-e45273ef1bd408d72245f8f7fd1ec5c0">NATO summit in Washington</a></span>. </p>
    
<p>Talks over who should form a new government and who should lead the foreign, interior and finance ministries among others, are expected to be extremely difficult and lengthy given that political parties negotiating a deal have diametrically opposing policies and contempt for one another. </p>
    

<p>“We are in a situation that is totally unprecedented,” said Jean-Didier Berger, a newly elected lawmaker from the conservative Republicans party. </p><p>Aurélien Rousseau, a newly elected lawmaker from the New Popular Front and former minister in Macron’s government acknowledged disagreements within the leftist alliance over the government formation, but said the alliance could eventually reach an agreement. </p><p>“We need to build compromises, but we need to take time to discuss, to know what we agree on or disagree within the left,” Rousseau said. </p><p>Another New Popular Front lawmaker, Jérôme Guedj of the French Socialists party, said the leftist alliance won’t buckle under pressure to name its candidate for the next prime minister who could govern alongside Macron. </p><p>“This is a confusing moment (and) we’re not going to add anxiety, unnecessary division at a moment when we need to find the right path,” Guedj said. </p><p>Political deadlock could have far-ranging implications for <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine</a></span>, global diplomacy and Europe’s economic stability. Still, at least one leader said the result was a relief.</p>
    

<p>“In Paris enthusiasm, in Moscow disappointment, in Kyiv relief. Enough to be happy in Warsaw,” Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a former European Council president, posted on X late Sunday.</p><p>According to official results released early Monday, all three main blocs fell far short of the 289 seats needed to control the 577-seat National Assembly, the most powerful of France’s two legislative chambers. </p><p>The results showed just over 180 seats for the New Popular Front leftist coalition, which placed first, to beat Macron’s centrist alliance, with more than 160 seats. The far-right National Rally part of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/france-elections-le-pen-antisemitism-macron-5c4c8fa261b0fa2f2e35c14c072a60b4">Marine Le Pen</a></span> and its allies were restricted to third place, although their more than 140 seats were still way ahead of the party’s previous best showing of 89 seats in 2022.</p><p>Macron has three years remaining on his presidential term.</p><p>Rather than rallying behind Macron as he’d hoped, millions took the vote as an opportunity to vent anger about inflation, crime, immigration and other grievances, including his style of government.</p>
    

<p>The New Popular Front’s leaders immediately pushed Macron to give them the first chance to form a government and propose a prime minister. The faction pledges to roll back many of Macron’s headline reforms, embark on a costly program of public spending, and take a tougher line against <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-evacuation-safe-zone-43536b7dfe84aa3c39668c30032bdfcb">Israel because of the war with Hamas</a></span>. But it’s not clear, even among the left, who could lead the government without alienating crucial allies.</p><p>“We need someone who offers consensus,” said Olivier Faure, head of the Socialist Party, which joined the leftist coalition and was still sorting out how many seats it won on Monday. </p><p>Macron warns that the left’s economic program of many tens of billions of euros in public spending, partly financed by taxes on wealth and hikes for high earners, could be ruinous for France, already criticized by EU watchdogs for its debt.</p>
    

<p>A hung parliament is unknown territory for modern France, and many people reacted with a mix of relief and apprehension. </p><p>“What pollsters and the press were telling us made me very nervous so it’s a huge relief. Big expectations as well,” said Nadine Dupuis, a 60-year-old legal secretary in Paris. “What’s going to happen? How are they going to govern this country?” </p><p>The political agreement between the left and center to block the National Rally was largely successful. Many voters decided that keeping the far right from power was more important than anything else, backing its opponents in the runoff, even if they weren’t from the political camp they usually support.</p><p>“Disappointed, disappointed,” said far-right supporter Luc Doumont, 66. “Well, happy to see our progression, because for the past few years we’ve been doing better.”</p><p>Le Pen, who was expected to make a fourth run for the French presidency in 2027, said the elections laid the groundwork for “the victory of tomorrow.”</p><p>Racism and antisemitism marred the electoral campaign, along with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/france-election-disinformation-russia-olympics-be18d688677240686df200096018f221">Russian disinformation campaigns</a></span>, and more than 50 candidates reported being physically attacked — highly unusual for France.</p><p>Unlike other countries in Europe that are more accustomed to coalition governments, France doesn’t have a tradition of lawmakers from rival political camps coming together to form a majority.

            The death toll includes 27 people killed, including three children, in the capital, the Kyiv city military administration said Monday.

            The facility is Ukraine’s largest children’s medical center and has been vital in the care of some of the sickest children from across the country.

            <a href="http://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/joe-biden-news">President Joe Biden</a> told congressional Democrats in a letter on Monday that he will continue his reelection bid despite mounting concerns about his mental fitness and the viability of his campaign, while also hitting back at party “elites” in an interview ahead of a critical week on Capitol Hill.
    </p>

            “I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,” Biden wrote in the letter, obtained by CNN.

            Biden sought to put growing concerns about his viability to rest in the forcefully worded letter.
    </p>

            “The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it’s time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump. We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us,” Biden concluded. “It is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.”

            It’s a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/biden-fate-political-career/index.html">critical week for Biden’s political future</a> as he seeks to tamp down intensifying fallout with the House and Senate back in session for the first time since the debate. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/07/politics/house-democrats-biden-out/index.html">More than a handful of top House Democrats</a> told Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday that Biden needs to step aside amid concerns about down-ballot Democratic races.

            Shortly after the letter was released, Biden called into MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” part of a strategy to do more “off-the-cuff,” unscripted engagements to quell concerns about his age.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyd1yvl3000k3b6klhrac51e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">

            Biden offered a lengthy and occasionally off-topic response to a question about his letter to Hill Democrats calling for unity and lambasted Trump for being on the golf course after the debate. Trump has largely stayed under the radar while Biden battles the news cycle.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyd1zquk000q3b6krunsu8de@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “Well look — Democrats — Joe, let me say it this way, the reason I’ve been on the road so much, all over the country, while Trump is riding around in a golf cart, filling out his golf cart before, golf cart before he even hits the ball — but anyway, he hasn’t been anywhere in 10 days, I’ve been all over the country, No. 1,” he said.
    </p>

            He continued: “And I’ve gone over the country for several reasons, one, to make sure my instinct was right about the party still wanting me to be the nominee. And all the data, all the data shows that the average Democrat out there who voted, 14 million of them who’ve voted for me, still want me to be the nominee, No. 1.”
    </p>

            And in a pointed rebuke to his critics, Biden said, “I’m getting so frustrated by the elites. Now, I’m not talking about you guys, but by the elites in the party. They know so much more. But if any of these guys don’t think I should run, run against me. Go ahead. Announce — announce for president. Challenge me at the convention.”

            The president will continue his outreach to Democratic lawmakers this week, a campaign official tells CNN. Tuesday will be a consequential day as members are set hold a planned caucus meeting with Jeffries, and one member told CNN they anticipate that is the day when the dam will break. Two sources told CNN that the meeting, the first time Democrats are gathering as a caucus since the June 27 debate, will be limited to members only and phones are not expected to be permitted inside.

            In the week following his disastrous debate performance, Biden personally reached out to roughly 20 House Democrats, a campaign official tells CNN, and has spoken with party leaders — including Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Reps.

    </p>

            During the question-and-answer portion of the call, Biden fielded a question from a donor about what he needs to do in the second debate — currently scheduled for September 10 — to perform better than the first debate, where 51 million Americans watched his meandering and low-energy performance.

            Biden, dressed in a suit and flanked by an American flag and family photographs, outlined the strategy simply, two participants said: “Attack, attack, attack.”

            DNC Finance Chair Chris Korge, who was among the final speakers on the call, was “begging us to stay in line,” one of the participants said.

            Biden struck a defiant note on a call with donors, emphasizing that the party needs to shift the narrative back to Trump and the important issues at stake in November. There was a fair amount of discussion, according to one donor on the call, on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/trump-distance-project-2025/index.html">“Project 2025.”</a>

            Biden made clear how damaging Trump’s agenda would be across the board, including for the economy, women and the LGBTQ community, one donor said.

            Biden also smiled on screen when one donor said she would crawl through glass for him.

            Another participant on the call, who has been critical of Biden and his campaign over the past week, praised the president’s words on Monday and said the campaign seemed to “finally” grasp the seriousness of the moment.
    </p>

            The ultimate test, this donor said, would be whether congressional leaders urge Biden to reconsider this week and whether the battleground map showed any signs of expanding or if the president’s support eroded in campaign polling this week following the long July 4 holiday weekend.
    </p>

            “It’s still a huge hole to climb out of,” the Democratic donor said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the campaign. “It was already a steep hill to climb to victory.”

"The Democratic Caucus in Congress is a very diverse group, and there are many opinions about what should next happen.

Trump is a lying, convicted felon who has only ever been out for himself, and the American people know that. As I shared earlier, Republicans are the biggest threat to the health of our democracy, our economy, and the people, and the President knows what's at stake.

"As Pennsylvania's only independent Black-owned talk radio station, WURD Radio has cultivated that trust with our audience over our 20-year history. This is something we take very seriously.

<li>The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) has warned of the potential disintegration of the 15-member bloc and increased insecurity after Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger formalized their breakaway union.</li>
<li>The military leaders of the three countries announced on Saturday that they were "irrevocably" leaving Ecowas to form a confederation of their own states, which Ecowas has deemed a major blow to the 50-year-old bloc.</li>
<li>Ecowas had previously imposed sanctions and threatened to use military force to push back against the juntas' moves, but has now appointed Senegalese President Bassirou Diomaye Faye as a mediator to try to resolve the crisis.</li>
<li>The leader of Ecowas, Omar Alieu Touray, has expressed concern that the breakaway could disrupt the freedom of movement of people across the region and undermine efforts to combat regional insecurity, especially in intelligence sharing.</li>
<li>The three military-led countries have also turned away from French and Western powers, expelling French soldiers and seeking military assistance from Russia instead, which could further complicate Ecowas' efforts to resolve the crisis.</li>
