                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Jury deliberations began Wednesday in Donald Trump’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-opening-stormy-daniels-6beee9b99114898ee0dd60185d43bac5">hush money trial</a></span>, placing the outcome of the history-making case in the hands of a dozen New Yorkers who have vowed to be fair and impartial in the face of their unprecedented task.</p><p>Just hours after embarking on their closed-door discussions, the jury returned with separate notes asking to rehear testimony about the alleged hush money scheme at the heart of the case and to rehear legal instructions from the judge that are meant to guide them in their deliberations.</p><p>The notes were the sole communication with the court since the jury of seven men and five women was sent to a private room just before 11:30 a.m. to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-trial-jury-deliberations-38642e8b525477b49c6cc1320f10f25b">begin weighing a verdict</a></span> in the historic case. Though the deliberations are secret, notes are used to send questions or messages about the case and to notify the court of a verdict, or if they are unable to reach one.</p>
    

<p>“It is not my responsibility to judge the evidence here. It is yours,” Judge Juan M. Merchan told jurors earlier in the day before dispatching them to begin deliberations. He also reminded them of their vow during the selection process to judge the case fairly and impartially.</p><p>Trump struck a pessimistic tone after leaving the courtroom following an hourlong reading of jury instructions, repeating his assertions of a “very unfair trial” and saying: “Mother Teresa could not beat those charges, but we’ll see. We’ll see how we do.”</p>
    
<p>Trump and his lawyers, along with prosecutors, were instructed to remain inside the courthouse during deliberations. While waiting behind closed doors there, he continued making a series of posts on his social media network complaining about the trial and quoting legal and political commentators who view the case in his favor.</p><p>In one post, written in all-capital letters, he said: “I don’t even know what the charges are in this rigged case — I am entitled to specificity just like anyone else.” He added, “There is no crime!”</p>
    

<p>Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records at his company in connection with an alleged scheme to hide potentially embarrassing stories about him during his 2016 Republican presidential election campaign.</p><p>The charge, a felony, arises from reimbursements paid to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-cohen-hush-money-stormy-daniels-735aadfd1ce015e05ba955c203a96f1b">then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen</a></span> after he made a $130,000 hush money payment to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-gag-order-d853768fff5fafbdee55623579889140">porn actor Stormy Daniels</a></span> to silence her claims that she and Trump had sex in 2006. Trump is accused of misrepresenting Cohen’s reimbursements as legal expenses to hide that they were tied to a hush money payment.</p><p>Trump has pleaded not guilty and contends the Cohen payments were for legitimate legal services. He has also denied the alleged extramarital sexual encounter with Daniels.</p><p>To convict Trump, the jury would have to find unanimously that he created a fraudulent entry in his company’s records, or caused someone else to do so, and that he did so with the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/175.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intent of committing or concealing another crime.</a></span></p><p>The crime prosecutors say Trump committed or hid is a violation of a New York election law making it illegal for two or more conspirators “to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.”</p>
    

<p>While the jury must unanimously agree that something unlawful was done to promote Trump’s election campaign, they don’t have to be unanimous on what that unlawful thing was.</p><p>The jurors — a diverse cross-section of Manhattan residents and professional backgrounds — often appeared riveted by testimony in the trial, including from Cohen and Daniels. Many took notes and watched intently as witnesses answered questions from Manhattan prosecutors and Trump’s lawyers.</p><p>Jurors started deliberating after a marathon day of closing arguments in which a prosecutor spoke for more than five hours, underscoring the burden the district attorney’s office faces in needing to establish Trump’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p><p>A defense lawyer spoke for about half that time; the Trump team need not establish his innocence to avoid a conviction but must instead bank on at least one juror finding that prosecutors have not sufficiently proved their case.</p>
    

<p>Earlier Wednesday, the jury received instructions in the law from Merchan, who offered some guidance on factors the panel can use to assess witness testimony, including its plausibility, its consistency with other testimony, the witness’ manner on the stand and whether the person has a motive to lie.</p><p>But, the judge said, “there is no particular formula for evaluating the truthfulness and accuracy of another person’s statement.”</p><p>The principles he outlined are standard but perhaps all the more relevant after Trump’s defense leaned heavily on questioning the credibility of key prosecution witnesses, including Cohen.</p><p>Jurors asked to rehear testimony from Cohen and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker about an August 2015 meeting with Trump at Trump Tower where the tabloid boss agreed to be the “eyes and ears” of his fledgling presidential campaign. </p>
    

<p>Pecker testified the plan included identifying potentially damaging stories about Trump so they could be squashed before being published. That, prosecutors say, was the beginning of the catch-and-kill scheme at the heart of the case.</p><p>Jurors also want to hear Pecker’s account of a phone call he said he received from Trump while he was an investor meeting in New Jersey. The publisher testified that Trump tracked him down and phoned him at the investor’s offices after hearing a rumor that another outlet had offered to buy former Playboy model Karen McDougal’s alleging that she had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Pecker testified that on the call, Trump told him, “Karen is a nice girl” and asked, “What do you think I should do?” Pecker said he replied: “I think you should buy the story and take it off the market.” He added that Trump told him he doesn’t buy stories because it always gets out and that Cohen would be in touch.</p><p>The publisher said he came away from the conversation thinking Trump was aware of the specifics of McDougal’s claims. Pecker said he believed the story was true and would have been embarrassing to Trump and his campaign if it were made public. The National Enquirer’s parent company, American Media Inc., eventually paid McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story in an agreement that also included writing and other opportunities with its fitness and other publications.</p><p>The fourth item jurors requested is Pecker’s testimony about his decision in October 2016 to back out of an agreement to then sell the rights to McDougal’s story to Trump through a company Cohen had established for the transaction, known as an “assignment of rights.”</p><p>“I called Michael Cohen, and I said to him that the agreement, the assignment deal is off. I am not going forward. It is a bad idea, and I want you to rip up the agreement,” Pecker testified. “He was very, very, angry. Very upset. Screaming, basically, at me.”</p><p>Pecker testified that he reiterated to Cohen that he wasn’t going forward with the agreement and told him to, “Rip it up.”</p><p>“And he said, excuse me, Michael Cohen said, The Boss is going to be very angry at you,” Pecker testified.</p><p>Any verdict must be unanimous. During deliberations, six alternate jurors who also sat through every minute of the trial will be kept at the courthouse in a separate room in case they are needed to replace a juror who falls ill or is otherwise unavailable. If that happens, deliberations will start anew once the replacement juror is in place.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow the AP’s coverage of former President Donald Trump at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump</a></span>. </p>

In addition, he says, neither he nor his wife knew of the meanings that are now being ascribed to the flags.</p><p>"A reasonable person who is not motivated by political or ideological considerations or a desire to affect the outcome of Supreme Court cases would conclude that this event does not meet the applicable standard for recusal," Alito wrote in the letters to Democrats. "I am therefore duty-bound to reject your recusal request."</p>    
  <p>Democrats had seized on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/us/justice-alito-flag-appeal-to-heaven.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">New York Times reports</a> that an upside-down American flag had flown outside the Alitos' Virginia home and a separate "Appeal to Heaven" flag had flown outside his vacation home. They argued the two incidents create an appearance of impropriety that require Alito recuse himself from any matters related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot or the 2020 election.</p><p>But going back to 2021, Alito has consistently said he had nothing to do with the flying of any flag, which he has said was solely an interest of his wife's. He emphasized that point in both of his letters.</p>

    </p>
<p>On the upside-down American flag that flew briefly outside his Virginia home in 2021, he said in the letters that he had asked her to take it down, and she eventually agreed to do so.</p><p>"My wife's reasons for flying the flag are not relevant for present purposes," he wrote, "but I know she was greatly distressed at the time due, in large part, to a very nasty neighborhood dispute in which I had no involvement."</p><p>Alito wrote that a house on the street displayed a sign attacking his wife personally, and a man living there at the time followed her down the street and "berated her in my presence using foul language, including what I regard as the vilest epithet that can be addressed to a woman."</p><p>"My wife is a private citizen, and she possesses the same First Amendment rights as every other American," Alito continued. "She makes her own decisions, and I have always respected her right to do so."  </p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'>
    </p>
<p>That is consistent with the Alitos' position dating back to 2021, when they were confronted as they were leaving their home by a Washington Post reporter who had been tipped off by a neighbor three years ago about the upside-down flag.</p><p>When the reporter asked about the flag, the Post said Martha-Ann Alito yelled, "it's an international signal of distress!"</p><p>The Post detailed the incident <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/25/alito-flag-martha-ann-washington-post/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">in a piece Saturday</a>, explaining why it decided not to publish the story in 2021.</p><p>"The justice denied the flag was hung upside down as a political protest, saying it stemmed from a neighborhood dispute and indicated that his wife had raised it," the Post said.</p><p>The Post then proceeded to describe the reporter's 2021 encounter with the Alitos outside their home, saying Martha-Ann Alito told the reporter, in apparent reference to the neighbors, "Ask them what they did!'"</p><p>The Post reporter then observed Martha-Ann Alito get out of the car "and then brought out from their residence a novelty flag, the type that would typically decorate a garden. She hoisted it up the flagpole. 'There! Is that better?' she yelled."</p><p>That reporting in 2021 is consistent with Tuesday's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/us/justice-alito-neighbors-stop-steal-flag.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">most recent New York Times story</a> detailing the neighborhood dispute. The Post said it did not publish the story because it was an ongoing neighborhood dispute with Matha-Ann Alito that did not implicate the justice.</p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'>
    </p>
<p>"My wife and I own our Virginia home jointly. She therefore has the legal right to use the property as she sees fit, and there were no additional steps that I could have taken to have the flag taken down more promptly," Alito wrote in the letters.</p><p>On the "Appeal to Heaven" flag, Alito says it also was flown by Martha-Ann Alito. He said he had nothing to do with it, and neither of them saw other meanings in the flags.</p><p>He also said she did not fly it to associate herself with "Stop the Steal" or any other group.</p><p>"As I said in reference to the other flag event, my wife is an independently minded private citizen," Alito wrote. "She makes her own decisions, and I honor her right to do so. Our vacation home was purchased with money she inherited from her parents and is titled in her name. It is a place, away from Washington, where she should be able to relax."</p><p>The justice told House and Senate Democrats that his wife was responsible for the flagpoles put up at their Virginia home and New Jersey vacation house, and said she has displayed a variety of flags in the past, including patriotic flags, college flags, those supporting sports teams, flags from places they've visited, and religious flags. </p><p>"My wife is fond of flying flags," Alito wrote. "I am not."</p><p>He said that Martha-Ann Alito may have mentioned that the "Appeal to Heaven" flag dates back to the American Revolution, but he assumed it was being displayed to express a "religious and patriotic message."</p>

    </p>
<p>"She did not fly it to associate herself with that or any other group, and the use of an old historic flag by a new group does not necessarily drain that flag of all other meanings," Alito wrote.</p><p>One of the letters was addressed to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin and subcommittee head Sheldon Whitehouse, who <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-democrats-seek-meeting-chief-justice-john-roberts-alito-flag/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">requested a meeting</a></span> with Chief Justice John Roberts and urged him to take steps to ensure Alito recused himself from cases pending before the Supreme Court involving Trump's claim of presidential immunity and the Jan. 6 attack. </p><p>The second letter was sent to a group of House Democrats who called for Alito to step aside in the cases.</p><p>Last year, in response to a similar request to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-john-roberts-senate-judiciary-durbin-ethics-reform/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">chief justice said</a></span> because of separation of powers concerns, it would be inappropriate for him to appear to discuss ethics or other matters that may go before the court.</p><p>A meeting with members of only one party to discuss issues that may relate to pending cases before the court would be unprecedented for a chief justice.</p><p><em>Melissa Quinn contributed to this report</em></p>

a buffer zone, only about 100m (330ft) deep in parts, which runs along the Gaza side of the 13km (8-mile) border with Egypt.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Inside Gaza, the IDF is now in control of 75% of the Philadelphi Corridor and I believe it will be in control of it all with time,” he said.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The plan, he added, was to work with the Egyptians to “ensure weapon smuggling is prevented”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Egypt has denied weapons are still being smuggled under the border. But the IDF said on Tuesday that it was demolishing tunnels that led to the Sinai peninsula.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Residents have said that troops have seized about 9km of the Philadelphi Corridor, including the Rafah border crossing, since the start of the ground operation in Rafah on 6 May.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The troops have also gradually pushed into built-up neighbourhoods of Rafah city from the east and south, and reportedly reached the central al-Awda roundabout on Tuesday.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On Wednesday, residents told Reuters news agency that tanks advanced into western Tal al-Sultan and central Yibna and Shaboura areas before pulling back towards positions on the border.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The IDF also announced that three Israeli soldiers were killed in combat in Rafah on Tuesday.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Sam Rose of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), who is in western Rafah, told the BBC that “most people are now packing up and leaving”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“I was on the road this morning and so were many, many others. It seems that even though the operation, the Israeli troops, haven't reached this far west of Rafah yet, people have taken the signs... that it's time for them to leave,” he said.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“A lot of anxiety, a lot of fear in the air.

Hundreds more were treated for severe burns, fractures and shrapnel wounds.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">IDF spokesman Rear Adm Hagari said on Tuesday that aircraft had targeted two senior Hamas officials inside a structure that was away from any tents, using “two munitions with small warheads”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“Our munitions alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,” he said, adding that the military was looking into the possibility that weapons stored by Hamas nearby could have caused a secondary explosion.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Blinken said he was unable to verify US media reports that <a target="_blank" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/28/middleeast/gaza-us-munitions-rafah-strike-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">US-made GBU-39 guided bombs were used in the strike</a>, which he described as "horrific".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On Tuesday, Palestinians accused Israel of shelling tents at al-Mawasi, where it had advised civilians in Rafah to go for safety.

We are human beings of flesh and blood... Eighteen innocent people lost their lives in seconds.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Last week, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israel to “immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part”.</p></div></article></div>

<p><span>Stony Brook University — the number-one public university in New York and a state flagship university — has announced that <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/pres/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">president Maurie McInnis</a> is stepping down after a four-year tenure to become the next president of Yale University. </span></p>
<p><span>McInnis, a Yale graduate (MA ’90, MPhil ’93, PhD ’96) and member of its Board of Trustees, will assume her new position effective July 1. The State University of New York (SUNY) will oversee the leadership transition.</span></p>
<p><span>President since March 2020, McInnis led Stony Brook through the COVID-19 pandemic and helped shepherd its continued rise into a world-class research institution and modern flagship of the SUNY system. Under McInnis’s leadership, Stony Brook was named the anchor institution of The New York Climate Exchange research center on Governors Island; awarded one of the largest gifts to a university in American history with a $500 million unrestricted endowment from the Simons Foundation; and achieved its highest ever rankings among U.S. News and World Reports Best Colleges listing.</span></p>
<p><span>In her role, McInnis worked at the center of a broad leadership coalition committed to growing academic excellence at Stony Brook, providing opportunity to students of all backgrounds, and supporting New York’s economy. This includes SUNY and its Board of Trustees, the Stony Brook Foundation and Stony Brook Council, the university’s longstanding partners at the Simons Foundation, and its more than 2,900 world-class faculty and staff members, from the Office of the Provost to Campus Operations and Maintenance.</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>“We congratulate Maurie on this prestigious appointment, merely the latest in her series of extraordinary professional accomplishments,” said </span>SUNY Chancellor John B. King Jr<span>. “Maurie’s election is a testament to both her exceptional ability and the esteem with which Stony Brook is viewed by its peers. I know that we will have superbly talented candidates to choose from as we begin this search for Maurie’s successor to lead one of the nation’s most prestigious public universities and a true engine of research innovation and social mobility.” </span><span><br>
</span></p>
<p>Rich Gelfond, chairman of the Stony Brook Foundation and CEO of IMAX Corporation<span>, praised McInnis’s leadership. “In her four-year tenure, Maurie’s decisive, collaborative leadership brought a number of key strategic initiatives to the finish line — culminating in the most transformational period in Stony Brook’s history. We are grateful for her stewardship and look forward to continuing the incredible progress of this one-of-a-kind institution.”</span></p>
<p>Kevin Law, chairman of the Stony Brook Council<span>, the group that oversees and supervises the operations and affairs of the institution, praised McInnis for her leadership through challenging times. “Maurie arrived during the Covid pandemic and more recently has successfully steered the university through a year that has been especially difficult for many university presidents,” Law said. “She led Stony Brook to new heights,</span><span> bringing immense positive change and improvement to the university.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I have been so proud to lead Stony Brook during this exciting time in its history,” McInnis said</span><span>. “When I talk with other leaders in higher education, it is clear that they recognize Stony Brook is an institution on an upward trajectory, combining groundbreaking research with expanded opportunities for students from all backgrounds. I want to express my appreciation to all the faculty, students, and staff who are achieving great accomplishments. I am confident that Stony Brook’s best years lie ahead.”</span></p>
<p>An interim president will be named shortly to ensure a seamless leadership transition consistent with SUNY processes and protocols. A national search for Stony Brook’s next president will begin immediately.</p>

<p>Russian missiles and bombs have pummeled Ukrainian military positions and civilian areas, including the power grid. Ukraine is facing its hardest test of the war, and untying its hands on long-range weapons could spur a fightback and upset the Kremlin.</p>



<p>Macron said that France’s position is that “we think we must allow (Ukraine) to neutralize the (Russian) military sites from which the missiles are fired.”</p><p>“If we tell (the Ukrainians) you do not have the right to reach the point from which the missiles are fired, we are in fact telling them that we are delivering weapons to you, but you cannot defend yourself,” Macron said late Tuesday on an official visit to Germany.</p>
    
<p>His remarks came a day after NATO Secretary-General <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/jens-stoltenberg">Jens Stoltenberg</a></span> urged the alliance’s members to lift some of the restrictions on Ukraine’s use of Western weapons.</p><p>“The right to self-defense includes hitting legitimate targets outside Ukraine,” Stoltenberg said at a NATO meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria on Monday.</p>
    

<p>Already, at the start of May, Moscow interpreted as a threat U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron’s comment that Ukraine could use British long-range weapons, such as the Storm Shadow cruise missile, to hit back at Russia.</p><p>That, and Macron’s comments that he doesn’t exclude sending troops to Ukraine, prompted Russia to announce it would hold <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-drills-ukraine-war-62ad37602b0cf2901bf82a75e593294d">drills involving tactical nuclear weapons</a></span>. Russia also warned the U.K. government that its decision could bring retaliatory strikes on British military facilities and equipment on Ukrainian soil or elsewhere.</p><p>The leaders are choosing their words carefully. Macron underlined that only Russian bases used to launch missiles against Ukraine should be regarded as legitimate targets — not other Russian bases or civilian infrastructure.</p><p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking alongside Macron, was as usual more guarded and noncommittal, noting that Ukraine “is allowed to defend itself” under international law.</p><p>Scholz’s spokesperson, Steffen Hebestreit, clarified Wednesday that the chancellor meant that Ukraine’s defense “isn’t limited to its territory.” He declined to say what agreements with Ukraine on weapons supplied by Germany stipulate, insisting they are confidential.</p>
    

<p>Scholz has insisted on avoiding steps that could end up drawing NATO into a battlefield confrontation with Russia. Other Western leaders have expressed similar fears of a creeping, high-stakes escalation.</p><p>His concerns are shared in Washington. Over the past two years, the U.S. has gradually ceded to Ukrainian requests for support, sending tanks and long-range missile systems that it initially hesitated to provide, but with a caveat on aiming at Russian soil.</p><p>Speaking Wednesday on a visit to Moldova, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken underlined that while Washington hasn’t given the green light to Kyiv for using American weapons in cross-border strikes it will continue providing Ukraine with means to effectively defend itself.</p><p>“We haven’t encouraged or enabled strikes outside of Ukraine,” Blinken said at a news conference with Moldovan President Maia Sandu. “Ukraine, as I’ve said before, has to make its own decisions about the best way to effectively defend itself. We’re going to make sure that it has the equipment it needs to do that.”</p>
    

<p>Blinken noted that Ukraine’s Western allies have adapted to the changing combat situation to offer more effective support. “We’re always learning and we’re always making determinations about what’s necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself,” he said.</p><p>Western leaders are keen to put pressure on Putin, whose forces have recently been pushing hard against Ukrainian defenses in eastern and northeastern Ukraine.</p><p>This week has brought a cascade of new European aid, with Belgium and Spain each pledging around 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in new military support to Ukraine. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-hungary-ae48c473927d54f5053f3cc276f5493e">Sweden announced</a></span> Wednesday it will donate aid worth 13 billion kronor ($1.23 billion) — the largest package Sweden has donated so far. It will include air defense systems, artillery ammunition and armored vehicles.</p>
    

<p>Ukraine has recently been under intense pressure from Russian attacks in the northeastern Kharkiv region and in the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region.</p><p>Putin has said he wants to establish a “buffer zone” in Kharkiv to halt cross-border Ukrainian assaults. Analysts say the Kharkiv push also draws depleted Ukrainian forces away from Donetsk.</p><p>The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said late Tuesday that Russia’s Kharkiv push has slowed in recent days and the Kremlin’s forces are probing the front line in Donetsk for weaknesses.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></span></p>

American’s TRASM guidance for Q2 is now expected to be down approximately 5% to 6%, compared to its prior forecast of down 1% to 2%.

The Chicago-based airline projected EPS in a range of $3.75 to $4.25, signaling it sees a strong summer travel season ahead.</p><p>“Demand is holding, but there is more price sensitivity,” Syth said with regard to the overall travel sector, but noted that during peak periods like Memorial Day and Labor Day price sensitivity isn’t an issue.</p><p>While travelers are seeking out better deals, they are still flying, and American Airlines' inability to capture more leisure and business travel is a concern for investors. Syth noted that American’s excess capacity during off-peak “shoulder” travel season was another issue, but the airline said it was addressing overcapacity during its Q1 earnings call last month.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">An American Airlines jetliner rumbles down a runway at Denver International Airport, Jan. 16, 2024, in Denver.
