<ol>
<li><strong>Multiple attacks</strong>: Gunmen targeted police officers, churches, and synagogues in Dagestan, Russia, on the Orthodox festival of Pentecost, leaving many people dead, including at least seven police officers, a priest, and a security guard.</li>
<li>** Targets included two churches and two synagogues**: The attacks took place in the cities of Derbent and Makhachkala, with a church priest killed in Makhachkala, and a synagogue and a church set on fire in Derbent.</li>
<li><strong>Islamist involvement suspected</strong>: While the attackers have not been identified, Dagestan has a history of Islamist attacks, and the incident is believed to be linked to the North Caucasus region's Islamist insurgency.</li>
<li><strong>Police hunt for suspects</strong>: Six of the attackers are dead, and police are searching for others involved in the attacks. Magomed Omarov, the head of the Sergokalinsky district, was detained after reports that two of his sons were among the attackers.</li>
<li><strong>Russia's history of Islamist attacks</strong>: Dagestan has been the scene of numerous Islamist attacks in the past, including those carried out by the Caucasus Emirate and Islamic Emirate of the Caucasus. Despite Russia's claims of interfaith harmony and unity, there have been several incidents of Islamist violence in the country, including a thwarted plot to attack a Moscow synagogue.</li>

<li>A Maryland couple, Alhaji Alieu Dausy and Haja Isatu Wurie, died during the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia due to extreme heat, with temperatures reaching over 110 degrees.</li>
<li>The couple, who were active members of their community, died of heat stroke, according to their daughter Saida Wurie, who suspects that the severe heat was the likely cause of their death.</li>
<li>The Hajj pilgrimage, which requires Muslims to make the trip to Mecca at least once in their lifetime, was particularly challenging this year due to the Saudi summer heat, with tens of thousands of pilgrims attempting to perform the hajj through irregular channels due to the high cost of official permits.</li>
<li>The couple's deaths bring the total number of deaths during the Hajj pilgrimage to over 1,300, with many more pilgrims requiring treatment for heat-related illnesses.</li>
<li>The Hajj pilgrimage is required for all Muslims who are physically and financially able to make the trip, and is a major event in the Islamic calendar, with the rituals commemorating the accounts of Prophet Ibrahim and his son Prophet Ismail, Ismail's mother Hajar and Prophet Muhammad.</li>

    <div><section class="content__body"><p>BALTIMORE - A Maryland couple was among the more than 1,300 people who died during extreme heat at the Hajj pilgrimage in the Middle East.</p><p>U.S. Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks confirmed in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that Alhaji Alieu Dausy and Haja Isatu Wurie died during a trip to Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Alsobrooks said the couple were both actively involved in their community. The woman was a volunteer for Alsobrooks campaign, a spokesperson confirmed.</p><p>"Alhaji Alieu Dausy and Haja Isatu Wurie passed away during a pilgrimage to Mecca due to the severe heat," Alsobrooks said in a statement. "Haja Isatu Wurie was an incredibly active member of our community. She was involved in several community organizations, making transformational impacts that were felt both locally and globally.  Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with their families during this difficult time. Their loss is profound, and they will be deeply missed."</p><p>The couple from Bowie is believed to have died of heat stroke in 110+ degree temperatures in the sacred city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>"All we know is that it was natural causes and someone from the U.S. Embassy advised the natural causes could have been due to heat stroke, which based on the temperature, people were saying it was 110 degrees," their daughter <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/22/middleeast/american-deaths-hajj-heat-intl-latam/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Saida Wurie told CNN</a>. "There are millions of people and they have to walk long hours. It was more than likely it was heat stroke for both of my parents."  </p><p>All Muslims are required to make the Hajj once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. Many wealthy Muslims make the pilgrimage more than once. According to the Quran, Islam's holy book, the rituals largely commemorate the accounts of Prophet Ibrahim and his son Prophet Ismail, Ismail's mother Hajar and Prophet Muhammad.</p><p>According to CBS News, the Hajj, whose timing is determined by the lunar Islamic calendar, fell again this year during the oven-like Saudi summer.</p><p>Every year, tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly official permits,<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hajj-2024-deaths-saudi-arabia-extreme-heat/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""> CBS News says</a></span>. </p>

<p>This group was more vulnerable to the heat because, without official permits, they could not access air-conditioned spaces provided by Saudi authorities for the 1.8 million authorized pilgrims to cool down after hours of walking and praying outside.</p><p>Saida Wurie said her parents saved up their life savings for this excursion.</p><p>"They saved their life savings, I think it was about $11,500 per person, that they saved their entire lives to embark on this journey," she said. "They didn't receive the proper preparation and proper documents. It was just a nightmare experience of a trip."</p>

                                        <p>JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a></span> said Sunday that the current phase of fighting against <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/hamas">Hamas</a></span> in Gaza is winding down, setting the stage for Israel to send more troops to its northern border to confront the Lebanese militant group <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/hezbollah">Hezbollah</a></span>.</p><p>The comments threatened to further heighten the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah at a time when they appear to be moving closer to war. Netanyahu also signaled that there is no end in sight for the grinding war in Gaza.</p><p>The Israeli leader said in a lengthy TV interview that while the army is close to completing its current ground offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, that would not mean the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">war against Hamas</a></span> is over. But he said fewer troops would be needed in Gaza, freeing up forces to battle Hezbollah.</p>



<p>“We will have the possibility of transferring some of our forces north, and we will do that,” he told Israel’s Channel 14, a pro-Netanyahu TV channel, in an interview that was frequently interrupted by applause from the studio audience. “First and foremost, for defense,” he added, but also to allow tens of thousands of displaced Israelis to return home.</p>
    

<p>The Iranian-backed Hezbollah began striking Israel almost immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7 cross-border attack that triggered the Gaza war. Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire nearly every day since then, but the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears of a full-blown war.</p>
    
<p>Hezbollah is much stronger than Hamas, and opening a new front would raise the risk of a larger, region-wide war involving other Iranian proxies and perhaps Iran itself that could cause heavy damage and mass casualties on both sides of the border. </p><p>White House envoy Amos Hochstein was in the region last week meeting with officials in Israel and Lebanon in an effort to lower tensions. But the fighting has continued.</p>
    

<p>Netanyahu said he hoped a diplomatic solution to the crisis could be found but vowed to solve the problem “in a different way” if needed. ″We can fight on several fronts and we are prepared to do that,” he said.</p><p>He said any deal would not just be “an agreement on paper.” He said it would require Hezbollah to be far from the border, an enforcement mechanism and the return of Israelis back to their homes. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated shortly after the fighting erupted and have not been able to go home.</p><p>Hezbollah has said it will continue battling Israel until a cease-fire is reached in Gaza. The group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, warned Israel last week against launching a war, saying Hezbollah <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-gaza-nasrallah-d3296bff6264582b7e7b90fe6061b16f">has new weapons and intelligence capabilities</a></span> that could help it target more critical positions deeper inside Israel.</p><p>Hezbollah already has unveiled new weapons during the low-level fighting, including hard-to-defend attack drones that strike with little warning. An Israeli soldier was badly wounded Sunday in a drone strike.</p><p>But Israel says it too has shown Hezbollah only a small part of its full capabilities, and that Lebanon will be turned into a second Gaza if there is a war. Israel’s army last week said it had “approved and validated” a new plan for a Lebanon offensive.</p>
    

<p>In the interview, Netanyahu said that Israel’s offensive in Gaza is winding down. The Israeli army has been operating in the southern border town of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-war-hamas-muwasi-humanitarian-2de77ea9095d2c680f57f77ad395917c">Rafah</a></span> since early May. It says it has inflicted heavy damage on Hamas in Rafah, which it has identified as the last remaining Hamas stronghold after a brutal war stretching nearly nine months. But he said Israel would have to continue “mowing” operations — targeted strikes aimed at preventing Hamas from regrouping.</p><p>Israel launched its air and ground invasion of Gaza immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, which killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage.</p><p>The Israeli offensive has killed over 37,000 Palestinians, unleashed a humanitarian crisis and triggered war crimes and genocide <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/icc-israel-hamas-gaza-warrants-court-c0509ed7daf21f9cc78ec17b8e627327">cases</a></span> at the world’s top courts in The Hague. </p><p>It also has raised tensions with the United States, with President <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a></span> and Netanyahu clashing publicly over the course of the war. Earlier on Sunday, Netanyahu again repeated his <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-06-18-2024-2a7aeb71867150c5a9d84ae57e2e7bf2">claim</a></span> that there has been a “dramatic drop” in arms shipments from the U.S., Israel’s closest ally, hindering the war effort. </p>
    

<p>Biden has delayed delivering <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-weapons-shipment-us-eed365ebef0477ba74bf9848cacae4f4">certain heavy bombs</a></span> since May over concerns of heavy civilian casualties, but his administration fought back last week against Netanyahu’s charges that other shipments had also been affected.</p><p>Although the U.S. and other mediators are pushing a cease-fire plan, Netanyahu has ruled out an end to the war until Israel releases all hostages held by Hamas and until it destroys Hamas’ military and governing capabilities.</p><p>The current phase of the war “is about to end,” Netanyahu said. “That doesn’t mean the war is about to end.”</p>
    

<p>Netanyahu spoke as his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, was in Washington for talks with American officials about the war and tensions with Lebanon. And next month, Netanyahu has been invited to address Congress for a speech that already is dividing Washington along partisan lines. Some Democrats, angry at Netanyahu’s public fighting with Biden, say <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-democrats-netanyahu-congress-address-boycott-war-54d4abfb517e399b22324d4c535427aa">they will not attend</a></span>.</p><p>American officials also have been pressing Netanyahu to spell out a clear post-war plan for Gaza. The U.S. has said it will not accept a long-term Israeli occupation of the territory.</p><p>Netanyahu spelled out a very different vision. He said the only way to guarantee Israel’s security is for Israel to maintain military control over the territory.</p><p>“There is no one else” capable of doing that, he said. But he said he is seeking a way to create a Palestinian “civilian administration” to manage day-to-day affairs in Gaza, hopefully with backing from moderate Arab countries. He ruled out any role for the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, which was ousted from Gaza by Hamas in a violent 2007 takeover.</p><p>Netanyahu said the Israeli army several months ago looked into working with prominent Palestinian families in Gaza, but that Hamas immediately “destroyed them.” He said Israel is now looking at other options.</p><p>Netanyahu ruled out one option favored by some of his ultranationalist governing partners — re-settling Israelis in Gaza. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, ending a 38-year presence.</p><p>“The issue of settlement is not realistic,” he said. “I’m realistic.”</p>

                                        <p>RUIDOSO, N.M. (AP) — Federal authorities offered a reward for information about those responsible for igniting a pair of New Mexico wildfires that killed two people and destroyed hundreds of homes in the past week.</p><p>The FBI on Saturday offered up to $10,000 for information in connection with the South Fork Fire and Salt Fire in southern New Mexico, which <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-wildfires-evacuation-ruidoso-be4907aa9570904e251ee193c05a2059">forced thousands to flee</a></span>.</p><p>An agency statement said it was seeking public assistance in identifying the cause of the fires near Ruidoso, New Mexico, that were discovered June 17. The notice also pointedly suggested human hands were to blame, saying the reward was for information leading to the arrest and conviction of “the person or persons responsible for starting the fires.”</p><p>The South Fork Fire, which reached 26 square miles (67 square kilometers), was 26% contained on Saturday. The Salt Fire, at 12 square miles (31 square kilometers), was 7% contained as of Saturday morning, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Full containment was not expected until July 15.</p>
    

<p>Recent <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-las-vegas-flash-flooding-evacuation-d8b2dc1d3a557291f8a3a15a959d25ce">rains</a></span> and cooler weather have assisted more than 1,000 firefighters working to contain the fires. Fire crews on Saturday took advantage of temperatures in the 70s Fahrenheit (21 to 26 Celsius), scattered showers and light winds to use bulldozers to dig protective lines. Hand crews used shovels in more rugged terrain to battle the fires near the mountain village of Ruidoso. </p>



<p>Elsewhere in New Mexico, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-las-vegas-flash-flooding-evacuation-d8b2dc1d3a557291f8a3a15a959d25ce">heavy rain and flash flood warnings</a></span> prompted officials to order some mandatory evacuations Friday in the city of Las Vegas, New Mexico; and communities near Albuquerque, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of Ruidoso. Las Vegas set up shelters for displaced residents, and some evacuation orders remained in place there on Saturday. </p>
    
<p>Flash flood warnings were canceled Saturday, though the National Weather Service said afternoon storms could produce excessive runoff and more flooding in the area. </p>
    

<p>The wildfires have destroyed or damaged an estimated 1,400 structures. Other fallout from the fires, including downed power lines, damaged water, sewer and gas lines, flooding in burn scars, continued “to pose risks to firefighters and the public,” according to a Saturday update from the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department.</p><p>Evacuations in areas near Ruidoso and road closures were still in effect. In Ruidoso, full-time residents will be allowed to return Monday, though everyday life won’t return to normal.</p><p>“You’re going to need to bring a week’s worth of food, you’re going to need to bring drinking water,” Mayor Lynn Crawford said on Facebook.</p><p>President Joe Biden issued a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/wildfire-advances-new-mexico-village-940f8193f1fc0c6c68a5276927aa5122">disaster declaration</a></span> for parts of southern New Mexico on Thursday, freeing up funding and more resources to help with recovery efforts including temporary housing, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property and other emergency work in Lincoln County and on lands belonging to the Mescalero Apache Tribe.</p><p>Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, met with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Crawford and Mescalero Apache President Thora Walsh Padilla on Saturday. “These communities have our support for as long as it takes to recover,” Criswell posted on the social media platform X. </p>
    

<p>Much of the Southwest has been <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/heat-wave-climate-change-causes-blame-4787a8bb1eb3aca0d398f46207f24247">exceedingly dry and hot</a></span> in recent months. Those conditions, along with strong wind, whipped the flames out of control, rapidly advancing the South Fork Fire into Ruidoso in a matter of hours. Evacuations extended to hundreds of homes, businesses, a regional medical center and the Ruidoso Downs horse track. </p><p>Nationwide, wildfires have scorched more than 3,344 square miles (8,660 square kilometers) this year, a figure higher than the 10-year average, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. </p>

                                        <p>KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian authorities said six people died and over 100 were wounded in Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Sunday, while the second day of Russia’s aerial bombing of Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine killed at least one person. </p><p>Among the dead were five people — including two children — who were hit by falling debris from Ukrainian missiles that were shot down over a coastal area in Sevastopol, a port city in Russia-annexed Crimea, said Mikhail Razvozhayev, the city’s Moscow-installed governor. Another person died in Grayvoron city in Russia’s Belgorod region, bordering Ukraine, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.</p><p>Razvozhayev said 151 people were wounded in Sevastopol. Falling rocket fragments caused a forest fire of over 150 square meters (1,600 square feet) and set a residential building alight, RIA Novosti said, noting that a fifth missile had exploded over the city.</p>




    

<p>Russia’s Defense Ministry said both Ukraine and the U.S. bore “responsibility for a deliberate missile strike on civilians.” It said that U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles were used in the Ukranian attack. </p><p>Razvozhayev declared Monday a day of mourning in Sevastopol, with public events canceled.</p><p>Air defenses overnight shot down 33 Ukrainian drones over Russia’s western Bryansk, Smolensk, Lipetsk and Tula regions, the Russian Ministry of Defense said Sunday. No casualties or damage were reported.</p>
    
<p>A fresh attack on Kharkiv killed at least one person and wounded 11 on Sunday, according to local officials. Mayor Ihor Terekhov said the city was attacked by a guided bomb and that around half of Kharkiv was <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-kyiv-power-blackouts-russia-attacks-electricity-a0f9c6a84b708dfd493230c8c26716fb">without electricity</a></span> because of the strike.</p><p>Sunday’s attacks came after Russia struck Kharkiv on Saturday afternoon with four aerial bombs, hitting a five-story residential building and killing three people. Regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said that 41 people were still being treated for injuries on Sunday. </p>
