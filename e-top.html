<p>MILWAUKEE (AP) — Former President <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></span> chose <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/jd-vance">Sen. JD Vance</a></span> of Ohio as his running mate on Monday, picking a onetime critic who became a loyal ally and is now the first millennial to join a major-party ticket at a time of deep concern about the advanced age of America’s political leaders. </p><p>“After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network as the Republican National Convention got underway in Milwaukee.</p><p>The 39-year-old Vance rose to national fame with the 2016 publication of his memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.” He was elected to the Senate in 2022 and has become one of the staunchest champions of the former president’s “Make America Great Again” agenda, particularly on trade, foreign policy and immigration. </p>
    

<p>But he is largely untested in national politics and is joining the Trump ticket at an extraordinary moment. An <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-assassination-attempt-thomas-matthew-crooks-shooter-881581c46c07025898027143fc9132e5">attempted assassination</a></span> of Trump at a rally Saturday has shaken the campaign, bringing new attention to the nation’s coarse political rhetoric and reinforcing the importance of those who are one heartbeat away from the presidency. </p>



<p>Vance himself faced criticism in the wake of the shooting for a post on X that suggested President Joe Biden was to blame for the violence.</p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know about the 2024 Election Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020.

    <div class="Infobox-items RichTextBody"><p><b>What to know about the 2024 Election</b><br></p></div>
    
</div>
<p>“The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a></span> is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,” Vance wrote. “That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.”</p>
    
<p>Law enforcement has not yet specified a motivation for the shooting. </p><h2>Why Vance was chosen over the other finalists</h2><p>Vance, Trump said, “will be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American Workers and Farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond.” Several of those Midwestern states are expected to play a critical role in November’s election.</p>
    

<p>Trump and Vance spoke about 20 minutes before the Truth Social post and Trump formally offered him the job, according to a person familiar with the call who, like others, requested anonymity to share the private conversation.</p><p>Biden’s reelection campaign issued a statement calling out Vance for saying, had he been vice president, he would have allowed “multiple slates of electors” to challenge Biden’s victory over Trump four years ago. Trump repeatedly promoted falsehoods about election fraud before and after Jan. 6, 2021, when rioters loyal to the former president stormed the Capitol to try to stop the certification of his loss. </p><p>“Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance as his running mate because Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,” Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in the statement.</p>
    
<p>Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, the other contenders on Trump’s shortlist, had been informed earlier Monday afternoon that they were not his pick, according to people familiar with their conversations.</p>
    

<p>Conversations in the last 10 days between Rubio and Trump’s campaign had focused on concerns about the residency issue and how they would work around both men residing in the same state, according to a person familiar with the private talks who insisted on anonymity to discuss them.</p><p>The Trump campaign wanted to be 100% sure that there would not be a protracted legal battle over the issue, and Rubio was unwilling to uproot his family, the person said.</p><p>Trump had spent months testing the field, assessing how his contenders performed on television, at fundraisers and on rally stages. Several, including Burgum and Vance, joined him at his criminal hush money trial in New York. Others were there at the debate last month, where Biden’s disastrous performance upended his campaign, leading to widespread calls for him to step aside in favor or a younger candidate.</p>
    

<p>The pick is sure to energize Trump’s loyal base. Vance has become a fixture on the conservative media circuit and frequently spars with reporters on Capitol Hill, helping establish him as the kind of leader who could carry Trump’s mantle into the future, beginning with the next presidential election in 2028.</p><p>But the pick also means that two white men will now lead the Republican ticket at a time when Trump has sought to make inroads with Black and Latino voters. </p><p>In “Hillbilly Elegy,” Vance detailed life in Appalachian communities that drifted from a Democratic Party many residents found disconnected from their daily travails. While the book was a bestseller, it was also criticized for sometimes oversimplifying rural life and ignoring the role of racism in modern politics.</p>
    

<h2>Vance once was a harsh Trump critic</h2><p>The relationship between Vance and Trump has been symbiotic.</p><p>Vance’s fame grew in tandem with Trump’s unlikely rise from a reality television star to Republican presidential nominee and eventually president. During the early stages of Trump’s political career, Vance cast him as “a total fraud,” “a moral disaster” and “America’s Hitler.”</p><p>But like many Republicans who sought relevance in the Trump era, Vance eventually shifted his tone. He said he was proved wrong by Trump’s performance in office and evolved into one of his most steadfast defenders.</p><p>“I didn’t think he was going to be a good president,” Vance recently told Fox News Channel. “He was a great president. And it’s one of the reasons why I’m working so hard to make sure he gets a second term.”</p><p>Vance was rewarded for his turnaround during his bid for an open Senate seat in 2022, during which he landed Trump’s coveted endorsement and rode it to victory in a crowded Republican primary and a general election hard fought by Democrats. He is close to Trump’s son Donald Jr.</p><p>“Listen, I’ve seen him on TV,” Donald Trump Jr. said of Vance, speaking to CNN from the convention floor. “I’ve seen him prosecute the case against the Democrats. No one’s more articulate than that. And I think his story, his background, really helps us in a lot of the places that you’re going to need from the Electoral College standpoint.”</p><p>Vance is now a Trump loyalist who has challenged the legitimacy of criminal prosecutions and civil verdicts against him and questions the results of the 2020 election. </p><p>He told ABC News in February that, if he had been vice president on Jan. 6, 2021, he would have told states where Trump disputed Biden wins “that we needed to have multiple slates of electors, and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there.”</p><p>“That is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020,” he said.</p><p>Many states adopted emergency measures four years ago to allow people to vote safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. But judges, election officials in both parties and Trump’s own attorney general have concluded there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. </p><h2>Vance’s book vaulted him to national prominence</h2><p>Vance’s book — subtitled “A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis” — was embraced for its <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-business-arts-and-ohio-8c7a70bad96c48df9544049a38584cb8">insights into Trump’s appeal in middle America</a></span>, where manufacturing job losses and the opioid crisis had driven many families like his into poverty, abuse and addiction. </p><p>The tale of Vance’s hardscrabble childhood in Middletown, Ohio, where he was born, and his familial eastern Kentucky hills region also captivated Hollywood. Ron Howard made it into a 2020 movie starring Amy Adams as Vance’s mother and Glenn Close as his beloved “Mamaw.” </p><p>With his grandmother’s encouragement, Vance went on to serve in the Marine Corps, including in Iraq, and to graduate from Ohio State University and Yale Law School. From there, he joined a Silicon Valley investment firm before returning to Ohio to launch a nonprofit that he said would aim to develop opioid addiction treatments that might be “scaled nationally.”</p><p>Ultimately, Our Ohio Renewal <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-entertainment-health-175153d8a80d93b2c9c6654a6a730de9">failed at that mission</a></span> and was shuttered. During the 2022 campaign, then-U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, his Democratic rival, charged that the charity was little more than a front for Vance’s political ambitions. Ryan pointed to reports that the organization made payments to a Vance political adviser and conducted public opinion polling, even as its actual efforts to address addiction largely floundered. Vance denied the characterization. </p><p>As a senator, Vance has shown some willingness to work across the aisle. He and Ohio’s senior senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown, have teamed up on a number of issues important to the state, including fighting for funding for a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-lifestyle-games-video-games-cb3e3a36f48416a25b5d00baa405f91a">$20 billion chip facility Intel is building</a></span> in central Ohio and introducing <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/derailment-ohio-safety-senate-legislation-brown-vance-82c55dc95aca9524d6ae8e6d01336dbe">rail safety legislation</a></span> in response to the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-ohio-evacuations-fires-5d399dc745f51ef746e22828083d8591">fiery derailment in East Palestine, Ohio</a></span>.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Smyth reported from Butler, Pennsylvania.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Judge Aileen Cannon, who is based in the sleepy town of Fort Pierce, Florida, was presiding over one of the most complex and consequential cases in America, the criminal prosecution of former President Donald Trump, over his handling of classified documents.</li>
<li>Cannon has been criticized for dragging out the proceedings, which has flummoxed legal scholars and put the trial on hold indefinitely.</li>
<li>Senior Judge Paul C. Huck has described Fort Pierce as a "lonely" and "sleepy" place, where Cannon is the only federal judge, which may contribute to her isolated decision-making.</li>
<li>Cannon's isolation in the Fort Pierce courthouse may be a factor in her conduct, as several attorneys who have practiced in front of her suggested that she lacks the informal, day-to-day interactions that judges often have with other judges and court staff.</li>
<li>Despite her lack of experience in high-profile cases, Cannon was tasked with overseeing the Trump trial, which has attracted nationwide scrutiny, and has been handling it in ways that have raised concerns among legal experts and the public.</li>

            Judge Aileen Cannon had been on the federal bench for little more than a year when a senior judge offered to preside over one of her first criminal trials in her isolated south Florida courthouse.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_51EB8EE8-548B-4757-8141-B5E2C8931480@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “It’s very lonely,” Senior Judge Paul C. Huck told CNN of Fort Pierce, a small fishing and citrus community on the edge of the Southern District of Florida where Cannon is the only federal judge. “It’s a pretty sleepy town with a pretty sleepy courtroom.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_2BAF4EE3-39C6-40CF-89D2-211B10B6D507@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Two years later, Cannon presided over one of the most consequential and complex cases in America: the criminal prosecution of former President Donald Trump over his handling of the nation’s secrets. She’s attracted nationwide scrutiny for how she’s approached the case.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_F0D47551-FFFF-4ACB-9A8D-F3B96879767D@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Since Trump was first indicted a year ago, Cannon has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/03/politics/legal-fights-judge-trump-documents-trial/index.html" target="_blank">dragged out the proceedings</a> in ways that have flummoxed legal scholars and put a trial initially scheduled to begin last month <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/07/politics/judge-postpones-trump-classified-documents-trial/index.html" target="_blank">on hold indefinitely.</a>
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_656BFBB0-7BD9-4991-9A18-986048D8E2D6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Several attorneys who have practiced in front of Cannon pointed to her isolation as one explanation for her conduct. Cannon’s solitary post in the Fort Pierce courthouse, one that rarely sees high-profile action, deprives her of the informal, day-to-day interactions with more seasoned judges who sit at the other courthouses and could offer her advice, the lawyers told CNN.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_1EDDD1A8-82A8-42B6-BF36-6EF4A30A0D5E@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            They also said Cannon’s lack of trial experience, both as a lawyer and a judge, is apparent. In her seven years as a Justice Department attorney, Cannon participated on the trial teams of just four criminal cases. And on the bench, she’s only presided over a handful of criminal trials — and Huck took over one of them.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_1A1737E3-1101-44C0-B7E0-AF7F78BF0EF7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            For this account of Cannon’s judicial demeanor, CNN spoke to 10 attorneys who have had cases — both criminal and civil — before her. The lawyers spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity because of the professional and ethical risks of speaking to press about a sitting federal judge in front of whom they practice.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_A7A63027-4DC6-4609-9DB0-7F6E6F624CB0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            To corroborate their characterizations of Cannon’s approach, CNN reviewed the public dockets of scores of cases that have traveled through her courtroom.

    <p class="pull-quote__text inline-placeholder" data-editable="text">
        The attorneys described Cannon as extremely diligent and well prepared, a tough questioner who accepts nothing at face value, and thoughtful in her rulings. But they also said that some of her habits that have raised eyebrows in Trump’s case have plagued her approach from the bench more generally.<br>Those tendencies include a penchant for letting irrelevant legal questions distract from core issues, a zero-tolerance approach to any technical defects in filings, and a struggle with docket management that allows the type of pretrial disputes that other judges would decide in weeks go unresolved for months.

<p>At noon, the demonstrators set off on the march around the arena’s security perimeter in temperatures approaching 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), chanting “Hey-hey, ho-ho, Republicans have got to go” and “This is what democracy looks like.” Many carried Palestinian flags.</p>
    
<p>Marchers passed within a block of Fiserv Forum on the edge of the arena’s security zone before returning to the downtown park where they began. The parade appeared to go off without incident, although Milwaukee Police didn’t immediately respond to an email inquiring about the number of arrests, if any. The police department estimated the crowd at 700 to 800 people. </p>

<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">How Is Secret Service Protection Allocated?</h2>
<p>The Secretary of Homeland Security determines which presidential candidates are eligible to receive <a href="https://www.secretservice.gov/protection/leaders/campaign-2024" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.secretservice.gov/protection/leaders/campaign-2024" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.secretservice.gov/protection/leaders/campaign-2024" aria-label="Secret Service protection">Secret Service protection</a> following consultation with an advisory committee made up of the Speaker of the House, House Minority Leader, Senate Majority Leader, Senate Minority Leader and one additional member. The Secret Service says the DHS secretary has “broad discretion,” but may consider factors such as a variety of polling thresholds based on Real Clear Politics averages. During the primary for a major party, candidates eligible for Secret Service protection must poll at 15% or more for 30 consecutive days. Independent or third-party candidates should poll at or above 20% for 30 consecutive days. The department also considers a candidate’s threat level, which it defines as “explicit threats of bodily harm to the candidate or indications of inappropriate behavior towards the candidate suggesting potential bodily harm.” Secret Service protection is also only granted within one year of the general election except in “extraordinary” circumstances based on a candidate’s threat level or other factors.</p>
<h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Which Candidates Have Received Secret Service Protection In The Past?</h2>

Though he had protection as vice president, it expired six months after he left office. In November 2015, one year before the 2016 presidential election, then-frontrunners for the Republican nomination Trump and Ben Carson received protection, while Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/bernie-sanders-secret-service-protection-218685" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/bernie-sanders-secret-service-protection-218685" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/bernie-sanders-secret-service-protection-218685" aria-label="received protection">received protection</a> in February 2016.

Some candidates have resisted Secret Service protection, including then-Sen. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/05/us/politics/05secret.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/05/us/politics/05secret.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/05/us/politics/05secret.html" aria-label="John McCain">John McCain</a>, who declined protection until April 2008, stating it “inhibits my ability to have close contact with people.”</p>

<li><strong>Serial killings</strong>: A suspect has confessed to killing 42 female bodies, aged 18-30, between 2022 and the present day, in a dumping site in Kenya.</li>
<li><strong>Confidential informant</strong>: The suspect led police to his house, located 100m from the crime scene, where they found items such as phones, laptops, identity cards, and personal female clothing.</li>
<li><strong>Motive unknown</strong>: The police are still interrogating the suspect to establish the motive for the killings, as well as the number of bodies found, with local residents claiming to have found more than 16 bodies at the dump site.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation ongoing</strong>: The police are conducting forensic analysis, including post-mortem examinations, and have cordoned off the dump site. They are asking families to report if they believe their loved ones may have been victims of the serial killings.</li>
<li><strong>Serial killer's crimes</strong>: The head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) described the suspect as a "psychopathic serial killer with no respect for human life", as the victims were all killed in the same way and the suspect is believed to have used a machete to dismember the bodies.</li>

murdered between 2022 and as recent as Thursday," said Mohamed Amin, head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI).</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Many Kenyans are asking how 42 people could be murdered in the space of two years without police noticing. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Amin said that after his arrest, the suspect led police officers to his house, about 100m (yards) from the crime scene.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The police displayed to the media some of the items said to have been recovered from the suspect’s house, including 10 phones, a laptop, identity cards and personal female clothing.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">They also found a machete they "believed was being used to dismember the victims",  and nine sacks like the ones used to dispose of the bodies.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Since Friday, police have cordoned off the dumpsite where the bodies were found in various stages of decomposition.  </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The victims were aged between 18 and 30 and were all killed in the same way, according to the police.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">While the authorities have confirmed that nine bodies have been found so far in the quarry, local residents say the number is higher.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Joseph Waweru, who has been involved in retrieving the bodies, told the BBC he had counted 16 bodies, all severely dismembered.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Police said they were still interrogating the suspect to establish the motive for the killings and he would be arraigned in court on Tuesday.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">They said his arrest followed a "forensic analysis" of a mobile phone that belonged to one of the victims, Josephine Mulongo Owino, "where some mobile money transactions were conducted on the very day [she] went missing".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Post-mortem examinations on the bodies were being conducted, the police said.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">They have asked families "who believe that their beloved ones may have fallen prey to these macabre murders" to report to the police.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"It is crystallising that we are dealing with a serial killer, a psychopathic serial killer who has no respect for human life, who has no respect and dignity," Mr Amin said.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Emmanuel Ogongo, whose sister went missing on 28 June, said he had identified a body from the dump site that looked like her.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He said the body had the same hairstyle and outfit she was wearing when she disappeared.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Only the torso has been found so far.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A second person with a phone belonging to one of the victims has also been arrested and would be treated either as an accomplice or suspect, he said.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Kenya's police watchdog earlier said it was investigating whether there was any police involvement in the crimes as the dumpsite is close to a police station. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The officers working there have been transferred, to ensure "fair and unbiased investigations" into the "heinous" deaths, the acting police chief, Douglas Kanja <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51y21lz606o" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">said earlier.</a></p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Independent Police Oversight Authority said “widespread allegations of police involvement in unlawful arrests [and] abductions” meant it was undertaking a preliminary investigation to establish whether there was any police connection.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Hussein Khalid, head of the Haki Africa campaign group, told the BBC that police need to address how the murders happened just metres from a police station.<b id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"> </b></p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The discovery of these bodies comes at a difficult time for Kenya's police.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Human rights groups have accused the police of shooting dozens of people who were demonstrating against planned tax rises earlier this month, some of them fatally.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Many Kenyans are calling for the police to investigate the allegations of abductions and killings from the protests as quickly as they have investigated the Mukuru deaths. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On Friday, <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c978l3rlymvo" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">Kenya's police chief Japhet Koome resigned</a>, a day after President William Ruto<a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c886g5evlxjo" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"> fired his entire cabinet</a> in the wake of the deadly protests.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The killings are being seen as the latest police failure to adequately deal with crime especially as it happened so close to a police station.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Some Kenyans are questioning why the police have been unable to solve <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68002939" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">the death of Rita Waeni,</a> whose dismembered body was found earlier this year at a short-term rental apartment in Nairobi.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Like the latest gruesome deaths, Waeni’s brutal murder shocked and angered many Kenyans. It ignited an online campaign urging the protection of women and girls.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Last year Kenyans were horrified after the remains of hundreds of people associated with a doomsday cult were discovered in the Indian Ocean coastal town of Malindi.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Paul Nthenge Mackenzie went on trial in Mombasa earlier last week on charges of terrorism and murder over the deaths of more than 440 of his followers.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced on Monday, gaining 210.82 points or 0.53% to 40,211.72, driven by investors' optimism about the potential impact of the unsuccessful assassination attempt on President Trump's presidential campaign and the Republican party's chances in November.</li>
<li>The S&amp;P 500 index also rose, adding 0.28% to 5,631.22, and touched a new intraday high. The Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.4% to 18,472.57.</li>
<li>Small-cap shares and banks were among the best-performing sectors, as investors bet on the potential for friendlier fiscal policies under a Republican administration.</li>
<li>The article quotes Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, as saying that the good news is that former President Trump was not seriously injured or killed in the assassination attempt, which has reduced concerns about the potential impact on the market.</li>
<li>The market rally is seen as a continuation of a broader trend that started last week, with investors becoming more optimistic about the prospects for economic growth and market gains under a potential Republican administration.</li>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Schulman was previously CEO of <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/michael-kors-names-chinese-actor-and-singer-jc-t-as-greater-china-brand-ambassador-1236091302/" data-type="post" data-id="1236091302">Michael Kors</a> and Coach where he also served as brand president.

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	From 2007 to 2012, Joshua was CEO of Jimmy Choo in London. Earlier, he was executive vice president worldwide merchandising and sales at Yves Saint Laurent and worldwide director women’s ready-to-wear at Gucci.

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	He will join Burberry on July 17, and be based at the company’s headquarters here. He will lead the executive committee and report to Burberry chair <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/human-resources/gerry-murphy-become-chairman-british-supermarket-tesco-1235721477/" data-type="post" data-id="1235721477">Gerry Murphy</a> and the board of directors.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Murphy said: “I am pleased that Josh will be joining Burberry as our new CEO. Josh is a proven leader with an outstanding record of building global luxury brands and driving profitable growth. He has a strong understanding of our brand and shares our ambition to build on Burberry’s unique creative heritage. His extensive experience in luxury and fashion will be key to realizing Burberry’s full potential.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Jonathan Akeroyd for the contribution he has made to Burberry. Jonathan has set out a clear strategy for growth that we will build on,” he added. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Schulman said: “I am deeply honored to join Burberry as CEO. Burberry is an extraordinary luxury brand, quintessentially British, equal parts heritage and innovation. Its original purpose to protect people from the weather is more relevant than ever. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“I look forward to working alongside [creative director] Daniel Lee and the talented teams to drive global growth, delight our customers, and write the next chapter of the Burberry story,” he added.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Schulman is a well-rounded retail leader known for building brands, and also restoring them to health. His appointment as CEO marks his return to the industry after two years, and his return to the U.K. after 12 years after exiting Jimmy Choo.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	For the past two years, he’d been keeping a low profile following his exit from <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/capri-holdings/" id="auto-tag_capri-holdings" data-tag="capri-holdings">Capri Holdings</a> in September 2022. He had been leading the company’s <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/michael-kors-2/" id="auto-tag_michael-kors-2" data-tag="michael-kors-2">Michael Kors</a> brand and was set to become Capri’s CEO, succeeding John Idol.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	In a surprise move, Idol stayed on and Schulman exited with a multi-million dollar separation agreement.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Before joining <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/business-features/capri-holdings-ceo-disappointed-fourth-quarter-results-1236405948/" id="related_article_link_capri-holdings" data-tag="capri-holdings">Capri Holdings</a>, he served as CEO of Coach. Prior to his arrival the brand had been struggling and revenues had been shrinking for several years. Schulman restored it to quality growth, and made market share gains, moves that won him plaudits in the financial community.

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Executives have described him as strategic, organized, methodical and focused on execution.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	He’s also a lateral thinker. During his pre-Coach days as president of <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/retail/saks-neimans-deal-impact-apparel-vendors-1236482379/" id="related_article_link_bergdorf-goodman" data-tag="bergdorf-goodman">Bergdorf Goodman</a>, Schulman brought in some unexpected labels such as Vetements, Off-White and Fenty by Puma, while maintaining the luxury appeal by emphasizing luxury mainstays like Chanel, Valentino and Goyard.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	During his five years as CEO of Jimmy Choo, he transformed the business from a niche player into a multi-million dollar global luxury brand, doubling the store count, entering new categories, and taking control of the Japanese and Hong Kong businesses, before selling it to Labelux in 2011 for 500 million pounds.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	It’s no wonder that Burberry’s board had wanted him to be a member, and why they ultimately decided to tap him as CEO.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	On the call, Murphy said the board “didn’t conduct any serious discussions with anybody about replacing Jonathan, until very recently. Josh was known to us a lot of the company, and we’d been talking to him about a board role. And as things evolved, it was clear that he was interested in a bigger role, and we acted,” he said.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Schulman’s remuneration arrangements have been set in accordance with the directors’ remuneration policy approved by shareholders, Burberry said. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	His salary will be 1.2 million pounds per annum and he will be eligible for a target bonus of 100 percent of salary and maximum of 200 percent of salary and a Burberry share plan award of 162.5 percent of salary.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Akeroyd, who joined Burberry from Versace two years ago, and later hired Lee as creative director,  will not be eligible for a bonus for the current financial year, and all unvested share awards will lapse in full.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Asked about the company’s future strategy, and whether Lee would keep his job, Murphy said: “Daniel’s not going anywhere. He is looking forward to working with Josh. They’ve already spoken and will meet later this week. So there is no change in terms of creative leadership,” he said.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Murphy also emphasized that Burberry had no intention to become the British Coach, despite having hired the U.S. brand’s former CEO. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Josh’s background is actually much closer to luxury than anything else, and he’s got a very clear view that Burberry is a true luxury brand and has a spectacular potential in what Jonathan coined as ‘modern British luxury.’ 

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“There is no intention of changing that ambition, or of becoming a British Coach. That is not to disparage Coach in any way – it’s just a different business,” he said, adding that Burberry also had no ambition to become a British Louis Vuitton.” </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Murphy added that Burberry made the leadership change due to a number of factors. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“Our strategy has been quite coherent for a while, but with the benefit of hindsight, in a weak market, we perhaps went a bit too far too fast with a creative transition at a time when customers are feeling a bit more challenged, and a bit more conservative in in sampling newness, especially new units at higher price points,” he said.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	He stressed that Burberry’s shift to focus on more recognizable, classic items, and outerwear was not a signal that the brand was changing tack, or becoming more mass.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“It’s not about dropping prices but about making sure that we have a product that people want at prices that are acceptable to them from from Burberry,” Murphy said, adding there will be some high price points going forward for merchandise “with more innovation, design content, and higher higher-cost materials. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	“This is about having a more inclusive and democratic brand, and not about dropping prices or a reversal of strategies. It’s about us rebalancing to ensure that people can get what they want from Burberry.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Schulman’s appointment closes a very short chapter for Akeroyd, who joined Burberry in 2022 from Versace, which belongs to Capri Holdings. Prior to joining Versace, Akeroyd served as CEO of Alexander McQueen, after having begun his career at Harrods. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Less than two years ago, Akeroyd set out his plan to move Burberry further upmarket to compete with brands such as Dior, Louis Vuitton, and Gucci.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	He projected revenue growth of 4 billion pounds in the medium term, and 5 billion pounds in the long term, at constant exchange rates, and with “good” margin progression.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	His new vision included “a refocus on Britishness,” doubling the sales of leather goods, shoes and women’s rtw, and growing outerwear by 50 percent in the medium-term.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Another of Akeroyd’s ambitions was to grow accessories to more than 50 percent of group sales in the medium term.

	</p>
<p></p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Those plans came with hefty price tags on merchandise: 2,000 pounds for the medium Rocking Horse shoulder bag; 2,000 pounds for a Long Gabardine Trench Coat; and 690 pounds for a pair of Check Knit Box sneakers. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	While those prices may seem normal in the luxury goods business, they have been shocking to many longtime British customers, and non-fashion institutional investors, who view Burberry as a heritage brand that should be growing through sales of accessibly-priced classic merchandise.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	Akeroyd was also counting on Lee, whose bags and accessories were a runaway success at Bottega Veneta, to deliver best-sellers, but they have yet to materialize. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	The strategy might have been successful at another period in time, but with China (historically, one of Burberry’s biggest markets) still cautious about spending, and U.S. demand tepid, it has damaged the share price and stymied sales. </p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">
	It will now be up to Schulman, Burberry’s fourth CEO in seven years, to re-position the brand for profit, unlock the dividend payments and restore the brand to its former glory as a top purveyor of outerwear.  </p>
