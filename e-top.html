    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Idaho abortion ban case involves the interpretation of the federal Emergency Medical Treatment Labor Act (EMTALA), which was at the center of a heated debate between liberal and far-right wings.</li>
<li>A dissent written by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, argued that EMTALA has an "express protection of the unborn child".</li>
<li>Alito's dissent claimed that EMTALA demands that Medicare-funded hospitals protect the health of both the pregnant woman and her "unborn child", and obligates them to treat, not abort, an "unborn child".</li>
<li>The argument put forward by Alito and his fellow justices is that EMTALA's language implies a protection of the unborn child, which could potentially be used to justify stricter abortion laws.</li>
<li>The debate over the interpretation of EMTALA could become significant if the case returns to the Supreme Court, potentially affecting the future of abortion laws in the US.</li>

            The significance of references to the “unborn child” in the federal emergency medical care statute at the center of the Idaho abortion ban case was the subject of heated debate between liberal and far-right wings, according to the version of the ruling obtained by Bloomberg Wednesday.

            <strong>What the conservatives say: </strong>A dissent written by Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, embraced an argument put forward by Idaho and its supporters in their efforts to defend the state’s strict ban on abortion. Alito described the Emergency Medical Treatment Labor Act (EMTALA), the key federal law in the dispute, as having an “express protection of the unborn child. “

            “Far from requiring hospitals to perform abortions, EMTALA’s text unambiguously demands that Medicare-funded hospitals protect the health of both a pregnant woman and her ‘unborn child,’” Alito wrote.

            <strong>What the liberals say:</strong>  Justice Elena Kagan, in parts of her concurrence that were joined by both Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, sought to rebut Alito’s claims. She said three of the statute’s four references to an “unborn child” have to do with how hospitals handle transfers of women in labor, and thus were not related to the types of emergency pregnancy complications at issue in this case.

            Advocates on both sides of the abortion debate were watching closely for how the court treated the “unborn child” language in the case. Anti-abortion activists argued that it showed that Congress, when it added the provisions making the reference, saw an interest in protecting unborn life. Abortion rights advocates countered that that was not Congress’ intent, and worried that the conservative Supreme Court would read fetal personhood into a federal statute for the first time ever.

Some of these communications <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/9/22/23883888/supreme-court-social-media-first-amendment-netchoice-paxton-murthy-missouri-twitter-facebook">urged platforms to remove content</a>, such as speech seeking to recruit terrorists, to spread election disinformation, or to promote false and potentially harmful medical advice — including false claims about Covid-19 and vaccines.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">The plaintiffs in <em>Murthy</em> are two red states plus an array of individuals who had content removed or suppressed by at least one of the social media platforms.

Among other things, a plaintiff must show that the defendant’s actions actually caused their injury, and that the injury is “redressable” by a court order — meaning that the court could actually do something to fix the damage allegedly caused to the plaintiff.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Additionally, when a plaintiff seeks an injunction — a court order requiring the defendant to change their behavior in the future — it is not enough to show that the defendant harmed the plaintiff in the past. Rather, as Barrett writes, the plaintiff must show that it is “likely” the defendant will cause them the same harm in the future.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Notably, these plaintiffs sued the federal government, and not the platforms themselves, for the platforms’ decision to remove or demote some of the plaintiffs’ content. That decision, to target a defendant with only an attenuated connection to the alleged censorship, made the <em>Murthy </em>plaintiffs’ case even weaker.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Indeed, some of their claims that they were injured by the government were embarrassingly thin. One plaintiff, for example, claimed that Twitter suspended his brother’s account in response to pressure from the FBI. But even setting aside the lack of evidence that the FBI played a role in Twitter’s decision, a plaintiff does not have standing to sue if their brother was harmed — only the brother may file such a lawsuit.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">The Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-411_3dq3.pdf">did find some vague links</a> between Facebook’s decision to moderate content by one of the plaintiffs, an anti-mask and anti-vaccine mandate activist named Jill Hines, and the government’s actions. Facebook deleted one of Hines’s posts three months after a White House official suggested that the platform should “end group recommendations for groups with a history of COVID–19 or vaccine misinformation.” And Facebook warned Hines against reposting content from a particularly notorious anti-vaccine advocate, third-party 2024 presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., two years after the White House included Kennedy on a list of prolific spreaders of Covid misinformation.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">But, as Barrett writes, these links are weak: “Facebook was targeting [Hines’s] pages before almost all of its communications with the White House and the CDC, which weakens the inference that her subsequent restrictions are likely traceable to ‘government-coerced enforcement’ of Facebook’s policies.” And even if the links were stronger, Hines can’t show that she will face future injury because of the government’s actions.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Among other things, Barrett notes that the Biden administration has largely halted its efforts to persuade social media platforms to remove Covid misinformation now that the acute phase of the pandemic has ended. So even if Hines could somehow show that some of her content was removed in the past due to government pressure, she has no reason to believe that it will be removed in the future due to similar pressure.</p></div><div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="_7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg0"><h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup">The Fifth Circuit is a rogue court</h2></p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">It’s notable that three Republican justices, including two Trump appointees, joined the <em>Murthy </em>majority.

Earlier this term, for example, the Supreme Court reversed the Fifth Circuit’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/24158216/supreme-court-cfpb-clarence-thomas-community-financial">declaration that an entire federal agency is unconstitutional</a>. It also reversed the Fifth Circuit’s holding that domestic abusers have a right to own guns (although, in fairness, the Fifth Circuit’s decision in that case was <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/356267/supreme-court-us-rahimi-domestic-abuse-guns-second-amendmen">more defensible</a> under the justices’ own incompetently drafted opinion in the 2022 case <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf"><em>New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v.

That court took a bunch of vague allegations, involving decisions by private companies that had only a tenuous connection to anything done by a government official, and used those vague allegations to try to shut down the Biden administration’s ability to communicate with those companies.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">Barrett even faults the Fifth Circuit, and the right-wing trial judge who first heard this case, for misrepresenting many key facts. In her words, “the Fifth Circuit relied on the District Court’s factual findings, many of which unfortunately appear to be clearly erroneous.”</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixd lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg0">For the moment, at least, the Supreme Court appears to be holding the line against this uniquely partisan court -— but it is far from clear that this line will hold if Trump wins the 2024 election. <em>Murthy</em>, after all, was a 6-3 decision. So, if Trump gets to appoint two more justices, the Fifth Circuit’s values could soon be imposed on the entire nation.</p></div></div></div>

                                        <p>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — WikiLeaks founder <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/julian-assange">Julian Assange</a></span> returned to his homeland Australia aboard a charter jet and raised a celebratory clenched fist as his supporters cheered on Wednesday, hours after <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/assange-plea-deal-wikileaks-justice-department-d329ba4614dbfa77b5eb968d07fd9bd0">pleading guilty</a></span> to obtaining and publishing U.S. military secrets in a deal with Justice Department prosecutors that concludes a drawn-out legal saga.</p><p>Assange told Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in a phone call from the capital Canberra’s airport tarmac that Australian government intervention in the U.S. prosecution had saved his life, Assange lawyer Jennifer Robinson said.</p><p>Assange embraced his wife Stella Assange and father John Shipton who were waiting on the tarmac, but avoided media at a news conference less than than two hours after he landed.</p><p>“Julian wanted me to sincerely thank everyone. He wanted to be here. But you have to understand what he’s been through. He needs time. He needs to recuperate and this is a process.” Stella Assange told reporters.</p>
    

<p>Assange was accused of receiving and publishing hundreds of thousands of war logs and diplomatic cables that included details of U.S. military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan. His activities drew an outpouring of support from press freedom advocates, who heralded his role in bringing to light military conduct that might otherwise have been concealed from view and warned of a chilling effect on journalists. Among the files published by WikiLeaks was a video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters journalists.</p>



<p>The case came to a surprise end in a most unusual setting with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/assange-wikileaks-profile-e6f55737c9cf6e5059eb43991e89e1f3">Assange, 52,</a></span> entering his plea in a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/assange-wikileaks-saipan-court-marianas-surge-066ab4e64d9fa063ffd20c71964a2662">U.S. district court in Saipan,</a></span> the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands. The American commonwealth in the Pacific is relatively close to Assange’s native Australia and accommodated his desire to avoid entering the continental United States.</p>
    
<p>Albanese said Assange told him during their phone call he was looking forward to playing with his sons, conceived while the father was in self-exile in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for seven years. </p>
    

<p>“He described it as a surreal and happy moment, his landing here in our national capital, Canberra,” Albanese told reporters in Parliament House. “I had a very warm discussion with him this evening. He was very generous in his praise of the Australian government’s efforts.”</p><p>Robinson said she became “very emotional” when she overheard Assange’s conversation with the prime minister. </p><p>“Julian thanked him and the team and told the prime minister that he had saved his life. And I don’t think that that’s an exaggeration,” Robinson said.</p><p>Assange’s British court hearings in which he fought extradition to the United States had heard evidence of his failing health and potential risk for self-harm in the U.S. penal system.</p><p>Assange was accompanied on the flights by Australian Ambassador to the United States Kevin Rudd and High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Stephen Smith, both of whom played key roles in negotiating his freedom with London and Washington.</p>
    

<p>The flights were paid for by the “Assange team,” Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said, adding his government played a role in facilitating the transport.</p><p>Albanese told Parliament that Assange’s freedom, after he spent five years in a British prison <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/julian-assange-wikileaks-extradition-timeline-77a759d7408ebeb24d026a7c2c00feb3">fighting extradition to the U.S.,</a></span> was the result of his government’s “careful, patient and determined work.”</p><p>It is unclear where Assange will go from Canberra and what his future plans are. His South African-born lawyer wife and mother of his two children, Stella Assange, has been in Australia for days awaiting his release.</p><p>Another of Julian Assange’s lawyers, Barry Pollack, expected his client would continue vocal campaigning.</p><p>“WikiLeaks’s work will continue and Mr. Assange, I have no doubt, will be a continuing force for freedom of speech and transparency in government,” Pollack said.</p><p>Assange’s father John Shipton said ahead of his son’s arrival that he hoped that his first-born child was coming home to the “great beauty of ordinary life.”</p>
    

<p>“He will be able to spend quality time with his wife, Stella, and his two children, be able to walk up and down the beach and feel the sand through his toes in winter, that lovely chill,” Shipton said.</p><p>The plea deal required Assange to admit guilt to a single felony count but also permitted him to return to Australia without any time in an American prison. The judge sentenced him to the five years he’d already spent behind bars in the U.K. fighting extradition to the U.S. on an Espionage Act indictment that could have carried a lengthy prison sentence in the event of a conviction. He was holed up for seven years before that in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.</p><p>The conclusion enables both sides to claim a degree of satisfaction. </p><p>The Justice Department, facing a defendant who had already served substantial jail time, was able to resolve — without trial — a case that raised thorny legal issues and that might never have reached a jury at all given the plodding pace of the extradition process. Assange, for his part, signaled a begrudging contentment with the resolution, saying in court that though he believed the Espionage Act contradicted the First Amendment, he accepted the consequences of soliciting classified information from sources for publication.</p>
    

<p>The plea deal, disclosed Monday night in a sparsely detailed Justice Department letter, represents the latest — and presumably final — chapter in a court fight involving the eccentric Australian computer expert who has been celebrated by supporters as a transparency crusader but lambasted by national security hawks who insist that his conduct put lives at risks and strayed far beyond the bounds of traditional journalism duties.</p><p>Prosecutors alleged that Assange teamed with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to obtain the records, including by conspiring to crack a Defense Department computer password, and published them without regard to American national security. Names of human sources who provided information to U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan were among the details exposed, prosecutors have said.</p><p>The indictment was unsealed in 2019, but Assange’s legal woes long predated the criminal case and continued well past it.</p><p>Weeks after the release of the largest document cache in 2010, a Swedish prosecutor issued an arrest warrant for Assange based on one woman’s allegation of rape and another’s allegation of molestation. Assange has long maintained his innocence, and the investigation was later dropped.</p><p>He presented himself in 2012 to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he claimed asylum on the grounds of political persecution, and spent the following seven years in self-exile there, welcoming a parade of celebrity visitors and making periodic appearances from the building’s balcony to address supporters.</p><p>In 2019, his hosts revoked his asylum, allowing British police to arrest him. He remained locked up for the last five years while the Justice Department sought to extradite him, in a process that encountered skepticism from British judges who worried about how Assange would be treated by the U.S.</p><p>Ultimately, though, the resolution sparing Assange prison time in the U.S. contradicts years of ominous warnings by Assange and his supporters that the American criminal justice system would expose him to unduly harsh treatment, including potentially the death penalty — something prosecutors never sought.</p><p>Last month, Assange won the right to appeal an extradition order after his lawyers argued that the U.S. government provided “blatantly inadequate” assurances that he would have the same free speech protections as an American citizen if extradited from Britain.</p><p>His wife, Stella Assange, told the BBC from Australia that it had been “touch and go” over 72 hours whether the deal would go ahead but she felt “elated” at the news.</p><p>Assange on Monday had left the London prison where he has spent the last five years after being granted bail during a secret hearing last week. </p><h2>___</h2><p>McGuirk reported from Melbourne, Australia.

The trial is over and it is left to jurors to decide Read’s fate.</p><p>While today is reserved for deliberation, Judge Beverly Cannone did hold intermittent court sessions to answer juror questions and hear attorney arguments.</p><p>Cannone agreed to introduce clarifying language to and create a new juror slip after the defense raised a concern that the slip was confusing to the point of being appealable. Cannone disagreed that the form was improper but ultimately made the requested changes.</p><h4>Scenes from the watch</h4><p>Judge Cannone had a brief yet testy direct interaction with Read at around 10:10 a.m. Wednesday following an argument by defense attorney Alan Jackson asking that the verdict forms be redesigned.</p><cnx class="cnx-main-container cnx-in-desktop cnx-ps cnx-main-container-flex" id="4e11a9ab3cf94a60ad0b3b48c6193d54"><cnx class="cnx-player-wrapper cnx-size-responsive"><cnx class="cnx-ratio"></cnx><cnx class="cnx-playspace-container cnx-in-ps-landscape cnx-bp-md-st cnx-close-hover cnx-close-float-off cnx-bp-xl-v"><cnx class="cnx-ui cnx-ui-ad cnx-is-paused cnx-mod-display-none"><cnx class="cnx-ui-ad-content "><cnx class="cnx-ad-marker" role="img" aria-label="Ad"><cnx class="cnx-marker-cnt-first"><cnx class="cnx-marker-cnt-second"><cnx class="cnx-ad-marker-svg"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 32 22"><path d="M26,22H0V0H31.93L32,16A6,6,0,0,1,26,22Z"></path><path d="M12,5.29h0L16.45,16.7H14.83l-1.06-2.85H8.86l-1,2.85H6.21L10.6,5.31h0Zm5.89,11.42V5.29h3.63A5.52,5.52,0,0,1,26.65,11a5.33,5.33,0,0,1-4.93,5.7H17.89Zm1.46-1.36h2.17c1.77,0,3.7-1.49,3.7-4.35s-1.93-4.28-3.7-4.28H19.35Zm-8-8.16-2,5.24h3.86Z"></path></svg>

“not guilty” to subordinate charge options as being wrong and then her attention seemed to shift to the defendant.</p><p>Then Cannone looked at the defendant.</p><p>“Excuse me. This is funny, Ms. Read?” Cannone said sharply. “Ok. We’re done.”</p><p>The court also answered a question from the jury this morning.</p><p>The jurors told the court they want to be released at 4 p.m. today, she said, with one stressing a long-held scheduling conflict.</p><p>That question could point toward the jury being unlikely to deliver a verdict today.</p><h4>The outcome for Read</h4><p>“I love my daughter. Immensely,” Read’s father William Read told the Herald in brief comments outside the courthouse Tuesday after the jury was dismissed for the day without a verdict. When another reporter asked if he was hoping for a good outcome, he said, “Better be.”</p><p>Cannone instructed the jury on the charges before handing the case off to them on Tuesday.</p><p>As the Herald reported at the time, jurors can find Read, 44, innocent or guilty on the following charges:</p><p>Second-degree murder. Read is guilty if the jurors find that she both caused O’Keefe’s death and had intent in some way to do so. Cannone said intent could be purposeful murder, purposeful intent for grievous injury causing his death or that the defendant acted in such a way that a reasonable person would know their actions could cause death.</p><p>Manslaughter while operating under the influence. Read is guilty if jurors found that she operated a motor vehicle on a public way while under the influence of an “intoxicating liquor” with a blood alcohol content of 0.08 or higher and that her actions transcended negligence into recklessness. Recklessness would be knowing the actions could cause injury but doing them anyway, or that the actions were not accidental and resulted in death but not necessarily intended.</p><p>Then there are lesser included offenses of involuntary manslaughter and motor vehicle homicide. Both are that Read caused O’Keefe’s death, with the first being that she intended the action that caused his death and that her conduct was wanton or reckless and the second where she operated a motor vehicle drunkenly and negligently but that intent does not matter.</p><p>The final indicted charge is leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death. The jury can find Read guilty if they find that she operated a motor vehicle on a public way, knowingly struck O’Keefe, caused his death and then failed to stop and deal with the legal consequences, if any, or to avoid prosecution.</p><p><strong>Verdict form</strong></p><p>Jackson complained that the verdict form doesn’t allow jurors to check a box marked “not guilty” for the two subordinate charges. Cannone said that is the way verdict forms in Massachusetts always are and that’s “the way it is.”</p><p>“Apparently that’s how it’s going to be because of the court’s ruling. That is not as it should be and it’s over our strong objection,” Jackson said. “They need to see there is a ‘not guilty’ option for the subordinate charges. If they come back ‘guilty’ on, for instance, involuntary manslaughter, that’s immediately appealable. They didn’t have an option on the verdict form to find her not guilty. It’s almost like the court is directing a verdict to the subordinate charges.”</p><p>Cannone responded, “Ok. I disagree with you.”</p><p>The topic was addressed again at around 11:50 a.m., when Cannone agreed to some changes regarding the second indicted charge of “Manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence of liquor” and two lesser included offenses.</p><p>Jurors are first to consider the primary offense, Cannone said, and if they find the prosecution failed to prove all its elements, then they are to consider the two lesser offenses of “Involuntary manslaughter” and then “Motor vehicle homicide” in descending order.</p><p>She said she would also make the “Not guilty” line on that primary account say “Not guilty of offense charged or any included lesser offense,” instead of how it was originally written as “Not guilty of offense charged.”</p><p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p><div class="article-slideshow"><button class="icon-close" aria-label="Close fullscreen slideshow"></button><ul data-total="40" class="slick-initialized slick-slider"><button class="slick-prev slick-arrow" aria-label="Previous" type="button"></button><div class="slick-list draggable"><div class="slick-track"><li data-index="40" class="slick-slide slick-cloned" data-slick-index="-1" id="" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><div class="image-wrapper"><img alt="Karen Read, center, arrives at Norfolk Superior Court with her..." class="lazyload size-article_inline" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24177501167081.jpg?w=620" data-srcset="https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24177501167081.jpg?w=620 620w,https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24177501167081.jpg?w=780 780w,https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24177501167081.jpg?w=810 810w,https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24177501167081.jpg?w=1280 1280w,https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24177501167081.jpg?w=1860 1860w"><p class="slide-credit"></p><p class="slide-caption">Karen Read, center, arrives at Norfolk Superior Court with her father William Read, left, Tuesday in Dedham.

<ol>
<li><strong>House collapse into river</strong>: A house owned by the Barnes family near Mankato, Minnesota, collapsed into the flood-swollen Blue Earth River on Tuesday night, just a day after the Rapidan Dam's west abutment failed, sending the river around the dam and eroding the riverbank.</li>

<p>Jessica Keech and her 11-year-old son watched part of the house fall into the river Tuesday night. They had often visited the area to see the dam and enjoy homemade pie from the Dam Store.</p>



<p>“It just kind of sucked it into the water. Just literally disappeared,” said Keech, of nearby New Ulm. “You didn’t see it go down the river at all. You didn’t see pieces of it anywhere.”</p><p>Blue Earth County officials said Wednesday that there were dramatic changes around the dam overnight, with the river cutting more widely and deeply into the bank, and they are concerned about the integrity of a nearby bridge over the river. After the flooding subsides, the county will be faced with deciding whether to make repairs to the dam or possibly remove it — with both options costing millions of dollars.</p>
    
<p>President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to discuss the severe flooding and the impacts to the Rapidan dam. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is already on the ground and Biden reiterated that his administration stands ready to provide additional support as needed, White House officials said.</p>
    

<p>A swath through Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota and Minnesota has been under siege from flooding because of torrential rains since last week, while also suffering through <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/heat-severe-weather-tornadoes-45e54e79787626291194be620bb67e10">a scorching heat wave.</a></span> Up to 18 inches (46 centimeters) of rain have fallen in some areas, pushing some rivers to record levels. Hundreds of people were rescued, homes were damaged and at least two people died after driving in flooded areas. </p><p>Tornado warnings, flash flooding and large hail Tuesday night added insult to injury for some Midwesterners. The National Weather Service said several tornadoes were reported in Iowa and Nebraska. The service was assessing damage to some buildings, crops and trees to confirm whether tornadoes touched down. No major injuries were reported.</p><p>The weather service also extended flood warnings for multiple rivers in the region. On Tuesday, floodwaters breached levees in Iowa, creating dangerous conditions that prompted evacuations.</p><p>Preliminary information from the weather service shows the recent flooding brought record-high river levels at more than a dozen locations in South Dakota and Iowa, surpassing previous crests by an average of about 3.5 feet (0.5 meters). The Big Sioux River reached nearly 41 feet (12 meters) in Hawarden, Iowa, on Saturday and nearly 45 feet (14 meters) in Sioux City, Iowa, on Monday, exceeding previous highs by 5 to 7 feet (1.5 to 2.1 meters), respectively.</p>
    

<p>In southeastern South Dakota, residents of Canton were cleaning up after getting 18 to 20 inches (46 to 51 centimeters) of rain in just 36 hours last week. A creek beside the 20 acres (8 hectares) owned by Lori Lems and her husband flooded the playground they’d built in their backyard for their grandchildren.</p><p>Lems, a 62-year-old former convenience store and wedding venue owner, said she’s lived in the town of 3,200 people all her life and never saw rain as intense as last week’s.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

<p>Farther south, in North Sioux City, South Dakota, flooding collapsed utility poles and trees, and some homes were washed off their foundations. There was no water, sewer, gas or electrical service in that area, Union County Emergency Management said Tuesday in a Facebook post.</p><p>South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said in a social media post Tuesday night that people needed to stay out of the area unless escorted by public safety officials.</p><p>In the Sioux City, Iowa, area, water spilled over the Big Sioux River levee, damaging hundreds of homes, officials estimated. And the local wastewater treatment plant has been so overwhelmed by the floodwaters that officials say they’re having to dump about a million gallons (3.8 million liters) of untreated sewage per day into the Missouri River.</p><p>Numerous roads were closed because of the flooding, including Interstates 29 and 680 in Iowa near the Nebraska line.</p>
    

<p>To the east in Iowa, towns were bracing for floodwaters. The west fork of the Des Moines River was expected to crest at nearly 17 feet (5 meters) in Humboldt overnight into Thursday. About 200 homes and 60 businesses in Humboldt could be affected, and about 68,000 sandbags have been deployed, officials said.</p><p>In the coming days, southeastern Nebraska and northwestern Missouri are expected to start to see the downstream effects of devastating flooding in South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. Many streams and rivers may not crest until later this week. The Missouri will crest at Omaha on Thursday, said Kevin Low, a weather service hydrologist. </p><h2>___</h2><div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth="">

<ol>
<li><strong>5 charged with jury bribery</strong>: The U.S. Attorney's Office and FBI announced charges against five individuals in connection with the jury bribery case related to the Feeding Our Future trial. Each defendant has been charged with conspiracy to bribe a juror, bribery of a juror, and corruptly influencing a juror.</li>

<li><strong>Bribery attempt was significant</strong>: A juror was dismissed in the sixth week of the trial after she reported that a woman showed up at her home with a bag of $120,000 in cash and offered her more money if she voted to acquit the defendants.</li>
<li><strong>Charges are novel in Minnesota</strong>: Luger stated that some of the charges against the defendants had never before been charged in Minnesota.</li>
<li><strong>Conspiracy was designed to corrupt the jury</strong>: Luger described the defendants' actions as a "chilling attack on our justice system," stating that they sought to buy a juror and use her to infiltrate the jury with their own false arguments, ignoring evidence and law.</li>

Many of the arguments were designed to allege the prosecution was motivated by racism.</p><p>The note also contained the phrase, “You alone can end this case,” Luger said.</p><p>Prosecutors allege that Ladan Ali, recruited by Nur, was the woman who dropped off the bag of cash at Juror 52’s home.

Ali gave the bag of $120,000 to a relative of the juror and explained the money was a gift in exchange for a not guilty verdict, court officials state. Ali said there would be more money if Juror 52 voted to acquit the defendants.</p><p>Prosecutors state Abdulkarim Farah stayed in the car and took a video of the interaction, later sending it to the co-conspirators using an encrypted messaging app.</p><p>Juror 52 called authorities when she found out about the bribery attempt.</p><p>“We sometimes ask ourselves[…] whether one person can actually make a difference. It doesn’t take much,” Luger commented. “Juror 52 gave us a clear example of how to do it. On Sunday night, June 2, Juror 52 refused a bribe and called authorities, and she made a difference.”</p><p>The judge ordered the defendants to surrender their phones to law enforcement on June 3. Abdiaziz Farah, Nur and Said Farah deleted evidence from their phones, court officials said.</p><p>However, investigators found a “blueprint” for Juror 52 on how to win an acquittal was found on Nur’s phone, Luger said.</p><p>The next day, June 4, <a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/another-juror-dismissed-as-feeding-our-future-deliberations-get-underway/" data-mrf-link="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/another-juror-dismissed-as-feeding-our-future-deliberations-get-underway/" cmp-ltrk="Article details" cmp-ltrk-idx="1" mrfobservableid="ee7be71a-9e92-4dce-8fc0-5d54a08e4cd7">a second juror was dismissed</a>.

    <div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On Wednesday night, on a debate stage built in an atrium at Nottingham Trent University, the two men who want to lead the country will face each other directly for the last time in this election campaign.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">As Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer go head-to-head, I’ll be chairing the 75-minute debate, aiming to get voters’ questions answered - and as fully as possible.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">I see the role as a privilege, but I know it won’t be easy and there have been times I’ve wished someone else was at the helm and I could watch from my sofa. But those moments pass.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">These events come around rarely and have a very special quality - at their heart is democracy unfiltered, where people can speak directly to those who have power and those who seek it.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">With millions of others watching, listening, and forming judgements, it can be an unforgiving spotlight for the leaders. But with little more than a week to polling day, the stakes are high and they have to be up to that scrutiny.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">I’ve done two seven-way leaders’ debates before, in 2017 and earlier this month. Each time there are different complexities, and while you prepare by honing your knowledge of each party’s key policies - and their points of difference - you also want spontaneity and energy. A proper debate, really, rather than speech-making.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The live audiences are chosen by the pollsters Savanta, not the BBC, and for this Prime Ministerial Debate they’ll include Conservative and Labour supporters as well as undecided voters. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">We will say this at the beginning of the programme, for maximum transparency, and also explain why the two men are standing where they are and the order in which they will deliver their closing thoughts. Spoiler - it’s a coin toss.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">You can watch the debate <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m001zzb0/election-2024" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">live on BBC iPlayer</a> and on BBC One, tonight, Wednesday 26 June at 20:15 BST.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"></p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">More details on how to follow the debate, as well as future and past debates from this campaign, <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c722nv38j88o" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">can be found here.</a></p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Once we’re into the flow, the debate will run straight through, for an hour and a quarter. Where necessary, I will be nudging the two men back to what was in the question, clarifying points, and yes, probably having to call a halt from time to time.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">I can’t predict how the overall tone will be, because that depends on the debaters, for whom these 75 minutes carry both opportunity and risk. They will not know what questions are coming, and the experience will be exacting and possibly, exposing. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But it is also a route through which they can reach millions of people - some of them yet to decide how they will cast their vote.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Politics is subject to intense scrutiny</strong>: Public life involves being open to examination by reporters, which can lead to the revelation of human fallibility, and ultimately, to help inform the public's judgment.</li>
<li><strong>Judgement is at the heart of the issue</strong>: The article highlights that the revelations about alleged betting may also reveal something about the judgement of those in senior roles, in office or seeking office, and how they respond to the situation.</li>
<li><strong>There are many unknowns</strong>: Despite extensive reporting, there are still many unanswered questions, including whether bets were made, how much was bet, and what the person placing the bet knew about election timing.</li>
<li><strong>Leaders must respond to allegations</strong>: Party leaders are under scrutiny, and their response to the allegations will be judged by the public. The article notes that Labour's relatively swift response in disowning their candidate who made a bet may be seen as a contrast to the Tories' response.</li>
<li><strong>The fallout may have unintended consequences</strong>: The article warns that leaders' actions can create awkward precedents and hostages to fortune, potentially leading to further scrutiny and questions about others who may have engaged in similar behavior.</li>
