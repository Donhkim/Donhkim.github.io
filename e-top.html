    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count of illegally obtaining and disclosing national security material in exchange for his release from a British prison.</li>
<li>The plea deal will end Assange's long-standing standoff with the US government, which had been seeking his extradition to the US mainland.</li>
<li>Assange, 52, will appear before a federal judge in Saipan, the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, which is a remote US commonwealth in the Pacific Ocean.</li>
<li>The Saipan court is considered a more remote and less intimidating location for Assange, who has expressed his desire to avoid extradition to the US mainland.</li>
<li>The deal implies that Assange will serve his sentence, likely in a British prison, rather than being extradited to the US to face charges.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Judge Aileen Cannon held a two-hour hearing</strong> with Donal Trump's legal team, focusing on the funding of the Justice Department's investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents.</li>
<li><strong>The judge questioned the Justice Department's spending</strong> on the investigation, asking how much money had been allocated and when the next financial disclosure would be due. The department is overdue for a disclosure that would cover the period from last fall to this March.</li>
<li><strong>Cannon sought guidance on explaining the laws and regulations</strong> governing past special prosecutors, including the Watergate era and Janet Reno's tenure as attorney general. This suggests she is trying to understand the legal framework for investigating and prosecuting former presidents.</li>
<li><strong>Trump's team is trying to invalidate the case against him</strong> by arguing that the investigation is flawed or that the special master appointed to review the documents is biased. Cannon's questions may be aimed at exploring these claims.</li>
<li><strong>The judge's questions were pointed and focused</strong>, with Pearce, the Justice Department attorney, responding that courts have been overturned in the past when they invalidated government functions in a way that resembled Cannon's inquiry. This suggests that Cannon may be weighing the legal implications of her actions.</li>

            Judge Aileen Cannon’s two-hour hearing Monday morning for Donald Trump’s criminal case on classified documents became a close read of past special prosecutors and their funding, in the latest attempt from Trump’s team to invalidate the case against him.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_D35D66A5-1F4A-4560-ABD1-BE349E96D64B@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Here are key things to know: 
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_616B9EBD-0B57-4B90-B1A4-82A3E3B59913@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            <strong>Tough questions for Justice Department: </strong>Though the judge was careful to say her questions shouldn’t imply she was leaning one way, Cannon pushed Justice Department attorney James Pearce to explain how much money the department has used for its work in the Trump criminal cases. 
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_5D6AE470-91CA-4052-9FCD-188FDD9DE3BC@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The judge noted that even if the office discloses its spending publicly every six months, a financial disclosure that would encompass last fall through this March was overdue.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_DBCA11A9-1042-48A4-8B70-40D4144CE769@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            She also sought from prosecutors guidance on explaining the laws and regulations that governed past special prosecutors, at one point bringing up Watergate and the era of Janet Reno as attorney general.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_8A4B19C3-2771-42EB-BD2B-058542D389F7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Cannon’s questions were so pointed toward Pearce, at one point the prosecutor mentioned how other courts have been overturned if they invalidated a government function in the way Cannon was probing, and said he hoped the Justice Department could provide additional written argument to the court if invalidating Smith was a serious possibility.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_DB9A28E0-B748-4D63-B0BA-E30913FC98AE@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            <strong>Should Congress be more involved? </strong>Trump is also aiming to bring Congress into the conversation. Trump attorney Emil Bove advocated at Monday’s hearing that Cannon should insist on more congressional oversight of the special counsel’s office’s work, or decide that the way the office is funded is unlawful because, he says, the money is being used in a way Congress hadn’t authorized.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_CD72D561-064F-4177-9E45-D36AFD55E4E5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The argument is in line with other arguments the Trump team has made to the judge in recent days alleging Smith is too independent from Justice Department leadership. Bove also told the judge more congressional oversight would curb what he called “extraordinary things” that were happening in the documents case.​
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_B50C5B02-406A-44B3-AE27-EA6E2BAEC695@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Justice Department attorneys have responded in court that the special counsel operates in line with established policies, in place over several decades and administrations, and that the DOJ is committed to continuing to fund this prosecution of Trump under the attorney general’s authorization. Republicans on Capitol Hill have also tried to buckle down on the DOJ’s use of the special counsel’s office and its funding.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_9A7F2D92-8D0C-4EEE-A084-C2212CE75E80@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            <strong>Delay, delay, delay: </strong>As the case proceeds, slowly, Trump’s lawyers are using every opportunity they spot in recent weeks to request additional hearings and oversight—suggesting as much to Cannon at a hearing on Friday and again on Monday morning.

<ol>
<li>
<p>A protest against the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza turned violent on Sunday outside a synagogue in Los Angeles, leading to arrests and prompting a strong condemnation from President Joe Biden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The protest, which was attended by pro-Palestinian demonstrators and counter-protesters, erupted into brawling and police were called in to break it up. One arrest was made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass strongly condemned the violence, calling it "abhorrent" and blocking access to a place of worship "unacceptable". She has also asked the police to provide additional patrols in the Pico-Robertson neighborhood and around houses of worship citywide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Councilwoman Katy Yaroslavsky, who represents the area, described the violence as "antisemitic" and expressed concern that it had happened in front of a synagogue in the heart of the Jewish community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The violence was sparked by the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which began on October 7 after Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 people hostage in southern Israel. The war has resulted in the deaths of over 37,000 Palestinians and has displaced most of the population in Gaza.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Attack in Dagestan</strong>: A brutal attack took place in the city of Derbent, Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim republic in Russia's North Caucasus region, on Trinity Sunday, a significant holiday in the Orthodox calendar.</li>
<li><strong>Christian Priest Targeted</strong>: The attack targeted Father Nikolai, a 66-year-old priest, who was in church at the time. The exact motive behind the attack is not known, but it is believed to have been a targeted killing of a Christian cleric.</li>
<li><strong>Intentional Attack</strong>: The FBI has classified the attack as a premeditated and intentional attack on a specific individual, Father Nikolai, rather than a random act of violence. The attack has been linked to religious tensions in the region.</li>
<li><strong>Regional Tensions</strong>: Dagestan is a region with a complex religious landscape, where Christianity, Islam, and Judaism coexist. This has created tensions in the past, and the attack is seen as a manifestation of these deeply ingrained issues.</li>
<li><strong>Russian Government Response</strong>: The Russian government has accused Ukraine of orchestrating the attack, despite the lack of evidence linking Ukraine to the incident. The government has also downplayed the religious tensions in the region, with the head of the Dagestan regional administration visiting the scene of the attack and embracing a priest, in an effort to show unity and stability.</li>

<p>After days of silence, Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao spoke out today in City Hall with an unequivocal message: “I have done nothing wrong.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you with confidence this investigation is not about me,” Thao told reporters at a packed press conference on Monday. “I have not been charged with a crime and I am confident I will not be charged with a crime because I am innocent.”</p>

<p>Last Thursday, <a href="https://oaklandside.org/2024/06/20/fbi-raids-home-of-oakland-mayor-sheng-thao/">FBI agents raided the home</a> of Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao, as well as the homes of David Duong and Andy Duong, the owners of the city’s recycling contractor <a href="https://oaklandside.org/2024/06/20/fbi-search-oakland-mayor-sheng-thao-andy-duong/">California Waste Solutions</a>. The FBI hasn’t said anything about why it carried out these searches. </p>


<p>In a 10-minute speech in which the mayor’s tone alternated from outrage to anger and determination, Thao said she was not given the opportunity to cooperate voluntarily with federal investigators, and that she is seeking answers from the US Attorney’s Office to learn why her home was raided. She promised to share information with the public as she receives it.</p>

<p>Thao aggressively questioned the timing of the raid, which occurred just days after a recall campaign targeting her <a href="https://oaklandside.org/2024/06/18/oakland-mayor-sheng-thao-recall-election/#:~:text=Oaklanders%20will%20decide%20whether%20to,%2C%202024%2C%204%3A17%20p.m.">qualified for the ballot</a> and she criticized the recall as a vehicle for “rightwing radical forces” who are trying to undermine progressive causes and leaders in the East Bay.  </p>

<p>“I want to know more about the handful of billionaires from San Francisco and Piedmont who are hellbent on running me out of office,” Thao said.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls="" src="https://oaklandside.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/medium-Thao-video.mov"></video></figure>

<p>Thao also called out former elected officials who she said have amassed campaign finance violations but will never face a door-knock raid. Her comment appeared to be a reference to an <a href="https://oaklandside.org/2024/06/12/former-oakland-mayor-libby-schaaf-orton-ethics-penalty/">ongoing Public Ethics Commission investigation</a> focused on former Mayor Libby Schaaf. <br><br>Thao said she initially believed FBI agents were barging into her house to protect her family. Thao said the leaders of the recall targeting her “empowered a dangerous man with a history of assault weapons violations to further attack me and my family.”<br><br>Thao claimed that the way she was treated last week by federal law enforcement is reserved for people like herself, who were “born poor in America” and experience injustice “in every bone of your body.”</p>

<p>“Well guess what? I’m not going down like that. We’re not going down like that,” Thao said. “I will not be bullied and will not be disparaged and I will not be threatened out of this office.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-thao-addresses-the-mass-shooting-that-wounded-15-at-lake-merritt">Thao addresses the mass shooting that wounded 15 at Lake Merritt</h2>
<p>The mayor said the FBI will not derail her plans for the city. She said Oakland is working hard to hold the people accountable for the <a href="https://oaklandside.org/2024/06/20/shooting-lake-merritt-oakland-juneteenth-celebration/">mass shooting</a> that happened at the Juneteenth festival near Lake Merritt on Wednesday. Thao said she will remain focused on having City Council complete the <a href="https://oaklandside.org/2024/05/22/oakland-to-sell-coliseum-aaseg-sheng-thao-budget/">sale of the city’s half of the Coliseum</a>, and <a href="https://oaklandside.org/2024/05/30/oakland-mayor-sheng-thao-budget-cuts-city-council-public-safety/">approving the annual budget</a> later this week.</p>

<p>She left the press conference without taking questions. Thao’s Chief of Staff Leigh Hanson said the mayor was following the advice of her attorney. Last week <a href="https://oaklandside.org/2024/06/21/oakland-mayor-sheng-thao-attorney-tony-brass-fbi/">Thao’s attorney Tony Brass</a> said he has no information that Thao is or will be the target of any investigation. </p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the overturning of a federally guaranteed right to abortion. He nominated three of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v.

<p>Nearly two-thirds of Americans said abortion should be legal in at least some cases, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/June-2023-AP-NORC-Topline-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to an AP-NORC poll</a></span> conducted last summer. The survey also found that 6 in 10 U.S. adults thought Congress should pass a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide.</p>
    

<p>Support for legal abortion was particularly high in situations where the pregnant individual’s own health was seriously endangered by the pregnancy. In the poll, more than 8 in 10 Americans said an abortion under those circumstances should be permitted in their state. Support for legal abortion early in pregnancy was also high, with about three-quarters saying it should be allowed in their state at that point.</p><p>Other Democratic candidates running for office are also focusing their campaigns around reproductive rights and believe it will motivate voters in key swing states.</p><p>Jessica Mackler, president of Emily’s List, a group that supports Democratic women, referred Monday to the 2023 election win by Janet Protasiewicz, a liberal candidate for Wisconsin Supreme Court who made abortion rights a focus of her campaign, as an example of how the issue can be used to win.</p>
    

<p>“I know when we do this work we can win,” Mackler said at an event with Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is up for reelection.</p><p>“This isn’t a branding problem for Republicans. It’s an agenda problem. We can’t let them get away with it,” she said. </p><p>Dr. Kristin Lyerly, an obstetrician and gynecologist running for an open congressional seat in Wisconsin, said Monday that it’s an issue of freedom. </p><p>“People are concerned about the cost of gas and groceries,” Lyerly said on a conference call with reporters. “They do talk about the border, but the fundamental thing that they are concerned about is the ability to make their own personal health care decisions. This is an issue of freedom. It’s not a political issue for them. It’s existential.”</p><p>Lyerly performed abortions across Wisconsin but temporarily moved her practice to Minnesota after the Supreme Court’s ruling. She was among those who brought a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-wisconsin-ban-appeal-00e04a5e90931891afd2e0adcd0bcbca">successful lawsuit</a></span> challenging the state’s abortion ban.</p><p>The White House is also detailing its policy efforts to protect access to abortion, contraception access and the right to travel for medical care, as it awaits another high-court decision expected sometime this month that will affect how <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-idaho-emergency-care-000a2482fdd1f1299599c91a6cc7635a">women receive emergency medical care</a></span>.</p>
    

<p>“The overturning of Roe has been devastating for women across the country,” said Jennifer Klein, a White House adviser on reproductive health. </p><p>Klein said the administration is already working to implement three executive orders by Biden aimed at protecting access where able, guarding contraceptive care and privacy rights, and expanding health care.

<li>A group of Louisiana parents and civil rights organizations have filed a lawsuit against the state's new law, which requires all public classrooms to display the Ten Commandments.</li>

<li>The lawsuit contends that the law violates both US Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment, arguing that the mandated posting of the Ten Commandments renders them "unavoidable" and "unconstitutionally pressures students into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state's favored religious scripture."</li>
<li>The lawsuit has argued that the law unfairly promotes Christianity and cannot be justified by any important government interest.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>President Biden and his team are preparing for multiple scenarios at the upcoming CNN presidential debate</strong>: They are preparing for different versions of Donald Trump, including a "very disciplined" version that may not be as unruly as he was during the first debate in 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Biden campaign believes Trump's campaign has been more disciplined this time around</strong>: Advisors think that Trump's presidential campaign has been far more disciplined than in 2020 or 2016, due in part to the influence of political operatives Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>This may result in Trump being relatively restrained at the debate</strong>: The Biden campaign is anticipating that Trump may be more composed during the debate, which could make it easier for the moderator to keep the discussion under control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>However, Biden's co-chair Mitch Landrieu says it doesn't matter how Trump shows up</strong>: Landrieu believes that the outcome of the debate will not be affected by whether Trump is "unhinged" or "quiet".</p>

<p><strong>Biden's team has been hunkered down at Camp David for intense debate preparations</strong>: The President and his team have been preparing intensively for the debate over the weekend, with a focus on getting ready to respond to different versions of Trump.</p>

            President Joe Biden and his team of advisers have been hunkered down at Camp David through the weekend for intensive debate preparations – including getting ready for different versions of Donald Trump that could show up to the CNN presidential debate Thursday night.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_9AC44E3C-4454-4F73-9DCF-EACC973A5306@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Biden aides are gearing up for what they believe is the very real possibility that “a very disciplined” Trump may step on to the debate stage this week, one senior adviser involved in the preparations told CNN, in what would mark a stark contrast from the unhinged former president that created chaos during the first Biden-Trump debate four years ago.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_279DD9DA-9D63-4A22-B8FC-9C7CD461B1E9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            In that face-off in September 2020, Trump memorably unleashed a torrent of insults, interruptions and long-winded rambling answers that made it, at times, nearly impossible for the moderator to keep the debate under control.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_2F928C2C-955D-45FE-AF6F-AC25E8796A65@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            But as this one Biden adviser put it, the president’s team believes that Trump’s presidential campaign has been far more disciplined this time around than in 2020 or 2016, in no small part at the direction of political operatives like Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, and that that could result in Trump being relatively restrained on Thursday. 
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_41CB22EE-8F1A-493E-95B1-B67CFEC1F172@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Still, Biden campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu said on “Meet the Press” Sunday that ultimately “it really doesn’t matter how Donald Trump shows up – if he comes in unhinged, like he is most of the time, or he sits there and is quiet.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_78103232-EC11-473A-8E40-0664E2B6051D@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “People are going to know that he’s a twice-impeached, convicted felon who has been found to have defamed somebody, sexually abused somebody and gone bankrupt six times,” Landrieu said. “They will always know that.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_B6804E64-F024-45C0-A615-A5B8C8FBC83C@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            CNN has reported that Biden’s personal attorney Bob Bauer is likely to reprise his role of Trump in mock debate sessions at Camp David this week. Bauer, who has repeatedly declined to comment on the strategy behind this year’s debate prep, did say on CNN last week that playing the role of Trump was about striking a balance between “trying to approximate the experience” of facing off against the ex-president, but also not letting “theatrics” become a distraction. 
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_073B6340-68B6-471A-ADAC-A9D1FAEADE0E@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Aides who were involved in debate preparations four years ago credited Bauer for having a knack for capturing what the team back then anticipated would be an implacable Trump on the debate stage.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_3EABAEC2-1EF6-477B-A708-5599198CCE22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “What he was excellent at was mimicking Trump’s relentlessness,” former White House communications director Kate Bedingfield recalled.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_E5F55320-A3FB-4A84-94CE-DB5FD5A041F2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            <strong>And there is one detail about Thursday night’s debate that the Biden team is glad about:</strong> the two campaigns agreeing that a candidate’s mic would be muted whenever it is not their turn to speak. The senior Biden adviser said that voters made clear after the first chaotic debate between Biden and Trump in 2020 that “their interests had not been served.” There was simply too much interrupting and yelling, the adviser said, and ultimately, the chaos meant voters were not able to hear clearly from both candidates. 
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_2D587776-9F55-44E6-AB80-775A244E2024@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Clearly showcasing that contrast between Biden and Trump on everything from policy issues to broader vision for the country, is a top priority for the Biden campaign for this week. At the end of the night, the president’s campaign wants the audience to have seen a divisive and chaotic Trump – and standing next to him, a steadier and wiser Biden. 
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_BF9C2209-AF47-44D0-9562-E27510D76647@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The Biden team is hoping that the muted mics might help to demonstrate that.

The cause of Anne’s injuries wasn’t clear, but doctors said her injuries were consistent with an impact from a horse’s head or legs.</p><p>“The king has been kept closely informed and joins the whole royal family in sending his fondest love and well-wishes to the princess for a speedy recovery,” the palace said in a statement.</p>
    

<p>The accident is just the latest health scare to hit the House of Windsor in recent months, with both Charles and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-royals-kate-health-255a3da40725ba9fc702a9a4ccce470f">Prince William’s wife, Kate</a></span>, undergoing treatment for cancer. That has strained the royal family’s ability to keep up a full slate of public appearances, with Anne and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/camilla-the-queen-consort">Queen Camilla</a></span> taking on more engagements as Charles and Kate took time off to focus on their health.</p>



<p>Anne, in particular, will be missed as she was the hardest working member of the royal family last year.</p><p>While she doesn’t have the status of Charles or the glamor of William and Kate, Anne is known for her businesslike approach to a busy schedule of public appearances. Anne took part in 457 royal engagements last year, compared with 425 for the king, 172 for William and 123 for Kate, according to statistics compiled by the Daily Telegraph newspaper.</p>
    
<p>As a result of her injuries, Anne was forced to cancel her appearance at a state dinner in the honor of the emperor of Japan on Tuesday, as well as a trip to Canada planned for later in the week.</p>
    

<p>“There will definitely be a sort of gap in the royal family lineup for the next few days,” royal expert Robert Hardman told the BBC. “But you know, obviously she’s got to get well.”</p><p>Anne has earned her status as a royal family stalwart through decades of work carrying out the awards presentations, ceremonial appearances and building dedications that make up the modern royal whirl.</p><p>As president of the British Olympic committee and a member of the International Olympic Committee, Anne was instrumental in helping London win its bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and later brought her experience as an Olympic equestrian to the committee that organized the games.</p><p>Committee Chair Sebastian Coe praised her stamina, joking at one point that she had usually opened three hospitals by the time she showed up for the average midday board meeting.</p><p>“Crucially, she sees the world through the eyes of a competitor,” he said at the time.</p><p>Anne was herself a member of the British Olympic team in 1976, competing in the three-day equestrian event at the Montreal Games.</p><p>She remembers that experience fondly, even though she was thrown from her horse, Goodwill, when it became stuck in boggy mud. Anne remounted and finished the event, but later said she had almost no memory of the day.</p>
    

<p>“As far as I’m concerned, the lights went out,” she later said.</p><p>Anne has always been known to speak her mind – even in extreme situations, such as during a kidnapping attempt in 1974. When the assailant opened her car door and demanded she come with him, Ann demurred.</p><p>“I said I didn’t think I wanted to go,” she told an interviewer. “I was scrupulously polite. I thought, hmph, silly to be too rude at that stage.”</p><p>Even so, Britain’s powerful tabloids sometimes mock Anne’s unpretentious and businesslike clothing choices when they notice her at all.
