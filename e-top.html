            The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a political activist’s attempt to trademark the phrase “Trump Too Small,” saying the federal trademark office did not violate the First Amendment when it declined to register the mark.

            “Our courts have long recognized that trademarks containing names may be restricted. And these name restrictions served established principles. This history and tradition is sufficient to conclude that the names clause — a content-based, but viewpoint-neutral, trademark restriction — is compatible with the First Amendment,” Thomas wrote, referring to a provision of the federal trademark law at issue in the case.

            “We conclude that the names clause is of a piece with a common-law tradition regarding the trademarking of names,” he added later. “We see no reason to disturb this longstanding tradition, which supports the restriction of the use of another’s name in a trademark.”

            The dispute can be traced back to a memorable squabble between then-candidate Donald Trump and Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio during the 2016 Republican presidential primary, in which the senator joked about the size of Trump’s hands ahead of a debate and said, “You know what they say about men with small hands.”

            Trump shot back during the debate, stretching his hands out for the audience to see and insisting Rubio’s suggestion that “something else must be small” was false.

            Two years later, attorney Steve Elster sought to register “Trump Too Small” as a trademark for use on T-shirts. He said in his registration request that the proposed trademark aims to “convey that some features of President Trump and his policies are diminutive.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxdcgbrr000g3b6j82uv6jo0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “The mark criticizes Trump by using a double entendre, invoking a widely publicized exchange from a 2016 Republican primary debate in which Trump commented about his anatomy, while also expressing Elster’s view about ‘the smallness of Donald Trump’s overall approach to governing as president of the United States,’” attorneys for Elster told the justices in court papers.

            Federal law bars people from registering a trademark of a name of a living person without their consent. The US Patent and Trademark Office refused registration because the use of the name “Trump” would be construed by the public as a reference to the former president. The question for the Supreme Court was whether the prohibition could be squared with the First Amendment. Elster appealed to the USPTO’s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, which also refused registration. A federal appeals court, however, later held that the refusal violated Elster’s First Amendment rights.

            Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in a concurring opinion, said she agreed with the court’s decision but not its reasoning. Thomas relied heavily on the nation’s history and tradition with trademark law to settle the case. Barrett said it could have been dealt with based on the court’s past precedent.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxdd109l00063b6j07ku4h3v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “The government can reasonably determine that, on the whole, protecting marks that include another living person’s name without consent risks undermining the goals of trademark,” Barrett wrote, in an opinion that was joined in part by the court’s liberal wing. The bar on trademarking someone else’s name, she wrote, “is therefore constitutional, both facially and as applied” to this case.
    </p>

            Justice Sonia Sotomayor similarly wrote in a concurrence joined by the court’s other two liberals that she would have applied the court’s First Amendment precedent to decide the case. She said she was “reluctant” to go down the path chosen by Thomas and her other colleagues.
    </p>

            The provision of federal trademark law upheld in the case, Sotomayor wrote, “is constitutional because it is a viewpoint-neutral, reasonable limitation on a trademark’s registration.”
    </p>

            At oral arguments, the justices seemed inclined to side with the trademark office, with several raising doubts that Elster’s free speech rights had been trampled on by the agency. Nothing stopped Elster from making or selling the T-shirts.
    </p>

            “The question is: Is this an infringement on speech? And the answer is no,” Sotomayor said at one point. “There’s no limitation on him selling it. So there’s no traditional infringement.”
    </p>

            Thomas similarly posited that if Elster’s “argument is that somehow your speech is being impeded, I think it would be good to know precisely how it’s being impeded or burdened.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxdcgl1l000n3b6j5u5jl8ox@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            In two recent cases, the court bolstered First Amendment protections when it declined to back decisions by the USPTO to deny trademark registrations based on other parts of the Lanham Act.
    </p>

            In 2017, the court ruled in favor of Simon Tam, an Asian-American musician and political activist who named his rock band “The Slants” in an attempt to take back a term that once was directed as an insult. He sought to register the name with the trademark office but was turned away on the ground that it is disparaging to “persons of Asian descent.”

            Two years later, the justices struck down a provision of the Lanham Act that prohibited the agency from registering “immoral” or “scandalous” trademarks, clearing the way for a clothing designer to apply for a trademark for a clothing line called “FUCT.”

He had arrived at Miami International Airport at about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn’t get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight.</p>

He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. “Nothing against the (airport) employees — there is only so much they can do.”</p><p>So he used his phone to book an afternoon flight out of Fort Lauderdale. He took a shuttle the 20 miles north, only to find that flight had been canceled. He was now heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn’t get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry.</p>

<li><strong>The Makah Tribe has been granted permission</strong> to hunt up to 25 gray whales over the next decade, despite the United States largely outlawing whaling more than 50 years ago.</li>
<li><strong>The tribe has a long history of whaling</strong>: Whaling was enshrined as a right in an 1855 treaty, and the tribe is seeking to resume its whaling traditions, which are deemed important for the tribe's culture and welfare.</li>
<li><strong>The population of Eastern North Pacific gray whales has recovered</strong>: The species had been hunted to the edge of extinction, but has since made a comeback and was removed from the endangered species list in 1994.</li>
<li><strong>The tribe has been seeking permission for years</strong>: The makah tribe has been seeking approval to resume whaling for decades, and this decision is a crucial victory for them in their quest to revive their whaling traditions.</li>
<li><strong>The decision is significant for the tribe's culture</strong>: The tribe sees whaling as an important part of their heritage and culture, and the hunt will help to preserve their traditions and identity, which are under threat.</li>

            “We have been clear from the start that Evan has done nothing wrong. He should never have been arrested in the first place. Journalism is not a crime. The charges against him are false, and the Russian government knows that they’re false. He should be released immediately,” Miller said at a State Department briefing.

            In the year since his arrest, the 32-year-old journalist has been imprisoned in Moscow’s notorious Lefortovo Prison, and his pre-trial detention period had been extended numerous times.

            Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens said Gershkovich was likely to be moved from Lefortovo to Yekaterinburg – more than 800 miles away –before the end of June, and was then likely to stand trial in that city.

            “If it’s anything like what happened to Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan, Trevor Reed, there’ll be a period when he leaves Lefortovo where we won’t have any contact with him,” Carstens explained, referencing other Americans wrongfully detained in Russia.

            “It’ll almost be like it’s gone dark, but eventually, an American or I would say, a detainee surfaces in Yekaterinburg and we’ll have a chance to reestablish that connectivity from there,” Carstens said at a congressional hearing.

            “Russia’s latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous. Evan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job. Evan is a journalist. The Russian regime’s smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime.

            US Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy, speaking after Gershkovich’s pre-trial detention was extended in March, said: “Evan’s case is not about evidence, due process, or rule of law.

            Miller, the State Department spokesperson, reiterated on Thursday that the US would continue to pursue Gershkovich’s release, as well that of Whelan, a former US marine who was arrested in Moscow in 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges he and the US deny.

            Speaking in a lengthy and at times ponderous interview with American right-wing pundit Tucket Carlson in February, Putin alluded to the case of Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel from Russia’s domestic spy organization who was convicted of assassinating a former Chechen fighter in broad daylight in Berlin in 2019.

But none comes close to the $46 billion pay deal Tesla shareholders appear to be on the verge of handing over to CEO Elon Musk. </p><p>The results of the shareholder vote, which concludes today, will be announced on Thursday during Tesla's annual meeting, which will be livestreamed <a href="https://www.tesla.com/2024shareholdermeeting" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> at 4:30 p.m. Eastern. But Musk has <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-tesla-stockholders-56-billion-pay-package-wide-margins/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">already declared victory,</a></span> writing late Wednesday on his social media platform X that shareholders were voting to approve the pay package by "wide margins."</p><p>The pay package has become a lightning rod over executive pay, with some critics calling the package "<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-shareholders-advised-to-reject-elon-musk-56-billion-pay/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">excessive</a></span>." Supporters argue that such a deal is necessary to tether Musk to Tesla and ensure he doesn't decamp to start another business. Along with Tesla, the billionaire currently owns five additional businesses including X (formerly Twitter), Neurolink and SpaceX, the latter of which he is also CEO. </p>    
  <p>With Musk trumpeting his apparent win ahead of the final tally, shareholders sent the stock up 4% in Thursday morning trading, indicating that many view the pay package as essential to ensuring Musk's future at the company. </p><p>"It is a pop-the-champagne moment for Musk and Tesla shareholders," noted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives in a Thursday research note about the preliminary vote results. "[L]arge shareholders at the end of the day knew that voting no would risk Musk potentially eventually leaving as CEO." </p>

<p>Ives said he believes Musk is now likely to pledge to remain CEO of Tesla for another three to five years, given the apparent approval of his pay package. </p><h2>Why does the pay package need to be voted on?</h2><p>The vote on Musk's payout stems from a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-55-billion-pay-package-delaware-judge-ruling/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">court ruling</a></span> in January that struck down his previous pay deal, worth more almost $56 billion earlier this year. The value has since declined due to a slide in Tesla's share price. </p><p>That package, approved in 2018 by Tesla shareholders, sparked a shareholder lawsuit that accused Musk and Tesla's board of directors of breaching their duties and unjustly enriching the billionaire. A Delaware judge ruled that Musk and his his company failed to prove that the massive payout was fair.</p><p>Because that initial pay deal was struck down, Tesla <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-elon-musk/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">said in April</a></span> that it would once again take the issue to its shareholders, asking them to re-ratify the package. </p>

    </p>
<h2>How much does Musk earn from Tesla? </h2><p>Tesla hasn't paid Musk a base salary since 2019, according to the company's regulatory filings. Instead, his compensation has been paid through "performance awards" of stock options that are based on Tesla hitting certain milestones, such as vehicle production or increasing the company's market value. </p><p>After the pay package was struck down by the Delaware court, Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000110465924048040/tm2326076d13_pre14a-gen.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a> to shareholders that they should re-ratify the package as "Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value."</p><p>Denholm described the situation as "fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it."</p><p>However, Musk is hardly without financial resources: He owns almost 13% of Tesla shares, worth $73 billion. He also has stakes in SpaceX, worth $71 billion, and multiple other businesses, giving him a total net worth of $203 billion, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/elon-r-musk/?sref=sBMxP0gT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according</a> to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That makes him the world's third richest person.</p><h2>Why are some shareholders supporting the pay package? </h2><p>According to Ives, some shareholders are concerned that Musk might decamp for another business or start a rival company if he isn't richly rewarded for working at Tesla. That's a threat that Musk himself has issued, stating in a post on X in January that he <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-elon-musk-25-percent-control-ai-what-it-means/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">wanted 25% voting control </a></span>of Tesla or he might leave. </p><p>Tesla chairwoman Denholm echoed those sentiments, writing in a June shareholder letter, "If Tesla is to retain Elon's attention and motivate him to continue to devote his time, energy, ambition and vision to deliver comparable results in the future, we must stand by our deal."</p><h2>Are some shareholders voting against the pay deal?</h2><p>Yes, some shareholders have spoken publicly against the package, most notably the California's State Teachers Retirement System. </p>

    </p>
<p>The large pension fund said Tuesday that it would vote against Musk's pay "based on its sheer magnitude, and because the award would be extremely dilutive to shareholders. We also have concerns with the lack of focus on profitability for the company."</p><p>Tesla's top five institutional shareholders — Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, Geode Capital and Capital Research — either said they don't announce their votes or wouldn't comment. They control about 17% of the votes.</p><h2>How is Elon Musk's pay package structured?</h2><p>The pay deal is structured to deliver several rounds of stock options that will allow Musk to buy about 304 million shares of Tesla stock. Musk is able to receive each round of options after the company hits certain milestones — such as when Tesla reached a market value of $100 billion, and then at every $50 billion mark beyond that. (Currently, Tesla's market cap is about $580 billion.)</p><p>Based on today's stock price, the value of the pay package stands at about $46 billion. </p><p>The package also includes a requirement that Musk hold onto the shares for five years after he exercises the options, <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000110465924048040/tm2326076d13_pre14a-gen.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according</a> to regulatory filings.</p><h2>Do large payouts ensure better CEO performance? </h2><p>The underlying question of the debate over Musk's payout is whether such grandiose packages actually make a difference in CEO performance. In other words, do CEOs actually outperform when they are given larger-than-normal packages? And if they don't receive such jaw-dropping deals, do they underperform? </p><p>Generous CEO pay packages don't actually guarantee better results, according to a 2017 study from investment research firm MSCI.
