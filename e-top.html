    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The US Supreme Court has agreed to review a lawsuit challenging a Tennessee law that bans hormone therapy and puberty blockers for children under 18.</li>
<li>The law, which was enacted in 2023, is being challenged by three transgender teenagers, their parents, and a doctor, who argue that it violates the US constitutional guarantee of equal protection under the law by discriminating against them based on sex.</li>
<li>The Biden administration and several major US medical groups have joined the lawsuit, arguing that the law prohibits transgender individuals from accessing medically necessary treatments and violates parental rights to access necessary care for their children.</li>
<li>The lawsuit alleges that the law inflicts "profound harm" on transgender adolescents and their families by denying them "appropriate and necessary" treatment for a serious medical condition, and that the Supreme Court should step in to settle the dispute.</li>
<li>Lawyers for the state of Tennessee argue that the law is a reflection of the will of the state's elected lawmakers and addresses a pressing public concern, and that it ensures that minors do not receive hormone therapy and puberty blockers until they are old enough to fully understand the lifelong consequences or until the science is developed to address these issues.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Hamas released a video</strong> showing the kidnapping of three Israeli hostages, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Or Levy, and Eliya Cohen, on October 7. The video was released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.</li>
<li><strong>The kidnapping occurred shortly after</strong> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that Israel could strike a "partial deal" with Hamas to free some of the hostages, but not all of them.</li>
<li><strong>Hersh Goldberg-Polin was seriously injured</strong> during the blast that occurred while he and others were hiding from Hamas gunmen. He can be seen in the video with his face bloodied and what appears to be bone protruding from his left arm.</li>
<li><strong>Hamas had previously released a video</strong> of Goldberg-Polin in April, which was the first proof that he survived the blast. In the video, he criticized Netanyahu's government, as other Israeli hostages in Hamas propaganda videos have done.</li>
<li><strong>Goldberg-Polin has been held in Gaza</strong> for six months at the time the video was released.</li>

            The group representing Israel’s hostages and their families has released a video showing the kidnapping of three Israelis by Hamas on October 7, shortly after the group condemned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s <a href="https://cnn.com/2024/06/23/middleeast/intense-phase-hamas-war-end-netanyahu-lebanon-intl-latam/index.html">suggestion</a> that Israel could strike a “partial deal” with the militant group to free some, but not all, of the hostages.

            The video, released Monday evening by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, shows Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Or Levy and Eliya Cohen in the back of a pickup truck, being driven along a tree-lined road in southern Israel by militants wielding assault weapons. “Here are the dogs, here they are,” one of the gunmen can be heard saying.
    </p>

            Goldberg-Polin, an American-Israeli citizen then aged 23, can be seen with his face bloodied and what appears to be bone protruding from his left arm – blown off after a grenade was tossed into the bunker in which he and several others had been hiding from Hamas gunmen.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxt681ir000a3b6jkk2py9me@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Hamas released a video of Goldberg-Polin in April, the first proof that he survived the blast. In the video, he criticized Netanyahu’s government, as other Israeli hostages in Hamas propaganda videos have done. Held in Gaza for six months at the time, he was almost certainly speaking under duress.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxt4ohac00063b6jytghhz26@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The video was released a day after Netanyahu, in his first one-on-one interview with local Israeli media since October 7, said he was ready to make “a partial deal” with Hamas to return some hostages still being held captive in Gaza – an apparent softening of one of Israel’s war aims that drew a sharp rebuke from the hostages’ Forum, which has become a potent political force in Israel.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxt4ohac00083b6jk5xh2l8b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Netanyahu’s comments to Israel’s Channel 14 were at odds with the aims of a broader Israeli ceasefire proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden last month, which sets out conditions intended to release all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces.
    </p>

  


    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxt5i1mk00033b6j8fn078m6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “This harrowing footage stands as a damning testament to the 262-day-long abandonment of our loved ones. Hersh, Eliya, and Or were taken alive, and they must return alive, today. Every day that passes puts the hostages at greater risk and diminishes our chances of bringing them back safely,” the Forum said in a statement, calling for a deal that brings all of the hostages home.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxt5iie700053b6j6tce1llk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Earlier, the Forum had said – in an apparent swipe at Netanyahu – that “the end of the fighting in the Gaza Strip, without the release of the hostages, is an unprecedented national failure and a failure to meet the goals of the war.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxt4ohac00093b6j6npbhhfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Israeli opposition figure Gadi Eisenkot – who resigned from Israel’s war cabinet a week before Netanyahu disbanded it – also slammed Netanyahu’s comments, saying “there are soldiers who are fighting now because they have war goals to return the hostages.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxt4ohac000a3b6jql4jvyw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            In a short statement issued after his interview Sunday, Netanyahu’s office sought to clarify his comments, saying he “has made it clear that we will not leave Gaza until we return all 120 of our hostages, living and deceased.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxt4q8k8000h3b6jdc8xdkrz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Seeking to row back his explosive comments even further, Netanyahu on Monday told the Knesset: “We are committed to the Israeli proposal that President Biden welcomed. Our position has not changed.”
    </p>



    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxt4ohac000b3b6jj714by19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The release of the video may be intended to refocus minds in Israel’s security cabinet, reminding Netanyahu and other senior officials of the war’s initial aim to return the hostages, many of whom remain in Gaza nearly nine months after their abduction.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxt8um8q00053b6kfunq79gi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            It came as the number of hostages believed to be dead rose to 42 with the announcement by the Israeli military that one of its soldiers, Sergeant Major Mhamad El Atrash, 39, was killed on October 7 and that his body is being held by Hamas. Previously, on June 8, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said it believes that at least 41 hostages from the October 7 attack are dead, with their bodies being held in the Gaza Strip.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxt92zy900003b6ksfmeycyu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            At least five American hostages are believed to be held alive and four others believed to be dead.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxt4ohac000c3b6j4iwtj9jv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Goldberg-Polin, Levy and Cohen were kidnapped from the Nova music festival during Hamas’ murderous rampage, when its militants killed around 1,200 people and took some 250 others hostage.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxt4ohad000d3b6jm8jxyotn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Rachel Goldberg-Polin, Hersh’s mother, was later told by eyewitnesses that as many as 29 people had huddled together in a shelter outside the festival before Hamas began to throw grenades inside. Eight people survived by hiding under the bodies of the dead, while Goldberg-Polin was one of several hostages taken. A firsthand account from a young woman in the bunker said Goldberg-Polin had helped to throw some of the grenades out, before his left arm was blown off from the elbow down.

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_61DA7A3F-33EB-4229-8AA5-1569D8634769@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Judge Aileen Cannon’s two-hour hearing Monday morning for Donald Trump’s criminal case on classified documents became a close read of past special prosecutors and their funding, in the latest attempt from Trump’s team to invalidate the case against him.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_D35D66A5-1F4A-4560-ABD1-BE349E96D64B@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Here are key things to know: 
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_616B9EBD-0B57-4B90-B1A4-82A3E3B59913@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            <strong>Tough questions for Justice Department: </strong>Though the judge was careful to say her questions shouldn’t imply she was leaning one way, Cannon pushed Justice Department attorney James Pearce to explain how much money the department has used for its work in the Trump criminal cases. 
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_5D6AE470-91CA-4052-9FCD-188FDD9DE3BC@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The judge noted that even if the office discloses its spending publicly every six months, a financial disclosure that would encompass last fall through this March was overdue.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_DBCA11A9-1042-48A4-8B70-40D4144CE769@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            She also sought from prosecutors guidance on explaining the laws and regulations that governed past special prosecutors, at one point bringing up Watergate and the era of Janet Reno as attorney general.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_8A4B19C3-2771-42EB-BD2B-058542D389F7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Cannon’s questions were so pointed toward Pearce, at one point the prosecutor mentioned how other courts have been overturned if they invalidated a government function in the way Cannon was probing, and said he hoped the Justice Department could provide additional written argument to the court if invalidating Smith was a serious possibility.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_DB9A28E0-B748-4D63-B0BA-E30913FC98AE@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            <strong>Should Congress be more involved? </strong>Trump is also aiming to bring Congress into the conversation. Trump attorney Emil Bove advocated at Monday’s hearing that Cannon should insist on more congressional oversight of the special counsel’s office’s work, or decide that the way the office is funded is unlawful because, he says, the money is being used in a way Congress hadn’t authorized.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_CD72D561-064F-4177-9E45-D36AFD55E4E5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The argument is in line with other arguments the Trump team has made to the judge in recent days alleging Smith is too independent from Justice Department leadership. Bove also told the judge more congressional oversight would curb what he called “extraordinary things” that were happening in the documents case.​
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_B50C5B02-406A-44B3-AE27-EA6E2BAEC695@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Justice Department attorneys have responded in court that the special counsel operates in line with established policies, in place over several decades and administrations, and that the DOJ is committed to continuing to fund this prosecution of Trump under the attorney general’s authorization. Republicans on Capitol Hill have also tried to buckle down on the DOJ’s use of the special counsel’s office and its funding.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_9A7F2D92-8D0C-4EEE-A084-C2212CE75E80@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            <strong>Delay, delay, delay: </strong>As the case proceeds, slowly, Trump’s lawyers are using every opportunity they spot in recent weeks to request additional hearings and oversight—suggesting as much to Cannon at a hearing on Friday and again on Monday morning.

President Emmanuel Macron's centrist party, Renew, was behind in third place, after he responded to RN's European election victory earlier this month by calling the snap election.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The vote will be held over two rounds, on 30 June and 7 July.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But polls suggest National Rally could fall short of an absolute majority of 289 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The three leading groups go head to head on Tuesday in a TV debate pitting Mr Bardella against Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and Manuel Bompard for the New Popular Front. Mr Attal has already ridiculed RN's economic plans as a disaster.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">President Macron warned in a podcast that the plans of the "two extremes" would lead to "civil war" - both those of National Rally and France Unbowed, which forms a big part of the four-party leftist alliance. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">While he said that National Rally was divisive because it reduced people to a religion or ethnicity, the far left was little different because it split France into separate communities.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Laying out his nationalist credentials, Mr Bardella said that the most sensitive of jobs in defence and security would be limited to French citizens, barring dual nationals.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The welfare budget would be cut under a programme of national priority that would limit social spending to French citizens, he added.

But he said he drew a "red line" on handing Kyiv long-range missiles or sending in French troops, which Mr Macron has suggested could happen.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Many of RN's plans focus on the cost of living crisis in France. President Macron's unpopular pension reforms would be "repealed in principle" and anyone who had worked for 40 years could retire at 60.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">National Rally's policies have been widely condemned by political opponents as unaffordable, in particular a pledge to reduce VAT (sales tax) on energy products from 20% to 5.5%, estimated to cost up to €17bn (£14bn), according to France's economy ministry.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He went on to claim that his party was the only republican bulwark against the "extreme left of Jean-Luc Mélenchon". </p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dOZXmm"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-13b8515c-1 bbjeKz"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2ba8/live/45e7d3b0-3253-11ef-b14b-0579e1b4ed15.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2ba8/live/45e7d3b0-3253-11ef-b14b-0579e1b4ed15.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2ba8/live/45e7d3b0-3253-11ef-b14b-0579e1b4ed15.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2ba8/live/45e7d3b0-3253-11ef-b14b-0579e1b4ed15.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2ba8/live/45e7d3b0-3253-11ef-b14b-0579e1b4ed15.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2ba8/live/45e7d3b0-3253-11ef-b14b-0579e1b4ed15.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2ba8/live/45e7d3b0-3253-11ef-b14b-0579e1b4ed15.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2ba8/live/45e7d3b0-3253-11ef-b14b-0579e1b4ed15.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Jeremy Suyker/Bloomberg  Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the France Unbowed party, speaks during an campaign rally in Montpellier" class="sc-13b8515c-0 hbOWRP"><span class="sc-13b8515c-2 iuvLSH">Jeremy Suyker/Bloomberg </span></div></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Jean-Luc Mélenchon is an awkward ally for moderate parties on the French left</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Mélenchon has been accused of minimising antisemitism, describing it this month as "residual" in France, despite a surge in attacks in recent months.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Apple's App Store rules are in breach of the Digital Markets Act (DMA)</strong>: The European Commission has found that Apple's current App Store rules are non-compliant with the DMA, which is a European Union law aimed at promoting competition and innovation in digital markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apple can be fined up to 10% of its global annual turnover</strong>: The European Commission's finding of non-compliance can result in fines of up to 10% of Apple's global annual turnover. This is a significant risk for Apple, as it would be a massive fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Third-party developers should be able to inform customers of alternative purchasing possibilities</strong>: The European Commission believes that developers should be allowed to inform customers of alternative purchasing possibilities and provide links to their own websites for transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apple's link-out mechanism is seen as too restrictive</strong>: While Apple allows developers to include a link to their website, the European Commission believes that the link-out mechanism is too restrictive, as developers are still required to report transactions to Apple and pay a commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apple has made some changes to comply with the DMA, but the European Commission is not convinced</strong>: Apple has made some changes to its App Store rules in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission, but the Commission is not convinced that these changes are sufficient to comply with the DMA.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">A few months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="0" mrfobservableid="eaa244fe-b624-4913-bf33-24a2aa769aad">opening</a> a non-compliance case on Apple and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/digital-markets-act/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/tag/digital-markets-act/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="1" mrfobservableid="741d497f-df86-4a8f-8480-9fb4e2de0dc9">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA), the European Commission has shared its preliminary findings with Apple. And the bottom line is that the current App Store rules <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_3433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-mrf-link="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_3433" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="2" mrfobservableid="cb3b8cd1-2b80-4af8-9390-4e8733a8e44b">are in breach of the DMA</a>. Confirmed violations of the DMA can lead to fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“‘Act different’ should be their new slogan,” the EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, <a href="https://x.com/ThierryBreton/status/1805138863091859564" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-mrf-link="https://x.com/ThierryBreton/status/1805138863091859564" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="3" mrfobservableid="10c2ae0b-8007-40be-907f-fe41c3aaef72">wrote</a> on X. “For too long, Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies — denying consumers new opportunities &amp; choices.”</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In this particular case, the European Commission believes third-party developers should be able to inform customers of alternative purchasing possibilities — free of charge.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For instance, developers who have released apps on the App Store can’t advertise different prices or alternative distribution channels in their apps. While Apple now allows developers to include a link to their site, the European Commission believes there are too many restrictions with this link-out mechanism.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Even if developers redirect users to their websites and handle transactions on their websites, they have to report transactions to Apple and pay a commission. Apple only waives a 3% payment processing fee for web purchases.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“Apple has made a number of changes to comply with the DMA in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission,” the company said in a statement. “We are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In addition to these preliminary findings, the European Commission is opening a third non-compliance investigation into Apple’s new contractual terms for EU developers. This time, the Commission is going to focus on Apple’s controversial Core Technology Fee (CTF) and alternative app marketplaces.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">European developers can remain on the standard business terms or choose new business terms that allow them to distribute their apps outside of the App Store. However, these new terms lead to a €0.50 fee per installed app after one million downloads.</p>

	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The company has already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/02/apple-adds-more-carve-outs-to-its-eu-core-tech-fee-after-criticism-from-devs/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/02/apple-adds-more-carve-outs-to-its-eu-core-tech-fee-after-criticism-from-devs/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="4" mrfobservableid="54b27fe0-1ad5-4bc4-a038-ad770fe92f87">adjusted the CTF</a> so that it doesn’t apply to free non-commercial apps. There’s also a three-year transition period for small developers that release a hit app and get more than one million downloads for the first time. But that doesn’t change much in the long term. With this new formal investigation, the EC will determine whether the CTF effectively complies with the DMA.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">If you’ve tried to install a third-party app store in the EU, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/01/the-altstore-an-alternative-app-store-coming-to-eu-will-offer-patreon-backed-apps/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/01/the-altstore-an-alternative-app-store-coming-to-eu-will-offer-patreon-backed-apps/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="5" mrfobservableid="93477de2-5934-4020-a2ed-6334982884c5">the AltStore</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155259/setapp-mobile-eu-subscription-app-store-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-mrf-link="https://www.theverge.com/24155259/setapp-mobile-eu-subscription-app-store-preview" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="6" mrfobservableid="b38a8b7c-2ec5-4c04-afd7-137de01be82b">Setapp Mobile</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/03/aptoide-launches-its-alternative-ios-game-store-in-eu/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/03/aptoide-launches-its-alternative-ios-game-store-in-eu/" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="7" mrfobservableid="f92c5649-2fa1-49c2-b760-45491fc18a48">Aptoide</a>, you may have noticed that it requires quite a few taps. You first get an error in your web browser. You have to open the Settings app, accept app installations from this site, go back to your web browser, download the alternative store again, and accept popups about the risks involved with a third-party app store. The EC will examine this “multi-step user journey” and its compliance with the DMA rules.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“We are concerned that Apple designed its new business model to discourage app developers and end users from taking advantage of the opportunities afforded to them by the DMA,” Margrethe Vestager, the Commission EVP in charge of competition policy, said in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_24_3442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-mrf-link="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_24_3442" cmp-ltrk="In-Article Links" cmp-ltrk-idx="8" mrfobservableid="d1acc6b6-1415-45fb-bbeb-1cb1044a04dc">a speech</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“The letter of the DMA is clear: Gatekeepers have to allow for alternative app stores to establish themselves on their platform, and for consumers to be fully informed about the offers available to them so that they can freely choose where they want to source their apps, and at what conditions,” she added.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As for today’s preliminary findings, Apple can now respond to the European Commission in writing. The final decision is due one year after the opening of the formal investigation, which means that Apple can negotiate with the EU and adjust its business terms once again to avoid a hefty fine.</p>
