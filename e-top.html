<p>Sensing a threat from the far right, the Christian Democrats of EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had already shifted further to the right on migration and climate ahead of the elections — and were rewarded by remaining by far the biggest group in the 720-seat European Parliament and de facto brokers of the ever expanding powers of the legislature.</p>

<p>Overall across the EU, two mainstream and pro-European groups, the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, remained the dominant forces. The gains of the far right came at the expense of the Greens, who were expected to lose about 20 seats and fall back to sixth position in the legislature. Macron’s pro-business Renew group also lost big. </p>
    

<p>For decades, the European Union, which has its roots in the defeat of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, confined the hard right to the political fringes. With its strong showing in these elections, the far right could now become a major player in policies ranging from migration to security and climate. </p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

            Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz has resigned from Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, delivering a blow to the prime minister who has been celebrating the rare rescue of hostages held in Gaza.

            Gantz – considered Netanyahu’s main political challenger – said he was quitting eight-months after the October 7 Hamas attacks because “the situation in the country and in the decision-making room has changed.”

            He accused Netanyahu of putting his own personal political considerations ahead of a post-war strategy for the Gaza Strip, claiming that “fateful strategic decisions are met with hesitancy and procrastination due to political considerations,” and urged the prime minister to hold an election in the coming months.

            Gantz had been expected to resign on Saturday, but postponed the announcement following news that Israeli forces had rescued four hostages in an operation Gazan officials said left more than 270 Palestinians dead.

            His resignation comes despite Netanyahu calling on Gantz to stay in Israel’s emergency government, saying this is the time for unity, not division. Following Gantz’s announcement, Netanyahu urged him to change his mind.

            “Citizens of Israel, we will continue until victory and all the goals of the war have been achieved, most importantly, the release of all our hostages and the elimination of Hamas,” Netanyahu said.

            Gantz’s decision does not put Netanyahu’s government in immediate danger – his party was not part of the prime minister’s coalition, which retains a majority with 64-seats in the 120-member Knesset, Israel’s parliament. It would however leave the war cabinet, set up four days after Hamas’ October 7 attack, without representation from any party other than Netanyahu’s Likud.

            Besides the prime minister, the only other remaining member of the emergency government with decision-making power is Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, also from Likud.

            The United States has repeatedly called on the prime minister to present a tangible post-war plan for Gaza. US President Joe Biden, who laid out a three-pronged Israeli peace deal proposal last week, has suggested that Netanyahu is likely benefiting from prolonging the conflict.

            Gantz, a 64-year-old former defense minister, said last month that Netanyahu should submit a plan that should include the elimination of Hamas, the return of hostages from Gaza, the establishment of an alternative government in the enclave, the return of displaced Israelis from the north of the country, and a plan to make progress on normalization with Saudi Arabia.

	An <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/israel/" id="auto-tag_israel" data-tag="israel">Israel</a> Defense Forces (IDF) rescue mission recovered four hostages from Hamas custody on Saturday but killed dozens of Palestinians and injured hundreds. ABC’s <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/martha-raddatz/" id="auto-tag_martha-raddatz" data-tag="martha-raddatz">Martha Raddatz</a> interviewed an IDF spokesperson and questioned him about the number of civilians killed and injured during the operation.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   ">
	“Part of this mission were the air strikes,” Raddatz said. “We saw buildings destroyed in a civilian area, in broad daylight. There were people on the street during this attack through the air. Did you factor in the loss of so many Palestinians in this operation?”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   ">
	When the rescue operation occurred, it was in the middle of the morning, and many people were out shopping at a market nearby. “[It was] something we never witnessed before, maybe 150 rockets fell in less than 10 minutes, while we were running away more fell on the market,” Nidal Abdo, a local resident who was close to where the attacks occurred, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/09/middleeast/israel-hostage-rescue-gaza-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">told CNN</a>.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   ">
	“We don’t know how many casualties were caused in the strike in the release and rescue operation,” Lerner told Raddatz. “And I’d be very cautious at accepting any figures and numbers that Hamas are putting out.”

<p></p>







<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   " data-_get-element-size='{"w":702,"h":84}'>
	But Raddatz pointed out that while Hamas is saying that 274 deaths resulted from the operation, even the IDF has acknowledged deaths occurred, with an estimated count of fewer than 100 Palestinians dead.

</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   " data-_get-element-size='{"w":702,"h":56}'>
	“That’s a significant amount of casualties. Did they come from those air strikes in broad daylight?” Raddatz asked Lerner.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   " data-_get-element-size='{"w":702,"h":140}'>
	“Every civilian life lost in this war is a tragedy,” he said. “Every civilian life lost in this war is a result of how Hamas has operated. Let’s think about, just for a moment, where they were holding the hostages. Within civilian houses. Within people’s apartments — in the same apartment they were being held where the families that owned the apartments. This exemplifies specifically how Hamas operating.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   " data-_get-element-size='{"w":702,"h":56}'>
	The hostages were being held in two apartments in civilian buildings approximately 200 meters away from each other.

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   " data-_get-element-size='{"w":702,"h":84}'>
	Lerner added that forces trying to rescue the four hostages — Noa Argamani, Almog Meir, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv  — “came under extensive attack in an attempt to kill both them and the hostages.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   " data-_get-element-size='{"w":702,"h":84}'>
	But Raddatz continued to press Lerner on the necessity of the air strikes. “And is that the reason for the air strikes? Tell me why those air strikes were necessary, why buildings were destroyed in that attack?”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   " data-_get-element-size='{"w":702,"h":84}'>
	Lerner said that IDF forces “came under fire from a 360-degree threat: RPGs, AK-47s, explosive devices on the way, mortar rounds” before blaming civilian casualties on “how Hamas is battling us on the battleground.”</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   " data-_get-element-size='{"w":702,"h":56}'>
	“Would you carry out a similar rescue mission to get the other 116 hostages, no matter the cost to civilians in <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/gaza/" id="auto-tag_gaza" data-tag="gaza">Gaza</a>?” Raddatz asked.</p>



<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   " data-_get-element-size='{"w":702,"h":112}'>
	“There can be a rescue mission like what happened yesterday. But there could also have been negotiations that create the opportunity,” Lerner replied. “Our role is to create the conditions either way, that Hamas realizes that they should give back the hostages, they should set the hostages free.”

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   " data-_get-element-size='{"w":702,"h":112}'>
	According to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-805577" target="_blank"><em>The Jerusalem Post</em></a>, Hamas released a message stating that other Israeli hostages were killed by IDF forces during the rescue mission. “In exchange for them [the four Israeli hostages], your own army killed three of your own captives in the same attack; one of them holds a US citizenship,” Hamas said in a statement.

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   " data-_get-element-size='{"w":702,"h":112}'>
	Israel and Hamas are currently engaged in negotiations to reach a ceasefire agreement, but Saturday’s attack could mark a setback in those talks. One Egyptian official with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN that the rescue mission will have a “negative effect.” </p>

	“[It] won’t be easy,” the Egyptian official said.</p>

	U.S. National Security Adviser <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/jake-sullivan/" id="auto-tag_jake-sullivan" data-tag="jake-sullivan">Jake Sullivan</a> called the civilian deaths and injuries “tragic” and encouraged Hamas to accept the ceasefire deal that President Joe Biden has put forth.

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   " data-_get-element-size='{"w":702,"h":140}'>
	“The best way to get all of the hostages home and to protect Palestinian civilians is to end this war.

	Meanwhile, in Gaza, aid workers have said that military operations make it exceedingly difficult for them to deliver assistance and necessary supplies. “Medical equipment, medications, we haven’t been able to get. It’s been the same issue with fuel,” Karin Huster, a French-American trauma nurse and medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in Gaza, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/gaza-aid-workers-inferno-bodies-burned-beyond-recognition-rafah-1235029894/">tells <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>. “It’s been super challenging… And soon it will be impossible for us to work.”<br><span class="a-icon-endmark" aria-label="End of the article"></span></p>

<p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas defended President Joe Biden's new executive action restricting asylum claims at the US-Mexico border, saying that the implementation of the new policy is only just beginning.</p>

<li>
<p>The executive action bars migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum, unless they are victims of human trafficking or have a valid claim to asylum. Mayorkas emphasized that Homeland Security personnel have done an "extraordinary job" in implementing the new policy.</p>

<li>
<p>The policy has been met with criticism from both Republicans and progressive Democrats, highlighting the precarious position President Biden is in on immigration reform ahead of the November election.</p>

            Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Sunday pushed back on criticism of President Joe Biden’s new <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/immigration-biden-border-authority/index.html">executive action restricting asylum</a> while calling on Congress to take action on the border.

            “It’s early, the signs are positive. Our personnel have done an extraordinary job in implementing a very big shift in how we operate on the southern border,” Mayorkas said on ABC’s “This Week,” noting that implementation of the new policy — announced last Tuesday — has only just begun.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clx7tg4ye00063b6j4439zmfl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The executive action — which bars migrants crossing the border illegally from seeking asylum, with some limited exceptions, once an average daily threshold is met — marked the administration’s most dramatic move on the US southern border, which former President Donald Trump has made a central focus of his 2024 campaign. But the attacks on the new policy from both Republicans and progressive Democrats have underscored the precarious position Biden is in on immigration ahead of the November election.

            Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, for example, accused Biden of “gaslighting” Americans on Sunday. “People need to understand that what Biden has done, he’s not doing anything to actually secure the border, in fact it’s the opposite,” Abbott said on Fox’s “Sunday Morning Futures”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clx7tg4ye00093b6jas2k4u29@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “When he stops the asylum process, there’s nothing that Biden is doing that actually is preventing anybody else from crossing the border. There’s no type of enforcement mechanism in place.”
    </p>

            While the number of encounters between ports of entry is still high, it’s too early to know the policy’s impact. Still, Mayorkas insisted the restrictions on asylum would reduce the number of people who try to cross the border.
    </p>

            “Our intent is to really change the risk calculus of individuals before they leave their countries of origin and incentivize them to use the lawful pathways that we have made available to them and keep them out of the hands of exploitative smugglers,” Mayorkas told ABC’s Martha Raddatz.

            Pressed on why the administration did not act sooner once the bipartisan immigration deal fell apart in February, Mayorkas pointed to the second attempt to advance the measure, which <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/senate-border-bill-vote/index.html">failed last month</a> because of GOP opposition and Democratic divisions.

            “The bipartisan deal was rejected once, we pressed forward again. It was rejected a second time and then we developed this and have implemented it,” he said. “And we’re at an early stage, and let’s not minimize the significance of this move and the significance of operationalizing it. And it requires the cooperation of other countries which we have secured.”

            But Mayorkas again called on Congress to do more. “What we need is congressional action. We cannot resource the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, the Department of Justice with additional personnel. We need Congress to legislate.”
