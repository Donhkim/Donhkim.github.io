                                        <p>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Louisiana has become the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom, the latest move from a GOP-dominated Legislature pushing a conservative agenda under a new governor.</p><p>The legislation that Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law on Wednesday requires a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in “large, easily readable font” in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities. </p><p>Opponents questioned the law’s constitutionality and vowed to challenge it in court. Proponents said the the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of the law, the Ten Commandments are “foundational documents of our state and national government.”</p><p>The posters, which will be paired with a four-paragraph “context statement” describing how the Ten Commandments “were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,” must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.</p>
    

<p>Under the law, state funds will not be used to implement the mandate. The posters would be paid for through donations. </p>



<p>The law also “authorizes” but does not require the display of other items in K-12 public schools, including: The Mayflower Compact, which was signed by religious pilgrims aboard the Mayflower in 1620 and is often referred to as America’s “First Constitution"; the Declaration of Independence; and the Northwest Ordinance, which established a government in the Northwest Territory — in the present day Midwest — and created a pathway for admitting new states to the Union.</p>
    
<p>Not long after the governor signed the bill into law at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette on Wednesday, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.</p>
    

<p>The law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>“Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,” the groups said.</p><p>The controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in Louisiana under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January. The GOP holds a supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda.</p><p>Similar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-01ad837a877143d6bc2f1681f9cd8a2a">Texas</a></span>, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has succeeded in making the bills law. </p>
    

<p>Legal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.</p><p>In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose. </p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.</p><h2>___</h2><p>The story has been corrected to clarify that the time for gubernatorial action did not lapse. The governor signed the bill Wednesday. </p>

The toll represented hundreds more deaths than any of the prior 10 years. Many of those who died in the county were homeless or low-income individuals, officials say.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.maricopa.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/5820" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">number of deaths in the county</a> has risen each year. In 2013, there were 76 heat-related deaths recorded. Ten years later, the 645 deaths marked a jarring 784% increase. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The city started preparations for the sweltering summer months early this year, Brian Lee, the head of Phoenix's Office of Emergency Management, told the BBC. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Our primary function first and foremost is to save lives, " Mr Lee said. "Every person we can get in an air-conditioned room with a bottle of water is one person we can potentially save.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Maricopa County's emergency repair programme has helped about 700 people since 2021, with county funds set aside to pay for the services through at least 2026.

Gov. Greg Abbott has activated three platoons of the Texas National Guard, including more than 40 personnel, 20 vehicles and Chinook helicopters.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Several hazards will be felt over South Texas through Thursday due to the large extent and slow movement of this system," the National Weather Service in Corpus Christi warned.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Culprits included flash flooding, coastal and river flooding, rip currents and wind gusts over 50 mph, the weather service said. Several roads in Corpus Christi were already closed Wednesday because of high water as the storm approached. And the state Transportation Department's online highway condition map showed several alerts related to water on roadways across the region.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Alberto is the first named storm of what's expected to be an <a href="/story/news/weather/2024/05/23/noaa-atlantic-hurricane-season-2024-forecast-outlook/73801719007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">especially active season for hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean</a>, which also include storms that form in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Alberto also marks an unusually late start to the season: Not since 2014 has there been such a late start.

Up to 20 inches are possible across the higher terrain of the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. The storm will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding, forecasters said. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Coahuila Gov.

The storm was driving maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and was moving to the west at 9 mph, the hurricane center said. Some slight strengthening is forecast before landfall along Mexico's northeastern coast early Thursday.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Alberto is a large storm, and tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 415 miles. However, rapid weakening is expected as the storm moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico by Thursday night.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt"><a id="gpd-1718811715776" class="gnt_ar_b_ba"></a> Alberto to bring life-threatening surf to Texas coast</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Tornadoes are possible into Thursday across parts of Deep South Texas and Southeast Texas, the hurricane center said. Parts of Texas could see a storm surge of up to 4 feet. And swells generated by Alberto along the coast of Texas and northeastern Mexico through Friday are likely to cause "life-threatening surf and rip current conditions," the hurricane center said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves," the hurricane center warned.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">Record predictions:</strong><a href="/story/news/weather/2024/05/23/noaa-atlantic-hurricane-season-2024-forecast-outlook/73801719007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:21|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">The 2024 NOAA hurricane season forecast is unlike any other</a></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt"><a id="gpd-1718813022243" class="gnt_ar_b_ba"></a> An active season is predicted</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Federal forecasters last month predicted an "extraordinary" season with as many as 25 named storms possible.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This is the most storms the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has ever predicted in a preseason outlook.

            Vladimir Putin said Russia and North Korea have ramped up ties to a “new level,” pledging to help each other if either nation is attacked in a “breakthrough” new partnership announced during the Russian president’s rare visit to the reclusive state.

            The pair then signed the new strategic partnership to replace previous deals signed in 1961, 2000 and 2001, according to Russian state news agency TASS. “The comprehensive partnership agreement signed today includes, among other things, the provision of mutual assistance in the event of aggression against one of the parties to this agreement,” Putin said after the meeting.

            Putin said joint drills involving the United States, South Korea and Japan were “hostile” toward North Korea,” characterizing the US policy as “confrontational.” Kim, meanwhile, called the new “alliance” a “watershed moment in the development of the bilateral relations.”
    </p>

            But the deal between the two autocrats raised many questions, too – including whether Russia’s nuclear deterrent now extends to North Korea, and vice versa, or whether the two nations will now hold joint military drills.
    </p>

            Putin was met with exuberant celebrations at a welcome ceremony with his counterpart at Kim Il Sung Square in the heart of the North Korean capital, where mounted soldiers, military personnel and children holding balloons cheered against the backdrop of large portraits of the each leader.

            The two leaders presented their respective officials and stood together as the Russian national anthem played before riding off standing shoulder to shoulder in an open-top limousine as they smiled and waved to the crowds. The scenes of pomp and fanfare were a constant throughout the day, which closed with Kim escorting Putin to his plane late in the evening ahead of his trip to Vietnam.

            The staging reflected North Korea’s reliance on Moscow and was likely intended as a reminder to the West that Putin still holds considerable influence in at least some corners of the world, after his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

            The relationship is important to Russia, too. Multiple governments have accused Pyongyang of supplying arms to Moscow for its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine">grinding war in Ukraine</a>, a charge both countries have denied, despite significant evidence of such transfers.

            On Wednesday Putin gave Kim an Aurus car when the two leaders exchanged gifts, according to Russian state media – the second time Putin has given his counterpart this car model. According to Putin’s aide Yuri Ushakov, the Russian leader also presented Kim with a tea set. Ushakov did not specify what Putin received, but said they were “also good gifts.”

            Putin landed in North Korea in the early hours of Wednesday local time, exactly 24 years to the day he was last in Pyongyang, for a visit heralding the countries’ deepening alignment in the face of shared animosity toward the West and international concerns over their growing military cooperation.

            In remarks ahead of talks between the two, Kim voiced his “full support and solidarity with the struggles of the Russian government, military and the people,” pointing specifically to Moscow’s war in Ukraine “to protect its own sovereignty, safety and territorial stability.”

            “Situations continue to be complicated and ever-changing, but I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that we will continue to strengthen and closely engage in strategic communication with the (Russian) leadership,” Kim added.

            Putin hailed the countries’ ties as based on “equality and mutual respect,” and said an expected new bilateral agreement would “form the basis of relations between the two states for many years to come,” according to Russian state agency TASS. He also added that he hoped Kim would visit Moscow for their next meeting.

            The burgeoning relationship has sparked concern in both Seoul and Washington, not only over North Korea’s arms transfers to Russia, but also the prospect of Moscow transferring its superior military technology to aid Pyongyang’s heavily sanctioned weapons program.

            It comes as tensions remain elevated on the Korean Peninsula, where Kim in recent months has ramped up bellicose language and scrapped a longstanding policy of seeking peaceful reunification with South Korea amid alarm in Pyongyang over tightening coordination between the US, South Korea and Japan.

            Putin made his last visit to Pyongyang in 2000 for a meeting with Kim’s late father and predecessor Kim Jong Il. That trip, weeks after Putin’s inauguration for his first term as president, made him the first Russian head of state to visit North Korea.

            The two countries in 2000 also inked a new cooperation agreement.

            The two neighbors have deep ties on the Korean Peninsula.

The advisory was lifted eight months later after the company agreed to numerous stipulations, including the formation of an advisory council,  NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-calls-american-airlines-respond-pattern-discrimination*link=*7B*22role*22:*22standard*22,*22href*22:*22https:/*naacp.org/articles/naacp-calls-american-airlines-respond-pattern-discrimination*22,*22affiliate*22:*22*22,*22target*22:*22_blank*22,*22absolute*22:*22*22,*22linkText*22:*22a*20public*20statement*22*7D__;IyUlJSUlJSUlLyUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUl!!CxwJSw!Pk8-dIWjGel9Jw_O2vpeJYTp6dU_QSjG4-o4I35Z97VMdcevGxPpEagjZYJ0yGPqowUd9o987b4hrwQLAojrWlKcOeoogw%24" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a public statement</a> after the recent lawsuit was filed. </p>

<p>American Airlines disbanded the panel in 2023, the NAACP said, but racial incidents continued.  "Without a swift and decisive response, the NAACP will be forced to reinstate an advisory against the airline," Johnson said earlier this month.</p><p>Isom wrote in his letter that he spoke with Johnson about the organization's concerns after the most recent incident. He thanked Johnson for sharing his views and said American Airlines would take immediate actions in the aftermath, including creating an advisory group and strengthening oversight and reporting mechanisms.</p><p>"The NAACP is pleased to see American Airlines has taken initial steps to forge a path toward a more inclusive experience for all. While it is unfortunately common for Black consumers to experience racism and discrimination at the hands of corporations, it is not common to see such swift, and decisive action," Johnson said in a statement to CBS News. "It is our hope that this approach will serve as a model for other corporations who may find themselves in similar situations."</p><p>The airline's advisory group, the letter said, would "focus on improving the travel experience for Black customers," and promote accountability to deliver an "inclusive" travel experience. Employees will be encouraged to come forward to ensure "swift and transparent handling" related to allegations of discrimination or bias. The company said they'll provide employee training, review operational manuals and institute a long-term diversity plan.  </p><p>"Be assured that we are steadfast in our commitment to working with the NAACP and other civil rights organizations to learn from this incident, listen to and rebuild trust with you, our team members, and our Black customers, and to delivering the best possible experience with American," wrote Isom.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The article reports on a close primary election in Virginia's 5th Congressional District, where Rep. Bob Good, a conservative member of Congress, is trailing his primary challenger, John McGuire, by a small margin.</li>
<li>McGuire, a former Navy SEAL, is backed by former President Trump and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, while Good chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus.</li>
<li>The margin between the two candidates is less than 1%, which means the race could qualify for a recount if the margin remains under 0.5% after all votes are counted.</li>
<li>The contest is significant because it marks one of the first tests of Trump's influence in congressional elections, as well as the ongoing infighting within the Republican Party.</li>
<li>The election is ongoing, with a resumption of vote tabulation scheduled for Thursday in Virginia, which observes the Juneteenth holiday.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>A nationwide blackout hit Ecuador on Wednesday, leaving around 18 million people without power for several hours.</li>
<li>The blackout affected major cities, including Quito, the capital, where the subway system ground to a halt and traffic lights stopped working.</li>
<li>The Public Works Minister, Roberto Luque, blamed the blackout on a lack of investment in electrical systems, stating that it was "just more proof of the energy crisis we're dealing with".</li>
<li>The blackout caused disruptions in daily life, including the suspension of drinking water supply in some areas, night classes at educational institutions, and the disruption of online classes.</li>
<li>The power was eventually restored, with the Public Works Minister announcing that 95% of the country's electricity had returned, although the cause of the blackout remains unclear, with the minister initially blaming a failure of a transmission line.</li>

<p>The act by Just Stop Oil was quickly condemned by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday as a “disgraceful act of vandalism”. Labour leader Keir Starmer, his main opponent in the election next month, called the group “pathetic” and said the damage was “outrageous”.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 3 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>The incident came just a day before thousands are expected to gather at the 4,500-year-old stone circle to celebrate the summer solstice – the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>English Heritage, which manages the site, said it was “extremely upsetting” and said curators were investigating the damage. Just Stop Oil said on the social media platform X that the paint was made of cornstarch and would dissolve in the rain.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The Wiltshire Police said the pair of protesters were arrested on suspicion of damaging the monument.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>“Officers attended the scene and arrested two people on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument,” police said. “Our inquiries are ongoing and we are working closely with English Heritage.”</p>
<p>Footage posted on social media showed activists, wearing “Just Stop Oil” branded T-shirts, spraying a cluster of the megalithic standing stones with the orange substance from a small canister.</p>
<p>The group said Niamh Lynch, a 21-year-old student, and Rajan Naidu, 73, had used “orange cornflour” for the stunt.</p>
<p>Stonehenge was built on the flat lands of Salisbury Plain in stages starting 5,000 years ago, with the unique stone circle erected in the late Neolithic period about 2,500 BC.</p>
<p>Some of the stones, the so-called bluestones, are known to have come from southwest Wales, nearly 240km (150 miles) away, but the origins of others remain a mystery.</p>
<p>Just Stop Oil is one of many groups around Europe that have gained attention – and received criticism – for disrupting sporting events, splashing paint and food on famous works of art and interrupting traffic to draw attention to the global climate crisis.</p>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<p>The group, formed in 2022, said it acted in response to the Labour Party’s recent election manifesto. Labour has said that if it wins the election on July 4, it would not issue further licenses for oil and gas exploration. Just Stop Oil backs the moratorium but said it is not enough.</p>
<p>In a statement, the group said Labour, which is leading in polls and widely expected by pundits and politicians to lead the next government, needs to go further and sign a treaty to phase out fossil fuels by 2030.</p>
<p>“Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas will result in the death of millions,” the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Failure to commit to defending our communities will mean Just Stop Oil supporters… will join in resistance this summer, if their own governments do not take meaningful action.”</p>

<p>President Nikos Christodoulides was responding Wednesday to remarks by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah who warned that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.</p><p>Christodoulides said Nasrallah’s remarks “don’t in any way reflect what’s being attempted, which is to present a picture that Cyprus is involved in military operations.”</p><p>The Cypriot president said his country is “part of the solution, not part of the problem” and is recognized throughout the Arab World and internationally through such initiatives such as the Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor delivering humanitarian aid by ship to the Palestinian territory.</p><p>He said there are avenues of communication with both Lebanon and Iran “through diplomatic means.”</p><h2>Israeli strikes have destroyed more than 70% of Rafah’s facilities and infrastructure, official says</h2><p>GAZA — Israeli strikes have destroyed more than 70% of the facilities and infrastructure in Rafah, south of the Gaza Strip, head of the Rafah municipality Ahmed al-Sufi said in a statement Wednesday.</p><p>He accused Israeli forces of systematically targeting camps in Rafah, adding that entire residential areas in the Al Saudi neighborhood have been destroyed. Al-Sufi didn’t immediately respond to a request for additional information.</p><p>Israeli tanks and helicopters fired at a Palestinian ministry building overnight Tuesday in southern Gaza, setting a number of tents next to the warehouse on fire, displaced Palestinians who were sheltered nearby told The Associated Press. </p><p>Five people were killed in the attack, according to Palestinian media. The AP was unable to immediately verify this figure.</p><p>“We were sleeping at 1 o’clock at night, when suddenly we heard the sound of screaming. We went out running, carried the children and went out running, and we found a fire burning in front of us, a big fire,” said Mohammad Abu Hasera, originally from Gaza City, who was near the warehouse during the attack.</p><p>A <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://x.com/Doron_Kadosh/status/1803323819861455149" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video circulating on social media</a></span> and posted by an Israeli military correspondent Wednesday morning shows the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, including the terminal, which appears to be the only structure still intact there since the IDF launched its ground operations last month. </p><h2>UN says its workers were unable to pick up aid due to chaos</h2><p>UNITED NATIONS — U.N. humanitarian workers weren’t able to pick up desperately needed aid shipments at the Kerem Shalom border crossing from Israel because of the lack of law and order in the area, the United Nations said.</p><p>U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters that even though there was no fighting Wednesday on a new route where Israel has declared a “tactical pause” in daytime military action, the law and order issue prevented U.N. workers from picking up aid.</p><p>This means that no trucks carrying aid have been able to use the new route since Israel announced the daily pause Sunday on the road between the Kerem Shalom border crossing and Gaza’s main north-south Salah al-Din Road.</p><p>Haq noted that the United Nations has been warning about lawlessness and unrest for several days.</p><p>Asked who was responsible, he said, it’s probably a combination of several factors including criminal gangs taking advantage of the unrest and a lot of frightened people who are hungry.</p><p>“The responsibility of Israel as the occupying power does not stop at Kerem Shalom where aid is dropped off,” Haq stressed. “It includes ensuring that this assistance reaches women, children and elderly who need it the most and creating the enabling environment to do so.”</p><p>Haq said five fuel trucks that traveled via the fence road did enter Gaza Wednesday through the military gate. The U.N. humanitarian office reported these were the first fuel deliveries since early June and supplies remain scarce.</p><p>Currently, the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA, estimates that only 65,000 remain in the southern city of Rafah, where 1.4 million people had fled seeking safety. Almost the entire population of Rafah fled after Israel issued evacuation orders about three weeks ago and began military operations.</p><p>Haq said large numbers of Palestinians have fled to Khan Younis, Dier al-Balah and other areas of southern Gaza, where he stressed that very limited amounts of food are getting in because of the closure of the Rafah border crossing from Egypt, which had been a main conduit for aid deliveries</p><h2>Hezbollah says at least 3 fig</h2><h2>hters were killed in Israeli strikes </h2><p>BEIRUT — The Hezbollah militant group says at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday as a U.S. envoy works to quell tensions.</p><p>Lebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.</p><p>The fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.</p><p>Kamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group’s primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling. Mohanna said he was visiting another health center in south Lebanon, which had been previously struck and then repaired, when the Khiam center was hit.</p><p>Hezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.</p><p>But the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel’s army announced late Tuesday that it has “approved and validated” plans for an offensive in Lebanon.</p><p>Israeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but at least 80 of the fatalities were civilians. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed.</p><h2>Israeli drone strikes kill a Syrian army officer, state media says</h2><p>DAMASCUS, Syria — A Syrian army officer was killed in an Israeli airstrike Wednesday morning, Syrian state media said.</p><p>State news agency SANA reported that Israeli drone strikes hit military sites in the areas of Quneitra and Daraa in southern Syria, killing an officer and resulting in “material damages.”</p><p>The Untied Kingdom-based war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes came after members of factions affiliated with the Lebanese militia Hezbollah transported the wreckage of an Israeli reconnaissance plane to one of the targeted sites to dismantle it.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from the Israeli army on the strikes. Israel frequently launches strikes on Iran-linked targets in Syria but rarely acknowledges them. The strikes have intensified since October against the backdrop of the war in Gaza. </p><h2>For a second time, a bulk carrier attacked by Yemen’s Houthi rebels sinks in the Red Sea</h2><p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A bulk carrier sank days after an attack by <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/houthis">Yemen’s Houthi rebels</a></span> believed to have killed one mariner on board, authorities said early Wednesday, the second ship sunk in the rebels’ campaign. </p><p>The sinking of the Tutor in the Red Sea marks what appears to be a new escalation by the Iranian-backed Houthis in their campaign targeting shipping through the vital maritime corridor over the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">Israel-Hamas war</a></span> in the Gaza Strip. </p><p>The attack comes despite a monthslong U.S.-led campaign in the region that has seen the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/us-navy-yemen-houthis-israel-war-7a9997f9d84ac669fae69ecf819913fb">Navy face its most intense maritime fighting</a></span> since World War II, with near-daily attacks targeting commercial vessels and warship. </p><p>The Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned-and-operated Tutor sank in the Red Sea, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said in a warning to sailors in the region. The Houthis, quoting foreign reports in media outlets they control, acknowledged the sinking. The U.S. military did not acknowledge the sinking, nor did it respond to requests for comment. </p><h2>United Nations human rights office spotlights 6 Israeli attacks on Gaza as possible crimes against humanity</h2><p>GENEVA — The United Nations human rights office has spotlighted six deadly bombing attacks by Israeli defense forces in Gaza during the first nine weeks of the war, saying they could amount to crimes against humanity.</p><p>The rights office says that more than eight months into the conflict, and despite commitments from Israel to look into such attacks, authorities have not produced transparent or credible investigations. Volker Turk, the U.N. human rights chief, said the requirement under international law that combatants avoid or minimize harm to civilians “appears to have been consistently violated” in Israel’s bombing campaign.</p><p>The comments came along with the release of a new report Wednesday that seeks to highlight the dangers posed to civilians of the use of powerful weapons, including 2,000-pound GBU-31 bombs. It said a Dec. 2 attack on Shujaiya neighborhoods of Gaza City destroyed 15 buildings and damaged 14 others. Three of the strikes, it said, came with no advance warning.</p><p>Israeli authorities responded by defending their respect for proportionality and principle of distinction under international law. They also accused the rights office of bias and said it didn’t have full information about the circumstances of the military operations.</p><p>The report, while mainly focusing on Israel, also said Palestinian armed groups have fired discriminately into Israel, possibly violating international law.</p><p>The office said part of the reason why the six attacks were spotlighted among thousands carried out was because it had extensive information about them.</p>

The achievement caps Nvidia’s rise from a respected maker of video game hardware to the purveyor of one of tech’s hottest commodities: specialized AI chips. The pivot has seen Nvidia dramatically transform its fortunes in a matter of years, growing from a <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/" aria-label="market capitalization">market capitalization </a>of around $16 billion in 2016 to just under $800 billion towards the end of 2021 before dropping to around $300 billion in 2022 amid <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-is-down-57-should-you-buy-right-now" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-is-down-57-should-you-buy-right-now" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-is-down-57-should-you-buy-right-now" aria-label="poor demand">poor demand</a> for gaming chips and a wider rout on U.S. stock markets. The boom in generative artificial intelligence, kickstarted by the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022, has helped propel Nvidia to new heights as demand for its specialized AI chips soared. Since then, the company’s value has multiplied from around $400 billion in late 2022 to $1 trillion by mid 2023, $2 trillion by early 2024 and $3 trillion by the middle of 2024 on a near vertical climb. Nvidia shares are up more than 170% this year alone and its stratospheric growth shows little sign of stopping as tech firms duel it out to dominate the nascent market for AI.</p>
