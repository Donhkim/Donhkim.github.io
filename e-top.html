<p>“This was a rigged, disgraceful trial,” an angry Trump told reporters after leaving the courtroom. “The real verdict is going to be Nov. 5 by the people. They know what happened, and everyone knows what happened here.”</p><p>Judge Juan Merchan set sentencing for July 11, just days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where GOP leaders, who remained resolute in their support in the aftermath of the verdict, are expected to formally make him their nominee.</p>
    

<p>The verdict is a stunning legal reckoning for Trump and exposes him to potential prison time in the city where his manipulations of the tabloid press helped catapult him from a real estate tycoon to reality television star and ultimately president. As he seeks to reclaim the White House in this year’s election, the judgment presents voters with another test of their willingness to accept Trump’s boundary-breaking behavior.</p>




    
<p>Trump is expected to appeal the verdict and will face an awkward dynamic as he returns to the campaign trail tagged with felony convictions. There are no campaign rallies on the calendar for now, though he’s expected to appear Friday at Trump Tower and to hold fundraisers next week.</p><p>The falsifying business records charges carry up to four years behind bars, though Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg would not say Thursday if prosecutors intend to seek imprisonment, and it is not clear whether the judge — <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hush-money-trial-gag-order-fae616037d3606cc60abbffb0e91f7ee">who earlier in the trial warned of jail time for gag order violations</a></span> — would impose that punishment even if asked.</p>
    

<p>The conviction, and even imprisonment, will not bar Trump from continuing his White House pursuit.</p><p>Trump faces <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/projects/trump-investigations-civil-criminal-tracker/">three other felony indictments</a></span>, but the New York case may be the only one to reach a conclusion before the November election, adding to the significance of the outcome. Though the legal and historical implications of the verdict are readily apparent, the political consequences are less so given its potential to reinforce rather than reshape already hardened opinions about Trump.</p><div class="AudioEnhancement" data-separate-event="audioModule" data-separate-value="AP AUDIO: Guilty: Trump becomes first former U.S. president convicted of felony crimes" data-module="" data-gtm-region="AP AUDIO: Guilty: Trump becomes first former U.S. president convicted of felony crimes" data-align-center="" data-module-number="4" data-main-module-number="4">

<p>Ahead of the verdict, Trump’s campaign had argued that, no matter the jury’s decision, the outcome was unlikely to sway voters and that the election would be decided by issues such as inflation.</p><p>Even so, the verdict is likely to give President Joe Biden and fellow Democrats space to sharpen arguments that Trump is unfit for office, though for now the White House offered only a muted statement that it respected the rule of law. Conversely, the decision will provide fodder for the presumptive Republican nominee to advance his unsupported claims that he is victimized by a criminal justice system he insists is politically motivated against him.</p><p>Trump maintained throughout the trial that he had done nothing wrong and that the case should never have been brought, railing against the proceedings from inside the courthouse — <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-speaker-mike-johnson-court-09aef3de395fa77843f2600f40da6ac3">where he was joined by a parade of high-profile Republican allies</a></span> — and racking up fines for violating a gag order with inflammatory out-of-court comments about witnesses.</p>
    

<p>Republicans showed no sign of loosening their embrace of the party leader, with House Speaker Mike Johnson lamenting what he called “a shameful day in American history.” He called the case “a purely political exercise, not a legal one.”</p><p>The first criminal trial of a former American president always presented a unique test of the court system, not only because of Trump’s prominence but also because of his relentless broadsides on the foundation of the case and its participants. But the verdict from the 12-person jury marked a repudiation of Trump’s efforts to undermine confidence in the proceedings or to potentially impress the panel with a show of GOP support.</p>
    

<p>“While this defendant may be unlike any other in American history, we arrived at this trial and ultimately today in this verdict in the same manner as every other case that comes through the courtroom doors, by following the facts and the law and doing so without fear or favor,” Bragg said after the verdict.</p><p>The trial involved charges that Trump falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-gag-order-d853768fff5fafbdee55623579889140">Stormy Daniels</a></span>, the porn actor who said she had sex with the married Trump in 2006.</p><p>The $130,000 payment came from Trump’s former lawyer and personal fixer <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-cohen-hush-money-stormy-daniels-735aadfd1ce015e05ba955c203a96f1b">Michael Cohen</a></span> to buy Daniels’ silence during the final weeks of the 2016 race in what prosecutors allege was an effort to interfere in the election.

He detailed the tense negotiations to get both women compensated for their silence but also faced aggressive questioning from a Trump attorney who noted Davidson had helped broker similar hush money deals in cases involving other prominent figures. </p><p>The most pivotal witness, by far, was Cohen, who during days of testimony gave jurors an insider’s view of the hush money scheme and what he said was Trump’s detailed knowledge of it. </p><p>“Just take care of it,” he quoted Trump as saying at one point.</p><p>He offered jurors the most direct link between Trump and the heart of the charges, recounting a meeting in which a plan to have Cohen reimbursed in monthly installments for legal services was discussed.</p><p>And he emotionally described his dramatic break with Trump in 2018, when he decided to cooperate with prosecutors after a decade-long career as the then-president’s personal fixer.</p><p>“To keep the loyalty and to do the things that he had asked me to do, I violated my moral compass, and I suffered the penalty, as has my family,” Cohen said.</p><p>The case, though criticized by some legal experts who called it the weakest of the prosecutions against Trump, took on added importance not only because it proceeded to trial first but also because it could be the only only one to reach a jury before the election.</p><p>The other three — local and federal cases in Atlanta and Washington alleging that he conspired to undo the 2020 election, as well as a federal indictment in Florida charging him with illegally hoarding top-secret records — are bogged down by delays or appeals.</p><h2>____</h2><p>Associated Press journalists Ruth Brown, Joseph B.

            At the center of the dispute was a meeting Vullo had with insurance market Lloyd’s of London in 2018 in which the NRA claims she offered to not prosecute other violations as long as the company helped with the campaign against gun groups. Vullo tried to wave off the significance of the meeting, arguing in part that the NRA’s allegations of what took place were not specific.

            Vullo, who served in Democratic former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration, said her enforcement targeted an insurance product that is illegal in New York: third-party policies sold through the NRA that cover personal injury and criminal defense costs following the use of a firearm. Critics dubbed the policies “murder insurance.”

            While the NRA is more likely to be at the Supreme Court making Second Amendment arguments, it picked up unfamiliar allies with its First Amendment claim. The American Civil Liberties Union, which usually sits opposite the NRA in the debate over guns, agreed to represent the group before the Supreme Court.

            A US district court denied some of the NRA’s claims but allowed its First Amendment arguments to proceed against Vullo. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision, concluding that Vullo’s actions were not coercive. It also ruled that Vullo was entitled to qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that shields government officials from lawsuits in some circumstances.

            The duct tape, approximately 15 inches long, “was found adhering to Laci’s pants on her right thigh.” According to the motion, “a section of the duct tape that was folded over onto itself underwent DNA testing and the presence of human DNA was found, but no DNA profile could be obtained.”

            The lawyers also wanted to examine evidence from a burglary that happened across the street from the Peterson home.

            In November 2004, after a nearly six-month trial, Peterson was found guilty of first-degree murder for Laci’s death and second-degree murder for Conner’s death. Prosecutors alleged that Peterson’s motive for the murders was to escape married life and upcoming fatherhood. The jury recommended the death penalty, which Judge Alfred Delucchi followed.

            Following Governor Newsom’s moratorium on executions in 2019, Peterson’s death sentence was overturned by the California Supreme Court in 2020. A few months later, the California Supreme Court ordered the San Mateo County Superior Court to reexamine Peterson’s murder convictions because a juror did not disclose involvement in other legal proceedings, including but not limited to “being the victim of a crime.” He was resentenced to life without parole in 2021.

            In 2023, Peterson’s attorneys filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which they alleged “violations of state and federal constitutional rights and state statutory rights, including … a claim of actual innocence that is supported by newly discovered evidence.” The Los Angeles Innocence Project, a nonprofit that works to exonerate people who are wrongly convicted, later announced it was investigating Peterson’s “claim of actual innocence.”

<p>A man described by police as a “serial slingshot shooter” died five days after being arrested for firing the weapon multiple times over several years in an Azusa neighborhood.</p>



<p>The 81-year-old man identified as Price King was pronounced dead after officers responded to a home in the 500 block of Soldano Avenue for a wellness check, an Azusa Police Department spokesperson said. </p>



<p>The spokesperson said there was no evidence of foul play in King’s death. </p>



<p>King had been <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/quality-of-life-issue-leads-to-arrest-of-81-year-old-serial-slingshot-shooter-police-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested on Friday</a> when officers responded to a “quality of life issue” occurring in the 900 block of North Enid Avenue.</p>



<p>“DEU conducted a lengthy investigation and learned that during the course of nine to ten years, dozens of citizens were being victimized by a serial slingshot shooter,” the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7U_sJfP4ij/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department stated in an Instagram</a> post. “The unknown suspect broke windows, windshields and almost struck people with ball bearings.” </p>





<p>Reactions to the post were mixed with one person accusing King of shooting their dog with ballbearings and another saying he “mainly ran off unwanted squatters.”</p>





<p>King was booked following Friday’s arrest but had been released, police said.</p>

data-link-name="in body link">widespread concern</a> among researchers and lawmakers over its potential for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/19/ai-generated-disinformation-us-elections" data-link-name="in body link">increasing the quantity and quality</a> of online disinformation. Artificial intelligence companies such as OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, have tried with mixed results to assuage these concerns and place guardrails on their technology.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">OpenAI’s 39-page report is one of the most detailed accounts from an artificial intelligence company on the use of its software for propaganda. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/openai" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">OpenAI</a> claimed its researchers found and banned accounts associated with five covert influence operations over the past three months, which were from a mix of state and private actors.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Russia</a>, two operations created and spread content criticizing the US, Ukraine and several Baltic nations. One of the operations used an OpenAI model to debug code and create a bot that posted on Telegram. China’s influence operation generated text in English, Chinese, Japanese and Korean, which operatives then posted on Twitter and Medium.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Iranian actors generated full articles that attacked the US and Israel, which they translated into English and French. An Israeli political firm called Stoic ran a network of fake social media accounts which created a range of content, including posts accusing US student protests against Israel’s war in Gaza of being antisemitic.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Several of the disinformation spreaders that OpenAI banned from its platform were already known to researchers and authorities. The US treasury <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2195" data-link-name="in body link">sanctioned two Russian men</a> in March who were allegedly behind one of the campaigns that OpenAI detected, while Meta also banned Stoic from its platform this year for violating its policies.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The report also highlights how generative AI is being incorporated into disinformation campaigns as a means of improving certain aspects of content generation, such as making more convincing foreign language posts, but that it is not the sole tool for propaganda.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“All of these operations used AI to some degree, but none used it exclusively,” the report stated. “Instead, AI-generated material was just one of many types of content they posted, alongside more traditional formats, such as manually written texts, or memes copied from across the internet.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">While none of the campaigns resulted in any notable impact, their use of the technology shows how malicious actors are finding that generative AI allows them to scale up production of propaganda. Writing, translating and posting content can now all be done more efficiently through the use of AI tools, lowering the bar for creating disinformation campaigns.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Over the past year, malicious actors have used generative AI in countries around the world to attempt to influence politics and public opinion. Deepfake audio, AI-generated images and text-based campaigns have all been employed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/26/ai-deepfakes-disinformation-election" data-link-name="in body link">disrupt election campaigns</a>, leading to increased pressure on companies like OpenAI to restrict the use of their tools.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">OpenAI stated that it plans to periodically release similar reports on covert influence operations, as well as remove accounts that violate its policies.</p></div></div>

They said the bombs used were likely U.S.-made.</p><p>The strikes, targeting Hamas operatives, killed as many as 45 people sheltering in a temporary displacement camp near the southern Gaza city of Rafah on Sunday and have <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-rafah-israel-gaza-hamas-20ab56f356e75273b24ad6361a6a0e0d">drawn international condemnation</a></span>. </p><p>Israel is investigating the attack but says the Hamas targets were 1.7 kilometers (1 mile) away from a declared humanitarian zone and that its review before the strike determined no expected harm to civilians.</p><p>But displaced civilians were scattered throughout the area, and Israel had not ordered evacuations. So even if the tents that burned were not inside the marked humanitarian zone, the civilians there thought it was safe.</p>
    

<p>Israel, which was <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-rockets-airstrikes-tel-aviv-11fb98655c256d54ecb5329284fc37d2">attacked by Hamas</a></span> on Oct. 7, 2023, has not said where the burned tents were in relation to the compound it bombed on Sunday, but has released one satellite image showing there were some known civilian shelters located about 180 meters (600 feet) away. It emphasized that while there were no tents “in the immediate vicinity,” due to “unforeseen circumstances, a fire ignited tragically taking the lives of Gazan civilians nearby.”</p>



<p>Footage released by the Israeli military appears to show people walking next to the targeted buildings before the blast. The footage also appears to show tents nearby.</p>
    
<p>Israel has not identified the bombs it used, but Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israel Defense Forces spokesman, has emphasized that the country chose the smallest munition its jets could carry — with 17 kilograms (37 pounds) of explosive material each — and that an unintended secondary explosion may have caused the fire.</p>
    

<p>Even the smallest jet-launched munition may be too big when civilians are near because of how they explode and can send fragments far, defense experts said. </p><p>Images posted on social media from the tent camp on Monday and verified by The Associated Press showed a CAGE code, a unique identifier assigned to U.S. government suppliers, on pieces of the exploded weapons. </p><p>Based on those images and satellite photos of the debris field, two defense experts said the bombs used were likely U.S.-made 250-pound (113-kilogram) GBU-39 small-diameter bombs. </p><p>Though they’re smaller than many other weapons the U.S. has provided to Israel, these bombs can still create a wide swath of damage. The entire 250-pound shell and components are designed to spew fragments that can travel as far as 2,000 feet (600 meters).</p><p>“You essentially have two bombs they use that the fragments can travel 600 meters in a densely packed area. So that just doesn’t check out if they’re trying to limit casualties,” said Trevor Ball, a former Army explosive ordnance demolition technician.</p><p>Ball said the serial number on the pieces of the tail kit and the shell debris shown in the photographs identify the munitions as the 250-pound GBU-39. It’s unusual to describe a bomb by its explosive load — in this case, 37 pounds — instead of its total weight, according to Ball and Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps Reserves colonel and senior adviser to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>
    

<p>The debris field in Gaza is indicative of the bombs possibly being set to detonate before impact, which would ensure their intended targets were killed but also risk unintended deaths, Ball and Cancian said. The images showed a small hole where shrapnel was found.</p><p>The GBU-39’s fuse settings can be adjusted to have the bomb explode on impact, which would create a crater at the site, or set for a delayed blast if the goal is to have it more deeply penetrate a target first.</p><p>They can also be set to detonate in the air, right before impact, to ensure multiple targets are hit. But that setting also maximizes area damage, which could explain a secondary explosion even if weapons or other flammable materials were some distance away, Ball said. </p>
    

<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters on Wednesday during <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/us-moldova-czechia-nato-blinken-085dde8dc3ab04e1f6a11ae60cee9d36">a visit to Moldova</a></span> that the U.S. is waiting for an investigation to show what weapons were used and how they were deployed.</p><p>Even if that confirms Israel used a small-diameter weapon, “we also see that even limited, focused, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-05-28-2024-21ea44e3b514d3f3f2bd26a33f157e48">targeted attacks</a></span> — designed to deal with terrorists who have killed innocent civilians that are plotting to kill more — even those kinds of operations can have terrible, horrific, unintended consequences,” Blinken said.</p><p>The defense experts said Israel had better options to turn to than the GBU-39 when civilians were nearby.</p><p>The Israelis have previously deployed drones to launch weapons that are smaller and more precise, Cancian said. These precision airstrikes used over the years have caused little damage beyond the immediate target.</p>
    

<p>Israel, for example, in this strike could have used a smaller anti-personnel weapon called the mini-Spike, which would not have created as wide an area of debris, if it was targeting specific Hamas leaders, Cancian said.</p><p>The U.S. has <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-bombs-gaza-netanyahu-israel-rafah-432aa51e3569d1a73b22273295b1a53f">withheld a shipment of even larger 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) bombs</a></span> from Israel out of concern they would be used in Israel’s Rafah operation, where more than 1 million Palestinians crowded after Israel bombed other parts of Gaza.

He declined to discuss the specific munitions used by Israel but said Israel’s public comments about the munitions used “certainly indicate a desire to be more deliberate and more precise in their targeting.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Federman reported from Jerusalem.

And while all the focus was on the $71,995 Wagoneer S, the automaker had one more thing to show off: an off-road-capable Trailhawk concept of the same EV, sitting pretty on 31.5-inch tires. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">The forest green SUV sports several features that distinguish it from the standard Wagoneer S, including an intimidating laser-cut roof rack, 3D-printed tow hooks, lifted suspension, wheel caps, and a host of other goodies for gearheads and boulder lovers alike. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component clear-both block md:float-left md:mr-30 md:w-[320px] lg:-ml-100"><div class="duet--article--article-pullquote mb-20"><p class="mb-10 h-[22px] w-[65px] bg-franklin"></p><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup relative bg-repeating-lines-dark bg-[length:1px_1.2em] pb-8 font-polysans text-28 font-medium leading-120 tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20  dark:bg-repeating-lines-light dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple">Sitting pretty on 31.5-inch tires</p></div></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Trailhawk is the trim name usually applied to Jeep’s most rugged off-road vehicles, complete with more durable equipment and materials. In addition, Trailhawk vehicles are often trail rated, meaning they’ve passed a battery of tests for maneuverability, articulation, and ground clearance. And with the Wagoneer S Trailhawk concept, Jeep is signaling its interest in extending those capabilities to its nascent battery-electric segment. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">The Trailhawk concept boasts a lot of the same features as the Wagoneer S — while taking them a step further. In addition to those all-terrain 31.5-inch tires, the concept sits on a lifted suspension for better ground clearance. Tow hooks are embedded in the front and rear of the vehicle, and functional air extractors are intended for high-pressure environments. The hood decal is anti-glare, the badging is flush with the vehicle, and the panoramic sunroof is dual panel for letting in fresh air — or trail dust, as it were. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Jeep’s five driver modes for the Wagoneer S gain a sixth mode for the Trailhawk concept: Rock. The mode selector is emergency red in the center console for ease of switching. And the steering wheel is octagonal-shaped, with special grips at the 9 and 3 o’clock positions for those especially hairy moments. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Electric off-roading isn’t exactly a new thing. Ford, Chevy, GMC, and Rivian all market their electric trucks as just as capable on gravel as they are on pavement. And the annual King of the Hammers off-roading competition features a segment just for battery-powered rock crawlers. But Jeep is a brand that prides itself on its overpowered dirt spewers, so introducing a plug-in version would make total sense. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">The company isn’t committing to putting the Trailhawk concept into production, but during today’s event, executives hinted heavily that the off-roader would indeed eventually become a real EV. Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa said that the Wagoneer S would feature several trims, with the fully loaded Launch Edition coming first. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white"><em>Photography by Andrew J.

            Boeing executives presented sweeping changes to the company’s production process and safety systems in a three-hour meeting with the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday. The plan is meant to reassure the public, airline customers and regulators that the troubled company’s planes are safe to fly.

            It was the second grounding since the first 737 Max delivery in 2017. The Max 8 spent 20 months grounded after crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.
