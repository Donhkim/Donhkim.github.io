            In a surprise result, the New Popular Front (NFP) – a cluster of several parties ranging from the far-left France Unbowed party to the more moderate Socialists and the Ecologists – won 182 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest group but short of the 289 required for an absolute majority, according to the French Interior Ministry.

            President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Ensemble alliance, which had slumped to a dismal third in the first round of voting last Sunday, mounted a strong recovery to win 163 seats. Despite leading after the first round of votes, Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (RN) party and its allies won 143 seats.

            The RN’s strong showing in the first round stirred fears that France could be on the cusp of electing its first far-right government since the collaborationist Vichy regime of World War II. But Sunday’s results come as a huge upset and show French voters’ overwhelming desire to keep the far right from gaining power – even at the cost of a hung parliament.

            After the first round, an unprecedented number of seats – over 300 – went to a three-way runoff between Ensemble, the NFP and the RN. By Tuesday, more than 200 centrist and left-wing candidates withdrew from the second round, in a bid to avoid splitting the vote.

            Cheers rang out on the streets of Paris as the projection was published. Speaking to a crowd of his ecstatic supporters near Stalingrad square, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the firebrand leader of France Unbowed, said the results came as a “huge relief for the overwhelming majority of people in our country.”

            Gabriel Attal, Macron’s protege, announced he would resign as prime minister Monday morning. He seemed to take a swipe at Macron’s decision to call the snap vote, saying he “didn’t choose” for France’s parliament to be dissolved.

            Elsewhere in Paris, the buoyant atmosphere at a RN campaign event in Bois de Vincennes took a nosedive an hour before the polls closed. After the projection was announced, <a href="https://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/jordan-bardella-national-rally-france-profile-intl/index.html">Jordan Bardella</a>, the party’s 28-year-old leader, said France had been thrown into “uncertainty and instability.”

            Handpicked as leader by Marine Le Pen in an effort to purge the party of its racist and antisemitic roots, Bardella had taken the party closer to the gates of power than ever before. Visibly disappointed by the results, he slammed the NFP as an “alliance of dishonor.”

            After parliamentary elections, the French president appoints a prime minister from the party that won the most seats. Ordinarily, this means a candidate from the president’s own party. However, Sunday’s results mean Macron faces the prospect of having to appoint a figure from the left-wing coalition, in a rare arrangement known as a “cohabitation.”

            But it is not clear from which party within the coalition that Macron will appoint a prime minister. France Unbowed won 74 seats, making it the largest single party within the NFP, ahead of the Socialists with 59.

            But Macron and his allies had repeatedly stressed that they would refuse to enter into coalition with Mélenchon. Speaking after last Sunday’s first round, outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal – Macron’s protege, said France Unbowed was preventing the formation of a “credible alternative” to the far right.
    </p>

            The NFP formed less than a month ago, after Macron called the snap vote following his party’s disastrous loss to the RN in last month’s European Parliament election.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clybvgdq2000v3b6jwkuze6v9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The capacious – and potentially fractious – coalition chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. Sunday’s results mean the NFP has managed to do this again.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clybwb8ia000c3b6jg03c7f5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            It campaigned on a platform to raise the minimum monthly wage to 1,600 euros (more than $1,700), to cap the price of essential foods, electricity, fuel and gas, and to scrap Macron’s deeply unpopular pension reform, which raised the French retirement age – already one of the lowest in the Western world – from 62 to 64.
    </p>

            Sunday’s vote represents a victory for the French “cordon sanitaire,” the principle that mainstream parties must unite to block the far right from taking office.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clybxz1fb00023b6jomzh55bc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            But the RN’s success should not be underestimated. In the 2017 elections, when Macron swept to power, the RN won just eight seats. In 2022, it surged to 89 seats. In Sunday’s vote, it won 125 – making it the largest individual party in parliament.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clybxxso800003b6j6mov99ua@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            While the risk of a far-right government has been avoided for now, these elections have plunged France into political uncertainty. Macron called the election three years earlier than necessary, just minutes after his party was trounced by the far right in the EU election.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clybyq35500093b6j3v8qqgwn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Although EU election results need have no bearing on domestic politics, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent to him by voters and wanted to clarify the situation.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clybyqqjo000b3b6jtffln2uo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            But Sunday’s results may further muddy the French political picture. Unable to call a new election for at least another year, and with three years left on his presidential term, Macron looks set to preside over an unruly parliament, as problems mount at home and abroad.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clybyvhrd000f3b6j3ped492d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Édouard Philippe, France’s former prime minister and an ally of Macron, said Macron’s gamble had further complicated the situation.
    </p>

            “The truth is that none of the political blocs in the assembly has a majority on its own to govern. The dissolution of the assembly, which was intended as a clarification, has instead led to great vagueness,” he said Sunday evening.
    </p>

            “The central political forces therefore have a responsibility to stay. They must, without compromise, promote the creation of an agreement that will stabilize the political situation.”

                                        <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — A long-running heat wave that has already shattered previous records across the U.S. persisted on Sunday, baking parts of the West with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/record-heat-deadly-climate-change-humidity-south-11de21a526e1cbe7e306c47c2f12438d">dangerous temperatures</a></span> that caused the death of a motorcyclist in Death Valley and held the East in its hot and humid grip.</p><p>An excessive heat warning — the National Weather Service’s highest alert — was in effect for about 36 million people, or about 10% of the population, said NWS meteorologist Bryan Jackson. Dozens of locations in the West and Pacific Northwest tied or broke previous heat records. </p><p>Many areas in Northern California surpassed 110 degrees (43.3 C), with the city of Redding topping out at a record 119 (48.3 C). Phoenix set a new daily record Sunday for the warmest low temperature: it never got below 92 F (33.3 C). </p><p>A high temperature of 128 F (53.3 C) was recorded Saturday and Sunday at Death Valley National Park in eastern California, where a visitor died Saturday from heat exposure and another person was hospitalized, officials said.</p>
    

<p>The two visitors were part of a group of six motorcyclists riding through the Badwater Basin area amid scorching weather, the park said in a statement.</p>



<p>The person who died was not identified. The other motorcyclist was transported to a Las Vegas hospital for “severe heat illness,” the statement said. Due to the high temperatures, emergency medical helicopters were unable to respond, as the aircraft cannot generally fly safely over 120 F (48.8 F), officials said. </p>
    
<p>The other four members of the party were treated at the scene.</p><p>“While this is a very exciting time to experience potential world record setting temperatures in Death Valley, we encourage visitors to choose their activities carefully, avoiding prolonged periods of time outside of an air-conditioned vehicle or building when temperatures are this high,” said park Superintendent Mike Reynolds.</p>
    

<p>Officials warned that heat illness and injury are cumulative and can build over the course of a day or days.</p><p>“Besides not being able to cool down while riding due to high ambient air temperatures, experiencing Death Valley by motorcycle when it is this hot is further challenged by the necessary heavy safety gear worn to reduce injuries during an accident,” the park statement said.</p><p>The soaring temperatures didn’t faze Chris Kinsel, a Death Valley visitor who said it was “like Christmas day for me” to be there on a record-breaking day. Kinsel said he and his wife typically come to the park during the winter, when it’s still plenty warm — but that’s nothing compared with being at one of the hottest places on Earth in July. </p><p>“Death Valley during the summer has always been a bucket list thing for me. For most of my life, I’ve wanted to come out here in summertime,” said Kinsel, who was visiting Death Valley’s Badwater Basin area from Las Vegas. </p><p>Kinsel said he planned to go to the park’s visitor center to have his photo taken next to the digital sign displaying the current temperature. </p><p>Across the desert in Nevada, Natasha Ivory took four of her eight children to a water park in Mount Charleston, outside Las Vegas, which on Sunday set a record high of 120 F (48.8 C).</p>
    

<p>“They’re having a ball,” Ivory told Fox5 Vegas said. “I’m going to get wet too. It’s too hot not to.”</p><p>Jill Workman Anderson also was at Mount Charleston, taking her dog for a short hike and enjoying the view.</p><p>“We can look out and see the desert,” she said. “It was also 30 degrees cooler than northwest Las Vegas, where we live.”</p><p>Triple-digit temperatures were common across Oregon, where several records were toppled — including in Salem, where on Sunday it hit 103 F (39.4 C), topping the 99 F (37.2 C) mark set in 1960. On the more-humid East Coast, temperatures above 100 degrees were widespread, though no excessive heat advisories were in effect for Sunday. </p><p>“Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors,” read a weather service advisory for the Baltimore area. “Young children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles under any circumstances.”</p>
    

<h2>Heat records shattered across the Southwest</h2><p>Rare heat advisories were extended even into higher elevations including around Lake Tahoe, on the border of California and Nevada, with the weather service in Reno, Nevada, warning of “major heat risk impacts, even in the mountains.”</p><p>“How hot are we talking? Well, high temperatures across (western Nevada and northeastern California) won’t get below 100 degrees (37.8 C) until next weekend,” the service posted online. “And unfortunately, there won’t be much relief overnight either.”</p><p>More extreme highs are in the near forecast, including possibly 130 F (54.4 C) around midweek at Furnace Creek, California, in Death Valley. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.</p>
    

<p>Tracy Housley, a native of Manchester, England, said she decided to drive from her hotel in Las Vegas to Death Valley after hearing on the radio that temperatures could approach record levels. </p><p>“We just thought, let’s be there for that,” Housley said Sunday. “Let’s go for the experience.” </p><h2>Deaths are starting to mount</h2><p>In Arizona’s Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, there have been at least 13 confirmed heat-related deaths this year, along with more than 160 other deaths suspected of being related to heat that are still under investigation, according to a recent report.</p><p>That does not include the death of a 10-year-old boy last week in Phoenix who suffered a “heat-related medical event” while hiking with family at South Mountain Park and Preserve, according to police. </p><h2>California wildfires fanned by low humidity, high temperatures</h2><p>In California, crews worked in sweltering conditions to battle a series of wildfires across the state. </p><p>In Santa Barbara County, northwest of Los Angeles, the growing Lake Fire had scorched more than 25 square miles (66.5 square kilometers) of dry grass, brush and timber after breaking out Friday. There was no containment by Sunday. The blaze was burning through mostly uninhabited wildland, but some rural homes were under evacuation orders. </p><h2>___</h2><p>This story has been edited to correct the spelling of Redding, California, and to correct that motorcyclist died Saturday, not Sunday. </p><h2>___</h2><p>Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska. Associated Press videographer Ty O’Neil in Death Valley National Park, and writer Walter Berry in Phoenix contributed to this report. </p>

            Lawful-Sanders, who hosted “The Source,” spoke with Biden last week and asked him four questions about what’s at stake in this election, his accomplishments, his debate performance and what he would say to hesitant voters. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/06/politics/video/andrea-lawful-sanders-joe-biden-interview-questions-foa-digvid">In an interview</a> Saturday with CNN’s Victor Blackwell, she said those questions were part of eight that were recommended to her by Biden aides ahead of the interview.

<p>The Lake Fire continued to rage out of control on Sunday as authorities issued the incident’s first evacuation order — for the upper Figueroa Mountain Road area.



</p><p>Firefighters from <a href="http://www.sbcfire.com/">Santa Barbara County</a> and <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/lpnf/fire">Los Padres National Forest</a> responded to the incident near Zaca Lake  just before 4 p.m. Friday, and the blaze quickly charred thousands of acres.



</p><p>Authorities issued an evacuation order encompassing Figueroa Mountain Road from the Grass Mountain trailhead to the neighborhood within Sawmill Basin, including Tunnel Road and the Figueroa Campground. 



</p><p>People affected by this evacuation order area were told to leave immediately.

</p>



<p>Later Sunday afternoon, the <a href="https://www.sbsheriff.org">Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office</a> issued a new evacuation warning for the areas north of Calzada Avenue, east of East Oak Trail Road, west of Happy Canyon, and south of the Sisquoc River due to the fire.



</p><p>The blaze northwest of Los Olivos had blackened 16,452 acres as of Sunday afternoon, with 0% containment, according to CalFire.



</p><broadstreet-zone-container-alt><broadstreet-zone alt-zone-id="67452" active-style="text-align:center; margin:0 auto;"></broadstreet-zone></broadstreet-zone-container-alt><p>The fire mostly stayed within its original footprint overnight, with some moderate growth, according to Rick Marinelli, operations section chief for the incident management team.



</p><p>“Most of that growth was in the southeast corner, the Figueroa Mountain area,” Marinelli said.

<p>Priorities for fire crews on Sunday included reinforcing containment lines along the southern edge of the fire, and keeping flames from spreading to communities to the south and southwest, he added.



</p><p>“We expect the fuel bed to heat up and, of course, when that happens we start to see an increase in fire activity,” said Marc Peebles, public information officer for the California Incident Management Team 13. 



</p><p>In addition, they are developing plans to check the fire’s spread to the north and east, including the rugged San Rafael Wilderness.



</p><broadstreet-zone-container-alt><broadstreet-zone alt-zone-id="67453" active-style="text-align:center; margin:0 auto;"></broadstreet-zone></broadstreet-zone-container-alt><p>Several large air tankers were making retardant drops throughout the day, and appeared to be targeting the eastern side of the fire.



</p><p>On Sunday morning, officials described the fire as very active and challenging, according to emergency dispatch reports. 



</p><p>The evacuation warnings issued earlier remained in effect. Those include north of Zaca Lake Road, east of Foxen Canyon Road, and south of the Sisquoc River.



</p><p>Road closures in the area include Happy Canyon Road at the Forest Service boundary, and Foxen Canyon Road at the Zaca Station Road and Alisos Canyon Road. 


</p>

<p>On Sunday, officials extended the Figueroa Mountain Road closure, which now starts 2 miles north of Highway 154. The closure previously was near Midland School.



</p><p>The Red Cross opened a shelter at the Solvang Veterans Memorial Building, 1745 Mission Drive, for evacuees affected by the fire. Red Cross volunteers will provide evacuees safe refuge along with water, meals and snacks, and additional resources.

</p><p>For shelter support, people can call 805.678.3073. For assistance with animal evacuations, call 805.698.0212. 



</p><p>On Sunday morning, a Complex Incident Management Team took operational control of the firefighting effort, a handoff to allow the initial fire crews and managers to get rest as the battle continues.



</p><p>“A significant number of firefighting resources have been ordered for the incident, including hand-crews, engines, dozers, and fixed and rotor wing aircraft,” authorities said.



</p><p>Weather is expected to continue to challenge efforts to corral the fire as the area experiences “high temperatures, drying vegetation, and little relief at night.”



</p><broadstreet-zone-container-alt><broadstreet-zone alt-zone-id="67454" active-style="text-align:center; margin:0 auto;"></broadstreet-zone></broadstreet-zone-container-alt><p>“The National Weather Service has reported that “A heat wave this intense, this long, has not been experienced in this region in 20 years,’” according to InciWeb. 



</p><p>Due to significant smoke from the fire, Santa Barbara County Public Health Department and Air Pollution Control District officials issued an air quality watch on Saturday, 



</p><p>The cause of the fire remained under investigation.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg</strong> stated that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's trip to Moscow does not change NATO's position on assistance to Ukraine, despite Hungary being a member country of the alliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Orbán's meeting with Putin</strong> was a rare trip to Russia by a European leader, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin just days before a NATO summit in Washington, D.C. where military aid to Ukraine will be discussed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NATO's position on Ukraine remains unchanged</strong>. Stoltenberg emphasized that Orbán made it clear he did not go to Moscow on behalf of NATO, and that NATO allies interact with Moscow in different ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hungary's assumptions of EU presidency</strong> took place on July 1, and Orbán has also met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and launched the "Patriots for Europe'' alliance with other right-wing nationalists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upcoming NATO summit</strong> in Washington, D.C. will focus on providing further military aid to Ukraine, with the topic expected to be at the forefront of discussions.</p>

<p>"What matters for me is that all allies have agreed that we need to do more  for Ukraine, both with this new training and assistance that NATO will provide to Ukraine, but also with the long term pledge," he said on "Face the Nation. "And I also expect that by the summit that starts next week, allies will make new announcements on more air defense and more ammunition."</p><p>Stoltenberg added that a main factor in NATO's ability to make decisions on support to Ukraine is the common goal for peace.</p><p>"And the only way to get there is to convince President Putin that he will not win on the battlefield, he has to sit down and accept a solution where Ukraine prevails as a sovereign, independent nation in Europe," Stoltenberg said. "The only way to convince Putin that he will not win on the battlefield is abroad military support to Ukraine.

<p>During former President Donald Trump's first term as president, America's allies were shocked by his open criticism of the failure of some NATO members to meet defense funding commitments, and the Trump campaign has said that calling on allies to increase their defense spending is a policy that a future Trump White House would aggressively pursue.</p><p>Trump said at a February campaign rally in South Carolina that he'd encourage Russia to "do whatever the hell they want" to NATO allies who don't pay their fair share into the Western military alliance. Referring to a conversation with an unnamed leader of a NATO country who asked him, "If we don't pay, are you still going to protect us," Trump said he replied, "Absolutely not."</p><p>The NATO Secretary General met with Mr. Biden in June at the White House ahead of this week's summit. When asked Sunday of his personal assessment of Mr. Biden as an effective leader, Stoltenberg said their conversation was a positive one.</p><p>"We had a good-we had a productive meeting. And of course, there is no way to make these big decisions on how to further strengthen NATO, enlarge NATO, new members without having a strong US leadership," he said.</p>

Aleksandr Gusev said that falling wreckage triggered the “detonation of explosive objects.” No casualties were reported, but residents of a nearby village in the Podgorensky district were evacuated, he said. Roads were also closed with emergency services, military and government officials working at the scene.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">A Ukrainian security official told The Associated Press that a strike had been carried out on a warehouse storing ammunition in the village of Serhiivka in the Voronezh region. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“The enemy stored surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, shells for tanks and artillery, and boxes of cartridges for firearms,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give the information to the media. “It is from this warehouse that the occupiers supply ammunition to their troops in Ukraine.” </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The official also said that Ukraine’s State Security Service was behind a drone attack on an oil depot in Russia's Krasnodar region the previous day.
