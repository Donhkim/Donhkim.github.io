    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>President Biden will announce a policy shift</strong> to allow hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens to apply for legal residency, according to two federal officials.</li>
<li><strong>The move is seen as a bold move</strong> ahead of the November elections and a rebuke to congressional Republicans who have largely ignored President Biden's calls for comprehensive immigration reform.</li>
<li><strong>The policy is part of a broader effort</strong> to address the country's immigration system, which President Biden has described as "broken." The move is expected to benefit an estimated 300,000 individuals.</li>
<li><strong>The policy shift is reminiscent of a similar move</strong> made by President Barack Obama in 2012, when he announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allowed undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children to apply for work permits.</li>
<li><strong>The announcement is expected to come as part of a celebration</strong> at the White House to mark 12 years since President Obama's DACA program was announced, which President Biden is expected to speak at on Tuesday.</li>

<p>Strong winds and hot temperatures on Monday hindered fire crews as they worked to contain a rapidly growing wildfire near Lebec in northern Los Angeles County.</p>



<p>The wildfire, dubbed the Post Fire, erupted near Gorman, just south of Lebec, shortly before 2 p.m. Saturday. </p>



<p>The blaze had charred at least 15,610 acres and was 8% contained as of Monday afternoon, <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2024/6/15/post-fire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cal Fire posted</a> on its website.</p>



<p>The flames engulfed the back of a McDonald’s parking lot off the 5 Freeway over the weekend, where a charred vehicle remained Monday morning. Several cars were also damaged when the flames spread to a nearby auto body shop.</p>

<p>“More than anything, the firefighters are challenged with the strong winds,” said Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Kenichi Haskett.</p>



<p>Haskett said wind gusts reached in excess of 50 miles per hour over the weekend, spreading embers more than a mile away.  </p>





<p>Fire officials say one commercial property has been destroyed, and ten other structures are threatened. Dozens of homes were threatened, and evacuation warnings were issued for areas south of Pyramid Lake, west of Interstate 5 and north of the Templin Highway.</p>



<p>“The California State Park Services have evacuated 1,200 people from Hungry Valley Park, and Pyramid Lake is closed due to the threat from the Post Fire,” Cal Fire said.</p>

<p>The state's indictment alleges the Norcross enterprise secured property and property rights along the Camden Waterfront for itself and others while collecting millions of dollars in government-issued tax credits and controlled and influenced government officials to advance the interests of the enterprise.</p><p>"On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests," Platkin said Monday. "The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents. That stops today." </p><p>Platkin described an alleged interaction between George Norcross and a developer when the 68-year-old looked to acquire what would become the Triad1828 center.</p><p>"When the developer would not initially relinquish his rights on terms preferred by the Norcross enterprise, George Norcross threatened the developer that he would, in substance and in part, 'F you up like you've never been F'd up before.' And he told the victim developer that he would make sure that the developer would never do business in Camden again," Platkin said.  </p>

<p>George Norcross' attorney Michael Critchley said Platkin didn't interview Norcross prior to Monday's press conference. </p><p>"He didn't have the decency to want to conduct this investigation, to seek to interview Mr. Norcross or allow him to come before the Grand Jury. It's a one-sided investigation with a pre-determined result," Critchley said. </p><p>The indictment has evidence from early as 2012 through 2024 and alleges the Norcross enterprise used its power over government officials to create and craft legislation that would serve their personal mission's interests. The indictment also alleges Redd and other officials used parts of Camden's city government to help the enterprise obtain property and property rights for itself and others by way of coercion and extortion. </p><p>Redd's attorney, Henry Klingeman, said the former Camden mayor was surprised by Monday's legal action: </p><blockquote><p>"She's done nothing wrong. What she has done is serve the Camden community in public and not-for-profit roles for more than three decades. She has cooperated fully with the grand jury investigation for over a year and is unaware of evidence of wrongdoing by her or others. She looks forward to fighting these false allegations in the courtroom before a judge and jury, so she can reclaim her good name that has now been tarnished by the Attorney General's unjust and unjustified action."</p></blockquote><p>Kevin Marino, the attorney representing Phillip Norcross, said they're looking forward to the trial.</p><p>"I don't think a thing that Mr. Platkin said was fair. I know for a fact none of it is supported by the evidence, with which I am extremely familiar, and we really do look forward to a trial as quickly as humanly possible."</p><p>The defendants' arraignment is scheduled for July 9 at 10 a.m. in Mercer County.</p><figure class="embed embed--type-video embed--type-content_video is-video embed--float-left embed--size-medium ">

            In an interview with CNN’s Meg Tirrell, Murthy said that the prevalence of social media use among kids is over 95%, “nearly universal.”

            But Murthy cannot act unilaterally to put a warning label on apps — that requirement would have to come from Congress, with whom Murthy pleaded to pass a bill.

            “I put forward this call for a warning because I think it’s essential that parents know what we now know, which is that there are significant harms associated with social media use,” Murthy told CNN.

            Congress has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/29/tech/big-tech-ceos-youth-safety-senate-testimony/index.html">long chastised social media companies</a>, claiming they pose harm to children. CEOs of tech companies have been grilled routinely on Capitol Hill, most notably Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — who publicly apologized to families whose children killed themselves because of online bullying and harassment. But Congress has taken little action to curb children’s social media usage.

            Murthy argued that it’s time for Congress to get serious about curbing children’s use of social media.

            “Until that point in time, when we have reliable evidence that tells us social media is safe and changes are being made and will be made in the future… parents deserve to be warned. That’s where the label comes in,” Murthy told CNN, adding that he hopes Congress will introduce legislation to add a surgeon general’s warning label on social media as soon as possible. “I think this is an urgent issue.”

            Murthy has warned about social media’s harm to children’s welfare for years. But Monday’s declaration of an emergency and his appeal to Congress represent his most urgent call to action on the issue so far.

            “We’re in the middle of a youth mental health crisis, and I’m concerned that social media is contributing to the harm that kids are experiencing,” Murthy told CNN in May 2023. “For too long, we have placed the entire burden of managing social media on the shoulders of parents and kids, despite the fact that these platforms are designed by some of the most talented engineers and designers in the world to maximize the amount of time that our kids spend on them.”

            Several states have worked to pass legislation to increase the age at which children can begin to use social apps or some of their more time-sucking features, such as algorithms that push people to engage with more content within the app. The bills have been largely bipartisan.

New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would sign legislation passed by the state legislature that would <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/04/tech/new-yorks-social-media-algorithm-block/index.html">ban social media from using algorithms</a> in children’s feeds, and the bill would also prevent tech companies from sharing information of children under 18.

            “This is much easier said than done, which is why parents should work together with other families to establish shared rules, so no parents have to struggle alone or feel guilty when their teens say they are the only one who has to endure limits,” Murthy wrote in the New York Times.

<li><strong>No nuclear weapons on board</strong>: Cuban authorities and Russia's defense ministry confirmed that none of the warships carried nuclear arms, dismissing concerns about the visit posing a threat to the region.</li>

<p>“At the invitation of the Chairman of State Affairs of the DPRK, Kim Jong Un, Vladimir Putin will pay a friendly state visit to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on June 18-19,” the Kremlin said on Monday, using North Korea’s official name.</p>
<p>North Korea’s state news agency, KCNA, also announced the visit but offered no further details.</p>
<p>Putin last visited Pyongyang in July 2000, four months after he was first elected president. He met the country’s then-leader, Kim Jong Il, Kim’s father.</p>
<p>In a letter published in Tuesday’s edition of the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of North Korea’s ruling Workers’ Party, Putin said the two countries had developed good relations and partnerships over the past 70 years based on equality, mutual respect and trust.</p>
<p>“We will develop alternative mechanisms of trade and mutual settlements that are not controlled by the West, and jointly resist illegitimate unilateral restrictions,” Putin wrote. “And at the same time – we will build an architecture of equal and indivisible security in Eurasia.”</p>
<p>He thanked North Korea for supporting <a href="/news/2024/6/17/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-843">Russia’s war in Ukraine</a> and promised to support Pyongyang to defend its interests against what he called “US pressure, blackmail and military threats”.</p>
<h2 id="axis-of-transactionalism">‘Axis of transactionalism’</h2>
<p>There are growing concerns that Pyongyang is providing Moscow with badly needed munitions for the war in Ukraine in exchange for economic assistance and technology transfers to fuel the<a href="/news/2023/12/31/north-korea-to-launch-3-new-satellites-in-2024-as-kim-warns-war-inevitable"> military modernisation programme</a> Kim has been pursuing in recent years.</p>

<p>South Korea and the United States discussed the impending visit last week and <a href="/news/2024/6/14/s-korea-us-closely-monitoring-potential-putin-kim-meeting-in-pyongyang">expressed concerns</a> about the implications for regional security of the two countries’ closer ties.</p>
<p>“For Kim Jong-un, this visit is a victory,” Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said in emailed comments. “Not only does the summit upgrade North Korea’s status among countries standing against the U.S.-led international order, it also helps bolster Kim’s domestic legitimacy.</p>
<p>“Russia cannot replace China economically, but increasing cooperation with Moscow shows that Pyongyang has options. For now at least, Putin’s war in Ukraine sets up an ‘axis of transactionalism’ among sanctions violators looking to trade yesterday’s weapons for today’s military technology.”</p>
<p>Two months after his Russia trip, North Korea announced it had successfully <a href="/news/2023/11/21/north-korea-launches-suspected-spy-satellite">put a spy satellite into orbit</a> after two previous efforts ended in failure.</p>
<p>Fragments of <a href="/news/2024/4/30/un-monitors-say-north-korean-missile-struck-ukraines-kharkiv">North Korean missiles</a> have also been found in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Any weapons trade with North Korea would be a breach of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions on North Korea over its nuclear weapons programme, which Russia, a permanent member of the council, previously endorsed. The two countries have denied arms transfers.</p>
<p>Andrei Lankov, an expert on North Korea at Kookmin University in Seoul, told The Associated Press news agency that in exchange for providing artillery munitions and short-range ballistic missiles, Pyongyang was hoping to get more sophisticated weapons from Moscow.</p>
<p>Lankov added that while Russia could be reluctant to share its state-of-the-art military technologies with North Korea, it was eager to get munitions from Pyongyang.</p>
<p>“There is never enough ammunition in a war. There is a great demand for them,” he said.</p>
<p>In recent months, Russia has been going out of its way to publicise the renaissance of its relationship with North Korea since the start of the war in Ukraine, causing alarm among the US and its allies in Europe and Asia.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>Putin’s foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said the two countries could sign a partnership agreement during the visit that would include security issues.</p>
<p>He said the deal would not be directed against any other country but would “outline prospects for further cooperation, and will be signed taking into account what has happened between our countries in recent years – in the field of international politics, in the field of economics … including, of course, taking into account security issues”.</p>
<p>Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak will join Putin on the trip.</p>
<p>The key meetings are due to take place on Wednesday, and satellite imagery suggests North Korea appeared to have been making preparations for a military parade in the centre of Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Putin will travel on to Vietnam after concluding his visit to Pyongyang.</p>

                                        <p>ABOARD THE USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER IN THE RED SEA (AP) — The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower may be one of the oldest aircraft carriers in the U.S. Navy, but it’s still fighting — despite repeated false claims by <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/houthis">Yemen’s Houthi rebels</a></span>. </p><p>The Houthis and social media accounts supporting them repeatedly have falsely claimed they hit or even sank the carrier in the Red Sea. The carrier leads the U.S. response to the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-israel-hamas-red-sea-shipping-ab6fee82e73170b7e2edbab90ed6c14c">rebels’ targeting of commercial vessels and warships</a></span> in the crucial waterway — attacks the Houthis say are aimed at bringing an end to the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">Israel-Hamas war</a></span> in the Gaza Strip. </p><p>The Eisenhower’s leader, Capt. Christopher “Chowdah” Hill, is creatively striking back on social media to counter the misinformation — and boost the morale of the ship’s 5,000 personnel — as the Navy <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/us-navy-yemen-houthis-israel-war-7a9997f9d84ac669fae69ecf819913fb">faces its most intense combat since World War II</a></span>. </p><p>“I think it’s been about two or three times in the past six months we’ve allegedly been sunk, which we have not been,” Hill told The Associated Press during a recent visit to the carrier. “It is almost comical at this point. They’re attempting to maybe inspire themselves through misinformation, but it doesn’t work on us.”</p>
    

<p>The visit by two AP journalists and others to the Eisenhower represents part of the effort the Navy has made to try to counter the Houthi claims. While on board for about a day and a half, journalists escorted by sailors crisscrossed the nuclear-powered ship’s 1,092-foot (332-meter) length. AP journalists also repeatedly circled the Eisenhower from the air in a Seahawk helicopter.</p>



<p>Other than rust on its side from the hot, humid Red Sea air and water apparently leaking from a pipe in a dining room, the ship appeared no worse for wear. Its flight deck bore no blast damage or gaping holes, just the stink of jet fuel, pooled puddles of oily water and the scream of engines before its F/A-18 fighter jets took flight. </p>
    
<p>The other half of the information warfare effort has been Hill himself, a native of Quincy, Massachusetts, something noticeable immediately in his South Boston accent. While even the secretive leader of the Houthis, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, has name-dropped the carrier in speeches while making false claims about the vessel, Hill has offered ceaselessly positive messages online about his sailors on board. </p>
    

<p>Videos of flight operations from the bridge and images of sailors eating cookies in the captain’s chair are constant staple. After one false Houthi claim, Hill responded by posting images of cinnamon rolls and muffins in the bakery on board the Eisenhower — a subtle jab at the claims. </p><p>“The whole intent of the social media outreach was to connect with families, to bring them closer to the ship,” Hill said. “So if I can post pictures of sons and daughters, husbands and wives out here, or even fathers and mothers, get it out there, it just kind of brings the family closer to us. And again, that’s our support network. But it also took on another role because everyone else was watching to see what we’re doing.”</p><p>Then there’s the “Star Wars” memes and images of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.muttswithamission.org/demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Captain Demo</a></span>, the Labrador-golden retriever mix who roams the ship as a support animal for sailors. And as far as the Houthi forces watching his postings, Hill takes special pleasure in writing about “Taco Tuesday” on the ship. </p>
    

<p>“We’re going to celebrate ‘Taco Tuesdays’ because it’s my absolute favorite day of the week. That will never end,” the captain said. “If you call that an information warfare campaign, you can. It’s just who I am, you know, at the end of the day.”</p><p>But morale remains a deep concern for Hill and other leaders on board the ship. The Eisenhower and its allied ships have gotten just one short port call during the eight-month rotation so far to Greece. The carrier also has been the most-deployed carrier among the entire U.S. fleet over the last five years, according to an analysis by <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://news.usni.org/2024/06/06/uss-dwight-d-eisenhower-busiest-u-s-carrier-over-last-5-years-deployment-data-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the U.S. Naval Institute’s news service.</a></span></p><p>One sailor, Lt. Joseph Hirl from Raleigh, North Carolina, wore a patch reading: “Go Navy, Beat Houthis.” While that’s a play on the classic call for the annual Army-Navy football game, the naval flight officer stressed that he knew the combat was deadly serious. </p>
    

<p>“It’s pretty much the day-in, day-out stress of knowing that we are being shot at definitely gives a realism to the whole experience that this is not a normal deployment,” Hirl said. </p><p>Meanwhile, munitions also remain a concern. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro told the U.S. Senate’s Armed Services Committee in May the Navy had spent at least $1 billion in armaments to fight in the Red Sea. Every leader on board the Eisenhower that the AP spoke to acknowledged the Navy was trying to use the right weapon against the Houthis, whose asymmetrical warfare sees them use far cheaper munitions. </p><p>“My sailors, my ships are priceless — that’s not a calculus I want a captain to have,” said Capt. David Wroe, the commodore overseeing the guided missile destroyers escorting the Eisenhower. “Now, using the appropriate effect weapon system on the appropriate threat to preserve magazine depth, to have more missiles, is certainly a germane tactical question.”</p>
    

<p>For now, the Eisenhower continues its patrol along with the USS Philippine Sea, a cruiser, and two destroyers, the USS Gravely and the USS Mason. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/navy-aircraft-carrier-houthis-red-sea-4529fe0d264fe749fb017d78c5cbdefd">It’s been extended twice already</a></span> and there’s always the chance it could happen again. But Hill said his sailors remained ready to fight and he remained ready to continue to captain in his style. </p><p>“I came to a revelation at some point in my career that, one of the things that all humans require is to be loved and valued,” Hill said. “So I shouldn’t be afraid, as a leader, to try to love and value everybody, and also to expect other leaders that I’m responsible for to love and value their sailors.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow AP’s coverage at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war</a></span></p>
