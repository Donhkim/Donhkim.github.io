The presiding judge in this case was ICJ  [International Court of Justice] President Nawaf Salam. He is from Lebanon, a country that does not recognize Israel’s right to exist. And in his spare time, he has <a href="https://x.com/nawafasalam/status/607020119705960449" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted such things</a> as a meme that reads ‘unhappy birthday to you: 48 years of occupation.’ He is a politician – a rabid anti-Israel politician – dressed up by the U.N. as a judge," Anne Bayefsky, the director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust, told Fox News Digital</p><p>Bayefsky, a legal expert on the U.N. who oversees Human Rights Voices, said, "And from where did his kangaroo Court get its ‘facts’ in this case?

"Hamas murderers and rapists themselves best articulate the standing of this ‘legal’ farce. They immediately reacted: ‘We welcome the decision by the World Court’ before referring to the Jewish state as the ‘Zionist enemy’ they intend to annihilate. So the fans of a decision purporting to be anti-genocide, are those who are openly committed to genocide. A U.N. court with friends in low places."</p><p>Salam said in his reading of the ruling, "The Court considers that, in conformity with its obligations under the Genocide Convention, Israel must immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part."</p><p>Hamas slaughtered nearly 1,200 people in southern Israel on Oct. 7. The jihadi terrorist movement kidnapped over 250 people, and 125 hostages are still being held captive in Rafah.</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Judge Nawaf Salam speaks at the start of a hearing in The Hague, Netherlands, May 16, 2024.</span> <span>(Reuters/Yves Herman)</span></p></div></div></div><p>Some of the IJC judges and outside legal experts have rejected the majority decision. Four of the 15 ICJ justices said the clause that Salam cited in his oral presentation does not mandate that Israel swiftly pull the plug on its military campaign in Rafah. According to this interpretation, the Jewish state is only required to stop its military operations if it "could bring about physical destruction in whole or in part." </p><p>ICJ Vice President Julia Sebutinde, from Uganda, who voted against all decisions opposed to Israel, wrote, "This measure <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204092" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">does not entirely prohibit</a> the Israeli military from operating in Rafah. Instead, it only operates to partially restrict Israel’s offensive in Rafah to the extent it implicates rights under the Genocide Convention."</p><p>Sebutinde added, "… this directive may be misunderstood as mandating a unilateral ceasefire in Rafah and amounts to micromanaging the hostilities in Gaza by restricting Israel’s ability to pursue its legitimate military objectives, while leaving its enemies, including Hamas, free to attack without Israel being able to respond."</p><p>The Ugandan jurist also voted against all restrictions that the ICJ ordered against Israel in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/top-un-court-issues-preliminary-ruling-south-africas-genocide-case-against-israel">court’s January ruling</a> that Jerusalem take steps to prevent acts of genocide as it fights Hamas terrorists in Gaza.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Hamas terrorists are seen during a military show on July 20, 2017, in Gaza City, Gaza.</span> <span>(Chris McGrath/Getty Images)</span></p></div></div></div><p id="cultivate-embed" data-question-id="660"></p><p>Aharon Barak, former Israeli Supreme Court president who has a post as an ad-hoc judge on the ICJ bench, said <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204098">in his dissenting opinion</a> that the majority view "requires Israel to halt its military offensive in the Rafah Governorate only in so far as is necessary to comply with Israel’s obligations under the Genocide Convention."</p><p>He added, "Israel is not prevented from carrying out its military operation in the Rafah Governorate as long as it fulfills its obligations under the Genocide Convention."

                                        <p>DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Palestinian medics said 22 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike Sunday on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that hit tents for displaced people.</p><p>There were no immediate details on the target, but footage from the scene showed heavy destruction. The Israeli army said it was unaware of anything occurring in the area.</p><p>A spokesperson with the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said the death toll was likely to increase as search and rescue efforts continued in Rafah’s Tal al-Sultan neighborhood west of the city center.</p><p>The society asserted that the location had been designated by Israel as a “humanitarian area.”</p><p>The strike comes two days after the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-palestinians-court-ceasefire-01d093d21a1eadaa31af5708cf1cbf38">International Court of Justice</a></span> ordered Israel to end its military offensive in Rafah.</p><p>Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, was in Rafah on Sunday and was briefed on the “deepening of operations” there, his office said.</p>
    

<p>The airstrike was reported hours after Hamas fired a barrage of rockets from <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">Gaza</a></span> that set off air raid sirens as far away as Tel Aviv for the first time in months in a show of resilience more than seven months into Israel’s massive air, sea and ground offensive.</p>



<p>There were no immediate reports of casualties in what appeared to be the first long-range rocket attack from Gaza since January. Hamas’ military wing claimed the attack. Palestinian militants have sporadically fired rockets and mortar rounds at communities along the Gaza border, and the military arm of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group later Sunday said it fired rockets at nearby communities.</p>
    
<p>The Israeli military said eight projectiles crossed into Israel after being launched from <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/rafah">Rafah</a></span>, where Israeli forces recently launched an incursion. It said “a number” of the projectiles were intercepted, and military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the launcher in Rafah was destroyed.</p>
    

<p>Earlier on Sunday, aid trucks entered Gaza from southern Israel under a new agreement to bypass the Rafah crossing with Egypt after Israeli forces seized the Palestinian side of it earlier this month. But it was not immediately clear if humanitarian groups could access the aid because of fighting.</p><p>Egypt refuses to reopen its side of the Rafah crossing until control of the Gaza side is handed back to Palestinians. It agreed to temporarily divert traffic through Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing, Gaza’s main cargo terminal, after a call between U.S. President Joe Biden and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi.</p><p>But the Kerem Shalom crossing has been largely inaccessible because of Israel’s offensive in Rafah. Israel says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter, but United Nations agencies say it is usually too dangerous to retrieve the aid.</p><p>The war between Israel and Hamas has killed nearly 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters in its count. The Health Ministry said the bodies of 81 people killed by Israeli strikes had been brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in dense, residential areas.</p>
    

<p>Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-famine-world-food-program-israel-hamas-war-476941bf2dc259f85a706408b2a665ff">are experiencing famine</a></span>.</p><p>Hamas triggered the war with its <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-hostages-0c14750240138853a70e38b0c09ef157">Oct. 7 attack into Israel</a></span>, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds some 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year.</p><p>The war has also heightened tensions in the Israeli-occupied <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-norway-spain-palestinians-israel-f218311fdd7a94511c69e5a5d81fe6d8">West Bank</a></span>. Palestinian authorities on Sunday said Israeli forces shot dead a 14-year-old boy near the southern West Bank town of Saeer. The Israeli army did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><h2>SOUTHERN GAZA LARGELY CUT OFF FROM AID</h2><p>Southern Gaza has been largely cut off from aid since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion into Rafah on May 6. Since then over 1 million Palestinians, many already displaced, have fled the city.</p>
    

<p>Egypt’s state-run Al-Qahera TV aired footage of what it said were trucks entering Gaza through Kerem Shalom. Khaled Zayed, head of the Egyptian Red Crescent in the Sinai Peninsula, which handles aid delivery from the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing, said 200 aid trucks and four fuel trucks were scheduled to be sent to Kerem Shalom on Sunday.</p><p>Northern Gaza receives aid through two land routes that Israel opened during global outrage after <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-aid-workers-killed-2d08786a9839dfc402632c7ca745acca">Israeli strikes killed seven aid workers</a></span> in April.</p><p>A few dozen trucks enter Gaza daily through a U.S.-built floating pier, but its capacity remains far below the 150 trucks a day that officials hoped for. Aid groups say 600 trucks a day are needed.</p><h2>ISRAEL DETAINS MAN OVER MUTINY THREAT</h2><p>Israel’s military said it had detained a suspect over a widely circulated video in which a man dressed as a soldier threatens mutiny. In the video, the man says tens of thousands of soldiers were ready to disobey the defense minister over his suggestion that Palestinians should govern Gaza after the war and pledged loyalty to Netanyahu alone.</p>
    

<p>The military spokesman, Hagari, said the man has been removed from reserve duty. The man has not been publicly identified. It was not clear when or where the video was made. The prime minister’s office released a brief statement condemning all forms of military subordination.</p><h2>NETANYAHU RESISTS PRESSURE TO END WAR</h2><p>Netanyahu has said Israel must take over Rafah to eliminate Hamas’ remaining battalions and achieve “total victory” over the militants, who recently regrouped in other parts of Gaza where the military has operated.</p><p>Netanyahu faces growing pressure to make a deal with Hamas to free the remaining hostages, something Hamas has refused without guarantees for <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-end-insurgency-0fcb4e20821ba8c0e49edf6571486d3b">an end to the war</a></span> and full withdrawal of Israeli troops.

CBS Boston has learned that the same suspect may be responsible for a similar incident which may have occurred at a McDonald's restaurant in Plymouth. </p><p>A man stabbed four girls inside a theater at an AMC multiplex in Braintree at around 6 p.m. local time, the Braintree Police Department reported. Braintree is located about 12 miles south of Boston. </p><p>Police said the man entered the multiplex without a ticket, went into a theater, and then attacked the four girls, ages 9 to 17, unprovoked. The girls were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. </p><p>"It's so heartbreaking that's what I'll be thinking about the rest of the night is seeing those kids coming down the steps and just crying. They looked really stunned like they just saw a horror movie, not a kid's movie," said Matteo Rojas, who was at the theater at the time of the stabbing.</p><p>An AMC employee who was working the snack counter at the time of the attack described the suspect as wearing "an oversized trench coat, sunglasses, and a long blonde wig."</p><p>The suspect fled the scene in a black SUV, but police were able to obtain his license plate number using video footage and located him in Plymouth after he was reportedly involved in a "similar assault" there, police said. CBS Boston learned that the second possible attack may have occurred around 7 p.m. at a McDonald's restaurant, where a 21-year-old woman and a 29-year-old male were allegedly stabbed. Both victims suffered non-life-threatening injuries and are being treated at a nearby hospital. Police said it appears the "crimes are related."</p>

            The closing arguments in Trump’s historic hush money criminal case will give prosecutors from District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office an opportunity to explain to the 12 jurors how each witness they called and piece of evidence they presented bolsters their case for a guilty verdict on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.

            “There’s plenty of moments during trial where you’re getting a piece of testimony or you’re introducing a document or other exhibit, and the jury is thinking, ‘Well, how does this fit in?’ That’s unavoidable. It’s your job at closing to weave it all together, and to make it make sense. And so that will be especially the case here because this is a long trial,” said CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor.

            Former New York prosecutor Bernarda Villalona said prosecutors will use their closing arguments “to tell the story from the very beginning.” She said that unlike their opening statement, which lasted about 40 minutes, prosecutors’ final remarks in the case could go on for several hours and feature a visual aid like a PowerPoint presentation to help walk the jury back through some of the key evidence.

            “The boring is over. The boring part was having them sit down to hear it,” added Villalona, referring to the 12 jurors. “Interestingly enough, the boring part is actually the most important part of the case because the boring part is what gives you the documents. The star witness in this case are the documents, and the documents speak for themselves.”

            Trump’s attorneys will present their closing arguments first on Tuesday, followed by the arguments from prosecutors. Once both sides finish their arguments, Judge Juan Merchan will instruct the jury as to the charges it must consider against the former president; then, the jurors will begin their deliberations. The judge has said he expects this to happen on Wednesday.

            The closing arguments will begin exactly a week after the defense rested its case on Tuesday and more than five weeks after opening statements were delivered and the first witness, former tabloid executive David Pecker, took the stand.

            The prosecution called 20 witnesses over 19 days in court, with their testimony totaling over 50 hours. Many of their witnesses were not household names, though some, including former Trump attorney Michael Cohen and adult film actress Stormy Daniels — whose alleged affair with Trump is at the center of the case — were high-profile figures whose testimony is no doubt seared into jurors’ minds. (Trump has denied the alleged affair.)

            For its part, Trump’s team called just two witnesses: a paralegal who entered phone records into evidence and Robert Costello, an attorney who was in talks with Cohen to represent him in 2018.
    </p>

            Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree to cover up the reimbursement of hush money payments made before the 2016 election to Daniels. If convicted, Merchan could sentence Trump to probation or a sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison, with a maximum of 20 years.

            Prosecutors will likely contend during their closing arguments that each of their witnesses plays a key role in the case, despite their professional rank or proximity to the alleged crimes. They will probably also have to push back against claims by the defense that Cohen, prosecutors’ star witness, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-best-day-analysis/index.html">undermines their case</a> because of his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/takeaways-day-17-trump-hush-money-trial-michael-cohen/index.html">history of dishonesty</a>, Honig said.
    </p>

            “The prosecution’s argument will be that all the evidence interlocks and is corroborated and that you don’t have to rely on any one witness’s word on its own. They will say this is a documents case,” he explained, going on to describe the various accounting documents presented during the trial.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000r3b6k7x9sp8mr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “And they’ll say, ‘Michael Cohen’s here to guide you through it, but you don’t need to believe him — everything he says is backed up’” by evidence and other testimony, Honig said.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000s3b6kb7dpsvby@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            During the trial, prosecutors walked jurors repeatedly through the 11 invoices, 12 vouchers and 11 checks — the 34 documents that make up the falsified business records charges — that were used to pay Cohen $420,000 in 2017, money that included the reimbursement for the $130,000 hush money payment “grossed up” to account for taxes.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000t3b6k2bbheaiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Prosecutors showed jurors how Cohen sent the Trump Organization monthly invoices for $35,000, which were processed by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/06/politics/takeaways-from-day-12-of-the-donald-trump-hush-money-trial/index.html">the Trump company’s controller</a> so checks could be cut. Trump signed nine of the 11 checks. (The other two checks were paid from Trump’s revocable trust and signed by former Trump Org. Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and one of Trump’s sons.)
    </p>

            Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who served for a time as a top prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, said she expects the prosecution to present several themes in their closing arguments, including that most of the people who testified for their case were “Trump witnesses … who you would expect to be friendly to him.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000v3b6k3c2cec4t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The other theme, she said, could be: “Look at the kind of people Trump values,” with prosecutors arguing the former president chose to surround himself with people such as Cohen and Pecker, who were doing Trump’s bidding ahead of the 2016 election.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000w3b6kut1m0e82@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “These are his people, he chose them. And he shouldn’t now get the benefit of, ‘Because they’re flawed you can’t rely on them,’” prosecutors might argue, Agnifilo said.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000x3b6ke2ct16iz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “And even if you do not rely on them,” she said, echoing Honig, “the third theme is going to be, ‘You don’t have to, because everything is corroborated either by other witnesses or documents or records or Trump’s own words.’”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000y3b6k4l97uo8x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The length of the trial may not ultimately prove to be much of a challenge for jurors during their deliberations, Villalona said, since they were allowed to jot down notes during the proceedings and will be able to request some parts of the trial be read back to them.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000z3b6kmzg54249@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “The good thing about New York is that they could request to have the whole trial read back to them and the judge will do that,” she said. “So if they forgot something David Pecker said on Day 1 or 2 of the trial, they can have that read back.” She added that any of the exhibits put into evidence could also be sent to the jurors for them to take a closer look as they mull a verdict.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn00103b6knsh0cqd7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Still, the closing arguments from each side will be carefully crafted to win not only a verdict in their favor, but also to mark each attorneys’ place in the historic trial, Villalona mused.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn00113b6kdmhgg3y3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “The prosecution and the defense is going to give the closing argument of their career,” she said.

Bruises had formed around her right eye. Her collarbone ached.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Late Saturday night, Yvette said she was getting ready for bed when her TV went off and she heard her parents panicking, ushering her into a closet. The four of them crammed in together, hugging one another. She recalled her mom saying a prayer before it felt like they were being thrown around.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Then everything went black.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">When Yvette woke up, she heard rain and began trying to find help. Family members who live in nearby Denton and Sanger came to stay with her while her parents and sister were in the hospital with non life-threatening injuries.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">”It’s all just a lot,” Yvette said.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">In an annex building of Valley View’s First Baptist Church, the Red Cross set up an emergency shelter that can house up to 58 people. Thirty five people sheltered there Saturday night, said Tauna Conk, a Red Cross program manager.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">The church recently constructed the building and outfitted it with showers in the event it would ever need to be used as an emergency shelter, Conk said.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">With a small backhoe and a dump trailer in tow, Denton resident Brian Burleson pulled up to the shelter about 11:45 a.m. Sunday in his white pick up truck.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">”I’m here to volunteer,” he told a Red Cross worker.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Burleson was planning to host a family cookout to celebrate his birthday, but he scratched his plans and drove to Valley View to help when he learned of the tornado miles from his ranch.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">”It’s the right thing to do,” he said.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Down the road in the one-stop-light town, a line of people carrying donations snaked through the door of Valley View United Methodist Church. The church opened its doors Saturday night to collect donations, which started rolling in less than two hours after the storm hit, said Pastor Beata Hall.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">”This community has done what it always does and respond swiftly,” she said. “All I did was open the door last night and people came.”</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Valley View is a tight-knit community, Hall said. Two weeks ago, just 63 kids made up the graduating class of the one high school in town.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">“They know each other here,” Hall said. “These people are kind, caring and generous.”</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">In the church’s fellowship hall, volunteers organized bags of clothing, shoes, hangers, tampons, diapers, snacks, paper towels and soap as residents from nearby towns parked their pickup trucks in front of the church to unload hundreds of cases of water.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">”For the most immediate physical needs, we’re doing OK,” Hall said. “The long-term need is going to be rebuilding. We’ll need folks with construction knowledge. Some companies have already reached out to donate lumber.”</p><h2 class="body-text-header">Collin County</h2><p class="body-text-paragraph">In Celina, the most severe damage was confined to two streets, Prairie Meadow Lane and Myrtle Drive, according to Celina Mayor Ryan Tubbs.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">The area of about 15 houses saw six completely destroyed, but only minor injuries were reported, Tubbs said. Some pets were reported missing, but all residents were accounted for.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Homeowners said the tornado hit shortly before 11:30 p.m. Saturday night. Families sought shelter in pantries and storm cellars. Some described how quickly the pressure changed in the air, causing their ears to pop. The storm passed through within minutes.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Terry Sharber, 51, was among those huddled in a shelter with his family. Sharber, who survived Hurricane Katrina in 2005, said he and his wife used a Collin County FEMA grant to construct the storm cellar.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">”The second that it opened up, there were hundreds of people on the waiting list,” he said. “My wife, who stayed up, got us on the very front.”</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Strewn wreckage floated in Sharber’s backyard pool. His tractor lay overturned in his backyard.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">Prairie Meadow Lane, which Tubbs said has been dubbed “Firefighter Row” by locals, is home to multiple City of Frisco firefighters. After the tornado subsided, those firefighters’ colleagues arrived to help neighbors who had already sprung into action.</p><p class="body-text-paragraph">While some homes remained standing, others were substantially damaged, their roofs partially or completely ripped off.

A previous estimate had been 60 homes.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Land is still sliding, rocks are falling, ground soil is cracking due to constant increased pressure and ground water is running, thus the area is posing an extreme risk for everyone,” Aktoprak said in a statement.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">More than 250 houses near the stricken area of Yambali village in Enga province had been abandoned and about 1,250 people had been displaced, the agency said, with many taking temporary shelter with relatives and friends.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“People are using digging sticks, spades, large agricultural forks to remove the bodies buried under the soil,” Aktoprak said. The revised toll was “not solid” because it was based on the average size of families per household in the region, he said.</p><gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/05/png_mudslide-zip/giv-13425q3X5DAeCi3W0","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Papua New Guinea map","format":{"display":0,"theme":0,"design":0},"elementId":"f3818655-4932-46a3-bcff-ac94981fc894","isMainMedia":false}' config='{"renderingTarget":"Web","darkModeAvailable":false,"inAdvertisingPartnerABTest":false,"assetOrigin":"https://assets.guim.co.uk/"}' data-island-status="hydrated"><figure id="f3818655-4932-46a3-bcff-ac94981fc894" data-alt="Papua New Guinea map" data-testid="interactive-element-Papua%20New%20Guinea%20map" data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-19xqv4h"></figure></gu-island><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Aktoprak would not speculate on the possibility that the actual toll could be higher. “It’s difficult to say,” he told the Associated Press. “We want to be quite realistic. We don’t want to come up with any figures that would inflate the reality.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Rescue teams had abandoned hope of finding any more survivors under earth and rubble piled up to 8 metres deep, he said. “People are coming to terms with this so there is a serious level of grieving and mourning,” Aktoprak said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Social media footage posted by villagers and local media teams showed people clambering over rocks, uprooted trees and mounds of dirt desperately searching for survivors. Women could be heard weeping in the background.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The IOM said a primary school, several small businesses and stalls, a guesthouse and a petrol station had also been buried.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The agency said the population of the village was relatively young and it feared that most fatalities would be children aged 15 and younger. The national government was considering whether it needed to officially request more international support.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The landslide hit a section of main road near the Porgera gold mine in a geographically remote region of the country. The only way to reach the mine and the area cut off from the rest of Enga province was by helicopter.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Army engineers were at the site but heavy equipment such as excavators required for the rescue were yet to arrive, authorities said, adding that the community may not allow use of excavators until their mourning obligations were complete.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Government authorities were establishing care and evacuation centres on safer ground on either side of the massive swath of earth, which left debris strewn across a 80 sq miles (200 sq km) zone after a limestone mountainside sheared away.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">A humanitarian convoy had also started distributing bottled water, food, clothing, hygiene kits, kitchen utensils, tarpaulins, as well as personal protective equipment to the nearly 4,000 people known to be living in the affected area.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">However, aid groups and local government officials have said the number is probably higher because the area is a refuge for people displaced by tribal violence nearby. At least 26 men were killed in Enga province in February in an ambush.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Eight more local men were killed in a clash between two rival clans on Saturday in a longstanding dispute, unrelated to the landslide. About 30 homes and five retail businesses were burned down in the fighting, officials said.<br><br>
 Soldiers were providing security for the aid convoys heading to the region and Aktoprak said he did not expect tribal combatants would target them, butnoted opportunistic criminals might take advantage of the mayhem.<br><br>
 “This could basically end up in carjacking or robbery,” Aktoprak said. “There is not only concern for the safety and security of the personnel, but also the goods because they may use this chaos as a means to steal.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Billy Joseph, Papua New Guinea’s defence minister, and the national disaster centre director, Laso Mana, were flying on Sunday from Port Moresby by helicopter to the provincial capital, Wabag, to see what was needed, authorities said.<br><br>
 The US and Australia, the island’s biggest foreign aid donor, are among several governments that have publicly stated their willingness to provide more help to the developing nation, most of whose 10 million inhabitants are subsistence farmers.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><em>Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p></div></div>
