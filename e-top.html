The decision came after a gunman in Las Vegas attacked a country music festival with semiautomatic rifles equipped with the accessories.</p><p></p><p>The gunman fired more than 1,000 rounds into the crowd in 11 minutes, sending thousands of people fleeing in terror as hundreds were wounded and dozens killed.</p><p></p><p>The ruling thrust guns back into the center of the political conversation with an unusual twist as Democrats decried the reversal of a GOP administration’s action and many Republicans backed the ruling.</p>
    

<p></p><p>The 6-3 majority opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas found the Justice Department was wrong to declare that bump stocks transformed semiautomatic rifles into illegal machine guns because, he wrote, each trigger depression in rapid succession still only releases one shot.</p><p></p><p>The ruling reinforced the limits of executive reach and two justices — conservative Samuel Alito and liberal Sonia Sotomayor — separately highlighted how action in Congress could potentially provide a more lasting policy, if there was political will to act in a bipartisan fashion. </p><p></p><p>Originally, imposing a ban through regulation rather than legislation during Donald Trump’s presidency took pressure off Republicans to act following the massacre and another mass shooting at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/school-shooting-parkland-florida-2084c00ad62a93bee257da06f1b907cc">a high school in Parkland, Florida</a></span>. Prospects for passing gun restrictions in the current divided Congress are dim.</p>
    
<p></p><p>President Joe Biden, who supports gun restrictions, called on Congress to reinstate the ban imposed under his political foe. Trump’s campaign team meanwhile, expressed respect for the ruling before quickly pivoting to his endorsement by the National Rifle Association.</p>
    

<p></p><p>As Trump courts gun owners while running to retake the presidency, he has appeared to play down his own administration’s actions on bump stocks, telling NRA members in February that “nothing happened” on guns during his presidency despite “great pressure.” He told the group that if he is elected again, “No one will lay a finger on your firearms.” </p><p></p><p>The 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas was carried out by a high-stakes gambler who killed himself, leaving his exact motive a mystery. A total of 60 people were killed in the shooting, including Christiana Duarte, whose family called Friday’s ruling tragic.</p><p></p><p>“The ruling is really just another way of inviting people to have another mass shooting,” said Danette Meyers, a family friend and spokesperson. “It’s unfortunate that they have to relive this again. They’re really unhappy.”</p>



<p></p><p>Republican Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, the former county sheriff in Las Vegas who has refused to sign multiple gun control measures the Democrat-controlled Legislature has sent to his desk, said in a statement Friday, “While I have always been a supporter of the Second Amendment, I have been a vocal opponent of bump stocks since my time in law enforcement, and I’m disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision today.”</p>
    

<p></p><p>The opinion comes after the same Supreme Court conservative supermajority handed down <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-mississippi-state-government-delaware-california-massachusetts-3983cecfd1107c263d5309ec0d80a966">a landmark decision</a></span> expanding gun rights in 2022. The high court is also expected to rule in another gun case in the coming weeks, challenging a federal law intended to keep guns away from people under <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-guns-restrictions-domestic-violence-f75dc9b59d8cd02acf17d220ecf6ebb9">domestic violence restraining orders</a></span>. </p><p></p><p>The arguments in the bump stock case, though, were less about Second Amendment rights and more about whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a Justice Department agency, had overstepped its authority.</p><p></p><p>Bump stocks are accessories that replace a rifle’s stock, the part that rests against the shoulder. Invented in the 2000s, they harness the gun’s recoil energy so that the trigger bumps against the shooter’s stationary finger, allowing the gun to fire at a similar speed as an automatic weapon.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Court majority found that the 1934 law against machine guns defined them as weapons that could automatically fire more than one shot by a single function of the trigger. Bump stocks don’t fit that definition because “the trigger must still be released and reengaged to fire each additional shot,” Thomas wrote. He also pointed to over a decade of ATF’s findings that claimed bump stocks weren’t automatic weapons.</p><p></p><p>The plaintiff, Texas gun shop owner and military veteran Michael Cargill, applauded the ruling in a video posted online, predicting the case would have ripple effects by hampering other ATF gun restrictions. “I’m glad I stood up and fought,” he said.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-right="">

            A Texas bankruptcy judge has rejected a proposed liquidation of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ company Free Speech Systems, the parent company of Infowars, saying that a denial of the bankruptcy plan was, in his opinion, in the best interest of the creditors.

            The rejection of the bankruptcy plan leaves many questions to sort out in the decision’s wake. Among them: What happens next for Infowars? And what legal avenues remain for the victims’ families to collect the massive sum Jones still owes them?

            This judgment could be viewed as a partial victory for Jones, who fought the liquidation proposal – but so too did some families, whose attorneys said they’ll benefit more from the bankruptcy plan’s dismissal by going after Jones’ assets immediately – rather than waiting for a prolonged bankruptcy procedure to play out.

            Lopez noted that the case is far from over. The interim trustee, and later the permanent trustee﻿, in Jones’ personal case will ultimately decided Infowars’ fate.

            Jay Westbrook, a University of Texas bankruptcy law professor, said that Infowars could still be sold by the court-appointed trustee to pay some of the damages owed to the families, but it would likely not fetch a high price.

            Jones founded Infowars, an influential conspiracy empire, in the late 1990s. Over the years, Jones has used the media company to poison the public discourse with lies and conspiracy theories, and he also enriched himself, making millions of dollars in the process.

            The families argued to the court that there is “no prospect” the Jones’ company could produce a proper reorganization plan under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would allow the company to remain operational through its restructuring.

            The judge’s rulings on Friday would not prevent Jones from spreading conspiracy theories and lies online. X CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/09/business/alex-jones-restored-x-elon-musk-poll/index.html">restored Jones’ social media account</a> in December 2023 after a five-year ban from the platform.

            But the Sandy Hook families are hoping to seize Jones’ social media accounts, arguing they are a key part of his Infowars business that allow Jones to promote his brand.

            Since founding Infowars in the late 1990s, Jones has pushed several conspiracy theories, including the lie that the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, mass school shooting was a so-called “false flag” operation staged by the government and that the grieving family members of 20 child victims were “actors.” Jones makes money on those conspiracy theories by hawking high-priced dietary supplements to his audience.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.) has announced that he will not seek re-election after a court-ordered redistricting made his path to reelection harder.</li>
<li>The redistricting order by the Supreme Court requires Graves to run in a newly created Black-majority district, which would make it difficult for him to win re-election.</li>
<li>Graves had considered running against Rep. Julia Letlow (R-La.), a fellow Republican, in the neighboring 5th Congressional District.</li>
<li>Graves stated that running for Congress this year would "cause actual permanent damage to Louisiana's great representation in Congress" and affected his decision not to seek re-election.</li>
<li>The redistricting order was a response to allegations of racial gerrymandering, where the Supreme Court ordered Louisiana to use a new map that redrew the 6th Congressional District to create a second Black-majority district.</li>

  <p>Another plan being prepared by the Biden administration would streamline the process for so-called DREAMers and other undocumented immigrants to request waivers that would make it easier for them to obtain temporary visas, such as H-1B visas for high-skilled workers, the sources said.</p><p>The measures, the sources added, could be announced as early as Tuesday, but a plan has not been finalized by the administration.

<p>Some Democratic lawmakers have already been invited to Tuesday's immigration event at the White House, three congressional officials told CBS News, requesting anonymity to share private invitations.</p><p>A White House official said no final decisions had been made. White House spokesperson Angelo Fernandez Hernandez previously said the administration is "committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system."</p><p>The "Parole in Place" plan would be the largest immigration program for unauthorized immigrants since DACA, a policy that former President Barack Obama announced in 2012 as a "stopgap" measure to protect DREAMers in light of congressional inaction on immigration. </p><p>The policy would benefit a subset of the <a href="https://www.fwd.us/news/parole-in-place-citizen-spouses/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">estimated 1.1 million</a> unauthorized immigrants with American citizen spouses, as long as they meet the residency requirement and other rules.

    </p>
<p>The move would further underscore an increased willingness by President Biden to take executive actions on immigration ahead of the presidential election in November. Just last week, Mr. Biden invoked his executive authority <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-executive-order-immigration-border-asylum/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">to enact a partial ban on asylum claims</a></span> at the southern border, a move that has <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-border-asylum-order-aclu-lawsuit/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">already been challenged</a></span> in federal court by the American Civil Liberties Union. </p><p>Just like the border executive action, the "Parole in Place" program will likely face legal challenges, possibly from Republican-led states, which have filed multiple lawsuits against Mr. Biden's more generous immigration policies.</p><p>The program would almost certainly garner vocal opposition from Republican lawmakers, who have increasingly taken strong stances against "amnesty" for those living in the U.S. illegally.</p><p>"Biden's border is still in crisis and his latest idea is amnesty. This will invite more chaos," <a href="https://x.com/SenatorLankford/status/1800544722202825148" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, the lead Republican negotiator of a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-immigration-deal-james-lankford-face-the-nation/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">border security deal brokered</a></span> by the White House and a group of senators earlier this year.</p><p>Still, Mr. Biden has been arguing that he's acting unilaterally on immigration because Congress failed to pass that agreement, which was rejected by most Republican lawmakers. Political analysts also believe the "Parole in Place" policy could help Mr. Biden's chances of earning more support from Latino voters, especially those in mixed-status families that would benefit from the move.</p><p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that oversees the legal immigration system, has administered a more limited "Parole in Place" program for military families for over a decade. The policy allows some undocumented immigrants who are immediate relatives of U.S. service members or veterans to obtain green cards, without having to leave the country.</p>

            But the video shared by the Post on X cropped out the kneeling parachute rigger, omitting the context of why Biden walked away from the group. “President Biden appeared to wander off at the G7 summit in Italy, with officials needing to pull him back to focus,” the social-media post said.

            The White House on Thursday criticized the Post and outlets for characterizing the president as “confused” and for using an “artificially narrow frame” to make it appear as if the president was wandering off from the skydiving demonstration.

            The video of Biden at the skydiving demonstration appeared to have first been flagged by the Republican National Committee, which posted the uncropped video of Biden giving the parachutists a thumbs-up shortly after the demonstration took place.

            Other right-wing outlets quickly followed suit. Sinclair stations posted stories saying Biden appeared to wander away at the summit.

            Other world leaders who attended the event with Biden, though, pushed back on the idea that he was confused.

            While emerging technologies like artificial intelligence continue to proliferate and create concern about the impact that misinformation will have on voters ahead of November, the video shared by the Post shows that relatively low-tech efforts, like cropping videos to show Biden out of context, can still be powerful tools to reinforce the idea that the 81-year-old president has lost control of his mental faculties.

            Every day that Biden is president, he sets a new record as the oldest person to ever hold that office. He would be 86 at the end of a potential second term. And recent events, including special counsel Robert Hur’s report that described the president being portrayed as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” and recent Biden missteps where he appeared to confuse long-dead world leaders with their living contemporaries, have served to reinforce those concerns.

            The White House has pushed back on criticism over Biden’s age by pointing toward his packed travel schedule. In just the last two weeks, the president has traveled to France to commemorate D-Day, back to the United States to comfort a son who just became a convicted felon and then embarked on another transatlantic journey to Italy, where he participated in high-stakes discussions about future US support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion. From there he heads straight to California to participate in a star-studded fundraiser.

            Biden’s campaign and his family members have said his age and the experience that comes with it are an asset to his role, and not a liability. The campaign has sent first lady Dr. Jill Biden to shore up older voters’ support of the president.

            “Joe and that other guy are essentially the same age,” the first lady said at an event in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Thursday. “Let’s not be fooled. But what this election is about, it’s about the character of the person leading our country.”

                                        <p>ABOARD THE USS LABOON IN THE RED SEA (AP) — The U.S. Navy prepared for decades to potentially fight the Soviet Union, then later Russia and China, on the world’s waterways. But instead of a global power, the Navy finds itself locked in combat with a shadowy, Iran-backed rebel group based in Yemen.</p><p>The U.S.-led campaign against <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/houthis">the Houthi rebels</a></span>, overshadowed by <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">the Israel-Hamas war</a></span> in the Gaza Strip, has turned into the most intense running sea battle the Navy has faced since World War II, its leaders and experts told The Associated Press.</p><p>The combat pits the Navy’s mission to keep international waterways open against a group whose former arsenal of assault rifles and pickup trucks has grown into a seemingly inexhaustible supply of drones, missiles and other weaponry. Near-daily attacks by the Houthis since November have seen more than 50 vessels clearly targeted, while <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-houthi-attacks-shipping-inflation-124d5445bec8ce6864112e3095646308">shipping volume has dropped in the vital Red Sea corridor</a></span> that leads to the Suez Canal and into the Mediterranean.</p>
    

<p>The Houthis say the attacks are aimed at stopping the war in Gaza and supporting the Palestinians, though it comes as <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-un-detentions-israel-hamas-war-966dce0c3d7cd96679b3c3562ee57068">they try to strengthen their position in Yemen</a></span>. All signs suggest the warfare will intensify — putting U.S. sailors, their allies and commercial vessels at more risk.</p>



<p>“I don’t think people really understand just kind of how deadly serious it is what we’re doing and how under threat the ships continue to be,” Cmdr. Eric Blomberg with the USS Laboon told the AP on a visit to his warship on the Red Sea.</p>
    
<p>“We only have to get it wrong once,” he said. “The Houthis just have to get one through.”</p><h2>Seconds to act</h2><p>The pace of the fire can be seen on the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, where the paint around the hatches of its missile pods has been burned away from repeated launches. Its sailors sometimes have seconds to confirm a launch by the Houthis, confer with other ships and open fire on an incoming missile barrage that can move near or beyond the speed of sound.</p>
    

<p>“It is every single day, every single watch, and some of our ships have been out here for seven-plus months doing that,” said Capt. David Wroe, the commodore overseeing the guided missile destroyers.</p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-red-sea-attacks-israel-f820b848eb76fa3ecc8056ca332cabae">One round of fire on Jan. 9</a></span> saw the Laboon, other vessels and F/A-18s from the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower shoot down 18 drones, two anti-ship cruise missiles and a ballistic missile launched by the Houthis.</p><p>Nearly every day — aside from a slowdown during the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan — the Houthis launch missiles, drones or some other type of attack in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait that connects the waterways and separates Africa from the Arabian Peninsula.</p><p>The Navy saw periods of combat during <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ceb6e7a86bf14a9a8d8ecf81c9dcc7ef">the “Tanker Wars” of the 1980s in the Persian Gulf</a></span>, but that largely involved ships hitting mines. The Houthi assaults involve direct attacks on commercial vessels and warships.</p><p>“This is the most sustained combat that the U.S. Navy has seen since World War II — easily, no question,” said Bryan Clark, a former Navy submariner and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. “We’re sort of on the verge of the Houthis being able to mount the kinds of attacks that the U.S. can’t stop every time, and then we will start to see substantial damage. … If you let it fester, the Houthis are going to get to be a much more capable, competent, experienced force.”</p>
    

<h2>Dangers at sea and in the air</h2><p>While the Eisenhower appears to largely stay at a distance, destroyers like the Laboon spend six out of seven days near or off Yemen — the “weapons engagement zone,” in Navy speak.</p><p>Sea combat in the Mideast remains risky, something the Navy knows well. In 1987, an Iraqi fighter jet fired missiles that struck the USS Stark, a frigate on patrol in the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war, killing 37 sailors and nearly sinking the vessel.</p><p>There’s also the USS Cole, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/terrorist-attacks-norfolk-archive-virginia-bdab9821fdfb61baee15df8f535514a8">targeted in 2000 by boat-borne al-Qaida suicide bombers</a></span> during a refueling stop in Yemen’s port city of Aden, which killed 17 on board. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthis-attacks-red-sea-israel-hamas-12e8bf184bfa08669bbe17b8e1f99b0f">AP journalists saw the Cole patrolling the Red Sea</a></span> with the Laboon on Wednesday, the same day the Houthis launched a drone-boat attack against a commercial ship there that disabled the vessel.</p>
    

<p>That commercial ship was abandoned on Friday and left adrift and unlit in the Red Sea, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said.</p><p>Rear Adm. Marc Miguez, the Navy’s commander for its Carrier Strike Group Two, which includes the Eisenhower and supporting ships, said the Navy had taken out one underwater bomb-carrying drone launched by the Houthis as well during the campaign.</p><p>“We currently have pretty high confidence that not only is Iran providing financial support, but they’re providing intelligence support,” Miguez said. “We know for a fact the Houthis have also gotten training to target maritime shipping and target U.S. warships.”</p>
    

<p>Asked if the Navy believed Iran picks targets for the Houthis, Miguez would only say there was “collaboration” between Tehran and the rebels. He also noted <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/us-navy-houthi-attacks-red-sea-shipping-iran-8e55669e4d18cbc7007654640fa5fdc1">Iran continues to arm the Houthis</a></span>, despite U.N. sanctions blocking weapons transfers to them.</p><p>Iran’s mission to the United Nations told the AP that Tehran “is adept at thwarting the U.S. strategy in a way that not only strengthens (the Houthis) but also ensures compliance with the pertinent resolutions.”</p><p>The risk isn’t just on the water. The U.S.-led campaign has carried out numerous airstrikes targeting Houthi positions inside Yemen, including what the U.S. military describes as radar stations, launch sites, arsenals and other locations. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/yemen-war-us-british-airstrikes-israel-hamas-12f99b7afc389a703f8dd333f2376b20">One round of U.S. and British strikes on May 30</a></span> killed at least 16 people, the deadliest attack acknowledged by the rebels.</p><p>The Eisenhower’s air crews have dropped over 350 bombs and fired 50 missiles at targets in the campaign, said Capt. Marvin Scott, who oversees all the air group’s aircraft. Meanwhile, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-us-military-reaper-drone-7acd2a91856fe78e5d0c5c308e9460a8">the Houthis apparently have shot down multiple MQ-9 Reaper drones</a></span> with surface-to-air missile systems.</p><p>“The Houthis also have surface-to-air capabilities that we have significantly degraded, but they are still present and still there,” Scott said. “We’re always prepared to be shot at by the Houthis.”</p><h2>A stalemated war</h2><p>Officers acknowledge some grumbling among their crew, wondering why the Navy doesn’t strike harder against the Houthis. The White House hasn’t discussed the Houthi campaign at the same level as <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-ceasefire-negotiations-ab6925549d8f523a6e5c61e88e7eec8a">negotiations over the Israel-Hamas war</a></span>.</p><p>There are several likely reasons. The U.S. has been indirectly trying to lower tensions with Iran, particularly after <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/strait-of-hormuz-vessel-33fcffde2d867380e98c89403776a8ac">Tehran launched a massive drone-and-missile attack on Israel</a></span> and now <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-program-iaea-us-mideast-tensions-a4a18eb0f8cb5105e5423eb1ddc4a806">enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels</a></span>.</p><p>Meanwhile, there’s the Houthis themselves. The rebel group has battled a Saudi-led coalition into a stalemate in a wider war that’s killed more than 150,000 people, including civilians, and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters.</p><p>The U.S. directly fighting the Houthis is something the leaders of the Zaydi Shiite group likely want. Their motto long has been “God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse the Jews; victory to Islam.” Combating the U.S. and siding publicly with the Palestinians has some in the Mideast praising the rebels.</p><p>While the U.S. and European partners patrol the waterways, Saudi Arabia largely has remained quiet, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/saudi-arabia-yemen-war-peace-talks-d2a9ad9efe1ab0b4f5d51597098f46a2">seeking a peace deal with the Houthis</a></span>. Reports suggest some Mideast nations have asked the U.S. not to launch attacks on the Houthis from their soil, making the Eisenhower’s presence even more critical. The carrier has had its deployment extended, while its crew has had only one port call since its deployment a week after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Houthi attacks continue to depress shipping through the region. Revenue for Egypt from the Suez Canal — a key source of hard currency for its struggling economy — has halved since the attacks began. AP journalists saw a single commercial ship moving through the once-busy waterway.</p><p>“It’s almost a ghost town,” Blomberg acknowledged.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow AP’s coverage at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war</a></span></p>

  <p>"We would condemn humanity to a future without hope if we took away people's ability to make decisions about themselves and their lives, by dooming them to depend on the choices of machines," he said.

But this is the reason why every one of these is happening. But, I do deliver in the end. That’s what’s important.”</p><p>With the upcoming Tesla robotaxi, Musk said some vehicles in the fleet would be owned by Tesla, while others would be owned by customers. Tesla owners would have something akin to “Airbnb” functionality with their cars, Musk said, giving them control over their vehicles' timing and frequency of participation in the robotaxi network.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="0"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Research firms like Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest see robotaxis as the main driver for the company's long-term $2,600 price target.</p><p>“ARK estimates that nearly 90% of Tesla’s enterprise value and earnings will be attributed to the robotaxi business in 2029,” ARK analyst Tasha Keeney wrote in a note. “Meanwhile, electric vehicles could approximate a quarter of total sales and ~10% of Tesla’s earnings potential, as we believe the robotaxi business will have much higher margins.”</p><p>Tesla’s robotaxi reveal event is set for Aug. 8.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-1">Visitors view the Tesla Bot humanoid robot of Tesla "Optimus" at the 2023 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, China, July 6, 2023.

AI/robotics: autonomous driving and Optimus,” Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas wrote on Thursday night.</p><p>“I could argue [Tesla] is one of the best AI plays in the market, when you look out over the next two, three, four years,” Wedbush’s Ives added in an interview with Yahoo Finance.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-2">Tesla's product roadmap from its 2024 shareholder meeting presentation.
