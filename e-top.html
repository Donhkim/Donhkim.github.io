                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is telling lawmakers that President Joe Biden is preparing to sign off on an executive order that would shut down <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/asylum-seekers">asylum requests</a></span> at the U.S.-Mexico border once the average number of daily encounters hits 2,500 between ports of entry, with the border reopening only once that number declines to 1,500, according to several people familiar with the discussions. </p><p>The impact of the 2,500 figure means that the executive order could go into immediate effect because daily figures are higher than that now.</p><p>The Democratic president is expected to unveil the actions — his most aggressive unilateral move yet to control the numbers at the border — at the White House on Tuesday at an event to which <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-border-immigration-mayors-biden-edinburg-brownsville-c67840732b442d109a84a03754ce121b">border mayors</a></span> have been invited. </p><p>Five people familiar with the discussions on Monday confirmed the 2,500 figure, while two of the people confirmed the 1,500 number. The figures are daily averages over the course of a week. All the people insisted on anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public. </p>




    

<p>While other border activity, such as trade, is expected to continue, the 1,500 threshold at which the border would reopen for asylum seekers could be hard to reach. The last time the daily average dipped to 1,500 encounters was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p><p>Senior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout Tuesday. But several questions remain about how the executive order would work, particularly how much cooperation the U.S. would need from Mexican officials to carry out the executive order. </p>
    
<p>The president has been deliberating for months over how to act on his own after <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-ukraine-aid-border-security-386dcc54b29a5491f8bd87b727a284f8">bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border</a></span> collapsed because Republicans defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the southern border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico.</p>
    

<p>Biden administration officials had waited until after Mexico’s presidential elections, held Sunday, to move on the U.S. president’s border actions. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-elections-president-governorships-lopez-obrador-d7fef5c7ac964072401ba6d9809dd7d4">Mexico elected Claudia Sheinbaum</a></span>, the nation’s first female leader, and Biden said in a statement Monday that he was committed to “advancing the values and interests of both our nations to the benefit of our peoples.” The two spoke on the phone Monday, although White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say whether they spoke about the pending order.</p><p>“We continue to look at all options on the table,” Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling with Biden on Air Force One on Monday evening.</p><p>The executive order will allow Biden to declare that he has pushed the boundaries of his own power after lawmakers, specifically congressional Republicans, killed off what would have been the toughest border and asylum restrictions in some time. Biden’s order is aimed at trying to head off any potential spike in border encounters that could happen later this year, closer to the November elections. </p>
    

<p>Trump’s campaign said in a statement that the order would not be effective and that if “Biden truly wanted to shut down the border, he could do so with a swipe of the same pen.”</p><p>Trump, describing illegal border crossings as an “invasion,” is trying to blame Biden for recent incidents of migrants being charged with violent crimes, though <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-riley-immigrants-crime-63181cbc7a89fe9fe28b1d0cf84c8b9a">many studies have shown</a></span> that immigrants typically commit violent crimes at lower rates than those born in the U.S.</p><p>For Biden’s executive order, the White House is adopting some policies directly from the bipartisan Senate border deal, including the idea of limiting asylum requests once the encounters hit a certain number. The administration wants to encourage migrants to seek asylum at ports of entry by using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s CBP One app, which schedules about 1,450 appointments per day.</p>
    

<p>Administration lawyers have been planning to tap executive powers outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives a president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it is deemed “detrimental” to the national interest. It is the same legal rationale used by Trump to take some of his toughest actions on migration as president. </p><p>That has advocacy groups already preparing to challenge Biden’s immigration order in court. </p><p>“We will need to review the (executive order) before making final litigation decisions,” said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who led several of the most high-profile challenges to Trump’s border policies. “But a policy that effectively shuts down asylum would raise clear legal problems, just as (it) did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum.”</p>
    

<p>The White House is also sure to encounter vocal resistance from many Democratic lawmakers. California Sen. Alex Padilla, an outspoken critic of the Senate’s earlier border bill, said the pending executive order was “just not the solution we need and it’s very incomplete as a strategy.”</p><p>Padilla, who was also briefed by the White House on the proposal, wants an approach that works with countries throughout Latin America to address the poverty and unrest that drives migration to the United States. In recent weeks, Padilla has also pressed the White House for executive actions that benefit immigrants and said the message he has heard in return is, “We’re working on it.”</p><p>Biden will unveil his executive order flanked by several border mayors whom the White House invited for the announcement. Texas Mayors John Cowen of Brownsville and Ramiro Garza of Edinburg both confirmed their invitations, and San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria’s office also said the White House invited the mayor, but he could not attend due to scheduling difficulties.</p><p>Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who said he was briefed on the plan, said he wishes the White House would have taken executive action a long time ago and said cooperation from Mexico would continue to be critical as the administration implements the order. </p><p>“If you think about the logistics, where else can they go?” Cuellar said. “If they’re not going to let them in, where do they go? Do they return them (to Mexico), or do they try to deport as many as they can? We did add a lot more money into ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) so they can deport, but the easiest thing, of course, is just send them back to Mexico. You’ve got to have the help of Mexico to make this work.”</p><p>Jennifer Babaie, an attorney at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas, said she would be alarmed if Biden issued formal deportation orders without an opportunity to seek asylum. Advocates worry he may attempt that under the 212(f) provision.</p><p>Pandemic-era expulsion authority known as Title 42 had “a silver lining” for migrants because they could try again without fearing legal consequences, Babaie said. But a formal deportation order would expose them to felony prosecution if they attempted again and it would impose bars on legally entering the country in the future.</p><p>“This is even more extreme than (Title 42), while still putting people in harm’s way,” Babaie said.</p><p>—</p><p>Associated Press writers Elliot Spagat in San Diego and Fatima Hussein on Air Force One contributed to this report.</p>

<li>US Attorney General Merrick Garland has rejected House Republicans' threats to hold him in contempt, calling it an "unprecedented and unfounded" attack on the Department of Justice.</li>
<li>Garland said that the Justice Department will not be intimidated and will continue to do its job without political influence, and will defend the democracy without backing down.</li>
<li>Garland also pushed back against conspiracy theories surrounding the criminal conviction of former President Donald Trump, denying claims that the guilty verdict was somehow controlled by the Justice Department.</li>
<li>The Attorney General's rebuke came amid a move by House Republicans to hold Garland in contempt over the DOJ's refusal to share audiotapes of President Joe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur.</li>
<li>The hearing before the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee was focused on allegations that the DOJ under Garland has become "politicized and weaponized".</li>

                                        <p>PHOENIX (AP) — The first heat wave of the season is bringing triple-digit temperatures earlier than usual to much of the Southwest U.S., where forecasters warned residents Tuesday to brace for “dangerously hot conditions” with highs expected to top 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 Celsius) in the days ahead in Las Vegas and Phoenix.</p><p>By Wednesday, most of an area stretching from southeast California to central Arizona will see “easily their hottest” weather <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/record-heat-deadly-climate-change-humidity-south-11de21a526e1cbe7e306c47c2f12438d">since last September</a></span>, and record daily highs will be in jeopardy throughout the region, the National Weather Service said.</p><p>Excessive <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/heat-wave-summer-weather-stay-cool-tips-026c835fe84b7113736dba0265379130">heat warnings have been issued</a></span> from 10 a.m. Wednesday to 8 p.m. Friday for parts of southern Nevada and Arizona. The unseasonably hot weather is expected to make its way into parts of the Pacific Northwest by the end of the week.</p><p>“We’re looking at high temperatures well in the 90s and 100s, temperatures well above average for the time of year — some spots as much as 10 to 20 degrees above average,” National Weather Service meteorologist Marc Chenard in College Park, Maryland, said Tuesday.</p>
    

<p>Southeast California, southern Nevada and much of Arizona will be affected most, he said.</p>



<p>“As we go through the week, some of those higher temperatures are also going to spread north, potentially getting into portions of the Pacific Northwest as well,” Chenard said.</p><p>“We do have several days where these temperatures will persist, and that usually adds to the impact. If there is just one day, it doesn’t tend to have as much of an impact,” he said. “But when you start getting two, three or four days this heat and then even warm temperatures at night, you start to see the impact increase.”</p>
    
<p>The unseasonably hot weather already has taken a toll in some areas. The U.S. Border Patrol reported on Monday that four migrants died last weekend from heat-related causes while attempting to cross the border in southeast New Mexico, near El Paso, Texas. </p>
    

<p>Border Patrol El Paso Sector Chief Anthony Good urged migrants not to try to cross the border in the extreme heat.</p><p>“The desert environment is extremely unforgiving, especially during the summer months,” Good said. “We urge anyone considering crossing illegally to understand the severe risks involved”</p><p>Fire crews will be on high alert especially in Arizona, where fire restrictions went into effect before Memorial Day in some areas and will be ordered by Thursday across most of the western and south-central parts of the state, authorities said.</p><p>Fire forecasters at the Southwest Coordination Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, said weather in the region doesn’t typically become so hot until mid- or late June.</p><p>“It does seem like Mother Nature is turning up the heat on us a little sooner than usual,” Tiffany Davila, spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management, said Monday evening.</p><p>“We can’t back down from a fire just because it’s pushing 113 degrees outside. But we do keep a close eye on everybody in the field. Make sure they are keeping hydrated and taking more breaks than they normally would,” she told The Associated Press.</p>
    

<p>Highs on Monday reached 110 F (43.3 C) at Death Valley National Park in California near the Nevada line, 103 F (39.4 C) in Phoenix and 105 F (40.5 C) in Needles, California.</p><p>In Las Vegas, where the high topped out at 103 F (39.4 C) on Monday, temperatures will soar to 10 to 15 degrees above normal during the second half of the week — peaking at 111 (43.8 C) on Thursday.</p><p>A high of 120 F (48.8 C) is forecast for Thursday at Furnace Creek in Death Valley.</p><p>The current forecasted high of 113 F (45 C) for Phoenix on Thursday would break the daily record high of 111 F (43.8 C) set in 2016. </p><p>Last summer, Phoenix <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/heat-warming-climate-environment-temperature-phoenix-arizona-d7db7d44effcdab554b6a742288eb2be">saw a record 31 straight days</a></span> of at least 110 degrees F (43.3 C), stretching from the last day of June through the entire month of July.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Arizona proposes anti-immigration law</strong>: The Arizona state legislature is expected to pass a resolution that would direct law enforcement agencies to arrest migrants who cross the border illegally, following a Texas-inspired law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copycat Texas law</strong>: The proposed law is similar to Texas's Senate Bill 4, which has been challenged in court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-state trend</strong>: This is part of a broader trend in the United States, with multiple states enacting laws inspired by Texas's immigration laws. Laws mimicking Texas's Senate Bill 4 have been enacted in Iowa, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, while laws penalizing undocumented immigrants have been passed in Tennessee, Florida, and Georgia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arrest and reporting of migrants</strong>: The proposed Arizona law would require law enforcement to arrest and report migrants who cross the border illegally to federal authorities, while laws in Tennessee, Florida, and Georgia allow for the more swift penalization and reporting of undocumented immigrants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Voter approval in November</strong>: If the Arizona legislature passes the resolution, it will be put to a vote in November.</p>

<li>Conservative leader Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will face off in a televised debate on Tuesday, with the aim of boosting their respective parties' chances in the upcoming UK election.</li>
<li>Nigel Farage, a populist Brexit-backer, has announced his candidacy for Parliament at the helm of the right-wing party Reform UK, which may siphon off votes from the Conservative Party, particularly among socially conservative older voters.</li>

<p>The two-way leaders’ debate on Tuesday comes a day after populist Brexit-backer Nigel Farage dealt a blow to Sunak’s hopes of winning the July 4 election by announcing <a href="/news/2024/6/3/nigel-farage-announces-uk-election-candidacy-in-surprise-u-turn">he will run for Parliament</a> at the helm of the right-wing party Reform UK.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 3 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>Farage kicked off his campaign on Tuesday in the eastern England seaside town of Clacton-on-Sea, where he visited a pub before a protester doused him in what appeared to be a milkshake. She was later arrested on suspicion of assault.</p>
<p>Farage is making an eighth attempt to win a seat in the House of Commons. His seven previous tries all failed.</p>
<p>The return of the populist politician, a key player in Britain’s 2016 decision to leave the European Union, is a major headache for Sunak’s party, which already trails Labour in opinion polls. Farage and Reform appear likely to siphon off votes of socially conservative older voters that the Tories have been targeting.</p>
<p>He claimed the Conservatives, who have been in office since 2010, had “betrayed” Brexit supporters because immigration had gone up, rather than down, since the United Kingdom left the EU.</p>

<p>Farage has injected volatility into an election that will almost certainly result in either Starmer or Sunak becoming Britain’s leader.</p>
<p>The two men will go head-to-head in a debate on broadcaster ITV, with Sunak likely to stress his stewardship of the economy, which has seen inflation fall to just over 2 percent from a peak of more than 11 percent in late 2022.</p>
<p>Starmer, whose main campaign refrain is the single word “change”, aims to persuade voters tired of the Tories that Labour can be trusted with the UK’s economy, borders and security.</p>
<p>Further debates are scheduled by other broadcasters before polling day, some featuring multiple party leaders and some with just the two frontrunners.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>Sunak announced the election on May 22, calling it six months earlier than required and making an inauspicious start in a widely mocked rain-sodden speech outside 10 Downing Street.</p>
<p>A YouGov survey Monday – using the same nationwide modelling that correctly predicted the 2017 and 2019 general elections – showed Labour on track to win 422 of the 650 seats in Parliament.</p>

Daniel Hagari, spokesman for the Israeli military, said at a news briefing on Monday that the four hostages were believed to have been killed together “several months ago” near Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, while Israeli forces were operating in the area. The military identified the men as Haim Perry, Yoram Metzger, Amiram Cooper and Nadav Popplewell.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Admiral Hagari said the decision to announce the hostages’ deaths on Monday was based on “additional intelligence, which had been verified recently, making it possible to determine today that the four are no longer alive,” adding that he knew “difficult questions” would arise about the circumstances of their deaths. The families of the four had been notified that their bodies were being held by Hamas, and the circumstances of their deaths were “still under examination,” the Israeli military said.</p><div class="css-1dv1kvn"><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The Hostages Families Forum, a support group, released a statement demanding that the Israeli government immediately negotiate a deal for the remaining hostages to be freed. It said the four who were declared dead on Monday were alive when they were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nirim and Kibbutz Nir Oz, and that there had been “signs of life” in the interim period.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">“Their murder in captivity is a mark of disgrace and a sad reflection on the significance of delaying previous deals,” the group said.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The pressure on Mr. Netanyahu to end the fighting in Gaza has grown since last week, when President Biden publicly endorsed what he said was a three-phase cease-fire proposal put forward by Israel. But Mr. Netanyahu’s far-right political allies have <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-netanyahu-ceasefire.html" title="">threatened to collapse his government</a> if Israel makes any agreement that ends the war without eliminating Hamas.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">On Monday, Mr. Netanyahu told lawmakers in a closed-door meeting that President Biden had not presented the “whole picture” when he described the proposed cease-fire, according to a person who attended the meeting and requested anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. But the Israeli leader expressed openness to a 42-day pause in the fighting, the person said, embracing at least part of the first phase of the cease-fire plan.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">A spokesman for Hamas’s military wing, Abu Ubaida, had said on March 1 that three of the men now declared dead — Mr. Cooper, Mr. Metzger and Mr. Perry — were among seven hostages who had been killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Hamas said on May 11 that the fourth man, Mr. Popplewell, had died from injuries sustained in an Israeli airstrike more than a month before and that he had not been able to receive proper medical care because of Israel’s destruction of Gaza’s hospitals. Earlier that day, Hamas had released an undated video of him in captivity.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The New York Times <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/06/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostages-dead.html" title="">reported in February</a> that Israeli intelligence officers had concluded that at least 30 hostages had died since the start of the war. Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, said in March that it believed Israeli military operations in the enclave may have killed more than 70 hostages in total.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Israeli forces <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/16/world/middleeast/israel-hostage-killings-gaza.html" title="">shot and killed three of the hostages in December</a> while they were bearing a makeshift white flag, an incident that shocked Israeli society and renewed outrage with the government for continuing its offensive in Gaza instead of negotiating another truce to allow for more hostages to be released.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Another hostage, a grandmother who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, was most likely <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/05/world/middleeast/israel-oct-7-hostage-killed.html" title="">killed by Israeli fire from a helicopter</a>, the Israeli military said in April.</p></div><button class="css-182hr0m" data-testid="Show-More" type="button" aria-hidden="true">Show more</button></div></div>
