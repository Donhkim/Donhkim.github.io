    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nikki Haley, former UN Ambassador and 2024 Republican presidential candidate, has announced that she will be voting for Donald Trump in the general election despite their past rivalry during the Republican primary calendar.</li>
<li>Haley's endorsement is significant given their intense and often personal rivalry during the primary contest, where she accused Trump of causing chaos and disregarding important international alliances.</li>
<li>Despite her endorsement, Haley emphasized that Trump still has work to do to win over voters who supported her during the primary campaign and continue to support her in ongoing primary contests.</li>
<li>Haley's decision comes after she shuttered her own bid for the GOP nomination two months ago, but did not immediately endorse Trump, instead taking time to assess her relationship with him.</li>
<li>Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Haley's announcement, while President Joe Biden's campaign is reportedly working to capitalize on the news, potentially viewing it as a boost to the Democratic nominee's chances.</li>

            The women were kidnapped during a Hamas raid on Israel’s Nahal Oz military base, near the northern Gaza Strip, as part of the militant group’s attacks on Israel that left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 250 captured and taken hostage in the enclave.

            Following the attack, Israel launched a war in Gaza that has killed <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/13/middleeast/death-toll-gaza-fatalities-un-intl-latam/index.html">more than 35,000 Palestinians</a> over the past seven months, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.

            Video of the ordeal has been made public as pressure mounts on Netanyahu to secure the release of the Israelis still held by Hamas, which his government has made a key goal of the Gaza offensive. Numerous attempts to strike a hostage-for-ceasefire deal with Hamas have faltered in recent months, infuriating those in Israel campaigning for the return of the captives.

            Netanyahu said Wednesday he is “horrified by the video showing the abduction of our dear field observers.” He said Israel will “continue doing everything to bring them home” and the “cruelty of Hamas terrorists only enhances my determination to fight forcefully until the destruction of Hamas, to ensure that what we’ve seen this evening will not happen ever again.”

            War cabinet minister Benny Gantz said when he first watched the video it made his “stomach turn.” However, Gantz said, “the responsibility of leaders is not only to look reality in the eye – it is to create a different reality even when it comes to difficult decisions.

            Efforts to reach a deal that would pause the war in Gaza and allow the release of hostages have repeatedly been dashed.

The New York Times last week published a photograph of an inverted American flag raised at Alito’s home in Virginia in 2021. Alito said the upside-down US flag was raised by his wife and was a response to a spat with neighbors.

    </p>

            The heated arguments played out in a morning proceeding in Fort Pierce, Florida, that had been scheduled for Walt Nauta, one of former President <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-45">Donald Trump</a>’s co-defendants, to present arguments that special counsel Jack Smith’s team had selectively and vindictively brought charges against him.

            But the hearing quickly diverted into a longstanding disagreement over an August 2022 meeting between prosecutor Jay Bratt and Nauta’s defense attorney, Stanley Woodward. Woodward has claimed in court proceedings and filings that Bratt attempted to pressure him into convincing Nauta to cooperate against Trump by threatening to affect a potential judgeship nomination. Cannon did not issue a ruling from the bench on Nauta’s motion that the case be dismissed on those grounds.
    </p>

            Cannon seemed skeptical of those arguments, while also expressing concern about a jury’s ability to understand legal nuances in the case at a future trial.

            The judge quickly scolded Harbach, telling the attorney to “calm down.” Cannon questioned why there was no evidence gathered of what happened in the 2022 conversation, saying, “Why do those comments [about Woodward] have to be made?”

            “That is not true, and I didn’t say that,” Harbach shouted back. The prosecutor said that that there was no recording of the conversation between Bratt and Woodward, but that Smith’s team has preserved any record they have of the meeting.

            The Florida judge spent hours Wednesday entertaining theories from defense attorneys about what they say were problems in the investigation and prosecution of the former president, Nauta and the third co-defendant, Carlos De Oliveira.

            Cannon’s slow pace in the case <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/03/politics/legal-fights-judge-trump-documents-trial/index.html">has attracted criticisms from outside legal experts</a>, who have accused the Trump-appointed judge of playing into delay tactics by the GOP’s presumptive White House nominee. Unless Cannon picks up her momentum considerably, it appears unlikely the charges will go before a jury before the 2024 election. If Trump wins the White House, it is expected he will make the charges against him go away.

            In her order Sunday allowing for the filings to be made public, Cannon took a shot at prosecutors – one of several swipes she’s made at Smith’s office. She expressed “concern” the special counsel’s office had sought redactions of information in the newly unsealed filings after previously giving its OK for that information to be published in full in earlier court filings.

            “The Court is disappointed in these developments. The sealing and redaction rules should be applied consistently and fairly upon a sufficient factual and legal showing,” Cannon wrote. “And parties should not make requests that undermine any prior representations or positions except upon full disclosure to the Court and appropriate briefing.”

<ol>
<li>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has temporarily removed its police chief, John Thomas, pending an investigation into the handling of a violent melee on campus earlier this month.</li>
<li>The incident involved a fight between masked counter-protesters and a pro-Palestinian student group, with officers taking over 2 hours to intervene and make arrests, leading to criticism from the California governor's office and others.</li>
<li>UCLA Vice Chancellor for Strategic Communications, Mary Osako, announced the reassignment of Chief Thomas on Tuesday, stating that the decision was made by Rick Braziel, Vice Chancellor for the newly created Office of Campus Safety.</li>
<li>The union representing UCLA police officers has criticized the decision to remove Chief Thomas, citing the university's responsibility for the failure of the protest response and calling for the public to reject attempts to shift blame to law enforcement.</li>
<li>The violent incident at UCLA led to over 200 arrests and forced the campus to close and switch to remote learning, highlighting concerns about the safety and security of students and staff on campus.</li>

Since then, "the Palestinians have taken important steps towards a two-state solution," the Norwegian government said. </p><p>It said that the World Bank determined that a Palestinian state had met key criteria to function as a state in 2011, that national institutions have been built up to provide the population with important services. </p>

<p>"The war in Gaza and the constant expansion of illegal settlements in the West Bank still mean that the situation in Palestine is more difficult than it has been in decades," the Norwegian government said.</p><h2>Ireland followed suit  </h2><p>Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris also made his announcement Wednesday, saying it was a move coordinated with Spain and Norway, "an historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine." He said the move was intended to help move the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to resolution through a two-state solution.</p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/22/143a9994-93bd-4e2f-98f5-6d02c9158800/thumbnail/620x413/a087e14d6f1f354e400109038a032688/gettyimages-2153530304.jpg?v=83093a0dd27502f0a52cd68b1c5b8b6e#" alt="IRELAND-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-CONFLICT-POLITICS-DIPLOMACY " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/22/143a9994-93bd-4e2f-98f5-6d02c9158800/thumbnail/620x413/a087e14d6f1f354e400109038a032688/gettyimages-2153530304.jpg?v=83093a0dd27502f0a52cd68b1c5b8b6e 1x, https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/22/143a9994-93bd-4e2f-98f5-6d02c9158800/thumbnail/1240x826/28ef4570283eaaf223ba8bcf11c70505/gettyimages-2153530304.jpg?v=83093a0dd27502f0a52cd68b1c5b8b6e 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E"></span>

<h2>Reactions starting</h2><p>A senior official of Hamas, which is embroiled in the war with Israel in Gaza, said Wednesday the "brave resistance" of the Palestinian people spurred Norway, Ireland and Spain to recognize a Palestinian state, Agence France-Press reports.</p><p>"These successive recognitions are the direct result of this brave resistance and the legendary steadfastness of the Palestinian people. ... We believe this will be a turning point in the international position on the Palestinian issue," Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas political bureau member, told AFP.</p><p>The Palestine Liberation Organization, seen worldwide as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, called the moves by Norway, Ireland and Spain "historical moments in which the free world triumphs for truth and justice," according to AFP, citing a post on X from Hussein al-Sheikh, secretary general of the PLO executive committee.</p><p>Meanwhile,  Israel's far right national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, visited Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque compound, declaring the contested holy site belongs "only to the state of Israel."</p><p>Ben-Gvir said the visit was a response to the move by Norway, Ireland and Spain. "We will not even allow a statement about a Palestinian state," he said.</p><p>The hilltop compound is revered by Jews and Muslims, and the conflicting claims have led to numerous rounds of violence in the past.</p><p>Israel allows Jews to visit the compound, but not to pray there. But the visit is likely to be seen around the world as a provocation.  </p>
