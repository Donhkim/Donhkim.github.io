    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Supreme Court limits obstruction charges</strong>: The Supreme Court has limited the power of prosecutors to pursue obstruction charges against those who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact on hundreds of defendants</strong>: The decision could potentially force a reopening of the cases against hundreds of defendants who were charged with obstruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Former President Donald Trump</strong>: The decision also has implications for former President Donald Trump, who was charged with obstruction, although the impact is more limited than initially predicted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Counts of electoral votes</strong>: At issue was a law passed in 2001 that bars people from obstructing an official proceeding, specifically the counting of electoral votes in Congress that was interrupted by the riot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supreme Court's narrow scope</strong>: The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision narrowed the scope of the law, potentially forcing a reopening of the cases against at least some of the rioters.</p>

            The Supreme Court on Friday limited the power of prosecutors to pursue obstruction charges against those who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/supreme-court-january-6-ruling-06-28-24/index.html">rioted at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021</a>, narrowing a law that could have tacked years onto the sentences of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/supreme-court-january-6-rioters/index.html">hundreds of defendants</a>.

            The decision had implications for former President Donald Trump, who was charged with the same crime – though that impact appeared to be more limited than some initially predicted. Two Trump nominees – Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh – joined the majority.

            At issue was a law passed in the wake of the Enron scandal in 2001 that bars people from obstructing an official proceeding. The Biden administration argued that the counting of electoral votes in Congress that was interrupted by a mob of Trump supporters counted.

            The people who pushed their way into the Capitol aren’t the only ones who are facing the obstruction charge. Special counsel Jack Smith also charged former President Donald Trump with the same crime.

            But even before the court’s decision was handed down, Smith made clear that the charge was based on different circumstances in Trump’s case. Those charges were based on Trump’s attempt to organize and send a slate of fake electors to Congress – actions that look a lot more like the evidence tampering that was targeted by the obstruction law.
    </p>

            Smith has argued in court filings that the charge against Trump should survive even if the court ruled the way it did, pointing particularly to the indictment’s allegations about the fraudulent electors plot.

            The Supreme Court’s opinion did not address the fake electors scheme specifically. But Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, nodded to the possibility that the obstruction statute would be violated “by creating false evidence – rather than altering incriminating evidence.”

            The likely best-case scenario, an adviser to Trump’s legal team told CNN, is that the new ruling weakens the obstruction charges against Trump, rather than prompting the charge to be dismissed. That narrowing might not even happen until appeal, the adviser said, adding that they did not expect the new ruling to delay the trial proceedings the way the pending immunity dispute could.

            Still, Trump’s legal team expects to file motions based the decision in an attempt to get obstruction counts against the former president dismissed, according to a source familiar with the matter.

            Approximately 249 cases involving the obstruction charge are pending – and in every one of those cases, the defendant faces other charges, including felonies and misdemeanors.

            The Justice Department has taken steps for months in its prosecutions of rioters to shore up the obstruction charges.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Supreme Court overturns 40-year-old Chevron decision</strong>: The Supreme Court has overturned the Chevron decision, a ruling that had made it easier for federal agencies to regulate the environment, public health, workplace safety, and consumer protections.</li>
<li><strong>Major implications for business and regulation</strong>: The decision is expected to have significant implications for businesses, as it could make it more difficult for the government to regulate industries and implement policies. Billions of dollars are potentially at stake in challenges that could be spawned by the ruling.</li>
<li><strong>Conservative justices deliver victory to business interests</strong>: The six conservative justices on the Court voted to overturn the Chevron decision, while the three liberal justices dissented. The decision is seen as a victory for business interests and a blow to the regulatory state.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on agency authority and judicial review</strong>: The decision does not grant courts absolute authority to review agency actions, but rather requires them to exercise independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority. This could lead to more challenges to regulatory decisions and fewer agency actions.</li>
<li><strong>Chief Justice Roberts writes majority opinion</strong>: Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion in the case, which does not call into question prior cases that relied on the Chevron decision. However, Justice Elena Kagan, in her dissenting opinion, argued that the decision is another example of the Court's efforts to roll back agency authority despite congressional direction to the contrary.</li>

<p>But in dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that the assurance rings hollow. “The majority is sanguine; I am not so much,” she wrote. </p><p>Kagan called the latest decision “yet another example of the Court’s resolve to roll back agency authority, despite congressional direction to the contrary.” Just a day earlier, the same lineup of justices <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-regulatory-agencies-sec-36f16444b1d4fc52985fdb68896362bb">stripped the Securities and Exchange Commission</a></span> of a major tool used in fighting fraud.</p>
    

<p>The court ruled in cases brought by <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-business-maine-fish-national-oceanic-and-atmospheric-administration-659d9fdea4aa653552ae5d10ded7da41">Atlantic herring</a></span> fishermen in New Jersey and Rhode Island who challenged a fee requirement. Lower courts used the Chevron decision to uphold a 2020 National Marine Fisheries Service rule that herring fishermen pay for government-mandated observers who track their fish intake.</p><p>Conservative and business interests strongly backed the fishermen’s appeals, betting that a court that was remade during Republican Donald Trump’s presidency would strike another blow at the regulatory state.</p><p>The court’s conservative majority has previously reined in environmental regulations and stopped the Democratic Biden administration’s initiatives on COVID-19 vaccines and student loan forgiveness.</p><p>The justices hadn’t invoked Chevron since 2016, but lower courts had continued to do so.</p><p>Forty years ago, the Supreme Court ruled 6-0, with three justices recused, that judges should play a limited, deferential role when evaluating the actions of agency experts in a case brought by environmental groups to challenge a Reagan administration effort to ease regulation of power plants and factories.</p>
    

<p>“Judges are not experts in the field, and are not part of either political branch of government,” Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in 1984, explaining why they should play a limited role.</p><p>But the current high court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has been increasingly skeptical of the powers of federal agencies. Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas all had questioned the Chevron decision. </p><p>They were in Friday’s majority, along with Justice Amy Coney Barrett.</p><p>Roberts’ opinion took direct aim at what Stevens wrote 40 years ago. “That depends, of course, on what the ‘field’ is. If it is legal interpretation, that has been, ‘emphatically,’ ‘the province and duty of the judicial department’ for at least 221 years,” Roberts wrote, quoting from the Marbury v. Madison decision that established the Supreme Court as the last word in interpreting laws and the Constitution.</p><p>Kagan, though, said that in getting rid of Chevron “gives courts control over matters they know nothing about.” She read a summary of her dissent aloud in the courtroom to emphasize her disagreement with the majority.</p>
    

<p>Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor joined Kagan in dissent.</p><p>Opponents of the Chevron doctrine argue that judges applied it too often to rubber-stamp decisions made by government bureaucrats. Judges must exercise their own authority and judgment to say what the law is, the court said Friday, adopting the opponents arguments.</p><p>Bill Bright, a Cape May, New Jersey-based fisherman who was part of the lawsuit, said the decision to overturn Chevron would help fishing businesses make a living. “Nothing is more important than protecting the livelihoods of our families and crews,” Bright said in a statement.</p><p>Reacting to the decision, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the ruling “is yet another deeply troubling decision that takes our country backwards. Republican-backed special interests have repeatedly turned to the Supreme Court to block common-sense rules that keep us safe, protect our health and environment, safeguard our financial system, and support American consumers and workers.” </p>
    

<p>Federal agencies and the Justice Department had already begun reducing their reliance on the Chevron decision in crafting and defending new regulations.</p><p>Environmental, health advocacy groups, civil rights organizations, organized labor and Democrats on the national and state level had urged the court to leave the Chevron decision in place.</p><p>“The Supreme Court is pushing the nation into uncharted waters as it seizes it seizes power from our elected branches of government to advance its deregulatory agenda,” Sambhav Sankar, a lawyer with the environmental group Earthjustice, said after the ruling. “The conservative justices are aggressively reshaping the foundations of our government so that the President and Congress have less power to protect the public, and corporations have more power to challenge regulations in search of profits. This ruling threatens the legitimacy of hundreds of regulations that keep us safe, protect our homes and environment, and create a level playing field for businesses to compete on.”  </p><p>Gun, e-cigarette, farm, timber and home-building groups were among the business groups supporting the fishermen.

                                        <p>SEATTLE (AP) — A decision by the U.S. Supreme Court allowing cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces will allow San Francisco to begin clearing homeless encampments that have plagued the city, the mayor said Friday as she applauded the ruling.</p><p>The case is the most significant on the issue to come before the high court in decades and comes as cities across the country have wrestled with the politically complicated issue of how to deal with a rising number of people without a permanent place to live and public frustration over related health and safety issues. </p><p>“We will continue to lead with services, but we also can’t continue to allow people to do what they want on the streets of San Francisco, especially when we have a place for them to go,” San Francisco Mayor London N. Breed, a Democrat, said in the wake of the 6-3 ruling. </p>
    

<p>Breed said she will review the ruling with the City Attorney’s Office before implementing any new policies, and the city will provide training to those clearing camps.</p><p>But the ruling was not welcomed everywhere and some cities, such as Seattle, said their approach to encampments will not change. A spokesperson for the Portland, Oregon, mayor’s office said it was prevented by a state law from making major changes based on the court decision.</p>



<p>Cody Bowman, a spokesperson for Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, a Democrat who has seen his two terms buffeted by discontent over the city’s homeless crisis, said they hoped the decision would push the state Legislature to take up the issue and “see this opportunity to consider the tools cities truly need to manage public camping, provide sufficient shelter, and keep our streets safe and clean.”</p>
    
<p>Boise, Idaho’s mayor, a Democrat, likewise said the city would not change its approach to those sleeping in public spaces, which includes case management and supportive housing.</p>
    

<p>“In Boise, we take care of people. Criminalizing homelessness has never, and will never, solve the problems associated with homelessness,” said Mayor Lauren McLean. “We must address the root causes with proven strategies, like permanent supportive housing, that empower our residents to stay housed and thrive in their community.”</p><p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is scheduled to sign a state budget in the coming days that includes another $250 million in grants for local governments to clear homeless encampments, said the ruling gives state and local officials “the definitive authority” to enforce policies that clear unwanted encampments.</p><p>“This decision removes the legal ambiguities that have tied the hands of local officials for years and limited their ability to deliver on common-sense measures to protect the safety and well-being of our communities,” Newsom said in a statement after the ruling, which came the same day Los Angeles <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/los-angeles-county-homeless-count-d0857248b13845ab09c6f8d20c826754">released an annual count</a></span> of the homeless population.</p><p>Sara Rankin, a professor of law at Seattle University who direct its Homeless Rights Advocacy Project, said the decision will likely result in a type of free-for-all for cities banning people from sleeping on the streets. But she said state constitutional provisions and other federal constitutional provisions could then be invoked.</p>
    

<p>“I think a number of cities are going to misread this as a green light for open season on unhoused folks,” she said. “But when they do that they’ll do it at their peril because I think that lawyers are going to come back at them under other theories that are still available to them, that are left untouched by today’s decision.”</p><p>The case <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/grants-pass-oregon-supreme-court-homeless-encampments-a8dcddb518bd76b11d409666c06701b8">came from the rural Oregon town of Grants Pass</a></span>, which appealed a ruling striking down local ordinances that fined people $295 for sleeping outside after tents began crowding public parks. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over the nine Western states, has held since 2018 that such bans violate the Eighth Amendment in areas where there aren’t enough shelter beds.</p><p>Jesse Rabinowitz, the communications and campaign director at the National Homelessness Law Center, said he worries this decision will empower cities to focus even more on arresting people sleeping outside, rather than focusing on proven solutions.</p><p>“There are encampments in California and D.C. and New York, not because there aren’t laws to punish people, but because there’s not enough housing that meets everybody’s needs,” he said. “And this case will make it harder to focus on the true solutions.”</p>

<p>"I think the defense is getting a little worried," legal expert Jennifer Roman told WBZ of the deliberations. "I think the prosecution's feeling a little bit better."</p><p>"The jury also has a lot of choices to make here because of the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-murder-trial-verdict-watch-jury-deliberations/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">nature of the charges</a></span>," Roman said.

Roman said.</p><p>"If they can't get a unanimous decision about that, then that's where the jury deliberations end. They have to find that she hit him in order to proceed with the rest of these deliberations."</p><p>"We don't know where they're at in their deliberations. We don't know if they're stuck on step one or if they've decided unanimously on step one and now they're debating about the charges," Roman told WBZ.</p><h2>What is a hung jury?</h2><p>If the Read trial ends with a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/hung_jury" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">hung jury</a>, in other words, they can't reach a verdict, it would lead to a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/retrial" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">retrial</a>.</p><p>"I'm concerned it's going be a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-murder-trial-day-3-verdict-watch/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">hung jury</a></span>. And I say that because the jury is representative of the population of people, and you can go to a party and talk to 10 different people, and you're going to have 5 or 6 on one side, 4 or 5 on the other, who all view this case differently," Roman said.</p>

The vote will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regional tensions</strong>: The election comes as wider tensions grip the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, with Iran launching its first-ever direct attack on Israel in April and militia groups it arms in the region escalating attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Iran's nuclear program</strong>: Iran continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build several nuclear weapons, should it choose to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reformist candidate's message</strong>: The sole reformist candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian, has vowed to seek "friendly relations" with the West, but has received a veiled warning from the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, over their outreach to the United States.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian’s remarks followed a veiled warning directed at him and his allies from the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, over their outreach to the United States. </p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024 The year will test even the most robust democracies.

</div>
<p>The comments, made after Pezeshkian cast his ballot, appeared to be aimed at boosting turnout as public apathy has grown pervasive in the Islamic Republic after years of economic woes and mass protests. He seemed to hope that invoking the possibility of Iran emerging from its isolation would motivate people otherwise disillusioned with Iranian politics. </p>
    
<p>A higher turnout typically aids those like Pezeshkian in the reformist movement that seeks to change the country’s Shiite theocracy from within.</p><p>While Iran’s 85-year-old <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ayatollah-ali-khamenei">Khamenei</a></span> has the final say on all matters of state, presidents can bend the country’s policies toward confrontation or negotiation with the West. However, given the record-low turnout in recent elections, it remains unclear just how many Iranians will take part in Friday’s poll. </p>
    

<p>Pezeshkian, who voted at a hospital near the capital, Tehran, appeared to have that in mind as he responded to a journalist’s question about how Iran would interact with the West if he was president. </p><p>“God willing, we will try to have friendly relations with all countries except Israel,” the 69-year-old candidate said. Israel, long Iran’s regional archenemy, faces intense criticism across the Mideast over its grinding war in the Gaza Strip. </p><p>He also responded to a question about a renewed crackdown on women over the mandatory headscarf, or hijab, less than two years after <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-sakharov-prize-masha-amini-5a24ba82e8b7819afae72e9dff4bc25e">the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini</a></span>, which sparked nationwide demonstrations and violent security force response.</p><p>“No inhuman or invasive behavior should be made against our girls, daughters and mothers,” he said.</p><p>A higher turnout could boost Pezeshkian’s chances, and the candidate may have been counting on social media to spread his remarks, as all television broadcasters in the country are state-controlled and run by hard-liners. But it remains unclear if he can gain the momentum needed to draw voters to the ballot.</p>
    

<p>There have been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-narges-mohammadi-nobel-peace-prize-fb0189fbb60c49953e118fc8572e8de3">Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi</a></span>. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains in house arrest, also has refused to vote with his wife, his daughter said.</p><p>There’s also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. One woman in a documentary on Pezeshkian aired by state TV said her generation was “moving toward the same level” of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian’s generation had in the 1979 revolution.</p><p>Analysts broadly describe the race as a three-way contest. There are two hard-liners, former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili and the parliament speaker, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf. A Shiite cleric, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, also has remained in the race despite polling poorly.</p>
    

<p>Pezeshkian has aligned himself with figures such as former President Hassan Rouhani, under whose administration Tehran struck the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.</p><p>The voting began just after President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump concluded <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/live/presidential-debate-2024-updates">their first televised debate</a></span> for the U.S. presidential election, during which Iran came up. </p><p>Trump described Iran as “broke” under his administration and highlighted his decision to launch a 2020 drone strike that killed <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-qassem-soleimani-profile-kerman-bomb-attack-57cbc9adff1914e5047c0104b311cced">Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani</a></span>. That attack was part of a spiral of escalating tensions between America and Iran since Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. in 2018 from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. </p><p>Iranian state media made a point to publish images of voters lined up in the city of Kerman near Soleimani’s grave. State television later broadcast images of polling places across the country with modest lines. Onlookers did not see significant lines at many polling centers in Tehran, reminiscent of the low turnout seen in Iran’s recent parliamentary election in March.</p>
    

<p>Khamenei cast one of the election’s first votes. </p><p>“People’s turnout with enthusiasm, and higher number of voters — this is a definite need for the Islamic Republic,” Khamenei said. </p><p>More than 61 million Iranians over the age of 18 are eligible to vote, with about 18 million of them between 18 to 30.</p><p>Polls closed shortly after midnight, following three extensions of voting hours. Iranian state media said those who were still waiting at the polling stations would be allowed to cast their ballots but no one else. </p><p>Counting was to begin immediately, with initial results expected Saturday. </p><p>As the weather cooled off a little in the evening hours, more people headed to vote and long lines formed outside polling stations in downtown Tehran and in the southern parts of the city. </p><p>Iranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If that doesn’t happen, the race’s top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There’s been only one runoff presidential election in Iran’s history, in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. </p><p>The 63-year-old Raisi <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/video/iran-iran-government-ebrahim-raisi-israel-hamas-war-womens-rights-cc89ed45bd5e49c696293d2b861b9780">died in the May 19 helicopter crash</a></span> that also killed the country’s foreign minister and others. He was seen as a protégé of Khamenei and a potential successor as supreme leader. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Amini, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-sakharov-prize-masha-amini-5a24ba82e8b7819afae72e9dff4bc25e">a young woman detained by police</a></span> over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab. </p><h2>___</h2><p>Karimi reported from Tehran, Iran.

<p>The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority announced the results of its <a href="https://mayor.lacity.gov/news/change-la-homelessness-down-city-la-first-time-years-following-urgent-action-taken-mayor-bass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 Homeless Point-In-Time Count</a> on Friday, and the numbers pointed in a positive direction for the city and county that is desperate to fix its homelessness issue.</p>



<p>According to the count, there are 75,312 unhoused people in L.A. County and 45,252 in the city.  Those figures are down 0.3% and 2.2% from last year, respectively.</p>



<p>“The numbers in this year’s homeless count give us cause to feel optimistic about the direction of our homeless work across L.A. County,” said Va Lecia Adams Kellum, the CEO of LAHSA.</p>





<p>While the decrease in the total homeless population may not sound significant, L.A. saw strides made when it came to the sheltered population. The city of L.A. saw a 10% decrease in the street homeless population, the largest such decrease in nine years.</p>

<p>The city also had a 38% decrease in makeshift shelters.</p>



<p>“For so many years, the count has shown increases in homelessness, and we have all felt that in our neighborhoods. But we leaned into change. And we have changed the trajectory of this crisis and have moved L.A. in a new direction,” said Mayor Karen Bass. “There is nothing we cannot do by taking on the status quo, putting politics aside, and rolling up our sleeves to work together.”</p>





<p>The count comes from a three-day period in January in which people living on the streets, in vehicles, tents and makeshift shelters were counted.</p>



<p>“For the first time in years, the number of people sleeping on our streets is down and the number of people in our shelters is up,” said Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn, who represents District 4. “We have focused on shelters and we are doing a better job convincing people to come inside. The next step is building more permanent supportive housing and investing in long-term solutions to this crisis.”</p>

<p>The news of the homelessness decrease coincidentally comes on a day in which the rights of homeless people were clamped down on by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court ruled Friday that  <a href="https://ktla.com/news/nationworld/ap-supreme-court-allows-cities-to-enforce-bans-on-homeless-people-sleeping-outside/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">local governments can enforce bans</a> on unhoused people sleeping in outdoor spaces. </p>



<p>Responses to that ruling has been mixed. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the ruling “removes the legal ambiguities” that tied the hands of lawmakers from clearing “unsafe” encampments. </p>





<p>Bass, however, said the ruling “neither will work or save lives,” and it “must not” be used as an excuse to “arrest their way out of this problem.”</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Iowa's Supreme Court has allowed a six-week abortion ban to take effect</strong>: The court's 4-3 majority ruling allows the state's Republican-led legislature's 2023 law to restrict abortion access after six weeks of pregnancy.</li>
<li><strong>The law restricts abortion at six weeks of pregnancy</strong>: The law, which has limited exceptions for rape, incest, or risk to the mother's life, restricts abortion at the point when fetal cardiac activity can be detected.</li>
<li><strong>Planned Parenthood and others had sued to block the law</strong>: The organizations had won a preliminary injunction from a lower court, keeping abortion legal in the state up until 22 weeks of pregnancy. However, the Iowa Supreme Court's ruling reverses this injunction.</li>
<li><strong>The ruling allows ongoing litigation to proceed</strong>: The court's decision will allow the lawsuit against the law to continue at the district court level, where the temporary injunction was initially granted.</li>
<li><strong>The decision is the latest in a string of anti-abortion rulings since the 2022 US Supreme Court decision</strong>: The US Supreme Court's 2022 decision, known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, overturned federal protections for abortion, leading to a wave of state-level restrictions on abortion access.</li>

<p>U.N. World Food Program spokesman Steve Taravella said Friday that the U.N. participation in the pier project is still on pause pending resolution of the security concerns.</p>



<p>While always meant to be temporary and never touted as a complete solution to the problems getting humanitarian aid into Gaza, President Joe Biden’s $230 million project has faced a series of setbacks since aid first rolled ashore May 17 and has been criticized by relief groups and congressional Republicans as a costly distraction.</p>
    
<p>The pier has been used to get more than 19.4 million pounds, or 8.6 million kilograms, of food into Gaza, but has been stymied not only by aid pauses but unpredictable weather. Rough seas damaged the pier just days into its initial operations, forcing the military to remove it temporarily for repairs and then reinstall it. Heavy seas on Friday forced the military to remove it again and take it to the Israeli port at Ashdod.</p>
    

<p>Several U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss military movements, said the military could reinstall the pier once the bad weather passes in the coming days, but the final decision on whether to reinstall it hasn’t been made.</p><p>Sabrina Singh, a Pentagon spokeswoman, acknowledged that she doesn’t know when the pier will be reinstalled. “When the commander decides that it is the right time to reinstall that pier, we’ll keep you updated on that.,” she said.</p><p>She also said Friday that there is a need for more aid to come into Cyprus and be transported to the pier. She noted that the secure area onshore is “pretty close to full,” but that the intention is still to get aid into Gaza by all means necessary. She said the U.S. is having discussions with the aid agencies about the distribution of the food.</p><p>But, she added, “Of course, if there’s not enough room in the marshalling yard, then it doesn’t make sense to put our men or women out there when there’s nothing to do.”</p><p>Palestinians are facing widespread hunger because fighting in the nearly nine-month <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">Israel-Hamas war</a></span>, Israeli restrictions on border crossings that are far more productive than the sea route and the attacks on the aid convoys have severely limited the flow of food, medicine and other supplies.</p><p>—-</p><p>Ellen Knickmeyer contributed from Washington. </p>

<p>The statement by Israel Defence Forces Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari earlier this week took many by surprise, considering the severity of the picture he painted of the ongoing escalation on Israel’s northern border. </p>
<p>Warning that “Hezbollah’s increasing aggression is bringing us to the brink of what could be a wider escalation”, his statement was followed by Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, not known to skimp on words, warning that the country was ready for an “all-out war” that would “change the rules of the game”.</p>
                    
    

<p>What inspired statements as strong as these coming from Israel’s military and political leadership was the most violent week so far on the border with Lebanon — that is, since the recent escalation began following Hamas’s 7 October attack. </p>
<p>A similar escalation in rhetoric has been seen from Hezbollah’s side, which, for the first time in a number of days, took direct responsibility for UAV attacks near the Israeli city of Metullah. </p>
<p>Considering the death of the most senior Hezbollah official thus far, commander Taleb Abdullah, coupled with Hezbollah launching what has been some of its heaviest rocket barrages to date, in addition to overt threats from Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah to attack Israeli critical infrastructure using footage filmed by the terror organisation’s reconnaissance drones, the threat of escalation is very real.</p>
<h2>Spats with Washington are not helping</h2><p>With Amos Hochstein, US President Joe Biden’s senior aide, who has been serving as Biden's mediator since the conflict began, visiting the region with an eye towards preventing further escalation, the question begging to be asked is what the US administration can practically do. </p>
<p>The state of relations between the United States and Israel is currently at an all-time low, rivalled only by the end of President Barack Obama’s time in office when Washington, in a rare move, abstained from a controversial UN Security Council resolution demanding an end to settlements.</p>






<p>Relations between Biden and Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu reached their own low this week when Netanyahu, in an English-language social media video, accused the Biden administration of withholding military aid to Israel, the single largest recipient of American military aid globally. </p>           <p data-ad-id="adzone-outstream_1" data-ad-type="outstream" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label js-adzone outstream"></p>
  

<p>The spat led to the rare cancellation of a strategic dialogue on Iran only a day before it was meant to take place in Washington with members of the Israeli delegation, including Israel’s National Security Advisor, already en route. “This decision makes it clear that there are consequences for pulling such stunts,” a US official, referring to Netanyahu’s clip, said.</p>



<p>And while Washington tries to reign in Israel’s prime minister, setting demands regarding Israeli operations in Rafah and cancelling the discussed meeting, what the Biden administration is missing is that they are dealing with a man who quite literally has nothing to lose. </p>
<h2>Mr Security's fall from grace</h2><p>Israel’s longest-serving PM, once known as Mr Security, lacks the vast public support he once had, finding himself fourth out of six Israeli politicians, with only 42% support in a poll conducted in March. </p>
<p>He was followed only by Israel’s hard-right leaders, Bezalel Smotritch and Itamar Ben Gvir (with 37% and 33%, respectively).</p>
<p>The 7 October massacre and the intelligence and military failures that will forever be associated with that day saw all preconceived notions of Netanyahu as the only one who could ensure the safety and security which Israeli citizens so desperately seek shattered. </p>         <p data-ad-id="adzone-native_1" data-ad-type="native" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label advertising--native js-adzone"></p>
  

<p>Indeed, calls for accountability are only getting stronger. Just this week, tens of thousands of protesters from all walks of Israeli society demanded a commission of inquiry, something that Netanyahu has been blocking State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman from putting together. </p>






<p>Despite his 17 years in power, shockingly, not one commission of inquiry has ever been formed, making “the likelihood of an inquiry very, very low,” according to professor of public policy at Hebrew University Raanan Sulitzeanu-Kenan.</p>
<p>On a personal level, it cannot be forgotten that Netanyahu is still facing an ongoing corruption trial, which resumed this December despite the war in Gaza. </p>
<p>Charged with fraud, bribery and breach of trust in three separate cases, it is obvious what Netanyahu has to gain by prolonging, if not escalating, Israel’s security situation. </p>
<p>In this light, only three months ago, Netanyahu’s lawyers petitioned the Jerusalem District Court to postpone testimonies “as long as there is no substantial change in the security situation in the country”.</p>

<h2>Vast arsenal of tools for self-preservation</h2><p>With Netanyahu in a position where he exemplifies what James Baldwin called “the most dangerous creation in any society, the man who has nothing to lose”, Biden and the US must tread carefully when calling for deescalation.</p>
<p>Commonly known by his favourite nickname, Bibi, he has made a career out of the persona he built for himself: the self-proclaimed "King Bibi" who can save Israel. </p>
<p>Vilifying the US Democrats in an election year and perhaps subtly doing everything in his power to ensure an administration change are only some of the tools in his vast arsenal of self-preservation.</p>






<p>President Biden himself is also limited in this regard, needing to ensure the pro-Israel vote while painting a picture of someone who also cares about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. </p>
<p>Netanyahu easily takes advantage of this delicate balance, portraying every action by Washington as calling into question US' unwavering support for the Jewish state. </p>

<p>Although Hezbollah does not see a severe escalation with Israel to be in its strategic interest, it may nevertheless take advantage of Netanyahu’s desperate need for an ongoing security crisis, coupled with what it perceives to be a lull in the US-Israel relationship, to score a much-needed win on the security front.</p>
<p>Nasrallah is even less restrained than Netanyahu, with little regard for the future of Lebanon. </p>
<h2>Who will shoot first?</h2><p>Hezbollah will win in the eyes of the Lebanese public if it is seen as keeping Israel’s military at bay and will win the battle for hearts and minds if an escalation occurs, too. </p>
<p>This is due to the military losses that Israel would undoubtedly suffer, including on the home front and during an eventual reconstruction process in Lebanon. </p>
<p>Although Hezbollah would be responsible for the country’s destruction, it would also play an important role in its rebuilding, given the virtual non-existence of a central government in Lebanon. </p>

<p>However, with recent polling in Israel showing 60% support attacking Hezbollah with full force and 36% wanting to see this in the immediate term, it is impossible to know which side the US has little to no control over will be the first to escalate.</p>

                                        <p>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — The death threats came rolling in shortly after Gimena Silva’s husband was detained on accusations that he took part in a failed coup in Bolivia.</p><p>“They call us, they say that if we do anything, say anything, they’re going to disappear us. They threaten not just us, but our children too,” Silva said. “They’re anonymous calls and they say they will kill our kids.” </p><p>Now, Silva, a mother of three children, sat with her mother and brother crying at the doors of a jail clinging to any news of her husband, Luis Domingo Balanza. </p><p>Balanza, a military major of more than 15 years, was among 21 people arrested after a group of military and armored vehicles attempted what the government has called a “failed coup d’état.”</p><p>Those families appeared visibly confused and anxious in the jail where their loved ones were kept on Friday, saying they knew nothing of a plot in the lead-up to Wednesday’s spectacle. Many families of those detained say their loved ones were simply “following orders” or told they were carrying out a “military exercise.”</p>
    

<p>On Friday, the government announced additional arrests of soldiers, bringing the total up to 21, including former Gen. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-army-chief-coup-attempted-foiled-2698e4bf34f25f8dddb1542a41f2f27d">Juan José Zuñiga</a></span>, who led the failed coup.</p>



<p>Images from Bolivia shocked the world on Wednesday as an armored car rammed into the government palace in La Paz, the country’s seat of government, and military officers fled after embattled President Luis Arce said his government was not backing down.</p>
    
<p>The general, who was sacked by Arce amid the chaos, claimed that he stormed the government office as a favor to Arce to earn him political favor at a time of deep economic discontent in Bolivia, stirring doubt in many.</p><p>Zuñiga’s lawyer, Stiven Orellana, told The Associated Press that prosecutors planned to charge Zúñiga with the crimes of terrorism and starting an armed uprising. He said he could not provide more details on the case.</p>
    

<p>Around 200 military officers took part in the attempted coup, Bolivia’s ambassador to the Organization of American States said Thursday. </p><p>“These people commanded the destruction of Bolivian heritage,” said senior Cabinet member Eduardo del Castillo said in a press conference.</p><p>Del Castillo was echoed by hundreds of protestors roaring outside the jail and other government buildings on Friday, carrying posters reading “Zuñiga, traitor, coup leader, respect the state.”</p><p>Inside, crying families told another story. </p><p>Silva and her mother, Daniela, said their family was left economically “devastated” with no income to care for their three children. The family was among those that said their father was simply following orders, asked to step away from an online course and head to the plaza outside the governmental palace. Silva said her husband later turned himself over.</p><p>“How are we going to feed our family,” Daniela, who asked not to be identified by her last name due to the threats. “I can’t think of the future, what future can someone who has been implicated, who has been treated like this.”</p><p>She added: “My son isn’t a villain … he’s just a subordinate. He safeguarded his patrimony and they took advantage of him.”</p>
    

<p>Families and lawyers of defendants interviewed by the AP could share few details about their family members’ cases and legal arguments because they were in the wake of legal proceedings but most said they sought “justice” for those detained.</p><p>Others like Nubia Barbery said her husband, Col. Raul Barbery Muiba, was instructed by Zuñiga to carry out a “military exercise”. Upon entering the square, Barbery said he left, telling Zuñiga that he was “tricked,” calling her shortly afterward.</p><p>The families’ claims add an extra layer of confusion to doubts already sewed by Zuñiga Wednesday night about the veracity of the coup.</p><p>Upon his swift arrest, he alleged, without providing evidence, that Arce ordered him to carry out the rebellion, prompting political opposition to dub the case a “self-coup.”</p><p>Zuñiga claimed the takeover was all a ruse to boost Arce’s flagging popularity as he struggles to manage a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-economy-us-dollar-42f815800dd18eb0952590bb8b968cfd">spiraling economy</a></span>, deepening political divisions and bubbling public discontent. Arce on Thursday vigorously denied accusations.</p>
    

<p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-morales-arce-political-economic-crisis-d38051e051a2e6473a18133e4a9c6120">The embattled president is vying</a></span> with powerful ex-President Evo Morales over who will be their party’s candidate in the presidential election next year. </p><p>The escalating political feud has left Bolivians disillusioned and bewildered as to what really happened during those three chaotic hours Wednesday when armored vehicles rolled into downtown La Paz and Arce confronted the putschists face-to-face and ordered them to back off. </p><p>Whether Zuñiga’s allegations about Arce are true — or whether the disgruntled general simply sought to exploit Bolivia’s mounting crises for his own benefit — remains unclear.</p><p>Still many like Cintia Ramos were were outraged by Wednesday’s chaos.</p>
    

<p>“Zúñiga must pay the highest sentence for having attacked the Bolivian people,” said 31-year-old Cintia Ramos, one of the protesters at the jail. </p><p>Families may say their loved ones are innocent, but Ramos said “this couldn’t have been carried out by just one person. This person had allies, high-level allies. ... They should also be pay the highest sentence.”</p><p>Police could be seen Friday morning marching Zúñiga through the jail in handcuffs.</p><p>Shortly before, his wife, Graciela Arzacibia, kept her eyes downcast as she waited for the general to emerge from the police station. Holding a small bag of snacks, she expressed concern for her 6-year-old son, who, she said, believed his jailed father was simply away at work.</p><p>“I’m asking that they consider the families,” she told the AP. “We haven’t done anything.”</p>

    <div><div class="caas-body"><p>(Bloomberg) -- Nike Inc. shares sank after the sneaker company’s full-year outlook missed expectations, stoking investor concerns about waning demand and competition from upstarts On and Hoka, as well as rival Adidas AG.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg</p><p>The world’s largest sportswear company sees revenue declining in the mid-single digits in the company’s current fiscal year, which began this month. Analysts had expected growth of about 2% this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.</p><p>The shares fell as much as 18% on Friday morning — Nike’s biggest fall since 2001. As of 9:35 a.m., the drop had wiped out about $23 billion in market value. The stock had already declined 17% over the past 12 months.</p><p>Other athletic retailers including JD Sports Fashion Plc and Puma SE were dragged down. Adidas gained early Friday in Frankfurt, but the stock later erased the gain.</p><p>After years of dominance, Nike is struggling to churn out hot-selling footwear to replace top sellers such as Air Force 1 and Dunk sneakers. The worsening performance raises the pressure on Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe. Donahoe has resorted to layoffs and other belt-tightening measures after a move to prioritize Nike’s own sales channels failed to produce the promised levels of profits and growth.</p><p>Nike also curtailed its reliance on retail partners in recent years, which in turn have begun pushing rival brands. The wave of competition from newer brands such as On Holding AG and Deckers Outdoor Corp.’s Hoka pushed Nike to vow to prioritize sports, new products and wholesale partners.</p><p>The trajectory contrasts with that of Adidas, whose new Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Gulden has embraced retail partners again and sped up the introduction of new products like the retro Samba sneaker, which has become a hit and fueled a new era of growth. He’s also sharpened the company’s focus on athletic performance.</p><p>Nike’s revenue in the fourth quarter fell 1.7% to $12.6 billion, missing the average of analyst estimates. A notable laggard was the Converse subsidiary, known for its Chuck Taylor sneakers, where revenue plummeted 18% due to soft sales in both North America and Western Europe.</p><p>Donahoe took over as Nike’s CEO in January 2020, following many years leading tech companies including ServiceNow Inc. and eBay Inc. Before that, he had spent nearly two decades at the management consulting firm Bain &amp; Company Inc., where in 1999 he became CEO.</p><p class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button class="link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" data-rapid_p="18"><span class="readmoreButtonText">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Some analysts have criticized Donahoe’s leadership approach, with Sam Poser of Williams Trading recently arguing that Nike’s current senior executives lack the “instinct and experience that the prior team had.” That’s left Nike in a “push model” situation, Poser said, whereby a company has to try to convince consumers to buy its products rather than the opposite scenario, where people are struggling to get their hands on a company’s shoes and apparel.</p><p>That’s a marked difference from what Nike was experiencing for much of the past decade, during which it has basically doubled revenue from $25 billion in 2013 to more than $50 billion today. While annual sales dipped during the onset of the Covid pandemic in 2020, the growth has otherwise been remarkable until recent quarters.</p><p>Now, Nike leaders are asking for patience as the company looks to accelerate the release of new franchises in the fitness and lifestyle categories in the second half of this fiscal year and then bring on more new products over the next couple of years.</p><p>“A comeback at this scale takes time,” Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said during the company’s call with analysts. But he cautioned that shifting the product lineup will erode sales in the short term.</p><p>Nike executives blamed the slowdown in part on lifestyle brands, including Air Force 1 and Nike Dunks. The category’s sales fell for the first time since the start of the pandemic, when demand for casual attire took off.</p><p>The issues could prompt double-digit downgrades to analysts’ earnings expectations for the company during this year and next, according to analyst James Grzinic of Jefferies. Moreover, the era of European shoe companies’ stock reactions tracking Nike’s is breaking down.</p><p>Adidas is now the “preferred sporting brand for global investors” as Nike and Lululemon Athletica Inc. lose momentum, Grzinic said in a note.</p><p>Weakness in Nike’s own sales channels is also a “reason for concern, as the activewear giant could be turning its core shoppers away due to lack of newness,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Poonam Goyal.</p><p>--With assistance from Daniela Wei and Isolde MacDonogh.</p><p>(Updates share trading)</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>
