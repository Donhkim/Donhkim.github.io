<li>Donald Trump plans to speak at the Libertarian Party's national convention on Saturday night to court conservative voters who have been skeptical of him in the past.</li>
<li>The Libertarians will choose their White House nominee during the convention, which wraps up on Sunday, and the party is also considering independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as a potential nominee.</li>
<li>Polls have shown that most voters do not want a rematch between Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, which could create an opening for alternative candidates like the Libertarian nominee or Kennedy.</li>
<li>Libertarian candidates have performed poorly in recent elections, with Gary Johnson receiving about 3% of the national vote in 2016 and Jo Jorgensen getting only about 1% in 2020.</li>
<li>Some critics, including Peter Goettler, president of the libertarian Cato Institute, have accused Trump of violating the values of the Libertarian Party by speaking at their convention, suggesting that Trump's involvement could undermine the party's core principles.</li>

That dynamic could potentially boost support for an alternative like the Libertarian nominee or Kennedy, whose candidacy has allies of Biden and Trump concerned that he could be a spoiler. </p>
    

<p>Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson won about 3% of the national vote in 2016, when Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in a tight race. Party nominee Jo Jorgensen got only a bit more than 1% during 2020’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-wins-white-house-ap-fd58df73aa677acb74fce2a69adb71f9">close contest</a></span>.</p><p>Peter Goettler, president and chief executive of the libertarian Cato Institute, suggested in a Washington Post column published this week that Trump’s convention invitation violated the gathering’s core values and that “the political party pretending to be libertarian has transitioned to a different identity.”</p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know about the 2024 Election Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020.

<p>Trump’s campaign says his appearance is part of an ongoing effort to reach would-be supporters in places that are not heavily Republican. For example, he held a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-bronx-rally-minority-voters-00fae754f78333111c508d6e740a3610">rally Thursday in the Bronx</a></span> during a pause in his New York <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-robert-costello-b1beb56a666c398ae5393ede16c326da">hush money trial</a></span>. His team was expecting some at the convention to oppose Trump, but hopes he will get credit for showing up and fighting for votes. </p>
    
<p>Trump supporters also showed up to cheer him on Saturday night. About two hours before the former president took the stage, Libertarian organizers asked large groups in the audience, many of whom wore red “Make America Great” hats and T-shirts and had filled up seats near the stage earlier, to vacate the first four rows. </p>
    

<p>They did that so convention delegates — many of whom said they’d traveled from around the country and bought expensive tickets to the proceedings — could sit close enough to hear the speech. Many of the original seat occupants moved, but organizers eventually brought in more seats to better accommodate the stage-adjacent demand. </p><p>Before Trump began speaking, Libertarian delegates endorsed a variety of topics they hoped he would address including calls to liberate imprisoned WikiLeaks founder <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/julian-assange">Julian Assange</a></span> and promote “peace not war.” Other topics they wanted to hear about overlapped with more traditional Republican rallying cries including “abolish the deep state” and “defend the Second Amendment.”</p><p>The Libertarian ticket will try to draw support from disaffected Republicans as well as people on the left who oppose perceived government overreach. Such voters could also gravitate toward Kennedy.</p><p>Kennedy <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/who-is-robert-f-kennedy-jr-rfk-097ac973a32ddf2e8e4edecd6a8f3153">cites his track record</a></span> of fighting for the middle class against powerful interests. He is also trying to win over conservatives who want to see the national GOP move away from Trump.</p>
    

<p>Kennedy’s anti-vaccine activism <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/who-is-robert-f-kennedy-jr-rfk-097ac973a32ddf2e8e4edecd6a8f3153">has appealed to some on the right</a></span> who oppose COVID-19 vaccine mandates. He has also suggested that some of the pro-Trump rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-january-6-prosecutions-conspiracy-6e8f8d060e54055c80c93d131e8dd7f3">may have been prosecuted for political reasons</a></span>. </p>



<p>Trump previously praised Kennedy and once considered him for a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/parenting-relationships-united-states-presidential-election-events-d0bd7a22514f427eb0686b94b1c2f077">commission on vaccination safety</a></span>, but has changed his tone now. He suggested on social media that a vote for Kennedy would be a “wasted protest vote” and that he would “even take Biden over Junior.”</p><p>Trump, while in office, referred to the COVID-19 vaccine as “one of the greatest miracles in the history of modern-day medicine.” But the former president now says that, if elected, he would “not give one penny” to public schools and universities that mandate COVID-19 vaccination. He also accused Kennedy of being a “fake” opponent of vaccines — efforts that could shore up Trump’s support among some in his base who might otherwise consider defecting to Kennedy. </p>
    

<p>In his speech at the Libertarian convention, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-libertarian-convention-pandemic-civil-liberties-53a857aadbeafbb2207ca3eb6b6775cc">Kennedy accused</a></span> Trump and Biden of trampling on personal liberties in response to the pandemic that spanned their presidencies. Trump bowed to pressure from public health officials and shut down businesses, Kennedy said, while Biden was wrong to mandate vaccines for millions of workers. </p><p>Biden, meanwhile, has promoted winning the endorsement of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-kennedy-rfk-trump-pennsylvania-b411e744d3b13fc6365029cb3dfd00c4">many high-profile members of the Kennedy family,</a></span> in an attempt to marginalize their relative’s candidacy. </p><p>Kevin Munoz, a spokesperson for Biden’s reelection campaign, also slammed Trump and top Republicans for opposing access to abortion and supporting limits on civil society, saying in a statement Saturday, that “freedom isn’t free in Trump’s Republican Party and this weekend will be just one more reminder of that.” </p>

<p>A prior round of negotiations in Cairo ended in early May without meaningful progress, though U.S. officials expressed optimism that differences between Israel and Hamas could be overcome.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Overbudget and troubled endeavor</strong>: The temporary piers established in the Mediterranean Sea to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza have run significantly over budget, costing over $300 million, with some reports citing a total cost of $320 million.</li>
<li><strong>Security concerns</strong>: Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., has expressed concerns about the security risks associated with the project, stating that it unnecessarily puts personnel in harm's way and potentially diverts resources from other important missions.</li>
<li><strong>Pentagon's announcement</strong>: The Pentagon announced the completion of the piers in May, but deployment was marred by difficulties over the following week.</li>
<li><strong>President Biden's pledge</strong>: President Biden had pledged to establish the temporary piers in his State of the Union speech in March, with the goal of increasing humanitarian aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty and controversy</strong>: The effectiveness and justification of the project are being questioned by lawmakers, with some, like Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., labeling it a "dangerous effort with marginal benefit."</li>

It's costing a lot. It's pulling assets that should be used elsewhere, and I just don't think it's going to accomplish anything near what he's promised," Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., told Fox News Digital in an interview.</p><p>President Biden, during his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/watch-5-key-highlights-president-bidens-sotu-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of the Union speech in March</a><a rel="noopener">,</a> pledged to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of the Gaza Strip to increase the delivery of humanitarian aid to the territory as millions remain displaced while Israel continues to hunt Hamas. </p><p>The Pentagon announced the completion of the piers – one that would remain several miles offshore while the other acted as a causeway onto the Gazan shore – were completed around May 9 but faced difficulty during deployment over the following week. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/egypt-agrees-send-aid-trucks-through-israeli-crossing-gaza-impact-unclear" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>EGYPT AGREES TO SEND AID TRUCKS THROUGH ISRAELI CROSSING TO GAZA BUT IMPACT IS UNCLEAR</strong></a></p><p>Waltz said the cost for the project totaled over $300 million, with some reports citing a figure as high as $320 million – which would be double what initial estimates indicated, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-militarys-pier-gaza-cost-320-million-2024-04-29/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">told Reuters</a>, calling the operation a "dangerous effort with marginal benefit." </p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>The image, provided by U.S. Central Command, shows U.S. Army soldiers assigned to the 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary), U.S. Navy sailors assigned to Amphibious Construction Battalion 1, and Israel Defense Forces placing the Trident Pier on the coast of the Gaza Strip on Thursday, May 16, 2024. </span> <span>(U.S. Central Command via AP)</span></p></div></div></div><p>Waltz noted that the quoted costs only apply to the first few months of operation: "The longer it’s there, the more those costs are going to skyrocket." </p><p>"We've been briefed that two Navy destroyers are assigned to patrol the waters around the pier," Waltz said as an example. "Are those being included in their sustained fuel operating costs? The cost of their crew? That's unclear … and then there's opportunity cost, right? Those destroyers and other assets, air assets or what have you, are being <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/growing-controversy-bidens-gaza-pier-fuels-concerns-cost-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated to secure this thing</a> from any type of drone or land attack that could be rested and refit in the U.S. and could be used elsewhere." </p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>The U.S. Army landing craft mechanized (LCM) was beached while trying to retrieve a piece of the temporary pier that broke off while in transit. </span> <span>(Fox News )</span></p></div></div></div><p>The main issue, according to Waltz, is that the delivery outside of Gaza has not been the issue, but rather what happens once the aid is delivered across the border, at which point the aid faces the same issues as land-based delivery. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/hamas-gaza-health-ministry-under-microscope-questions-continue-over-number-deaths" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HAMAS' GAZA HEALTH MINISTRY UNDER MICROSCOPE AS QUESTIONS OVER NUMBER OF DEATHS</strong></a></p><p>"It’s going to run into the exact same problems the land routes have faced once it gets across the border," Waltz argued.  "The trucks get ransacked. They get attacked. When they do make it to the warehouse, it’s Hamas controlling the warehouses."</p><p>"Whether the trucks come from the sea or whether they come from land, they're going to run into the same <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/blinken-says-criminal-gangs-ordinary-civilians-looting-humanitarian-aid-gaza-doesnt-mention-hamas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buzzsaw of issues once they get inside</a>, and it is the Palestinian, you know, the poor Palestinian people and kids that suffer in the end," Waltz continued. </p><p>"Because of corruption and because they're being run by a terrorist dictatorship that is going to use aid to, one, feed and arm and resource itself, with more nutrients and medical supplies and fuel and what have you," he added. "Then, secondarily, use it as a lever to make sure the Palestinian people don't rise up against them."</p><p>Deliveries have not hit the desired level since the piers commenced shipments last week: Trucks started entering the Gaza Strip on May 17, with plans to scale up to 150 truckloads a day, but the pier has run into a number of issues, including damage to one of the piers on Saturday as the military tried to move them due to "sea conditions." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-service-members-injured-working-gaza-humanitarian-aid-critical-condition-defense-officials" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>3 US SERVICE MEMBERS INJURED ON GAZA HUMANITARIAN AID MISSION, 1 IN CRITICAL CONDITION: DEFNESE OFFICIALS</strong></a></p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Looters take aid from a truck.

"Then, I think we just have this false notion of no boots on the ground coming from Biden and the administration."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-says-european-nations-recognizing-palestinian-state-signals-israels-growing-diplomatic-isolation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WHITE HOUSE OBSERVES MORE COUNTRIES OPPOSING ISRAEL AS IRELAND, SPAIN, NORWAY RECOGNIZE PALESTINIAN STATE</strong></a></p><p>"I mean, technically, there's no boots touching sand, but they're on a dock that's touching the sand, and we confirmed at a hearing they're very close to shore," he continued. "They are within small arms range of any militants that want to fire on them from Gaza, much less the types of drones or missiles that we've seen in the Red Sea."</p><p>"We do know that the dock and the entire complex has come under mortar fire, already, so, again, this is putting our service members in harm's way unnecessarily," he stressed.</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>CENTCOM tweeted on X that, "The pier will support @USAID and humanitarian partners to receive and deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. @USTRANSCOM and @USEUCOM support the movement of #humanitarianaid."

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, told reporters on Tuesday that crowds have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-plans-new-aid-routes-gaza-desperate-crowds-halt-deliveries-us-built-pier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped the trucks at various points</a> along the route after the trucks arrived on land, leading to a sort of "self-distribution" of the deliveries. </p><p>"These trucks were traveling through areas where there'd been no aid. I think people feared that they would never see aid. They grabbed what they could," Dujarric said, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/gaza-floating-pier-un-humanitarian-aid-israel-hamas-1904248" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according to Newsweek</a>. </p><p>Pentagon Spokesman Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder also commented earlier in the week that the aid was "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/what-know-how-aid-us-pier-project-help-gaza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not flowing at a rate</a> that any of us are happy with."</p><p>Ultimately, Waltz argued that the piers have proven a project initiated for "purely political reasons." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</u></strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p>"When you have over 100,000 Democrats in the state of Michigan … go and vote against him in the Democrat primary – over 100,000 – that is a heck of a scary political moment for this White House," Waltz said. </p><p>"We’ve seen the policy shifts towards Israel ever since, from Schumer calling for regime change on the Senate floor to the kind of bashing of Netanyahu, to the promising a change in policy if the Israelis carry out their offensive in Rafah ... that has all been a signal to the youth vote," Waltz added. </p><p>During an on-record call on Thursday, defense officials confirmed to reporters that three U.S. service members had been injured while supporting a mission to provide humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. All injuries were non-combat-related with one person being listed in critical condition.</p><p>The White House did not respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment by time of publication. </p><p><i>Fox News' Greg Wehner contributed to this report. </i></p>  <div class="article-meta"><div class="author-bio"><p>Peter Aitken is a Fox News Digital reporter with a focus on national and global news. </p></div></div></div> </div>

<li><strong>President Biden reminded the graduating class of the US Military Academy that their oath is to the Constitution, not any political party or president</strong>, in an implicit rebuke of former President Trump's comments about the military.</li>

This comes on top of calls demanding that Justice Alito recuse himself from election-related cases before the court and face investigation by the US Senate, the congressional chamber that confirms federal and supreme court judges.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The Senate judiciary committee chair, Dick Durbin, and the senator and judiciary committee member Sheldon Whitehouse wrote a letter to Roberts earlier this week asking him for a meeting to discuss court ethics and to take steps to ensure that Alito recuses himself from any cases before the court concerning the January 6 attack or Trump’s attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The court did not respond to a request for comment regarding the letter.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">On Saturday afternoon, despite Alito having said that the flag-flying was entirely his wife’s business, Tennessee Democratic representative Steve Cohen <a href="https://twitter.com/RepCohen/status/1794457949856792707" data-link-name="in body link">posted on X</a>, formerly Twitter, that: “It’s almost too ironic that Alito would fly a Jan 6 flag calling for heavenly intervention because he felt the rule of law, which he’s supposed to uphold, was insufficient.

Alito is participating in both cases and has rejected calls from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Democrats</a> in the past to recuse himself on other issues.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Alito earlier said he had no part in the flying of the inverted American flag. He and the court declined to respond to requests for comment on how the “Appeal to Heaven” banner came to be flying and what it was intended to express.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Durbin and Whitehouse said they will continue to pressure the court. The plea for a meeting is a new approach after Roberts declined to testify at a hearing on supreme court ethics last year, amid a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/sep/29/us-supreme-court-john-roberts-ethics-scandal-recuse-thomas-alito-donor-cases" data-link-name="in body link">scandal</a> over accusations of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/30/ginni-thomas-clarence-thomas-2020-election" data-link-name="in body link">political influence</a> and corruption <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jun/21/samuel-alito-undisclosed-gifts-billionaire-paul-singer-supreme-court" data-link-name="in body link">aimed at Alito</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/may/05/clarence-thomas-kellyanne-conway-leonard-leo-payments" data-link-name="in body link">Clarence Thomas</a>, the two most conservative justices on the supreme court bench.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Until the court and the judicial conference take meaningful action to address this ongoing ethical crisis, we will continue our efforts to enact legislation to resolve this crisis,” Durbin and Whitehouse wrote.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The American Legion US <a href="https://www.legion.org/flag/code" data-link-name="in body link">flag code</a> states of the Stars and Stripes that “the flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property”.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p></div></div>
