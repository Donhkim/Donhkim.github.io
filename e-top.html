            “I’m telling him, ‘I have other targets, but if you stop me, I’ll go through you,’” DePape said, recounting a conversation with Paul Pelosi, adding that he then reacted and hit Pelosi “in the head,” because his plan was “basically ruined.”

            In his testimony, Pelosi recounted how he awoke from sleep the night of the attack to see a man with a hammer in his home. That man, later identified by police as DePape, asked where his wife was. “She’s not here. She’s in Washington,” Pelosi recalled answering.

            Pelosi, who underwent surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his hand and arm, told jurors that his recovery has been difficult, with spells of lightheadedness and headaches. “I’ve made the best effort I possibly can to not revisit this,” he said at the time.

<ol>
<li>MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin praised the Trump defense team for a "real triumph" in a key exchange during the cross-examination of Michael Cohen in the New York v. Trump trial.</li>
<li>The exchange in question involved Trump lawyer Todd Blanche grilling Cohen about his communications with Trump's former bodyguard Keith Schiller, which led to Cohen admitting he was less certain about what was discussed during a phone call.</li>
<li>Cohen testified that he had never seen a text message between him and Schiller, which the district attorney's office had not shown him, and that he could not recall every detail of the phone call.</li>
<li>Rubin described the exchange as the "John Grisham moment" and the "biggest point" earned by the Trump defense team, saying that it showed Cohen's uncertainty and lack of clarity about the details of the phone call.</li>
<li>The exchange was considered a significant moment in the trial, with Rubin stating that it led her to think "Oh, we're in for something here" and that it marked a turning point in the defense's strategy.</li>

Trump trial</a>. </p><p class="speakable">During MSNBC's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coverage of the trial</a> on Thursday, Rubin zeroed in on what the network described as the "John Grisham moment" and the "biggest point" earned by Team Trump when defense attorney Todd Blanche grilled Cohen about his communications with Trump's former bodyguard Keith Schiller. </p><p>"When he started talking about the harassing phone calls that Cohen was getting, I think a bunch of us looked at each other sort of quizzically being like, ‘What is this? Where is this going?’" Rubin said. "And then it became clear when he first brought up the text to Keith Schiller on October 24 after getting Cohen to reestablish that that was the day on which he called Schiller to reach Trump and that remained his testimony that he discussed with Trump that day, the resolution of the Stormy Daniels matter and that it was time to pay out Stormy." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/may-16-trump-trial-michael-cohen-cross-examination" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MICHAEL COHEN FACES CROSS EXAMINATION FROM TRUMP LAWYERS IN NEW YORK CRIMINAL TRIAL</strong></a></p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin called Trump lawyer Todd Blanche's grilling of Michael Cohen a "moment of real triumph" for the defense team.</span> <span>(Screenshot/MSNBC)</span></p></div></div></div><p>"Once he connected up to the Keith Schiller text I thought, 'Oh, we're in for something here.' And indeed, we were," Rubin told MSNBC's Chris Jansing, "because Michael Cohen not only admitted that he is now less than certain about what got discussed that day and that it could have been both but he's not positive given the one minute and 30-something seconds of that phone call, but also that in eight years he had never seen that Keith Schiller text and that it was not among the things that the district attorney's office had shown him." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-michael-cohen-adviser-told-nothing-trump-stormy-nda-idea" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FORMER MICHAEL COHEN ADVISER: ‘HE TOLD ME HE HAD NOTHING ON TRUMP,’ STORMY NDA WAS ‘HIS IDEA’</strong></a></p><p>"That makes the district attorney's office look sloppy in addition to making Michael Cohen seem like a self-assured either fabricator, liar or forgetful person. It casts doubt on the veracity of a ton of his testimony and not just about who he did or didn't talk to on October 24 or October 26. It sort of cast lots of his testimony in doubt, given the passage of time and makes the district attorney's office look terrible all in one breath," Rubin continued.</p><p>"This is a moment of real triumph for Todd Blanche, you can even hear it in his voice. He is not a person to get excitable very easily," Rubin added before calling it a "real point for the defense." </p><p><a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/cnns-elie-honig-says-michael-cohen-had-his-knees-chopped-out-by-trumps-attorney-in-devastating-cross-examination/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CNN analyst Elie Honig</a> added that Cohen had his "knees chopped out" during cross-examination, while the New York Times' Jonathan Alter described the exchange as "pay dirt" for Trump's defense. Alter added Trump seemed happy even after the defense couldn't shake Cohen on another story about a payoff to ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal.</p><p>"Even so, I saw Trump smiling as he whispered to one of his lawyers. It was a good day for him," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/14/opinion/thepoint" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Alter wrote.</a></p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Michael Cohen is asked about taking an oath as he is cross-examined by defense lawyer Todd Blanche during former President Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan state court in New York City, May 16, 2024, in this courtroom sketch.</span> <span>(Reuters/Jane Rosenberg )</span></p></div></div></div><p>During the contentious exchange, Blanche accused Cohen of lying about a phone call he allegedly made to Schiller to speak with Trump about the hush money payment. But an unearthed text exchange showed Cohen asking Schiller who he could speak with about harassing phone calls he had been receiving from an alleged 14-year-old prankster, to which Schiller responded, "Call me." </p><p>Cohen previously testified Tuesday that the Oct. 24 phone call, which lasted for one minute and 36 seconds, was about Trump. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ny-v-trump-house-gop0firebrands-flank-trump-outside-manhattan-courtroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>NY V TRUMP: HOUSE GOP FIREBRANDS FLANK TRUMP OUTSIDE MANHATTAN COURTROOM</u></strong></a></p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Former President Trump speaks to the press alongside his lawyer Todd Blanche at his trial at Manhattan Criminal Court on May 7, 2024, in New York City.</span> <span>(Win McNamee/Pool via Reuters)</span></p></div></div></div><p>Blanche asked if the testimony on Tuesday was a lie because Cohen said then that he called to speak with Trump. Cohen responded, "Part of it was the 14-year-old ... but I know Keith was with Mr. Trump." Blanche again accused Cohen of lying insisted he never spoke with Trump that day.</p><p>"That was a lie, you did not talk to President Trump," Blanche said.</p><p id="cultivate-embed" data-question-id="653"></p><p>"I’m not certain that’s accurate," Cohen responded.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</u></strong></a> </p><p>The cross-examination of Cohen is set to resume on Monday.

The attacker climbed on a large waste bin and threw a petrol bomb through a small window, setting the synagogue alight.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Two police officers reached the scene fast, after the man was spotted on security cameras. The suspect was on the roof of the synagogue when they arrived, according to prosecutors. After threatening the pair he threw a chisel at them before jumping down to the ground, brandishing a 25cm (10in) knife.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">"The officer opened fire five times, hitting the individual four times," said Rouen public prosecutor Frédéric Teillet, explaining that he had seen the footage on the security cameras.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Firefighters at the scene eventually brought the fire under control inside the synagogue in the historic centre of the city. There appeared to be no victims other than the armed man, the mayor said.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Damage inside the synagogue has been described as significant. "I'm really upset, it's catastrophic," said Natacha Benhaïm, the head of Rouen's Jewish community of some 150 families.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">The walls and furniture had been left blackened by the fire, although "the Torah scrolls, the holy books, did not come to any harm". </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Inspecting the damage inside the synagogue, Rabbi Shmouel Lubecki said the city's small community was devastated by the attack.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">"The message the community needs to hear is we mustn't give up. We must be able to practise our Judaism in complete freedom; antisemites cannot destroy us. " he told BFMTV. "So we're asking the community to light the candles this sabbath evening and come to the synagogue if you can."</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Mr Teillet said two investigations were under way - into an arson attack on a place of worship and into the use of a police weapon outside the building.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Although the officer was currently in custody, the prosecutor said that video footage indicated he had used his gun "according to conditions allowed by the internal security code".</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin visited the synagogue and praised police for their fast response and their courage in tackling the attacker.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">"I want to reiterate, on this sabbath evening, that at the interior ministry we are extremely determined to protect France's entire Jewish community, wherever they are, and that they must practise their religion without fear."</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Little is known about the suspected attacker, who was not carrying any form of identity at the time.

"It was a very chaotic situation, understandably so considering the tragic accident that had occurred earlier, and there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do. </p><p id="section_news" class="moreFrom darkBg"></p> <p> “I never intended to disregard any of the instructions,” he said. “I'm hopeful to put this to the side and focus on golf today. Of course, all of us involved in the tournament express our deepest sympathies to the family of the man who passed away in the earlier accident this morning. It truly puts everything in perspective.” </p> <p> His attorney, Steve Romines in Louisville, also described it as a misunderstanding and told The Associated Press, “We will litigate the case as it goes.” </p> <p> Louisville mayor Craig Greenberg said tournament vendor John Mills was the pedestrian killed and offered sympathies to his family. Greenberg also said the incident involving Scheffler and LMPD was “unfortunate” and that the police department was investigating. </p> <p> Traffic was backed up for about a mile in both directions on the only road that leads to Valhalla in the morning darkness with light rain, with dozens of police vehicles flashing red-and-blue lights near the entrance. </p> <p> Police said a pedestrian had been struck by a bus while crossing the road in a lane that was dedicated to tournament traffic and was pronounced dead at the scene about 5:09 a.m. </p> <p> ESPN reporter Jeff Darlington witnessed the incident and said Scheffler, the No. 1 player in the world who was to start the second round at 8:48 a.m., drove past a police officer a little after 6 a.m. in his SUV with markings on the door indicating it was a PGA Championship vehicle. </p> <p> The officer screamed at him to stop and then grabbed onto the car until Scheffler stopped about 10 yards later, Darlington said. The officer, identified in the arrest report as Det. Gillis, was dragged “to the ground” and suffered “pain, swelling, and abrasions to his left wrist” after the car “accelerated forward,” according to Louisville police. </p> <p> Scheffler was booked at 7:28 a.m. — about 2 1/2 hours before his updated tee time after the second round was delayed because of the fatality. In addition to the assault charge, he was booked on charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding traffic signals from an officer directing traffic. </p> <p> “The main thing is he was proceeding exactly as he was directed in a marked vehicle with credentials," Romines said. “He didn’t do anything intentionally wrong.” </p> <p> The officer was dressed in a high visibility reflective jacket when he stopped Scheffler’s car to give instructions, the arrest sheet said. Gillis was taken to the hospital for his injuries. </p> <p> Darlington said police pulled Scheffler out of the car, pushed him up against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs. </p> <p> “Scheffler was then walked over to the police car, placed in the back, in handcuffs, very stunned about what was happening, looked toward me as he was in those handcuffs and said, ‘Please help me,’" Darlington said. “He very clearly did not know what was happening in the situation. It moved very quickly, very rapidly, very aggressively.” </p> <p> Louisville Metro police spokesman Dwight Mitchell told Louisville radio station WHAS the man was crossing Shelbyville Road about 5 a.m. and the bus didn't see him. Mitchell said the man was pronounced dead on the scene. </p> <p> Scheffler was released by police and returned to the course at 9:12 a.m. He made his way to the practice area around 9:30 a.m. and was welcomed by fans — one shouted “free Scottie!” and others arrived later wearing “Free Scottie” T-shirts. </p> <p> Scheffler seemed like his normal, relaxed self, sharing a few laughs on the driving range. Then he went out and made a birdie on his first hole of the day after sticking his approach shot to 3 feet. </p> <p> With cars backed up in the morning darkness, other PGA-marked vehicles tried to move slowly toward the entrance. Traffic finally began to move gradually a little before 7 a.m. </p> <p> It was a surreal start to what already has been a wild week of weather — the Masters champion and top-ranked player in the world, dressed in workout clothes with his hands in cuffs behind his back amid flashing lights. </p> <p> Darlington, the ESPN reporter, said police were not sure who Scheffler was. He said an officer asked him to leave and when he identified himself being with the media, he was told, “There's nothing you can do. He's going to jail.” </p> <p> Darlington said another police officer later approached with a notepad and asked if he knew the name of the person they put in handcuffs. </p> <p> Louisville police have attracted negative national attention in recent years after the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in 2020 and a federal investigation into its policing practices. </p> <p> A Department of Justice report released last year said Louisville officers use excessive force and conduct searches based on invalid warrants. The report said Black motorists in Louisville were more likely to be searched during traffic stops, and officers used neck restraints, police dogs and Tasers against people who posed no imminent threat. </p> <p> Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was shot by officers in who had come to her apartment with a warrant that federal officials later said was falsified. </p> <p> PGA of America, which runs the PGA Championship, offered sympathies for Mills' family and said in a statement, “As it relates to the incident involving Scottie Scheffler, we are fully cooperating as local authorities review what took place.” </p> <p> Scheffler is coming off four victories in his last five tournaments, including his second Masters title. He was home in Dallas the last three weeks waiting on the birth of his first child, a son that was born May 8. </p> <p> Scheffler opened with a 4-under 67 and was five shots out of the lead as he tries to become only the fifth player since 1960 to win the first two majors of the year. </p> <p> Associated Press writer Dylan Lovan contributed. </p> <p> golf: /hub/golf </p> <p><strong>This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.</strong></p> <p></p> </div> </div>
