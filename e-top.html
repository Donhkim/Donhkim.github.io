    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>US President Joe Biden has urged Hamas to accept a new Israeli proposal to end the conflict in Gaza.</strong> The proposal includes a six-week ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli Defense Forces from populated areas of Gaza, and an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The proposal is a three-part deal</strong>, with the first phase including a full and complete ceasefire, withdrawal of IDF forces from populated areas, and exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The second phase would see all remaining living hostages returned, including male soldiers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The deal aims to provide humanitarian aid and reconstruction</strong> for Gaza, with 600 trucks carrying aid into Gaza every day. The deal would eventually lead to a permanent "cessation of hostilities" and a major reconstruction plan for Gaza.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>International leaders have welcomed the proposal</strong>, with UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron urging Hamas to accept the deal and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres encouraging all parties to seize the opportunity for a ceasefire and durable peace in the Middle East.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Biden acknowledged that negotiations between phases one and two would be difficult</strong>, but emphasized that it was a decisive moment for Hamas to prove that they truly want a ceasefire.</p>

    <div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">US President Joe Biden has urged Hamas to accept a new Israeli proposal to end the conflict in Gaza, saying that "it's time for this war to end". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The three-part proposal would begin with a six-week ceasefire in which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There would also be a "surge" of humanitarian aid, as well as an exchange of some hostages for Palestinian prisoners. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The deal would eventually lead to a permanent "cessation of hostilities" and a major reconstruction plan for Gaza. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Hamas said it views the proposal "positively". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Speaking at the White House on Friday, Mr Biden said that the first phase of the proposed plan would include a "full and complete ceasefire", the withdrawal of IDF forces from populated areas and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"This is truly a decisive moment," he said. "Hamas says it wants a ceasefire. This deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it." </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The ceasefire, he added, would allow more humanitarian aid to reach the beleaguered territory, with "600 trucks carrying aid into Gaza every single day". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The second phase would see all remaining living hostages returned, including male soldiers. The ceasefire would then become "the cessation of hostilities, permanently." </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Among those who have urged Hamas to agree to the proposal was UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron, who said on X that the group "must accept this deal so we can see a stop in the fighting". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"We’ve long argued a stop in the fighting can be turned into a permanent peace if we are all prepared to take the right steps," Lord Cameron added. "Let’s seize this moment and bring this conflict to an end."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also welcomed the development in a post to X, formerly known as Twitter. He said the world had "witnessed too much suffering [and] destruction in Gaza" and said it was "time to stop". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"I welcome [President] Biden’s initiative [and] encourage all parties to seize this opportunity for a ceasefire, release of all hostages, guaranteed unhindered humanitarian access [and] ultimately a durable peace in the Middle East," he added.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In his speech, Mr Biden acknowledged that negotiations between phases one and two would be difficult. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">As recently as a few days ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was letting it be known that he was implacably opposed to agreeing to end the war as part of a ceasefire deal - making Mr Biden's reference to the war's end particularly significant. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">While the plan includes many of the details from previous, ultimately failed rounds of talks, the US calls for a permanent ceasefire appear to be a significant concession designed to try and draw Hamas back to negotiations on terms they have already said they would agree to. A permanent ceasefire has been one of the group's key demands. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The third phase of the proposal would see the final remains of any deceased Israeli hostages returned, as well as a "major reconstruction plan" with US and international assistance to rebuild homes, schools and hospitals. </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In his remarks, Mr Biden acknowledged that some Israelis - including officials within Israel's government - would likely be opposed to the proposal. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"I've urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal," he said. "Regardless of whatever [political] pressure comes. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The US president also directly addressed the Israeli people, telling them that "we can't lose this moment". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Notably, Mr Biden said that Hamas has now been degraded to the extent that it can no longer repeat an attack such as that which its fighters conducted on 7 October - a likely signal to the Israelis that Washington sees the war as done. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In a statement, Prime Minister Netanyahu insisted that the war would not end until its objectives were achieved, including the return of all hostages and the elimination of Hamas' military and governing capabilities. He said the latest plan would allow Israel to uphold these principles.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Hamas, for its part, said that it views the proposal "positively" because of its call for a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, reconstruction and the exchange of prisoners. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The group said it was ready to "deal positively and constructively" to any proposal centred on a permanent ceasefire, provided that Israel "declares its explicit commitment to that". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Another Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations who has seen the new Israeli proposal said that the document did not include a guarantee that the war will end, nor that IDF troops would withdraw from Gaza completely. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The proposal has been transmitted to Hamas through mediators based in Qatar. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Faced with mounting civilian casualties in Gaza, President Biden has faced growing domestic criticism over the level of US support for Israel, and calls to do more to encourage the warring sides to negotiate. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Earlier this week, however, the White House said that it does not believe that Israeli operations in Rafah amount to a "major ground operation" that could cross a red line and trigger a possible change in US policy. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The statement came after an Israeli air strike and resulting fire killed at least 45 Palestinians on Sunday. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In a separate announcement on Friday, US lawmakers from both sides of the political spectrum formally invited Mr Netanyahu to address Congress in Washington. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It is unclear when the address would take place. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">More than 36,000 have been killed across Gaza since the start of the conflict, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The war began in October when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 252 back to Gaza as hostages.</p></div></div>

                                        <p>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas Supreme Court on Friday rejected a closely watched challenge to the state’s restrictive abortion ban, ruling against a group of women who had serious pregnancy complications and became the first in the U.S. to testify in court about being denied abortions since Roe v. Wade was overturned.</p><p>In a unanimous ruling, the all-Republican court upheld the Texas law that opponents say is too vague when it comes to when medically necessary exceptions are allowed. The same issue was at the center of a separate lawsuit brought last year by Kate Cox, a mother of two from Dallas, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-kate-cox-texas-exceptions-e85664b2ab76bcb689b1b91913d3e33e">who sought court permission</a></span> to obtain an abortion after her fetus developed a fatal condition during a pregnancy that resulted in multiple trips to an emergency room.</p><p>Abortion rights activists have struggled to stem the tide of restrictions that have taken effect in most Republican-led states since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-dobbs-anniversary-state-laws-51c2a83899f133556e715342abfcface">overturned Roe vs Wade</a></span>, which for nearly 50 years had affirmed the constitutional right to an abortion. </p>
    

<p>The court said the law’s exceptions, as written, are broad enough and that doctors would be misinterpreting the law if they declined to perform an abortion when the mother’s life is in danger. </p>



<p>“Texas law permits a life-saving abortion,” the court wrote in the order signed by Justice Jane Bland. </p><p>The decision appeared to close, at least for now, another pathway for opponents who have sought to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/women-sue-texas-over-abortion-ban-632fad72e0f5b255a3a55274cd097fa9">force the state to provide more clarity</a></span> about when exceptions are allowed. Last year, plaintiffs in the lawsuit gave emotional accounts in an Austin courtroom over how they carried babies they knew would not survive and continued pregnancies that put their health in worsening danger.</p>
    
<p>“Now we know the courthouse doors are closed to them,” said Molly Duane, a staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represented the Texas women. “It seems Texans have nowhere to go but the voting booth, in terms of what comes next.”</p>
    

<p>Under the law in Texas, doctors who perform abortions risk life in prison, fines of up to $100,000 and revocation of their state medical licenses. </p><p>A lower court in 2023 had granted <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Zurawski-v-Texas_TI.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a temporary injunction</a></span> preventing Texas from enforcing the ban against doctors who in their “good faith judgment” ended a pregnancy that they determined was unsafe because of complications. But that was immediately blocked by an appeal from the Texas attorney general’s office to the state’s Supreme Court.</p><p>Amanda Zurawski, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, had been told that she had a condition that meant her baby would not survive. The Austin woman said she was forced to wait until she was diagnosed with a life-threatening case of sepsis before being provided an abortion. </p><p>She spent three days in intensive care and was left with a permanently closed fallopian tube from an infection, affecting her ability to have more children. </p><p>The court ruled that state law does not require that a woman’s death or serious impairment be “imminent” when being evaluated by a doctor for an abortion.</p>
    

<p>“Ms. Zurawski’s agonizing wait to be ill ‘enough’ for induction, her development of sepsis, and her permanent physical injury are not the results the law commands,” the court wrote.</p><p>Zurawski called the ruling “heartbreaking.” </p><p>“I am outraged on behalf of my fellow plaintiffs who the Court deemed not sick enough,” Zurawski said. “We all deserve bodily autonomy. Every day, people in Texas are being told that they have no options. It’s sickening and wrong.”</p><p>Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose office defended the law in the case, applauded the ruling. </p><p>“I will continue to defend the laws enacted by the Legislature and uphold the values of the people of Texas by doing everything in my power to protect mothers and babies,” Paxton posted on X.</p><p>Earlier this month, two University of Texas professors signed onto Paxton’s federal lawsuit against the Biden administration over regulations that expand protections for pregnant students in federally funded education programs. Those include accommodations for students who need to miss class for abortion care.</p>
    

<p>Philosophy professor Daniel Bonevac and business professor John Hatfield said they would accommodate students only in cases of “medically necessary” abortions when a mother’s life or health is threatened.</p><p>The state lawsuit decided Friday argued that exemptions under the Texas law, which allow an abortion to save a mother’s life or prevent the impairment of a major bodily function, create confusion among doctors, who were turning away some pregnant women experiencing health complications because they feared repercussions. </p><p>The plaintiffs said the abortion ban has made medical professionals wary of facing liability if the state does not consider the situation a medical emergency. </p><p>Last year, Cox ended up leaving the state for an abortion before the court ruled that she hadn’t shown her life was in danger. In the ruling, the court also called on the state medical board to offer more guidance. </p>
    

<p>New guidelines proposed by the medical board earlier this year, though, offered little beyond advising doctors to meticulously document their decision-making. And Texas’ Republican-led Legislature is not expected to make any changes to the law’s language. </p><p>Plaintiff Kaitlyn Kash, whose fetus developed severe skeletal dysplasia, was told even the simplest movements could break its bones in utero. While her life was not threatened, she chose to leave Texas to get an abortion.</p><p>“I wanted to end my child’s pain before it could begin,” Kash said. “The state just told me that as a mother, I don’t have the right to make those decisions for my child. ... If you want to grow your family, if you want to have children, you should get out of Texas.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Stengle reported from Dallas. Associated Press writer Paul J.

            Daybell was convicted Thursday of first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the deaths of his first wife, Tammy Daybell, and two of his second wife’s children – 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua “JJ” Vallow – in a case prosecutors claim was fueled by power, sex, money and apocalyptic spiritual beliefs.

            The sentencing phase of Daybell’s trial began shortly after the guilty verdict was delivered, with state Judge Steven Boyce giving jurors preliminary instructions. Jurors began deliberating his fate Friday afternoon after hearing victim impact statements and contrasting portraits of the man from lawyers.

            In his opening statement to the jury on Friday, prosecutor Rob Wood asked them to consider aggravating factors that would make Daybell eligible for the death penalty.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwuyfv0p00043b6jlhdyqz0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            First, the three murders, he said, were committed for remuneration. Daybell was also convicted of insurance fraud stemming from life insurance policies that allegedly paid him money after his first wife’s death. His second wife, as well as Daybell, also were convicted of grand theft because she continued to draw Social Security benefits for her children after their deaths.

            Additionally, Wood told the jury, the murders of the three victims were “especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity.”
    </p>

            “This defendant exhibited utter disregard for human life,” Wood added. “The defendant, by his conduct, whether such conduct was before, during or after the commission of the murders at hand, has exhibited a propensity to commit murder, which will probably constitute a continuing threat to society.”
    </p>

            The prosecutor concluded, “It is your decision whether one or more of these aggravators has been proven. And if it has been, you must decide if, under these circumstances, imposition of the death penalty would be just or unjust.”
    </p>

            The verdict came about a year after Daybell’s second wife, Lori Vallow Daybell, was also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/12/us/lori-vallow-daybell-jury-deliberation-friday/index.html">convicted</a> of the murder of her children and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Vallow Daybell has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/06/us/lori-vallow-daybell-conviction-appeal/index.html">appealed her convictions</a> to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether she was mentally competent to stand trial.

            Addressing the jury Friday, defense lawyer John Prior portrayed Daybell as a once “quiet, reserved, shy young man” who grew up in Springville, Utah, a small, tight knit “town of faith.” Daybell, his lawyer said, met his first wife, Tammy, and they were married for 29 years, raising five “wonderful” children “very deep in their faith, very deep in their commitment to family.”
    </p>

            “Everything that glitters is not gold,” he told jurors. “Lori Vallow glittered. She was not gold. She was the trajectory that changed the plan… Chaos hits and all of these things start cascading and this thing becomes very complicated and difficult.”

            “We have to look back at that,” he said. “You examine what Chad Daybell’s past was prior to the bomb being dropped, the Lori Vallow bomb being dropped… If it wasn’t for that trajectory coming in and changing the path, is this where we would be going? It’s not where we’d be going.”

<p>In remarks from the White House on Friday announcing that <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-israel-new-ceasefire-proposal/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Israel has put forward a new cease-fire proposal</a></span>, Mr. Biden acknowledged divisions on the war and said Palestinians "have endured sheer hell in this war."  </p><p>"I know this is a subject on which people in this country feel deep, passionate convictions. So do I. It's been one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world," he said. </p><p>The president also said Israel has accomplished one of its main objectives of the war and "Hamas is no longer is capable of carrying out another October 7," referring to Hamas' gruesome attacks across Israel last year that left more than 1,200 people dead. The attacks prompted Israel to launch the war in the Hamas-led Gaza Strip.</p><p>In March, Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish elected official in the U.S., <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chuck-schumer-israel-new-election-benjamin-netanyahu/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">called</a></span> Netanyahu a "major obstacle to peace" and said he "lost his way by allowing his political survival to take the precedence over the best interests of Israel." Schumer, who has long supported Israel, also called on its government to hold a new election. </p>

<p>"He has been too willing to tolerate the civilian toll in Gaza, which is pushing support for Israel worldwide to historic lows," the New York Democrat said in a speech on the Senate floor. "Israel cannot survive if it becomes a pariah."</p><p>Days later, Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said he planned to invite Netanyahu to address Congress. Schumer said in a statement that "Israel has no stronger ally than the United States" and he "will always welcome the opportunity for the prime minister of Israel to speak to Congress in a bipartisan way." </p><p>Schumer recently reiterated to reporters that the U.S. relationship with Israel is "ironclad and transcends any one prime minister or president."</p><p>U.S. officials, including those who have been critical of Netanyahu, came to his defense earlier this month after the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/icc-arrest-warrants-sought-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-yahya-sinwar/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">International Criminal Court announced it was seeking arrest warrants</a></span> against the prime minister and three Hamas leaders over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The U.S. does not.</p><p>The move to obtain a warrant was welcomed by some progressives in the U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat, <a href="https://x.com/MarkPocan/status/1792543063740752141" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> he "would be more than glad to show the ICC the way to the House floor to issue that warrant." Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, said the ICC "is doing its job." </p><p>"Democratically elected officials can commit war crimes," Sanders said on the Senate floor. "We cannot only apply international law when it is convenient." </p><p>The House is working on legislation that involves sanctions against the ICC in response. </p>

A number of other Democrats have also expressed opposition. </p><p>"I just don't think it's constructive for Netanyahu to be addressing, to be doing a joint address in this moment. Period," Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, told reporters. </p><p>Before Memorial Day, Jeffries, also from New York, said the notion that Democrats are divided on the issue "is overstated." Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus, added that if Netanyahu is invited to speak to a Congress, "we'll respect that." </p><p>Netanyahu last addressed a joint meeting of Congress in 2015 as he sought to convince lawmakers to torpedo negotiations between the Obama administration and Iran over the regime's nuclear program. </p><p><em>Jaala Brown, Alan He, Nikole Killion and Ellis Kim contributed reporting. </em></p>

Minneapolis became ground zero for the “defund the police” movement, and while that <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/2021-election-minneapolis-cc108d1707d9cb8cbaa6135bb60e7fbd">didn’t succeed</a></span> in eliminating the city’s police department, the force remains well below full strength. </p><p>On Friday, visiting a memorial that has popped up at Mitchell’s former station in south Minneapolis, Mayor Jacob Frey paid tribute to the fallen officer and to officers who, like Mitchell, have joined or stayed despite everything. </p><p>“They’re committed to protecting and serving,” the mayor said. “They’re committed to the change that we’ve talked about. They’re committed to upholding these values that we all want to see.” </p>
    

<p>“Right now we are seeing people enter this force that really care. We’re seeing heroes that are deciding to step up, to wear the badge that they do, to wear the uniform that they do, to make the city a better place,” Frey said. “Officer Mitchell was clearly a prime example of exactly that.” </p>



<p>Mitchell, 36, was killed while responding to a double shooting at an apartment building. Mitchell stopped to aid a man who appeared to be an injured victim, but that man shot him instead. </p>
    
<p>The shooter’s name and other details about him have not yet been made public. The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is leading the investigation of what its leader said was clearly an ambush. In an update Friday, the bureau said it is still working to establish a clear timeline of events but three people were killed: Mitchell, the gunman and a person in the apartment. </p><div class="AudioEnhancement" data-separate-event="audioModule" data-separate-value="AP AUDIO: Minneapolis police chief shares anger with fellow officers over ambush death of one of their own" data-module="" data-gtm-region="AP AUDIO: Minneapolis police chief shares anger with fellow officers over ambush death of one of their own" data-align-center="" module-before-ad="" data-module-number="3" data-main-module-number="3">

        AP AUDIO: Minneapolis police chief shares anger with fellow officers over ambush death of one of their own
    </h1>
    
    
    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP correspondent Jackie Quinn reports Minneapolis police officials are expressing their outrage over the ambush killing of a police officer responding to a shooting scene.</p>
    
</div>
    

<p>The BCA also said four people were injured — another responding officer, a second person in the apartment, a bystander in a vehicle and a firefighter. The officer and firefighter were treated and released, and the others remained hospitalized. </p><p>Investigators confirmed that two officers fired their guns, the BCA added. </p><p>Police Chief Brian O’Hara said the gunman “assassinated” Mitchell while the officer was attempting to help him, and continued to shoot him after he fell to the ground. </p><p>“I am angry and deeply hurt by such a senseless and violent attack on Minneapolis’ Finest,” O’Hara told officers Friday, according to a statement released by the department. </p><p>The confrontation did not come as a total shock to Reuben Molina — who heard the initial shots at his apartment upstairs and witnessed the shootout with police a few minutes later. Molina and other nearby residents said they believe crime is a problem in their neighborhood, and police presence feels sparse.</p><p>“Honestly, I’m surprised it hasn’t happened sooner,” Molina said. </p><p>Mitchell, a father who was engaged to be married, had been with the department just shy of 18 months when he was killed.</p>
    

<p>He was the kind of officer the department really wants to recruit, showing his courage just three days into the job when he rescued an older adult couple from their burning home, an incident that Chief O’Hara and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz both cited in mourning his death. </p><p>Minneapolis’ police department had 560 officers in March when it launched a $1 million recruiting campaign, down from more than 800 before the pandemic. Many retired or went on disability after Floyd’s death, claiming post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from the unrest. </p><p>The metro area has seen other recent deaths of first responders: In the suburb of Burnsville, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/burnsville-minnesota-police-shooting-details-d0bf1062499b25a818da45c3c9596a28">two officers and a firefighter-paramedic</a></span> were killed, and a third officer was wounded, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/burnsville-minnesota-police-shooting-memorial-service-8b4a2c5b2334e4304dab3f7527c5de14">while responding</a></span> to a domestic violence call. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/burnsville-minnesota-police-shooting-memorial-service-8b4a2c5b2334e4304dab3f7527c5de14">Their funeral</a></span> drew thousands of officers, paramedics and firefighters. </p><p>Retired New York City Police Sgt. Joe Giacalone, who is now an adjunct professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said anytime an officer is killed it affects everyone in the department because it drives home the reality that it can happen to any of them. And some of the police accountability measures enacted in the wake of Floyd’s death may have made it harder for police to do their jobs, he said. </p>
    

<p>“Unfortunately we’re dealing with for the last couple of years, an anti-cop environment in this country, coming from many politicians and many members of the community, and when you have a blow like this, it kind of hits morale even more,” Giacalone said. </p><p>“Recruitment is just not a problem in Minneapolis. It’s a problem in every police department across the country. And stories like this, in situations like this, certainly don’t help with recruitment,” he added said. </p><p>Former Minneapolis Police Chief Janeé Harteau, who led the department from 2012 to 2017, said the events of the last four years, and probably going back before that, made recruiting challenging to begin with, and Mitchell’s death will only make it harder. </p>
    

<p>“When you get a young hero taken unnecessarily and tragically, and then when you couple that with today’s polarized and divided climate, it adds to that challenge of recruitment,” Harteau said. “Because there’s a multitude of things people can do to serve, and policing isn’t anyone’s first choice anymore, it seems.” </p><p>While it’s important to hold police accountable, she said, it’s also important for officers to know they have the support of their leadership, elected officials and the public. </p><p>“We know when we take the job, we know that we might not come home. We know it’s truly life and death,” she said. “But when an event like this occurs, that’s when the public can begin to understand what it’s like.” </p><p>City Council Member LaTrisha Vetaw on Friday recalled meeting Mitchell at his badge ceremony in 2022. </p><p>“When I asked him why he joined the department, he said he wanted to ‘be the change’ he wanted to see in policing,” Vetaw said in an email to constituents. “He selflessly gave his life to this mission while protecting the city he served.” </p><h2>___</h2><p>This story has been corrected to reflect that the number of deaths was three. </p><h2>___</h2><p>Funk reported from Omaha, Nebraska. </p>

                                        <p>TORONTO (AP) — Canadian serial killer Robert Pickton, who took female victims to his pig farm during a crime spree near Vancouver in the late 1990s and early 2000s, has died after being assaulted in prison, authorities said Friday. He was 74.</p><p>The Correctional Service of Canada said in statement that Pickton, an inmate of Port-Cartier Institution in the province of Quebec, died in hospital following injuries in the May 19 assault involving another inmate. He was one of Canada’s most notorious serial killers and his case made international headlines.</p><p>A 51-year-old inmate was in custody for the assault on Pickton, police spokesman Hugues Beaulieu said earlier this month. </p><p>Robert “Willie” Pickton was convicted of six counts of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2007, with the maximum parole ineligibility period of 25 years, after being charged with the murders of 26 women.</p>
    

<p>Police began searching the Pickton farm in the Vancouver suburb of Port Coquitlam more than 22 years ago in what would be a years-long investigation into the disappearances of dozens of women from Vancouver’s seediest streets, sex workers and users of drugs abandoned on the margins of society.</p>



<p>The remains or DNA of 33 women were found on the farm. Pickton once bragged to an undercover police officer that he killed a total of 49 women.</p><p>During his trial, prosecution witness <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.seattlepi.com/search/?action=search&amp;channel=national&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=property&amp;query=%22Andrew+Bellwood%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Bellwood</a></span> said Pickton told him how he strangled his victims and fed their remains to his pigs. Health officials once issued a tainted meat advisory to neighbors who might have bought pork from Pickton’s farm, concerned the meat might have contained human remains.</p>
    
<p>Cynthia Cardinal, whose sister Georgina Papin was murdered by Pickton, said Pickton’s death means she can finally move on from her sister’s murder. </p><p>“This is gonna bring healing for, I won’t say all families, I’ll just say most of the families,” she said. “I’m like — wow, finally. I can actually move on and heal and I can put this behind me.”</p>
    

<p>Vancouver police were criticized for not taking the cases seriously because many of the missing were sex workers or users of drugs.</p><p>Canada’s correctional service said it was conducting an investigation into the attack on Pickton.</p><p>“The investigation will examine all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the assault, including whether policies and protocols were followed,” the service said in the statement. “We are mindful that this offender’s case has had a devastating impact on communities in British Columbia and across the country, including Indigenous peoples, victims and their families. Our thoughts are with them.”</p><p>Pickton’s confirmed victims were six: Sereena Abotsway, Mona Wilson, Andrea Joesbury, Brenda Ann Wolfe, Papin and Marnie Frey.</p><p>“Earlier today, I was made aware of the death of an inmate at Port-Cartier Institution,” Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said in statement. “At this time, my thoughts are with the families of the victims of this individual’s heinous crimes.”</p><p>At the time of Pickton’s sentencing, British Columbia Supreme Court Justice James Williams said it was a “rare case that properly warrants the maximum period of parole ineligibility available to the court.”</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Retailers' success is not due to increased consumer spending, but rather due to executing well and being chosen by cash-strapped shoppers over competitors.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consumers are being selective about where they spend their money, prioritizing purchases that offer value, convenience, and fun.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sticky inflation, high interest rates, and a toughening economy are making consumers more cautious with their spending.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Companies like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, TJX Companies, and Gap are among those that are thriving in this environment.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Rather than increased consumer spending, these successful retailers are benefiting from being choosy about where they spend their money.</p>

Both retailers are in the midst of ambitious turnaround plans and are performing better than expected because of new strategies they’ve implemented. </p><p>Gap <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/30/gap-gps-earnings-q1-2024.html">posted positive comparable sales</a> for all four of its brands — Athleta, Old Navy, Banana Republic and its namesake banner — for the first time in “many years,” beating Wall Street’s expectations across the board, the company said. </p><p>For years, Gap had been losing market share to buzzy competitors. But <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/gap-taps-mattel-executive-richard-dickson-to-be-its-new-ceo.html">under new CEO Richard Dickson</a>, the marketing guru credited with reviving the Barbie franchise, the apparel chain has focused on financial rigor, brand storytelling and product development. In under a year, Gap’s sales and profits have meaningfully improved, and its brands are beginning to be part of the cultural conversation again.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>A few weeks ago, actor Anne Hathaway went to a Bulgari party wearing a white Gap shirt dress that had been designed by the company’s new creative director, Zac Posen. Critically, Gap dropped the $158 dress to consumers, and it sold out within hours. This combination of marketing and exclusive product drops is what Gap had long been lacking, and what competitors had already been doing. </p><p>Foot Locker had declined over the last couple of years, but with the right combination of new strategies and a little bit of luck, its turnaround is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/30/foot-locker-fl-earnings-q1-2024.html">showing signs of life</a>. </p><p>Under CEO Mary Dillon, Foot Locker has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/24/inside-foot-lockers-plan-to-revitalize-retail-footprint.html#:~:text=The%20new%20format%20also%20includes,customized%20options%20like%20specialized%20lacing.">worked to change its stores</a>, where it does more than 80% of its sales.<strong> </strong>It has tried to create not only a better shopping experience for consumers but also a better place for its critical brand partners.</p><p>Instead of two walls of shoes with competing brands mixed together, Foot Locker is changing its fleet so the brands have their own unique displays. Its new “store of the future” concept at a New Jersey mall that brings that strategy to life has become its best performing store in North America in just a few weeks, Dillon told CNBC, adding that brands are thrilled with the new design. </p><p>The shift couldn’t have come at a better time. Years into Nike’s strategy to cut out wholesalers and sell directly to consumers, the retailer is realizing it went too far and is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/12/nike-ceo-acknowledges-it-went-too-far-in-direct-push.html">now changing course</a>.</p><p>With refreshed stores and better product displays, consumers are converting more, too, and paying full price — even Foot Locker’s lower-income shopper. </p><p>“Our consumer ... this is a category that is very important to them. So when people have discretionary income, it may be limited, but you’re gonna prioritize where you spend it, right?” said Dillon. “We’re proving that people are willing to spend full price, but you have to have the right products and serve it up in a way that makes it enticing, right? So that’s where the whole customer experience really matters.” </p><p>Elsewhere, <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-18"><a href="/quotes/DKS/">Dick’s Sporting Goods</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/29/dicks-sporting-goods-dks-earnings-q1-2024.html">posted a solid first-quarter report</a> Wednesday, as executives said average selling prices and transactions rose and that they saw no signs of consumers trading down for cheaper options. That may not mean shoppers are spending more broadly, though: Dick’s has long been considered a best-in-class operator that offers a solid shopping experience, meaning it can win even when consumers are picky with their spending.</p></div><h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"><a id="headline0"></a>Denim wars</h2><div class="group"><p>Two retailers that didn’t have great quarters — <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-20"><a href="/quotes/AEO/">American Eagle</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> and <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-21"><a href="/quotes/KSS/">Kohl’s</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span> — tell a story of executing poorly or missing out on trends. </p><p>American Eagle handily beat earnings estimates thanks to a new strategy <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/07/american-eagle-aeo-earnings-q4-2023.html#:~:text=Looking%20ahead%20to%20the%20next,Eagle's%20initials%20and%20stock%20ticker.">designed to boost profitable growth</a>, but it fell short on revenue and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/29/american-eagle-aeo-earnings-q1-2024.html#:~:text=American%20Eagle%20posted%20net%20income,%241.08%20billion%20a%20year%20earlier.">issued cautious guidance</a> that was slightly below Wall Street’s expectations. </p><p>American Eagle president and executive creative director Jennifer Foyle told CNBC that the brand is working to cut out items that aren’t landing with shoppers and dig down into the ones that are. She said the retailer was overly focused on jeggings in the past but now, low-rise, baggy fits are in. </p><p>During a store visit at the American Dream mall in New Jersey on Thursday, an associate told CNBC that the location didn’t have the low-rise, baggy fit in-stores, and they were only available online. Meanwhile, there was a wall of jeggings. Still, denim was a strong performer for the company during the quarter, and it had a variety of other styles that resonated with customers at the location, the company said.</p></div><div class="group"><p>Denim is having a moment with shoppers. Search levels for denim are hitting peaks in a 20-year data set, particularly for categories like tops and dresses, according to a Morgan Stanley research note. </p><p>Kohl’s is missing the mark in a far more meaningful way. The retailer <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/30/kohls-kss-earnings-q1-2024.html#:~:text=Kohl's%20reported%20a%20net%20loss,compared%20to%20the%20year%20prior.">posted dismal numbers</a> on Thursday, as both earnings and revenue fell well short of expectations. It cut its full-year forecast and its shares plunged more than 20%, the stock’s biggest single-day percentage decline ever.</p><p>The weak results illustrated a challenge the retailer is still contending with: Keeping up with trends and staying relevant. </p><p>CEO Tom Kingsbury told CNBC he expects the “head-to-toe” denim trend to play a role in the back half of the year, but it could already be out of style by the time Kohl’s gets around to adding the clothing items to its shelves.</p><p>“Denim is OK business for us. I mean it’s really not the most important time for denim,” said Kingsbury. “We’re selling shorts and tees. And more, you know, warm weather product.” </p><p>Gap, one of the longtime denim leaders, didn’t seem to be concerned about denim going out of favor because the weather is warmer. CEO Dickson said the company is getting ready to launch its “exclusive lightweight denim fabric” dubbed “Ultra Soft” in time for the summer.</p><p>Failing to chase trends has been an ongoing issue for the aging department store Kohl’s. Kingsbury told CNBC in March that Kohl’s used to buy product for the juniors department catering to teen girls — one of the most trend-driven areas of its stores — 12 to 14 months in advance. When the apparel hit the sales floor, it was “dead on arrival.”</p><p>In an age where viral TikTok videos dictate the life and death of trends, it’s more important than ever for retailers to stay on top of what’s working with customers and what isn’t. They’re not just competing with legacy players, they’re also vying for customers with innovative yet controversial upstarts like Chinese-linked Shein, which can go from an idea to an online product in a matter of weeks.</p><p>That’s a far cry from the lead times at <span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-25"><a href="/quotes/UAA/">Under Armour</a><span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"><button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"><span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"></span></button></span></span></span>, where it currently takes about 18 months to get a product from an idea to a showroom floor. During an earnings call with analysts on May 16, CEO Kevin Plank called the system “just plain uncompetitive in the 2024 landscape” as he laid out a plan to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/16/under-armour-uaa-earnings-q4-2024.html#:~:text=The%20company's%20reported%20net%20income,of%2011%20cents%20per%20share.">streamline the process</a>. </p><p>Meanwhile, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch posted another stellar set of results, even as it begins to lap tougher comparisons. It has posted torrid growth in part because the company is responsive to its customers and a has nimble supply chain that has allowed it to chase trends quickly and efficiently. </p><p>It posted its strongest first quarter in history, and now expects sales to grow 10% in fiscal 2024, up from previous guidance of between 4% and 6%. </p><p>CEO Fran Horowitz told CNBC that low-rise, baggy jeans are also uber-popular with its customers.
