                                        <p>REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday delivered some of the Biden administration’s strongest public criticism yet of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-05-12-2024-c61fbe06bc5c1a7c85ac18a542e8776e">Israel’s conduct</a></span> of the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">war in Gaza</a></span>, saying Israeli tactics have meant “a horrible loss of life of innocent civilians” but failed to neutralize Hamas leaders and fighters and could drive a lasting insurgency.</p><p>In a pair of TV interviews, Blinken underscored that the United States believes Israeli forces should “get out of Gaza,” but also is waiting to see credible plans from Israel for security and governance in the territory after the war.</p><p>Hamas has reemerged in parts of Gaza, Blinken said, and that “heavy action” by Israeli forces in the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-hamas-rafah-palestinians-evacuees-refugees-2f4e37cb3e40560f4980d8a70baaa81e">southern city of Rafah</a></span> risks leaving America’s closest Mideast ally “holding the bag on an enduring insurgency.”</p><p>He said the United States has worked with Arab countries and others for weeks on developing “credible plans for security, for governance, for rebuilding’’ in Gaza, but ”we haven’t seen that come from Israel. ... We need to see that, too.”</p>
    

<p>Blinken also said that as Israel pushes deeper in Rafah in the south, where Israel says Hamas has four battalions and where more than 1 million civilians have massed, a military operation may “have some initial success” but risks “terrible harm” to the population without solving a problem “that both of us want to solve, which is making sure Hamas cannot again govern Gaza.”</p>



<p>Israel’s conduct of the war, he said, has put the country “on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy, and probably refilled by Hamas. We’ve been talking to them about a much better way of getting an enduring result, enduring security.”</p>
    
<p>Blinken also echoed for the first time publicly by a U.S. official <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-gaza-war-nsm-international-law-c83b6f39ce2799e5d2c473a337e2f857">the findings of a new Biden administration report</a></span> to Congress on Friday that said Israel’s use of U.S.-provided weapons in Gaza likely violated international humanitarian law. The report also said wartime conditions prevented American officials from determining that for certain in specific airstrikes.</p>
    

<p>“When it comes to the use of weapons, concerns about incidents where given the totality of the damage that’s been done to children, women, men, it was reasonable to assess that, in certain instances, Israel acted in ways that are not consistent with international humanitarian law,” Blinken said. He cited “the horrible loss of life of innocent civilians.”</p><p>Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, in a call Sunday with his Israeli counterpart, Tzachi Hanegbi, raised concerns about a military ground operation in Rafah and discussed “alternative courses of action” that would ensure Hamas is defeated “everywhere in Gaza,” according to a White House summary of the conversation. Hanegbi “confirmed that Israel is taking U.S. concerns into account,” the White House said.</p><p>The war began on Oct. 7 after an attack against Israel by Hamas that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. About 250 people were taken hostage. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. </p>
    

<p>U.S. and U.N. officials say Israeli restrictions on food shipments since Oct. 7 have brought on full-fledged famine in northern Gaza.</p><p>There are increasing tensions between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about how the war has been conducted, and also domestic tensions about U.S. support for Israel, with protests on U.S. college campuses and many Republican lawmakers saying that Biden needs to give Israel whatever it needs. The issue could play a major role in the outcome of November’s presidential election.</p><p>Biden said in an interview last week with CNN that his administration would not provide weapons that Israel could use for an all-out assault in Rafah.</p><p>Blinken appeared on CBS’ “Face the Nation” and NBC’s “Meet the Press.”</p>

<p>“This week, the situation in the Kharkiv region has significantly worsened,” Oleksandr Syrskii wrote on Telegram on Sunday. “There are ongoing battles in the border areas along the state border with the Russian Federation.”</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 3 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>While admitting that the situation is “difficult” and Russian attackers had achieved “partial successes” in some areas, he said, “Ukrainian defence forces are doing everything they can to hold defensive lines and positions.”</p>
<p>The intense battles have forced at least one Ukrainian unit to withdraw, leaving behind more land to Russian forces across less defended settlements in the so-called contested “grey zone” along the Russian border.</p>
<p>By Sunday afternoon, the town of Vovchansk, among the largest in the northeast with a pre-war population of 17,000, emerged as a focal point in the battle.</p>
<p>Volodymyr Tymoshko, the head of the Kharkiv regional police, said Russian forces were on the outskirts of the town and were approaching from three directions. “Infantry fighting is already taking place,” he said. A Russian tank was spotted along a major road leading to the town, Tymoshko said, illustrating Moscow’s confidence to deploy heavy weaponry.</p>
<p>Evacuation teams worked non-stop throughout the day to take residents, most of whom were elderly, out of harm’s way.</p>

<p>At least 4,000 civilians have fled the Kharkiv region since Friday when Moscow’s forces launched the operation, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said in a social media statement. Heavy fighting raged Sunday along the northeast front line, where Russian forces attacked 27 settlements in 24 hours, he said.</p>
<p>The Russian Ministry of Defence said Sunday that its forces had captured four villages on the border in addition to five villages reported to have been seized on Saturday. These areas were likely poorly fortified due to the dynamic fighting and constant heavy shelling, easing the Russian advance.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s leadership has not confirmed Moscow’s gains. But Tymoshko said Strilecha, Pylna and Borsivika were under Russian occupation and it was from their direction the Russians were bringing in infantry to stage attacks in the embattled villages of Hlyboke and Lukiantsi.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that there were intense battles across parts of the region.</p>
<p>“Defensive battles and fierce fighting continue on a large part of our borderline,” Zelenskyy said, adding: “The idea behind the attacks in the Kharkiv region is to stretch our forces and undermine the moral and motivational basis of the Ukrainians’ ability to defend themselves.”</p>
<p>The gains are “significant not just because of the territory but also because in 10km (6 miles) or so they will be at a shelling distance of Kharkiv city, the second largest city in Ukraine,” Al Jazeera’s John Holman said, reporting from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.</p>
<p>“It also means that Ukraine is so stretched paper thin on different sides of the front, and it will probably have to divert soldiers from other areas and send them to the Kharkiv region,” he added.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Russian push is designed to exploit ammunition shortages before promised Western supplies can reach the front lines. Ukrainian soldiers said the Kremlin is using the usual Russian tactic by launching a disproportionate amount of fire and infantry assaults to exhaust their troops and firepower.</p>
<p>By intensifying battles in what was previously a static patch of the front line, Russian forces threaten to pin Ukrainian forces in the northeast while carrying out intense battles farther south, where Moscow is also gaining ground.</p>
<p>The advance comes after Russia stepped up attacks in March, targeting energy infrastructure and settlements, which analysts predicted was a concerted effort to shape conditions for an offensive.</p>

<li>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has ruled that Apple illegally interrogated retail staff in New York City. The ruling was announced earlier this week.</li>

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">It’s been a busy weekend for union organizing efforts at U.S. Apple stores, with the union at one store voting to authorize a strike, while workers at another store voted against forming a union.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Back in 2022, workers in Towson, Maryland became <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/18/apple-store-union-maryland-win-vote/">the first formally recognized union at an Apple retail store</a>. That union, which is part of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, voted Saturday to <a href="https://www.goiam.org/news/iam-core-members-at-first-unionized-u-s-apple-retail-store-vote-to-authorize-strike/">authorize a strike</a>. The date of this potential strike has yet to be determined.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“This vote today is the first step in demonstrating our solidarity and sends a clear message to Apple,” said the IAM CORE Negotiating Committee in a statement. “The passage of the strike sanction vote highlights IAM CORE’s unwavering commitment to advocating for the rights and well-being of workers in the face of challenges. As discussions with Apple management continue, we remain committed to securing tangible improvements that benefit all employees.”</p>

	
	


	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The union says it has been negotiating with Apple since January 2023 over issues including work-life balance, unpredictable scheduling, and wages.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“We deeply value our team members and we’re proud to provide them with industry leading compensation and exceptional benefits,” an Apple spokesperson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-12/apple-store-in-new-jersey-votes-against-unionizing-cwa-says">told Bloomberg</a>. “As always, we will engage with the union representing our team in Towson respectfully and in good faith.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bloomberg also reported that a vote to unionize a Short Hills, New Jersey store with the Communication Workers of America has failed. Before the vote, the CWA <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-charges-apple-additional-labor-law-violations">filed an unfair labor practice charge</a> against Apple for allegedly retaliating against one of the organizers at the store by scheduling “unprecedented multiple meetings with his supervisor and denying requests for leave.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Earlier this week, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-06/apple-illegally-interrogated-nyc-retail-staff-us-labor-board-rules?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxNTE3NjcxNiwiZXhwIjoxNzE1NzgxNTE2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTRDMwVThEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIyMUUyRjFBQUYzNjA0MDM1ODU2MTZFOEY2NzI5RUJDNSJ9.ERcJ18ESl-5on5xFFydEHY1r0K5NebWB-7KI9-cXsSo"> Apple violated federal labor laws</a> in 2022 by confiscating union flyers and interrogating staff about unionizing efforts at the Apple store in New York’s World Trade Center.</p>
