            Biden’s comment left several of the governors in the room frustrated, sources told CNN, and is one of the reasons that some of the participants have been rankled by the statement of loyalty and enthusiasm from them distributed by the Biden campaign on Thursday.
    </p>

            The White House did not immediately comment about what the president said. A Biden campaign aide argued that, as well as doing debate prep in the week after his two trips to Europe, Biden was engaged in hours of official work in addition to the hours of campaign work.

            “President (George W.) Bush went to bed at 9, and President (Barack) Obama made dinner at 6:30,” said Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz. “Normal presidents strike a balance, and so does Joe Biden. Hardly the same rigor as Donald Trump, who spends half of his day ranting on Truth Social about plans that would cause a recession and the other half golfing.”

            Biden also made a joke to the governors that didn’t go over well: “I’m fine — I don’t know about my brain, though.” Jen O’Malley Dillon, Biden’s campaign chairwoman, said the president was “clearly making a joke and then said, ‘All kidding aside.’”

In the days after, administration officials have provided confusing and conflicting explanations as they attempted to spin a performance that exacerbated voters’ concerns about Biden’s age.

            Campaigning for Biden in South Haven, Michigan,  on Thursday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom — who attended the meeting in person — told CNN that Biden’s acknowledging his fatigue shows he’s “human” and said he felt people were making too much of the remark.

            Biden, the oldest president in US history, has faced questions around his age and health for years. They came to a head during the debate, when he was hoarse and at times unintelligible, leaving Trump — who is only three years younger than Biden — to appear more fit. The majority of debate watchers deemed the former president as the winner of the stand-off, according to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/debate-poll-cnn-trump-biden/index.html">CNN poll</a>.

            The New York Times reported earlier this week that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/us/politics/biden-lapses.html" target="_blank">president’s “lapses” have increased</a> and grown more worrisome, with a source telling the Times that Biden’s six-day debate preparations at Camp David didn’t start before 11 a.m. and that the president was given time to nap each day.

            White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre sidestepped a question during Wednesday’s briefing about whether the president takes daily afternoon naps following the Times’ reporting. But she offered jet lag and travel fatigue as an explanation for Biden’s poor debate performance after previously chalking it up to a cold.

<li><strong>Multiple regions affected</strong>: The heat wave will impact nearly all of the West Coast, the southern Plains, the lower Mississippi Valley, the Ohio Valley, and parts of Florida, with the Pacific Northwest expected to see temperatures rise later in the weekend.</li>
<li><strong>Increased health risks</strong>: The heat wave poses health risks, particularly for those who are vulnerable, such as the elderly and young children. High humidity and extreme temperatures can lead to dehydration, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.</li>
<li><strong>Holiday weekend concerns</strong>: The heat wave coincides with the upcoming July 4th holiday weekend, a time when people may be more likely to become dehydrated while celebrating outdoors.</li>
<li><strong>Climate change implications</strong>: While individual heat waves cannot be directly linked to climate change, the overall trends show that human-caused climate change is making heat waves longer, more intense, and more frequent.</li>

<p>It’s a dangerous weather pattern hitting as <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/video/wildfires-california-gavin-newsom-national-national-139d8c046bbb476eae5bab609a2e35c0">fires burn in northern California</a></span>, and just in time for <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/july-fourth-travel-fireworks-602108ca0e195ca52479d37cc1c04b9c">a holiday weekend</a></span>. When people are celebrating, “it’s very easy to get sidetracked,” staying out for longer and forgetting to stay hydrated, said Chris Stachelski, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “And then all of a sudden you’re putting yourself more at risk.”</p>



<p>Human-caused climate change is making heat waves longer and more intense. More research will be needed to link an individual event like this one directly to climate change, but given the overall trajectory, Swain wasn’t surprised by the forecast this weekend. Even so, “the pace of record breaking heat extremes and precipitation extremes is becoming a little bit overwhelming,” he said.</p>
    
<p>This heat wave’s expected duration, breadth and high overnight temperatures compound the risks to people’s health. “I think this heat wave may end up being more consequential, more dangerous, and more record breaking in many cases than the heat waves that produce those slightly higher temperatures,” Swain said. </p>
    

<p>Stachelski added that even after the highest temperatures have passed, heat can still be dangerous, especially to the most vulnerable — the young, old and those without access to air conditioning. </p><p>Experts urge people to drink plenty of water and find air conditioning.

<p><strong>Keir Starmer poised to become Prime Minister</strong>: After 14 years of Conservative Party rule, Exit polls from the UK parliamentary elections suggest that Keir Starmer's Labour Party is on track to win enough seats for him to become the next Prime Minister.</p>

<p><strong>Labour's centrist strategy appears to have worked</strong>: Starmer has faced criticism for a perceived lack of charisma, but his approach to bring Labour back towards the center of British politics and broaden its appeal to voters has been successful.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Economic pain and political chaos have contributed to Labour's success</strong>: Years of economic pain and political chaos under the Conservative Party have likely contributed to Labour's success, as many voters have turned to the opposition party in search of an alternative.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Professor Sir John Curtice predicts Labour will win</strong>: In an interview with the BBC, political analyst Professor Sir John Curtice stated that there was "more chance of [Rishi Sunak] telling the truth about the economy" than Labour not winning the election, suggesting that a Labour victory is all but certain.</p>

              </figcaption></figure><p>Professor Sir John Curtice, a political analyst and elections expert who, through decades of TV commentary has become something of a British national institution himself, told the BBC just a couple days before the election that there was "more chance of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-told-theres-more-33148929" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lightning striking twice</a> in the same place" than incumbent Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak remaining in power.</p>    
  <p>So, unless there is a truly massive shock between now and final results coming in on Friday morning, Starmer will soon take the reins of government, but he will do so with the British people's overall <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/a-crisis-of-trust-in-our-politics-spells-trouble-for-the-government-13122344" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">trust in politicians at rock bottom</a>, and a <a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/child-poverty-statistics-causes-and-the-uks-policy-response/#heading-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">record number of British children living in poverty</a>.</p><h2>Where does Keir Starmer come from?</h2><p>Sir Keir Starmer — the former lawyer was knighted for services to criminal justice — has, through years of chaos (you may remember <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/boris-johnson-knowingly-misled-uk-parliament-over-party-gate-scandal/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Partygate</a>, or perhaps even Prime Minister Liz Truss' <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/u-k-prime-minister-liz-truss-backpedals-on-tax-cuts-amid-recession-fears/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">50 days in power</a>) projected an almost dull managerialism that appears to have become a beacon for a welcome return to political normalcy. </p>

<p>Starmer grew up in a small town in Surrey, just outside London. His mother worked for the National Health Service, Britain's free public health care system, and his father was a toolmaker — a fact that Starmer repeated so often during the election campaign that it became a <a href="https://twitter.com/HumanBollard/status/1804888166186316256" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">meme</a>.</p><p>His mother suffered for all her life from Still's disease, a type of inflammatory arthritis, and died only a few weeks after he was first elected to the British Parliament in 2015. His father died three years later. Starmer has said his relationship with his father was strained, and that never telling him, "I love you and I respect you" is "<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/keir-starmer-chris-evans-father-regret-b2572071.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the one thing I do regret</a>."</p><p>Starmer was the first member of his family to go to university, after which he helped run a left-wing magazine called Socialist Alternatives. He then became a lawyer, rising up the ranks to become the head of public prosecutions in 2008, running the British government's Crown Prosecution Service. He received his knighthood in 2014, the year before he turned to politics.</p><p>Despite his legitimate background in tackling serious crime, Starmer has never managed to shake the image of a relatively boring politician. He's even leaned into it on occasion.</p>

<p>"If, in the end, that is the only bit of mud left to sling, then I'm pretty comfortable," he told Britain's ITV in January. "If they are calling you boring, you're winning."</p><h2>What are Keir Starmer's policies?</h2><p><br>Throughout his tenure as Labour leader, Starmer has tried to make his party more electable by forcing out individuals seen as entrenched in its socialist left wing — the faction that ran the party under its previous leader, <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeremy-corbyn-election-british-politics-unapologetic-socialist/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Jeremy Corbyn</a></span> (whose cabinet Starmer served in, incidentally). </p><p>After Corbyn called the findings of an inquiry into antisemitism in the party "dramatically overstated," Starmer suspended him. </p><p>"Sometimes you have to be ruthless to be a good leader," Starmer told <a href="https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/a45680960/keir-starmer-interview/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Esquire</a> about the episode. </p><p>His public mantra has been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-labour-leader-keir-starmer-profile-dc40877586d32b903e4ecdb7e397f803" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">"country before party."</a></p><p>Starmer's move toward centrism has been criticized by left-leaning members of his own party and others.

He also wants to negotiate a better deal with the European Union, given the <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/new-report-reveals-uk-economy-almost-ps140billion-smaller-because-brexit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">catastrophic economic consequences</a> of the U.K.'s "<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/brexit-britain-breaks-with-the-eu/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Brexit</a></span>." </p><p>He said his unflashy election pledges were a "down payment" on what the Labour Party can offer Britain if it is given enough time.</p><p>"I'm not going to make a promise before the election that I'm not comfortable we can actually deliver," he's stressed.</p><p>"A lot of people on the left will accuse him of letting them down, betraying socialist principles.

"But, hey, if that's what it takes to win, then I think that tells you something about Starmer's character. He will do whatever it takes — and has done whatever it takes — to get into government."</p><h2>How might Starmer influence U.S.-U.K. relations?</h2><p>With British and American election cycles coinciding for the first time since 1992, there's a lot of uncertainty about how U.S.-U.K. relations could look by the end of the year. </p><p>Starmer has spoken admiringly of President Biden, particularly his focus on job creation and investment in domestic industry. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/09/28/britains-labour-party-takes-lessons-from-joe-biden" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Economist even described him</a> as "infatuated" with the American president. </p>

An exit poll projected Labour would well exceed that mark, forecasting the party would pick up 209 seats for a total 410, but assuming that at least the 326 threshold is reached, Sunak will resign, and King Charles III will quickly take the necessary but largely ceremonial step of inviting Starmer to form a new government.</p><p>Starmer would then appear to make his first speech outside 10 Downing Street, the official residence of Britain's top elected official.</p><p>Once the formalities are completed, Starmer will receive briefings from key members of the civil service and the intelligence community, select the members of his new cabinet, and start taking phone calls from world leaders.</p><p>And then?

<p>“July Fourth is always going to be a day of mixed emotion,” Mayor Nancy Rotering said. “We come forth today hoping we as a community can remember and honor the lives lost.”</p><p>The holiday celebrating the establishment a new country, free from British rule, is traditionally marked by barbecue, cold drinks and the Stars and Stripes on flagpoles and on clothing, in addition to parades.

The South Padre Island fire and police department treated the victim on scene for a shark bite to his leg before he was transported to a nearby hospital, police said.</p>    
  <p>Also shortly before 11 a.m., video obtained by CBS News showed police rushing to the scene of a woman who was bitten on her left leg by a shark while swimming.</p><p>The video showed Good Samaritans and first responders pulling the woman from the water and wrapping a tourniquet around her leg to slow the bleeding. A dorsal fin can be seen swimming back and forth near the shoreline. </p>

            <p><strong>Lisa Desjardins:</strong></p>
            <p>Exactly my question.</p><p>There are a few reasons. One, wording of the letter is difficult, especially for front-liners. Some of those front-liners, I'm told, would like letter that says, this is — he has been a good president. They would like praise for the president in this letter.</p><p>Other front-liners are nervous about signing that kind of letter, because President Biden may not have won in their district before, may not win again. So, wording is one issue. Another, of course, is the politics here.</p><p>There is a lot of calculation about, how do you influence this president. Some believe that publicly coming out, asking him to step aside, is exactly the kind of thing that would have this president feel more embattled, more likely to dig in. There's a discussion about that.</p><p>Then there's also the politics for members. Some are worried that, if they come out publicly, there will be retribution later, should he win. Some are worried that, if they don't come out publicly now, if he loses, there could be retribution for missing this moment.</p>

Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting, until it eliminates Hamas.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">When he announced the plan on 31 May, President Biden said it was based on a more detailed Israeli proposal, and that it involved three phases.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The first would include a "full and complete ceasefire" lasting six weeks, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, and the exchange of some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The second phase would involve the release of all other living hostages and a "permanent end to hostilities". The third phase the start of a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of dead hostages' remains.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">After the two leaders' phone call on Thursday, the Israeli government said in a statement: "Prime Minister Netanyahu updated President Biden on his decision to send a delegation to continue the hostage negotiations and reiterated the principles that Israel is committed to, especially its commitment to end the war only after all of its goals have been achieved."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Netanyahu has declared his objectives to be the return of all remaining hostages, the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, and ensuring Gaza no longer constitutes a threat to Israel. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The White House said Mr Biden "welcomed the prime minister's decision to authorise his negotiators to engage with US, Qatari, and Egyptian mediators in an effort to close out the deal".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A source in the Israeli negotiating team meanwhile told Reuters news agency that Hamas's response included "a very significant breakthrough" and that there was "a deal with a real chance of implementation".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A senior Palestinian official told the BBC earlier on Thursday that Hamas had given up the demand for a complete ceasefire. Its new conditions, the official said, related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from a strip of land running along Gaza's southern border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi corridor, and from the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The source, who was informed of the response Hamas submitted to the mediators, added that the atmosphere was positive. "We are going to a new round of negotiations soon,” the source said.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The US has accused Hamas of blocking progress towards a ceasefire. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the group was the “one exception” to international support for the ceasefire proposal. Hamas, he said, had created "gaps... in not saying yes to a proposal that everyone, including the Israelis, had said yes to”. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Prime Minister Netanyahu has said he is “committed to the Israeli proposal welcomed by President Biden”, although he has not publicly endorsed the outline as it was laid out.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">At least 38,010 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Hamas and allied armed groups are believed to still be holding 116 hostages who were taken on 7 October. At least 42 are presumed by Israeli authorities to be dead.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The others have been released, rescued or their bodies recovered.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Four other Israelis have been held hostage since 2014 and 2015, two of whom are presumed dead.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><i id="additional-reporting-by-rushdi-aboualouf-in-istanbul" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog">Additional reporting by Rushdi Aboualouf in Istanbul</i></p></div></div>

                    <p>KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s army has retreated from a neighborhood in the outskirts of Chasiv Yar, a strategically important town in the eastern Donetsk region that has been reduced to rubble under a monthslong Russian assault, a military spokesperson said Thursday.</p>
<p>Chasiv Yar is a short distance west of Bakhmut, which was captured by Russia last year after a bitter 10-month battle. For months, Russian forces have focused on capturing Chasiv Yar, a town which occupies an elevated location. Its fall would put nearby cities in jeopardy, compromise critical Ukrainian supply routes and bring Russia closer to its stated aim of seizing the entire Donetsk region.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/ukraines-railroad-workers-play-crucial-role-in-creating-a-lifeline-during-war"><strong>WATCH:</strong> Ukraine’s railroad workers play crucial role in creating a lifeline during war</a></p>
<p>The Ukrainian army retreated from a northeastern neighborhood in the town, Nazar Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Khortytsia ground forces formation, told The Associated Press in a written message Thursday.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s defensive positions in the town were “destroyed,” he said, adding that there was a threat of serious casualties if troops remained in the area and that Russia did not leave “a single intact building.”</p>
<p>Months of relentless Russian artillery strikes have devastated Chasiv Yar, with homes and municipal offices charred, and a town that once had a population of 12,000 has been left deserted.</p>
<p>Oleh Shyriaiev, commander of the 255 assault battalion which has been based in the area for six months, said after Russian troops captured the neighborhood, they burned every building not already destroyed by shelling.</p>
<p>Shyriaiev said Russia is deploying scorched-earth tactics in an attempt to destroy anything which could be used as a military position in a bid to force troops to retreat.</p>
<p>“I regret that we are gradually losing territory,” he said, speaking by phone from the Chasiv Yar area, but added, “we cannot hold what is ruined.”</p>
<p>Russian troops outnumber Ukrainians 10-to-1 in the area but Shyriaiev suggested that, even with that ratio, they have not been able to make significant progress in the past six months of active fighting.</p>
<p>The intensity of Russian strikes on Ukraine’s defensive line in the area of Chasiv Yar has increased over the last month, Voloshyn said.</p>
<p>In the past week alone, Voloshyn said Russia has carried out nearly 1,300 strikes, fired nearly 130 glide bombs and made 44 ground assaults.</p>
<p>Other Russian attacks in recent weeks have focused on capturing nearby settlements that would allow them to advance to Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, the biggest cities in the Ukrainian-controlled part of the Donetsk region.</p>
<p>Ukrainian commanders in the area say their resources remain stretched, largely due to a monthslong gap in military assistance from the United States which threw Ukraine’s military onto the defensive.</p>
<p>Shyriaiev, the assault battalion commander, said ammunition from allies is arriving, but more slowly than needed by the army.</p>
<p>“We are determined to hold on to the end,” said the commander, who has been fighting on the front line since the outbreak of the war.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Ukraine, the governor of the northern Chernihiv region, Viacheslav Chaus, said Russia launched 22 drones over Ukraine last night. One hit a power infrastructure facility in the northern Chernihiv region, leaving nearly 6,000 customers without electricity, he said, adding that the rest were shot down.</p>
<p>Russia is continually targeting Ukraine’s badly damaged energy infrastructure, resulting in hours of rolling blackouts across the country. Ukrainian officials have warned that the situation may worsen as winter approaches.</p>

            Soccer star <a href="https://cnn.com/2024/07/01/sport/kylian-mbappe-mask-france-euro-2024-spt-intl/index.html">Kylian Mbappé</a> has called the first round of French elections “catastrophic” after last Sunday’s results saw the country lurch towards the far-right with anti-immigration party National Rally (RN) leading first place.
    </p>

            The captain for France’s national soccer team, who is preparing for <em>Les Bleus’</em> Euro 2024 quarterfinal against Portugal in Hamburg on Friday, urged the French public to vote saying “now more than ever” it was needed.
    </p>

            “There’s an emergency, we can’t let our country in the hands of these people, it’s really urgent,” Mbappe said at a media conference in Hamburg, Germany.

    </p>

            After a high turnout at the polls, last Sunday the RN clinched 33.15% of the vote, while the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition came second and President Emmanuel Macron’s party slumped to third.
    </p>

            If the RN assumes power, it would become the first far-right party to enter the French government since World War II – although nothing is certain ahead of Sunday’s second round.

            Mbappé, whose family originally come from Algeria and Cameroon, stressed that he didn’t want to “represent a country” that didn’t embody his “values.”

            Earlier this week, Mbappé’s <em>Les Bleus </em>teammate Jules Kounde – a 25-year old French Beninese national – used a media conference during the Euros tournament to share what he called his own “political position.”

            “I was disappointed to see the direction France is taking, with strong support for a party against our values … I believe it’s important to block the extreme right, the National Rally, because this party will not lead our country towards more freedom,” Kounde told journalists after the last-16 match between France and Belgium on Monday.
