            President Joe Biden, who is dogged by questions about his acuity, has privately acknowledged that the next few days are a critical test of his reelection campaign, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/joe-biden-2024-campaign-troubles/index.html" target="_blank">according to CNN’s reporting earlier this week.</a>

            He remains publicly defiant and insists he will remain in the race. But he would not be the first president to step aside rather than seek reelection if he ultimately makes that decision.

            Most recently, in 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson shocked the country when he made the surprise announcement that he would not run at the end of an Oval Office speech on his plan to limit US military operations in Vietnam. Here’s part of that address:
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-bf687fcbc1abb168b560884e704873e0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            With America’s sons in the fields far away, with America’s future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world’s hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office – the Presidency of your country. Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-235c98064775b276a0bb234c81e4299b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Nearly 60 years old<strong><em> </em></strong>when he made that speech, Johnson looked much older. He would die of a sudden heart attack in 1973 at 64, before eligibility for retirement programs like Medicare,<strong> </strong>which he signed into law, and Social Security, which he expanded.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-6f0eacad7ed0f58dc1e80d968f14db0e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            By the time he bowed out of the race, Johnson, unlike Biden, was facing multiple challenges for the Democratic nomination in the spring of 1968. Racial strife in the US, paired with a country fractured over the war in Vietnam, hurt Johnson’s popularity. In early 1968, the Tet offensive in Vietnam showed Communist forces there to be must stronger than the US military had claimed, and American casualties in the war mounted.

<p>“People look at Starmer and they see this guy who is very solid, clearly very able in his professional life,” said Douglas Beattie, author of “How Labour Wins (and Why it Loses).”</p>

<p>“I think people want that caution, they want that stability.”</p><p>A former chief prosecutor for England and Wales, Starmer has often been caricatured by Conservative opponents as a “lefty London lawyer.” He was knighted for his role leading the Crown Prosecution Service, and opponents like to use his title, Sir Keir Starmer, to paint him as elite and out of touch. While most prime ministers are awarded knighthoods, damehoods — the female equivalent — or other royal honors after their time in office, Starmer is the first knight of the realm to become the country’s leader since Sir Alec Douglas-Hume in 1963.</p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024 The year will test even the most robust democracies.

<p>Starmer prefers to stress his humble roots and down-to-earth tastes. He loves soccer — still plays the sport on weekends — and enjoys nothing more than watching Premier League team Arsenal over a beer in his local pub. He and his wife Victoria, who works in occupational health, have two teenage children they strive to keep out of the public eye.</p>
    
<p>During the campaign he was stubbornly resistant to revealing flashes of personality, telling a Guardian interviewer that he couldn’t remember any of his dreams, did not have a favorite novel and had no childhood fears.</p>
    

<p>When he did get personal, telling a journalist that he hopes to carve out Friday evenings to spend with his family — his wife is Jewish, and Friday-night Shabbat dinners are a family tradition — the Conservatives used it against him, claiming Starmer planned to be a part-time prime minister.</p><p>Born in 1963, Starmer is the son of a toolmaker and a nurse who named him after Keir Hardie, the Labour Party’s first leader. One of four children, he was raised in a cash-strapped household in a small town outside London.</p><p>“There were hard times,” he said in a speech launching his election campaign. “I know what out-of-control inflation feels like, how the rising cost of living can make you scared of the postman coming down the path: ‘Will he bring another bill we can’t afford?’”</p>
    

<p>Starmer’s mother suffered from a chronic illness, Still’s disease, that left her in pain, and Starmer has said that visiting her in the hospital and helping to care for her helped form his strong support for the state-funded <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-election-nhs-crisis-nathaniel-dye-a9d6ad4a3b5acd3e35a9acf9b5ee2c5a">National Health Service</a></span>.</p><p>He was the first member of his family to go to college, studying law at Leeds University and Oxford. As a lawyer, he took civil liberties cases including that of the “McLibel Two,” green activists sued by McDonald’s for handing out leaflets saying the restaurant chain sold unhealthy food.</p><p>The cases often put him at odds with both Conservative and Labour governments, so his switch to become chief prosecutor in 2008 surprised some colleagues. But during five years in the job he gained a reputation as a tough and hard-working director of public prosecutions, a role that included prosecuting people charged with terrorism, organized crime and other serious offenses.</p><p>Starmer entered politics relatively late, in his 50s, and was elected to Parliament in 2015. He often disagreed with the party leader at the time, staunch socialist Jeremy Corbyn, at one point quitting the party’s top team over disagreements, but agreed to serve as Labour’s Brexit spokesman under Corbyn.</p>
    

<p>Starmer has faced repeated questions about that decision, and about urging voters to support Corbyn, a divisive figure under whose leadership the party was hammered in the 2019 election.</p><p>He said he wanted to stay and fight to change Labour, arguing that “leaders are temporary, but political parties are permanent.”</p><p>After Corbyn led Labour to election defeats in 2017 and 2019 — the latter the party’s worst result since 1935 — Labour picked Starmer to lead efforts to rebuild.</p><p>His leadership has coincided with a turbulent period that saw Britain suffer through the COVID-19 pandemic, leave the EU, absorb the economic shock of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and endure economic turmoil from <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/liz-truss-europe-economy-business-e18e6e6007c28f6e11cc1a201c545b71">Liz Truss’</a></span> turbulent 49-day term as prime minister in 2022.</p>

He has already dismayed some supporters by watering down a pledge to spend billions investing in green technology, saying a Labour government would not borrow more to fund public spending.</p><p>Starmer was a strong opponent of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, but now says a Labour government won’t seek to reverse Brexit, another disappointment to many in the party.</p><p>“A lot of people on the left will accuse him of letting them down, betraying socialist principles. And a lot of people on the right accuse him of flip-flopping,” said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. </p><p>“But, hey, if that’s what it takes to win, then I think that tells you something about Starmer’s character. He will do whatever it takes — and has done whatever it takes — to get into government.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writer Danica Kirka contributed to this story.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow AP’s coverage of elections around the world: <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/elections">https://apnews.com/hub/global-elections/</a></span></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow</strong>, despite criticism from European Union leaders and Ukraine's government. Orban's visit was described as a "peace mission" three days after he met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv.</li>
<li><strong>EU leaders emphasized that Orban did not act on behalf of the bloc</strong>. European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen both stated that the EU rotating presidency has no mandate to engage with Russia on behalf of the EU.</li>
<li><strong>Ukraine expressed strong condemnation of the visit</strong>, with its foreign ministry stating that "the principle of 'no agreements on Ukraine without Ukraine' remains inviolable" and calling on all states to adhere to it.</li>
<li><strong>Orban described the meeting as a step towards restoring dialogue between Russia and Ukraine</strong>, but Putin repeated a previously rejected proposal for Ukraine to withdraw from regions in the south and east of the country, which Russia claims to have annexed.</li>
<li><strong>European leaders have reaffirmed their support for Ukraine and rejected any notion of "appeasement" with Russia</strong>. They emphasized that Russia is the aggressor and that any discussions about Ukraine's future must involve Ukraine itself.</li>

He also repeated a previously rejected proposal for Ukraine to withdraw from regions in the south and east of the country which Russia claims to have annexed - an area that includes territory Russia does not currently occupy.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Volodymyr Zelensky has long said Ukraine will not negotiate with Moscow until Russian forces leave all Ukrainian territory, including Crimea.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Earlier, Mr Putin said Mr Orban was visiting "not just as a long-time partner" but as a European Union representative. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">However, European leaders openly condemned the Moscow trip and emphasised he was not representing the EU. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"The EU rotating presidency has no mandate to engage with Russia on behalf of the EU," Charles Michel, President of the European Council, wrote on X. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"The European Council is clear: Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim.

He previously slowed agreement on a €50bn ($54bn; £42bn) EU aid package designed to support Ukraine in its defence against Russia.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Tuesday's visit to Kyiv was his first in 12 years, while he met Mr Putin repeatedly during that time.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">During Mr Orban's joint appearance with Mr Zelensky, the body language between them was not warm, and neither took questions from the media after they gave their statements.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But for the next six months Mr Orban's position as head of the Council of the European Union means he has an influential role as a figurehead for Europe. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">His visit to Kyiv came on his second day in that role, saying there was a need to solve previous disagreements and focus on the future.</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li><strong>Reversal of earlier ruling</strong>: The Wisconsin Supreme Court, with a new liberal majority, has ruled that ballot drop boxes can be used widely in the state, reversing a previous ruling issued two years ago when the court had a conservative majority.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on upcoming election</strong>: The ruling changes the way the upcoming election in Wisconsin, a closely divided state that could tip the Electoral College, will be carried out, with just four months to go.</li>
<li><strong>Background on drop boxes</strong>: Drop boxes were used in Wisconsin for years as one of several ways for voters to submit ballots before Election Day, particularly in 2020 when mail-in voting and early in-person voting were more common due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</li>
<li><strong>Controversy and lawsuit</strong>: The widespread use of drop boxes in 2020 drew criticism from Republicans, prompting a lawsuit that the court's previous majority decided by mostly banning their use.</li>
<li><strong>Partisan implications</strong>: The judicial whiplash is likely to fuel Republican claims that the court has become a partisan force, a claim that Democrats had made in the past when most of the justices were conservatives.</li>

<li>A judge has ruled that the writings of Audrey Hale, the person who killed three 9-year-olds and three adults at a private Christian elementary school in Nashville, cannot be released to the public. Hale, a former student, was killed by police during the shooting.</li>
<li>The judge, I'Ashea Myles, found that the copyright to Hale's writings and other works belongs to the victims' families, who argue that it is up to them to decide who has access to the records.</li>
<li>The ruling comes after several groups requested access to documents seized by Metro Nashville Police during their investigation into the March 2023 shooting.</li>
<li>The interest in the records has been fueled by speculation that Hale may have identified as a transgender man and that the journals may contain planned hate crime against Christians, although there is no evidence to support these theories.</li>

                                        <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The writings of the person who <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nashville-covenant-school-shooting-children-killed-75c11745c54edb9691f3d41455de11c5">killed three 9-year-olds and three adults</a></span> at a private Christian elementary school in Nashville last year cannot be released to the public, a judge ruled.</p><p>Chancery Court Judge I’Ashea Myles found that The Covenant School children and parents hold the copyright to any writings or other works created by shooter Audrey Hale, a former student who was killed by police. As part of the effort to keep the records closed, Hale’s parents transferred ownership of Hale’s property to the victims’ families, who then argued in court that they should be allowed to determine who has access to them.</p><p>Myles recognized that claiming copyright as an exception to the Tennessee Public Records Act was a novel argument that previous courts have not ruled on. In the end, she agreed with the parents’ group, finding that “the original writings, journals, art, photos and videos created by Hale are subject to an exception to the TPRA created by the federal Copyright Act.” </p>
    

<p>The ruling, filed just before midnight Thursday, comes more than a year after several groups filed public records requests for documents seized by Metro Nashville Police during their investigation into the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nashville-school-shooting-covenant-school-5da45b469ccb6c9533bbddf20c1bfe16">March 2023 shooting</a></span>. Those killed were Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs, and William Kinney, all 9 years old, and adults Cynthia Peak, 61; Katherine Koonce, 60; and Mike Hill, 61.</p>



<p>Part of the interest in the records stems from the fact that Hale, who police say was “assigned female at birth,” may have identified as a transgender man, and some pundits have floated the theory that the journals will reveal a planned hate crime against Christians. </p>
    
<p>The victims’ families released statements praising the ruling on Friday. Cindy Peak’s family wrote, “The last year and a half without Cindy has been difficult. But today brings a measure of relief in our family. Denying the shooter some of the notoriety she sought by releasing her vile and unfiltered thoughts on the world is a result everyone should be thankful for.”</p>
    

<p>The shooter left behind at least 20 journals, a suicide note and a memoir, according to court filings. When the records requests were denied, several parties sued, and the situation quickly ballooned into a messy mix of conspiracy theories, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nashville-covenant-school-shooting-officer-leak-6a50d712f73fdf54cb4082d64c6eda78">leaked documents</a></span>, probate battles and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nashville-covenant-school-shooting-records-writings-a73ad27416832bcb2c62fc4db5314ccb">accusations of ethical misconduct</a></span>. Myles’ order will almost surely be appealed.</p><p>In addition to the copyright claims, the Covenant parents argued that releasing the documents would be traumatic for the families and could inspire copycat attacks. </p><p>Myles found that the copycat risk was real and “of grave concern.”</p><p>“Hale used the writings of other perpetrators in similar crimes to guide how this plan was constructed and accomplished, mimicking some not only in their methodology, but also choice of weapons and targets,” Myles wrote. “Hale even held past perpetrators out as heroes in their attacks, idolizing them.”</p><p>The Associated Press is among the groups that requested the records but did not participate in the lawsuit. </p>
    

<p>Deborah Fisher, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government, warned that Myles’ ruling could have far-reaching implications, making it easier to hide evidence of a crime from the public.</p><p>“To say that evidence collected by police can be copyrighted by the criminal, or the surviving parent or spouse of the criminal, does not bode well for the transparency of the police or the judicial system,” she said.</p><p>Fisher thinks it will lead to a system in which selective evidence is leaked, as it has been in the Covenant case. First, pages from one journal were <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nashville-covenant-school-records-a85d4728ff7a01e522b2194ba50070fd">leaked to a conservative commentator</a></span> who posted them to social media in November.

The publication is among the plaintiffs, and Myles briefly threatened to hold the paper’s editor-in-chief, Michael Leahy, and owner, Star News Digital Media, in contempt.</p><p>Although Myles’ ruling will shield many of the documents created by Hale from public release, other documents in the police file can be released once the case is officially closed as long as they fall under Tennessee’s open records law.</p><p>An attorney for the lead plaintiff in the case did not immediately have a reaction to the ruling. </p><h2>___</h2><p>This story was corrected to show that The Associated Press did not participate in the lawsuit.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>French far-right party may falter Ukraine support</strong>: The National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen, is likely to gain power in the French parliamentary elections on Sunday, which could lead to a change in France's stance on Ukraine. Currently, France is a strong supporter of Ukraine, but Marine Le Pen has vowed to restrict Ukraine's use of French-supplied weapons and may not allow French troops to be deployed on Ukrainian soil.</li>
<li><strong>Marine Le Pen opposes French military support for Ukraine</strong>: Le Pen has stated that a prime minister from her party would prevent Ukraine from using long-range weapons supplied by France to strike inside Russia. She has also indicated that she would not allow French troops to be deployed on Ukrainian soil, citing that the prime minister has the final say on such decisions.</li>
<li><strong>French presidential election influenced Ukraine support</strong>: The French presidency has been a key factor in shaping France's stance on Ukraine. President Emmanuel Macron has suggested that he might deploy French troops on Ukrainian soil, which Marine Le Pen opposes. Her views on Ukraine reflect the growing divide between the two main parties in France.</li>
<li><strong>National Rally's rising power in France</strong>: Marine Le Pen's National Rally party has been gaining popularity in France, particularly among disaffected voters. The party's success in the European elections in May led to Macron calling for a snap parliamentary election, which Le Pen's party is now expected to win or perform strongly in.</li>
<li><strong>Potential implications for Ukraine-Russia conflict</strong>: A shift in France's stance on Ukraine could have significant implications for the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine relies on Western support to counter Russia's aggression, and a change in France's stance could impact the country's ability to defend itself.</li>

    <p>Here are five key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Federal Reserve officials are watching the labor market for signs of weakness</strong>: Despite the labor market's surprising vigor over the past year, Fed officials are starting to look for cracks in the market, particularly as fewer jobs go unfilled and more people linger on unemployment insurance rosters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fed officials could cut interest rates if labor market softens unexpectedly</strong>: In a slight shift in their stance, Fed officials have recently begun to indicate that if the labor market softens unexpectedly, they could cut interest rates. This would be a departure from their previous focus on cooling the economy and bringing a hot job market back into balance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest rates have been high for nearly a year</strong>: The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at 5.3 percent since July 2023, a decades-long high that has made it more expensive to get a mortgage or carry a credit card balance. This policy setting is designed to slow down the economy and bring inflation under control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The goal is to fully control rapid inflation</strong>: The Fed's goal is to wrestle rapid inflation fully under control, and they believe that higher interest rates will help achieve this goal. However, the exact timing and magnitude of rate cuts remain uncertain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fed Chair Jerome Powell wants to see more cooling inflation data before cutting rates</strong>: Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that officials would like to see more cooling inflation data "like what we've been seeing recently" before cutting rates. This suggests that the Fed is not yet ready to cut rates, and that they want to see more evidence of a slowdown in inflation before making a move.</p>

That policy setting is slowly weighing on demand across the economy, with the goal of wrestling rapid inflation fully under control.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">But as inflation cools, Fed officials have made it clear that they are trying to strike a careful balance: They want to ensure that inflation is in check, but they want to avoid upending the job market. Given that, policymakers have signaled over the past month that they would react to a sudden labor market weakening by slashing borrowing costs.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The Fed would like to see more cooling inflation data “like what we’ve been seeing recently” before cutting rates, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a speech this week. “We’d also like to see the labor market remain strong. We’ve said that if we saw the labor market unexpectedly weakening, that is also something that could call for a reaction.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">That’s why employment reports are likely to be a key reference point for central bankers and Wall Street investors who are eager to see what the Fed will do next.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">For years, the Fed had been watching the job market for a different reason.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Officials had worried that if conditions in the labor market remained too tight for too long, with employers fighting to hire and paying ever-rising wages to attract workers, it could help keep inflation faster than usual. That’s because companies with higher labor costs would probably charge more to protect profits, and workers earning more would probably spend more, fueling continued demand.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">But recently, job openings have come down and wage growth has abated, signals that the job market is cooling from its boil. That has caught the Fed’s attention.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">“At this point, we have a good labor market, but not a frothy one,” Mary C. Daly, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.frbsf.org/news-and-media/speeches/mary-c-daly/2024/06/getting-it-right-meeting-uncertainty-with-conditionality/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent speech</a>. “Future labor market slowing could translate into higher unemployment, as firms need to adjust not just vacancies but actual jobs.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The unemployment rate has ticked up slightly this year, and officials are watching warily for a more pronounced move. Research shows that a sudden and marked uptick in unemployment is a signal of recession — a <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-FED-SAHM/0H001QXBP8S1/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rule of thumb</a> set out by the economist Claudia Sahm and often referred to as the “Sahm Rule.”</p></div><button class="css-182hr0m" data-testid="Show-More" type="button" aria-hidden="true">Show more</button></div></div>
