                                        <p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel ordered new evacuations in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah on Saturday, forcing tens of thousands more people to leave as it prepared to expand its military operation deeper into what is considered Gaza’s last refuge, in defiance of growing pressure from close ally the United States and others.</p><p>As <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/campus-protests-divestment-transparency-616b5d9d78e90bd478d6b5e2ee50164c">pro-Palestinian protests</a></span> continued against <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">the war</a></span>, Israel’s military also said it was moving into an area of devastated northern Gaza where it asserted that the Hamas militant group has regrouped after seven months of fighting.</p><p>Israel has now evacuated the eastern third of Rafah, and top military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said dozens of militants had been killed there as “targeted operations continued.” The United Nations has warned that the planned full-scale Rafah invasion would <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-crossings-aid-gaza-f654871ba67c42e6345b6f709427b664">further cripple humanitarian operations</a></span> and cause a surge in civilian deaths.</p>
    

<p>Rafah borders Egypt near the main aid entry points, which already are affected. Israeli troops have <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-05-07-2024-113bf4ee5dad87dc5c003d76ed2785bf">captured the Gaza side</a></span> of the Rafah crossing, forcing it to shut down. Egypt has refused to coordinate with Israel on the delivery of aid though the crossing because of “the unacceptable Israeli escalation,” the state-owned Al Qahera News television channel reported, citing an unnamed official.</p>



<p>U.S. President Joe Biden has said he won’t provide offensive weapons to Israel for Rafah. On Friday, his administration said there was “reasonable” <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-gaza-war-nsm-international-law-c83b6f39ce2799e5d2c473a337e2f857">evidence that Israel had breached international law</a></span> protecting civilians — Washington’s strongest statement yet on the matter.</p>
    
<p>In response, Ophir Falk, foreign policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a></span>, told The Associated Press that Israel acts in compliance with the laws of armed conflict and the army takes extensive measures to avert civilian casualties, including alerting people to military operations via phone calls and text messages.</p>
    

<p>More than <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/rafah-israel-gaza-war-hamas-evacuation-e0754cdae0f3786982038e80feaa159e">1.4 million Palestinians</a></span> — half of Gaza’s population — have been sheltering in Rafah, most after fleeing Israel’s offensives elsewhere. The latest evacuations are forcing some to return north, where areas are devastated from previous attacks. Aid agencies estimate that 110,000 had left before Saturday’s order that adds 40,000.</p><p>“Do we wait until we all die on top of each other? So we’ve decided to leave,” Rafah resident Hanan al-Satari said as people rushed to load mattresses, water tanks and other belongings onto vehicles.</p><p>“The Israeli army does not have a safe area in Gaza. They target everything,” said Abu Yusuf al-Deiri, displaced earlier from Gaza City.</p><p>Many people have been displaced multiple times. There are few places left to go. Some Palestinians are being sent to what Israel has called humanitarian safe zones along the Muwasi coastal strip, which is already packed with about 450,000 people in squalid conditions.</p><p>Georgios Petropoulos, with the U.N. humanitarian agency in Rafah, said that aid workers had no supplies to help people set up in new locations. </p><p>“We simply have no tents, we have no blankets, no bedding,” he said.</p>
    

<p>The World Food Program had said it would run out of food to distribute in southern Gaza by Saturday, Petropoulos said — a further challenge as parts of Gaza face what the WFP chief has called <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-famine-world-food-program-israel-hamas-war-476941bf2dc259f85a706408b2a665ff">“full-blown famine.”</a></span> Aid groups have said that fuel will be depleted soon, forcing hospitals to shut down critical operations.</p><p>Heavy fighting was also underway in northern Gaza, where Hagari said that the air force was carrying out airstrikes. Palestinians in Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and surrounding areas were told to leave for shelters in the west of Gaza City, warned that Israel would strike with “great force.”</p><p>Northern Gaza was the first target of Israel’s ground offensive launched after Hamas and other militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 250 hostage. They still hold about 100 captives and the remains of more than 30. Hamas on Saturday said that hostage Nadav Popplewell had died after being wounded in an Israeli airstrike a month ago, but provided no evidence.</p>
    

<p>Israel’s bombardment and ground offensives have killed more than 34,800 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures. Israel blames Hamas for civilian casualties, accusing it of embedding in densely populated residential areas.</p><p>Civil authorities in Gaza gave more details of mass graves that the Health Ministry announced earlier at Shifa hospital, the largest in northern Gaza and the target of an earlier Israeli offensive. Authorities said most of the 80 bodies were patients who died from lack of care. The Israeli army said “any attempt to blame Israel for burying civilians in mass graves is categorically false.”</p>
    

<p>At least 19 people, including eight women and eight children, were killed overnight in central Gaza in strikes that hit Zawaida, Maghazi and Deir al-Balah, according to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital and an AP journalist who counted the bodies.</p><p>“Children, what is the fault of the children who died?” one relative said. A woman stroked the face of one of the children lying on the ground.</p><p>Another round of cease-fire talks in Cairo ended earlier this week without a breakthrough, after Israel rejected a deal that Hamas said it accepted.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people attended the latest anti-government protest in Israel on Saturday evening amid growing pressure on Netanyahu to make a deal. </p><p>“I think the (Rafah) operation is not meant for the hostages and not meant for killing the Hamas, it’s meant for just for one thing, save the government,” protester Kobi Itzhaki said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Sam Mednick reported from Tel Aviv and Samy Magdy from Cairo.

But in the hours before they took action, at least 16 people were visibly injured, the majority of them pro-Palestinian, including two protesters who could be seen with blood streaking across their faces and soaking into their clothes, videos and images show. The counterprotesters ignited at least six fireworks; struck protesters at least 20 times with wooden planks, metal poles and other objects; and punched or kicked at least eight protesters.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">The protesters occasionally fought back.

"The arguments that somehow we’re walking away from Israel fly in the face of the facts. I mean, this is a president who visited Israel within days of the October 7th attacks. This is a president who rushed additional military articles to Israel and, frankly, provided expertise from our own military to go over there to help them as they thought through their planning and their operation," he told reporters at the White House.</p><p>Kirby continued "this is a president who put American pilots — fighter pilots — in the sky to help shoot down more than 300 missiles and drones fired by Iran in . . . mid-April. So the argument that somehow we’re walking away from Israel, we’re not willing to help them defeat Hamas just doesn’t . . . comport with the facts."</p><p>Matthew Levitt, the director of the Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at The Washington Institute, told Fox News Digital, "By default, working arms before hostages—including U.S. hostages—are released, and after Hamas’ bad faith behavior in negotiations, could embolden both Hamas and Hezbollah."</p><p>Hamas has over 100 hostages in its captivity, including Americans. The terrorist mastermind behind Hamas' massacre of nearly 1,200 people, including over 30 Americans, Yahya <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/hamas-terrorist-leader-surrounds-himself-hostages-human-shields">Sinwar is believed to be using hostages</a> as human shields to hold off Israeli soldiers seeking to capture him in a tunnel deep below Gaza.</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Palestinian Hamas terrorists are seen during a military show in the Bani Suheila district on July 20, 2017, in Gaza City, Gaza.

I don’t think that’s any secret. We’ve been making those concerns known publicly, and we have made those concerns quite clear to the Government of Israel. And as the President noted, there are certain types of military assistance that we will not make available to Israel for use in a campaign in Rafah," said Miller.</p><p>The Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA) published a letter from a who’s who of <a href="https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/JINSA_Israel_at_war_Open_Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">retired U.S. military leaders</a>, criticizing Biden’s arms directive. "Amid surging antisemitism in America and the world, following the largest one-day loss of innocent Jewish life since the Holocaust, U.S. support for the only Jewish state should be clear, unwavering, and not conditioned.

These forces are also enemies of the United States and everything we stand for. </p><p>"This Iranian-backed axis of terror, as well as other adversaries and allies around the world, are watching closely to see whether the United States will stand by one of its closest allies fighting in self-defense, even when the going gets tough."</p><p>Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and former National Security Council official, warned, "There’s zero doubt that Iran and Hezbollah are going to escalate the longer this illegitimate embargo drags on.

        </div><p>As of Saturday afternoon, heavy rains were falling in the northern and central regions of the state, and water levels were rising.</p><p>Carlos Sampaio, 62, lives in a low-income community next to soccer club Gremio’s stadium in Porto Alegre. His two-story home doubles as a sports bar.</p>
    

<p>Even though the first floor is inundated, he said he won’t leave, partly out of fear of looters in his high-crime neighborhood, where police carry assault rifles as they patrol its flooded streets. But Sampaio also has nowhere else to go, he told The Associated Press.</p>



<p>“I am analyzing how safe I am, and I know that my belongings aren’t safe at all,” Sampaio said. “As long as I can fight for what is mine, within my abilities to not leave myself exposed, I will fight.”</p><p>At least 136 people have died in the floods since they began last week, and 125 more are missing, local authorities said Friday. The number of people displaced from their homes because of the torrential rains has surpassed 400,000, of whom 70,000 are sheltering in gyms, schools and other temporary locations.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

<p>“I came here on Monday — lost my apartment to the flood,” Matheus Vicari, a 32-year-old Uber driver, said inside a shelter where he is staying with his young son. “I don’t spent a lot of time here. I try to be out to think about something else.”</p>
    

<p>Some residents of Rio Grande do Sul state have found sanctuary at second homes, including Alexandra Zanela, who co-owns a content agency in Porto Alegre.</p><p>Zanela and her partner volunteered when the floods began, but chose to move out after frequent electricity and water cuts. She headed to the beachfront city of Capao da Canoa — so far unaffected by flooding — where her partner’s family owns a summer home.</p><p>“We took a ride with my sister-in-law, took our two cats, my mother and a friend of hers and came here safely. We left the Porto Alegre chaos,” Zanela, 42, told the AP by phone. “It is very clear that those who have the privilege to leave are in a much safer position, and those living in the poorer areas of Porto Alegre have no option.” </p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

        </div><p>Weather across South America is affected by the El Niño climate phenomenon, a naturally occurring event that periodically warms surface waters in the equatorial Pacific. In Brazil, El Niño has historically caused droughts in the north and intense rainfall in the south, and this year the effects have been particularly severe. </p><p>Scientists say extreme weather is happening more frequently because of climate change, caused by the burning of fossil fuels that emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, and overwhelmingly agree the world needs to drastically cut the burning of coal, oil and gas to limit global warming.</p>
    

<p>But there is also a need for social policy responses, said Natalie Unterstell, president of Talanoa Institute, a Rio de Janeiro-based climate policy think tank.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

<p>Rio Grande do Sul has the sixth-highest gross domestic product per capita among Brazil’s 26 states and the federal district, according to the national statistics institute. Many of the state’s inhabitants descend from Italian and German immigrants.</p><p>“In the popular imagination, the population of Rio Grande do Sul is seen as white and well-off, but this is not the reality,” said Marília Closs, a researcher at the CIPO Platform, a climate think tank. “It’s very important to dispel this fiction, because it’s constructed with a political objective” to erase Black and poor residents, she said. </p><p>In Canoas, one of the hardest-hit cities in the state, Paulo Cezar Wolf’s small wooden house has been fully submerged, along with all his belongings. The truck driver, who is Black, now lives in the back of a loaned truck with six of his neighbors, who all cook, eat and sleep there.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

<p>Wolf, 54, has considered leaving the rural region, where he has lived since childhood, but has nowhere else to go and doesn’t want to leave behind his four adult children.</p><p>“It is too late for someone like me to move somewhere else,” Wolf said, wearing a donated sweatshirt as he stood on a highway.</p><p>The meteorology institute predicts the arrival of a mass of cold and dry air will reduce the chance of rain beginning Monday. But it also means temperatures are set to drop sharply, to around freezing by Wednesday. That makes hypothermia a concern for those who are wet and lacking electricity.</p><p>Celebrities, among them supermodel Gisele Bündchen who is from Rio Grande do Sul, have been sharing links and information about where and how to donate to help flood victims. Churches, businesses, schools and ordinary citizens around the country have been rallying to provide support.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

<p>A police spokesperson said that the march on Saturday largely proceeded peacefully.</p>

<p>Police said that there had been minor clashes with activists, but did not initially provide any information on injuries or arrests.</p>

<h2>What did the protesters say?</h2>

<p>The Disrupt Tesla group said the political and environmental problem went beyond the <a class="internal-link" href="/en/elon-musk/t-63587027">Elon Musk</a>-owned carmaker and extended to other auto manufacturers.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter if it's Tesla, VW or Mercedes — car companies and their political supporters are responsible for selling out our lifeblood," said Disrupt Tesla group spokeswoman Lucia Mende, ahead of a planned demonstration.</p>

<p>"We must prevent this and we will prevent it," she added.</p>

<p>Some residents in Grünheide, where <a class="internal-link" href="/en/germany-elon-musk-visits-tesla-factory-after-power-sabotage/a-68511988">billionaire Musk</a> has built his only European Tesla factory, say both the company and the Brandenburg state government have not paid attention to citizens' interests in pressing ahead with the expansion.</p>

<p>"They are going through with it, they are not listening to the sensitivities of the local people," said spokesman Steffen Schorcht, a spokesman for a citizens' initiative. "It only serves the interests of Tesla."</p><div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"><h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Taking on Tesla — Fight for the Forest" class="headline"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"><g fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"></path></g></svg>Taking on Tesla — Fight for the Forest</h2><div class="render-container"><div class="sc-djLfiL bWQlcR sc-gSYeb fALeZZ"><div class="bg-poster"><video id="video-68996009" dir="ltr" controls="" playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-duration="12:36" data-play-btn-title="Play video" class="dw-player video-js vjs-fluid"><source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/repoe/repoe20240504_gesamtHD_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"><track src="https://www.dw.com/media/subtitles/69045611" srclang="en" label="ENGLISH"><p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p></track></source></video></div></div></div></div>

<p>"If you're fighting and keep hitting a wall and don't know what else to do, then sometimes the only thing left is civil disobedience."</p>

<h2>Police prepared for further flare-ups</h2>

<p>Police said they were braced for more trouble after multiple people were arrested after activists attempted to break into the factory on Friday evening.  </p>

<p>Regional broadcaster RBB said several hundred people ran toward the Tesla facility, with many wearing masks and dressed in black.</p>

<p>Hundreds of demonstrators had gathered near the site on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>"We are aware," said a police spokesman adding that the situation had been calm in the night and the morning.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Activists set up a protest camp, including tree houses, near the factory in late February and have been there ever since. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tesla was forced to suspend production in March after an <a class="internal-link" href="/en/germany-tesla-plant-targeted-in-deliberate-arson-police/a-68455762">arson attack on an electricity pylon</a> compromised the factory's power supply. The <a class="internal-link" href="/en/arson-near-teslas-gigafactory-who-is-the-volcano-group/a-68457754">far-left extremist "Volcano Group"</a> said it attacked the power grid.</span></p>

<p>Opponents of the expansion, which would include a freight depot and requires forest to be cleared, say their concerns are chiefly environmental.</p>

<p>They criticize the production of electric cars in general and have cited fears about the possible pollution of local drinking water.</p>

<p>Activists also cite environmental destruction in countries like Argentina or <a class="internal-link" href="/en/russia-china-ahead-in-race-for-bolivias-lithium/a-67843534">Bolivia where the mineral lithium, needed for electric car batteries, is mined</a>.</p>
