<li>
<p>The Georgia Court of Appeals has halted the election subversion conspiracy case against Donald Trump and his co-defendants, effectively putting the trial on hold until the court rules on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court filed a new order on Wednesday, indicating that the trial will not occur before the 2024 presidential election. A panel of judges will rule on Willis' disqualification in the coming months.</p>

<li>
<p>The appeals court is expected to rule on the disqualification issue by March 2025, although the timeline is uncertain, according to sources close to the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee had initially allowed proceedings in his courtroom to continue while the appeals court weighed an appeal of his decision to allow Willis to remain on the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court's decision to halt the trial is a significant victory for Trump, who can now avoid a trial until 2025 or potentially indefinitely if he wins the disqualification ruling.</p>

            A Georgia appeals court has halted the election subversion conspiracy case against Donald Trump and several of his co-defendants – a massive victory for the former president seeking to push further legal issues until 2025 if he can’t beat them altogether.

The court said the case will be on hold until a panel of judges rules on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified.

            Trump and some of his co-defendants in the sprawling racketeering case have been trying to get Willis disqualified from the case because of a romantic relationship she had with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired to help handle the case. The defendants argued that Willis financially benefited from the relationship with Wade, who defense attorneys say covered several vacations for the pair.

            In March, after what amounted to a mini-trial where attorneys for Trump and his co-defendants sought to prove their case against Willis and Wade, McAfee found there was not enough evidence to firmly prove Willis financially benefited from the relationship.

            Steve Sadow, Trump’s lead defense counsel in Georgia, said the ruling was proper.

            “The Georgia Court of Appeals has properly stayed all proceedings against President Trump in the trial court pending its decision on our interlocutory appeal which argues the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct,” Sadow said in a statement.

            Meanwhile, in Trump’s classified documents case in Florida, the federal judge overseeing those proceedings has shown propensity to devote large amounts of in-court time to Trump’s requests to question investigators and his prosecutors’ authority.

            That judge, Aileen Cannon, indicated on Wednesday she still appears to be willing to hold a hearing where Trump could attempt to put federal investigators under oath so his attorneys could question them, and said she’ll dedicate a day and a half this month to hearing arguments about the legality of his prosecutor.

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans have blocked legislation designed to protect women’s access to contraception, arguing that the bill was just a political stunt as Democrats mount an election-year effort to put GOP senators on the record on <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-bans-exceptions-doctors-lawmakers-7cefca4a248076268c789ea05b367f1a">reproductive rights issues</a></span>, </p><p>The test vote won a 51-39 majority, but that was well short of the 60 votes to move ahead on the legislation.</p><p>It came as the Senate has abandoned hopes of doing serious bipartisan legislation before the election. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and his Democrats are trying to instead spotlight issues they believe can help them win the presidency and keep the Senate in November. A similar vote on <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ivf-senate-reproductive-care-8325160d68579ff2bbf89cfee5acd481">ensuring nationwide access to in vitro fertilization</a></span> is expected next week. </p><p>That bill is expected to similarly stall in the Senate, where Democrats need 60 votes to move forward on legislation. Schumer said Tuesday that Democrats will “put reproductive freedoms front and center before this chamber, so that the American people can see for themselves who will stand up to defend their fundamental liberties.”</p>
    

<p>The effort comes as Democrats worry that reproductive rights will be further threatened after the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to an <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/abortion">abortion</a></span> two years ago and as they continue to see that access as one of their most potent election-year issues. President Joe Biden’s campaign has embraced reproductive rights as <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/michigan-biden-abortion-israelhamas-4edafc567e1e8377950e52713f8f4966">a key to winning undecided voters</a></span>, especially women.</p>



<p>“Contraception is health care, essential health care, that millions of people rely on,” said Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Democrat. She said the court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade “foretold more chaos to come.”</p>
    
<p>President Joe Biden called the Republican opposition to the bill “unacceptable.” </p><p>“We will continue to urge Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law and safeguard the right to contraception once and for all,” Biden said. </p>
    

<p>Minority Republicans have scoffed at the votes, saying the political messaging votes were unserious distractions from legislation they would like to vote on. “I expect we will see a lot more show votes this summer,” said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, on Tuesday.</p><p>Maine Sen. Susan Collins, one of two Republicans to vote with Democrats to move forward on the bill, said Monday that she would want the legislation to be amended to include more religious liberty protections. “It is clearly a messaging attempt and not a serious attempt in itself,” she said. </p><p>Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who along with Collins supports abortion rights, also voted to move forward on the legislation. </p><p>Many Republicans who voted against consideration of the bill said they support access to contraception but believe the legislation is unnecessary. </p><p>“The Democrats are using their power to push an alarmist and false narrative that there is a problem accessing contraception,” said Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the top Republican on the Senate Health, Labor, Education and Pensions Committee. </p>
    

<p>Democrats have moved to protect various rights in the wake of the Roe decision, particularly after Justice Clarence Thomas issued a concurring opinion that suggested the court also reconsider previous opinions that prohibited bans on contraceptives, sodomy and same-sex marriage.</p><p>But the Senate push on reproductive access this year differs from bipartisan legislation passed in 2022 that would <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-wisconsin-rob-portman-marriage-tammy-baldwin-91b12650871afaa87a479d3018a4fded">protect same-sex marriage</a></span>. A vote on that bill was delayed until after that year’s midterm elections to try and avoid political complications, and 12 Republicans eventually supported it, sending it to Biden’s desk. </p><p>Since Republicans took the House majority last year, though, Congress has moved on few legislative items that were not immediately urgent or that did not face deadlines for expiration. Schumer has said repeatedly that he would like to move on bills to improve rail safety, lower the cost of prescription drugs and improve online safety for children, among other bipartisan legislation. But most of those bills have stalled in the divided Congress as some Republicans and Democrats have been less willing to work together in an election year.</p>
    

<p>Instead, Schumer has focused the Senate on judicial nominations and political messaging bills, including a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/border-immigration-senate-vote-924f48912eecf1dc544dc648d757c3fe">repeat vote last month on a border security bill</a></span> that Republicans had already rejected in February after months of bipartisan negotiations. Democrats who have faced intense criticism over the border issue have hoped that they can blunt that issue somewhat by highlighting that legislation. But Republicans have said it did not go far enough.</p><p>Democrats seized on the contraception issue after former President <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></span>, the presumptive GOP nominee, said <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-contraception-birth-control-abortion-2024-8f73bb1b3a5864b24157f15eb272a3e6">in an interview</a></span> last month that he was open to supporting restrictions on birth control.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hunter Biden, the son of US President Joe Biden, is on trial in Wilmington, Delaware, on charges related to his possession of a firearm while allegedly using narcotics.</li>
<li>The prosecution's star witness, Zoe Kestan, has testified that Biden was using crack cocaine "every 20 minutes or so" when they first met at a "gentleman's club" in New York.</li>
<li>Kestan also claimed that Biden would often withdraw cash for drug deals and that she saw him smoking crack cocaine at a frequent rate.</li>
<li>The trial is the first criminal trial for the son of a sitting US president, and Biden faces up to 25 years in prison if found guilty on all counts.</li>
<li>The charges against Biden relate to his possession of a firearm while allegedly using narcotics, and the trial is being closely watched due to Biden's high-profile family connections.</li>

Germans, Dutch, Belgians and Brits from all walks of life, who this week have chosen to don Second World War Allied military uniforms, to honour the 150,000 soldiers who landed here in Nazi-occupied France on 6 June 1944 - changing the course of 20th-Century Europe as they did so.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">How different things look now.

Russia’s Vladimir Putin most pointedly has not.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">President Macron’s office insists the World War Two sacrifice of the Soviet people and their contribution to victory will be honoured this year as always. But it says “it will be remembered that the Eastern front was not just Russia, but also the Ukrainians, the Belarusians and all the other countries that were part of the USSR.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The pain and humiliation of occupation, the deprivation of freedom facing or threatening millions in Ukraine, is something the Normands understand all too well.

<p>Stanford students who participated in Wednesday’s protest would be immediately suspended, and any seniors would not be allowed to graduate, university President Richard Saller and Provost Jenny Martinez said in a joint statement. </p>
    
<p>They said the university also removed a student encampment of Palestinian supporters on Wednesday, which had been set up on campus on April 25, citing public safety concerns and violations of school policies.</p><p>“The situation on campus has now crossed the line from peaceful protest to actions that threaten the safety of our community,” they said, adding that demonstrators had recently tried to occupy a different building. </p>
    

<p>One law enforcement officer was lightly injured when he was shoved by protesters interfering with a transport vehicle, university spokesperson Dee Mostofi wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Other campus activities were not affected, she said.</p>
    
<p>In addition to the damage indoors, the president and provost said there was extensive graffiti on the sandstone buildings and columns of the Main Quad. Video posted on social media showed police busting in a door. Other photos showed an office desk splattered with a red liquid. </p><p>An AP journalist on campus saw walls spray-painted political slogans calling for the destruction of the U.S. and Israel, as well as killing police.</p><p>“This graffiti conveys vile and hateful sentiments that we condemn in the strongest terms,” the president and provost said, adding that it remains unclear who graffitied the university.</p><p>Sarah Lebaron, a Stanford physics student, said she didn’t think Wednesday’s demonstration and graffiti were an effective way to protest the war in Gaza or <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/campus-protests-university-endowments-investment-4b393044367becca68f17c3435c91e33">question university endowments</a></span>.</p><p>“I think the goal is to have Stanford divest from Israel.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) passed a resolution criticizing Iran for not cooperating with the agency and reversing its decision to ban inspectors. The resolution was passed by a vote of 20-12, with one country abstaining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The resolution was brought by Britain, France, and Germany, but opposed by China and Russia. The US initially opposed the resolution, fearing it would escalate tensions in the Middle East.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iran condemned the decision as "hasty and unwise" and threatened to take a "serious and effective response". The country has consistently denied Western allegations of seeking to develop a nuclear weapon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The resolution marks the first of its kind since November 2022 and is seen as a way to apply diplomatic pressure on Iran. The option to refer the issue to the UN Security Council is still on the table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The IAEA has reported that Iran has significantly ramped up its nuclear program, including increasing its uranium enrichment activities. Tehran has threatened to retaliate if the international community imposes more sanctions or pressure on the country.</p>

<p>The UN nuclear watchdog’s 35-nation board of governors passed a resolution on Wednesday calling on Iran to step up cooperation with the watchdog and reverse its recent barring of inspectors.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 3 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>“The decision of the Western countries was hasty and unwise, and it will undoubtedly have a detrimental impact on the process of diplomatic engagement and constructive cooperation [between Iran and the opposing parties]”, state TV cited Iran’s mission to the United Nations as saying.</p>
<p>The motion brought by Britain, France and Germany – but opposed by China and Russia – at the IAEA board is the first of its kind since November 2022.</p>
<p>It comes amid an impasse over Iran’s escalating nuclear activities and as Western powers fear Tehran may be seeking to develop a nuclear weapon, a claim Iran has consistently denied.</p>
<p>The resolution was carried by 20 votes in favour – including the United States, which initially was reluctant for fear of aggravating Middle East tensions – with 12 abstentions and one country not participating, three diplomats told the AFP news agency.</p>
<p>Although symbolic in nature at this stage, the censure motion aims to raise diplomatic pressure on Iran, with the option to potentially refer the issue to the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>Tehran had already threatened “a serious and effective response” and called the censure motion “devoid of any legal, technical and political basis”.</p>
<p>In the past, similar resolutions have prompted Tehran to retaliate by removing surveillance cameras and other equipment from its nuclear facilities and ratcheting up its uranium enrichment activities.</p>
<p>The IAEA has said that Tehran has significantly ramped up its nuclear programme and now has enough material to build several atomic bombs.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>During the debates at the IAEA board of governors that began on Monday in Vienna, European powers denounced Iran’s expansion of its nuclear programme “to alarming levels” as “unprecedented for a state without a nuclear weapons programme”.</p>
<h2 id="strong-and-renewed-message">‘Strong and renewed message’</h2>
<p>According to the IAEA, Iran is the only non-nuclear weapon state to enrich uranium to the high level of 60 percent – just short of weapons-grade – while it keeps accumulating large uranium stockpiles.</p>
<p>The resolution sent “a strong and renewed message of support” for the IAEA’s efforts to address the issue, Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The Board will not sit idly by when Iran challenges the foundations of the non-proliferation system and undermines the credibility of the international safeguards regime,” they added.</p>
<p>“We hope Iran takes this opportunity to resolve these outstanding matters so that no further Board action is necessary.”</p>
<p>Iran has gradually broken away from its commitments under the nuclear deal it struck with world powers in 2015.</p>
<p>The landmark deal provided Iran with relief from Western sanctions in exchange for curbs on its atomic programme, but it fell apart after the unilateral withdrawal of the US under then-President Donald Trump in 2018.</p>
<p>Efforts to revive the deal have so far failed.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>In a joint statement quoted Wednesday by Iran’s official news agency IRNA, Tehran, Moscow and Beijing called on “Western countries to show political will … and take the necessary steps to resume the implementation” of the 2015 deal.</p>
<p>But the US rejected that assertion, saying Iran refused an accord when it was possible and “continued with activities that negated the chance for that deal, and now makes baseless statements to obfuscate the history”.</p>
