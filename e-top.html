                                        <p>JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli army ordered some 100,000 Palestinians on Monday to begin evacuating from the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/rafah-offensive-israel-netanyahu-hamas-palestinians-014b2d850bbe28897b624bc5e5378320">southern city of Rafah</a></span>, signaling that a long-promised ground invasion there could be imminent and further complicating efforts to broker a cease-fire in Gaza.</p><p>The looming operation in the city — where more than 1 million Palestinians are sheltering and a high number of deaths is feared — has <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-02-10-2024-2d80dc890a5030757e2ae76684fa75da">raised global alarm</a></span> and Israeli’s closest allies have warned against it. On Monday, the United Nations agency serving Palestinian refugees said it would not comply with the evacuation order.</p><p>Israel has described Rafah as the last significant <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">Hamas stronghold after some seven months of war</a></span>, and has repeatedly said the invasion is necessary to defeat the Islamic militant group, which unleashed the current conflict with an attack on Israel on Oct. 7.</p>
    

<p>But Hamas and key mediator Qatar have warned that <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/rafah-gaza-evacuation-palestinians-attack-israel-hamas-90bf78cfca6550dc229e7192f6724dfc">invading Rafah</a></span> — along the border with Egypt — could derail efforts by international mediators to broker a cease-fire. </p>



<p>Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an army spokesman, said some 100,000 people were being ordered to move to a nearby Israel-declared humanitarian zone called <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-refugees-displaced-muwasi-ca3860fafed03cb2333ad0bdf2379e31">Muwasi</a></span> — a makeshift camp of tents where along the coast hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have sought safety and live in squalid conditions.</p><p>Shoshani said Israel was preparing a “limited scope operation” and would not say whether this was the beginning of a broader invasion of the city. Israel never formally announced the launch of its current ground invasion in Gaza.</p>
    
<p>Smoke could be seen rising from Rafah Monday afternoon, although the cause was unclear.</p><p>Tensions escalated Sunday when Hamas fired rockets at Israeli troops positioned on the border with Gaza near Israel’s main crossing for <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/video/israel-hamas-war-israel-gaza-strip-israel-government-war-and-unrest-de0c9d0d47984b7c887f2a04d676f1bf">delivering badly needed humanitarian aid</a></span>, killing four soldiers. Israel shuttered the crossing — but Shoshani said it would not affect how much aid enters Gaza as others are working.</p>
    

<p>He would not say whether the upcoming operation was a response to that attack. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes on Rafah killed 22 people, including children and two infants, according to a hospital.</p><p>Shoshani said Israel published a map of the evacuation area, and that orders were being issued through air-dropped leaflets, text messages and radio broadcasts. He said Israel has expanded humanitarian aid into Muwasi, including field hospitals, tents, food and water.</p><p>Israel’s army said on the social media platform X that it would act with “extreme force” against militants, and urged the population to evacuate immediately for their safety.</p><p>Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, condemned the “forced, unlawful” evacuation order and the idea that people should go to Muwasi.</p><p>“The area is already overstretched and devoid of vital services,” Egeland said.</p><p>About 1.4 million Palestinians — more than half of Gaza’s population — are jammed into Rafah and its surroundings. Most of them fled their homes elsewhere in the territory to escape Israel’s onslaught and now face another wrenching move or the danger of staying under a new assault. </p>
    

<p>They live in densely packed tent camps, overflowing U.N. shelters or crowded apartments, and are dependent on international aid for food, with sanitation systems and medical facilities infrastructure crippled.</p><p>Palestinians in Rafah said people gathered to discuss their options after receiving the flyers.</p><p>“So many people here are displaced and now they have to move again, but no one will stay here it’s not safe,” Nidal Alzaanin told The Associated Press by phone.</p><p>A father of five, Alzaanin works for an international aid group and fled to Rafah from Beit Hanoun in the north at the start of the war. He said people are concerned since Palestinians have said they were <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-palestinians-war-ambulance-girl-family-06f15b155f1de426e00f6a655554b2a2">fired at during previous evacuations</a></span>. Israel denies shooting at civilians.</p><p>Alzaanin said he has packed his documents and bags but will wait 24 hours to see what others do before relocating. He said he has a friend in Khan Younis whom he hopes can pitch a tent for his family.</p>
    

<p>The U.N. agency that has helped millions of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank for decades, known as UNRWA, warned Monday of devastating consequences of a Rafah offensive, including more civilian suffering and deaths. Juliette Touma, communications director for the agency, which has thousands of employees in the city, said it has not evacuated and has no plans to do so.</p><p>Egypt’s Rafah crossing, a main transfer point for aid going into Gaza, lies in the evacuation zone. The crossing remained open on Monday after the Israeli order.</p><p>The war was sparked by an <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-attack-military-war-a8f63b07641212f0de61861844e5e71e">unprecedented Oct. 7 raid into southern Israel</a></span> in which Hamas and other militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 hostages.</p><p>The ensuing conflict has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials. The tally does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but officials say at least <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-aqsa-martyrs-hospital-health-care-israel-7c7a6117efae29e22a61e82151144613">two-thirds of the dead are children and women</a></span>. It has left a swath of destruction in Gaza, and around 80% of the territory’s population has fled to other parts of the besieged coastal enclave.</p>
    

<p>Recently, pressure to end the war has grown. Even as the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have pushed for a cease-fire agreement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated last week that the military would move on the city <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-04-30-2024-f5e14fd176d69f9c4e23b48f3ab5af6a">regardless of whether a truce-for-hostages deal is struck</a></span>.</p><p>On Monday, Netanyahu accused Hamas of “torpedoing” a deal and not budging from its “extreme demands” while vowing to stop the militants from retaking control of Gaza.</p><p>A Hamas official told The Associated Press that Israel is trying to pressure the group into making concessions on the cease-fire, but that it won’t change its demands. Hamas wants a full end to the war, withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the eventual reconstruction of the strip in exchange for the Israeli hostages held by the militants. </p><p>In Rafah, people received flyers Monday morning in Arabic detailing which neighborhood blocks needed to leave and said that aid services would be provided in other cities.</p><p>“The IDF is about to operate with force against the terror organizations in the area you currently reside,” the army said in its evacuation order to residents. “Anyone in the area puts themselves and their family members in danger.”</p><p>But some people say they’re too tired and fed up of months of devastation to flee again. </p><p>Sahar Abu Nahel fled to Rafah with 20 members of her family.</p><p>“Where am I going to go? I have no money or anything. I am seriously tired as are (my) children,” she said wiping tears from her cheeks. “Maybe its more honorable for us to die. We are being humiliated.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Mroue reported from Beirut.</p>

            Trump faces another week in the Manhattan courtroom where he is on trial over the alleged falsification of business records to cover up an affair with adult film actress Story Daniels. Prosecutors argue he attempted a cover-up to mislead voters in 2016 in an early act of election interference. Trump denies the affair and has pleaded not guilty — to this and to three other criminal indictments.

            Given the former president’s frequent attacks on witnesses, which last week <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/30/politics/donald-trump-fined-usd9-000-for-violating-gag-order-in-hush-money-case/index.html">cost him $9,000</a> over violations of gag orders, prosecutors are keeping witness lists under wraps. But in dramatic testimony last week, former White House communications director Hope Hicks <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/03/politics/donald-trump-trial-takeaways-hope-hicks-day-11/index.html">took the stand</a> under a prosecution subpoena. In potentially the most significant moment of the trial so far, a nervous Hicks, who shed tears at one point, appeared to implicate Trump in a way that played into the prosecution argument when she said that the ex-president admitted to her that he knew his then-fixer Michael Cohen had paid Daniels. She also said that Trump felt it was better to deal with the story after the election than beforehand. But Trump’s lawyer, Emil Bove, extracted a statement under cross-examination that could be useful to bolstering the core defense argument when Hicks said her boss was worried about the Daniels story because it could hurt or embarrass members of his family.

            As the trial continues, Trump’s mood is becoming testy. He’s offering new glimpses of the extremism that could drive his second term and is already posing a fresh challenge to American democracy, following his departure from office in disgrace in 2021 after trying to steal the last election based on false claims of fraud.

            At a private luncheon at his Mar-a-Lago club on Saturday, he accused Democrats of “running a Gestapo administration,” according to three attendees, equating the Biden team with the Nazi Secret Police who rounded up and committed genocide against Jews in the Holocaust.

            Trump continually repeats his charge that his indictments are a result of a Democratic plot. But there is no evidence to support this. His comments about the Gestapo do not only betray historical ignorance but also underscore how there is no limit to the ex-president’s use of inflammatory rhetoric to try to win the election. Last week, in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/02/politics/donald-trump-accept-2024-election-results/index.html">refused to guarantee</a> he’d accept the result of the next election. And in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/04/politics/fact-check-trump-time-magazine/index.html">an interview with Time magazine</a> published last week, he said violence was possible depending on the “fairness” of the election.

            James Singer, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign, said Trump’s remarks at the fundraiser proved the danger of a potential second term the ex-president has said would focus on retribution. “Trump is once again making despicable and insulting comments about the Holocaust, while in the same breath attacking law enforcement, celebrating political violence, and threatening our democracy,” Singer said.

            After days of building political pressure, the president addressed the situation for the first time on camera last Thursday, saying that the right to protest was a vital American freedom but that it was not acceptable when demonstrations turn violent. He condemned antisemitic incidents that have been reported against some Jewish students and he said he wasn’t rethinking his staunch support for Israel in the wake of the October 7 terror attacks — despite his frequently ignored calls on the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do more to protect civilians in Gaza.

            Trump and Republicans have seized on the protests — and police operations to clear them at some schools — to underscore their narrative that the country is spinning out of control under Biden and that Trump could restore law and order.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvu5nhyn000j3b6i0p5bqfq3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            But speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday, the Biden campaign’s national co-chair Mitch Landrieu pushed back on an analogy by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who likened the current protests to the anti-Vietnam war sentiment in 1968 that caused then-President Lyndon Johnson to abandon his reelection bid. Landrieu said the Independent senator from Vermont’s view was an “over exaggeration.” He added: “This is a very different circumstance. I think that people who actually lived through that very difficult time; they would say that this isn’t comparable. However, that is not to say that this is not a very serious matter.”

            Some Democrats have downplayed the impact of the protests, citing polling that suggests that the war in Gaza is well down the list of concerns for most young voters, notwithstanding the dramatic scenes at many colleges. But Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, a staunch supporter of Israel during the conflict, warned that pro-Palestinian demonstrators could help Trump in November. “Like if they want to throw Michigan to Trump that way — well, if you want to play with that fire … you better own that fire,” said Fetterman, referring to a swing state where Arab Americans form an important part of the Democratic electorate. He also warned against liberal voters deserting Biden because of his stance on the war. “If you are willing to walk away or to actually vote for someone else, you are going to throw your vote away and you are on the Trump train and you better watch out for the wreck,” he said.

            But another leading Democrat, California Rep. Ro Khanna, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that a lot of the protests across the country were seeing a constructive dialogue. “We have to understand that this is a defining moment for this generation, similar to anti-Vietnam protests, anti-apartheid protests, anti-Iraq War protests,” he said. “They’re telling us that over 30,000 people have died. It’s time for this war to end. It’s time for the hostages to be released that Hamas has, and they want to see leadership in America and around the world.”

            In another significant political drama looming this week, Johnson is expected to survive a vote called by Greene to oust him and throw the House GOP into yet more chaos. After Johnson pushed through Biden’s request for billions of dollars in funding for Ukraine last month, Democrats are likely to vote to save the speaker. But even if he survives, no Republican speaker wants to leave the impression that he is only in power because of the opposition party, and the Louisiana lawmaker’s long-term future remains cloudy.

            Many Republicans, even those cool on the rookie speaker, don’t want to see another governing farce unfold like the multi-vote ballot to choose Johnson’s predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, and the vote to oust — and then replace — the Californian last year.

            Right-wing extremists, taking advantage of the tiny GOP majority, have made the House all but ungovernable since the party took over after the 2022 midterm elections. But despite signs that Greene’s patron, Trump, has praised Johnson and is not enthusiastic about more chaos in the party that could complicate his and the GOP’s chances in the fall, she is vowing to push ahead after accusing Johnson of betraying Republican base voters.

She has embraced a policy of "de-risking" from China, which includes tougher talk and cutting Europe's dependence  on Chinese imports and tech. </p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Later this week, he will make stops in Serbia and Hungary, allies of Moscow that have courted Chinese investment. </p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Mr Xi will spend most of Monday in talks with French President Emmanuel Macron.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Mr Macron will want to press Mr Xi on Beijing's friendship with Moscow - and how far it is prepared to go to settle the war in Ukraine, especially as President Putin is scheduled to visit Beijing later this month.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">The two will also discuss French brandy, China's most imported type of spirit - Beijing is threatening to impose tariffs on it in response to the EU's investigation into Chinese EVs. </p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">That is an alarming prospect for French brandy makers who said last week that high tariffs would be a blow to the future of the industry. </p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Beijing is likely to be just as concerned about the results of the EU's investigation into Chinese subsidies for EVs. Europe is a key market for China's hugely  successful electric car makers. </p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb"></p></section><section data-component="text-block" class="sc-189fa0a-0 insmih"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">So, winning over Mr Macron is key if Beijing is to, as China’s ambassador to France put it, “resist anti-China relations”. </p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">To do that Mr Xi is highlighting the ties that bind Franco-Chinese relations together as the two celebrate 60 years of diplomatic relations. </p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">The Chinese leader wrote an opinion column for the French newspaper Le Figaro and said he was coming to France with three messages: that Beijing was committed to opening up “new vistas” in its relationship with France; opening up “ever wider” to the world and to upholding world peace and stability.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Keeping with Beijing's message, Chinese state media is also upbeat.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">“China and France will light up their way forward with the torch of history, open a brighter future of China-France relations and make new contributions to world peace, stability and development,” said Xinhua.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">It also highlighted President Xi’s love of French writers and artists and reported that his book has now been translated into French.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">But there was also a word of caution: a Global Times editorial urged Europe to be independent and "especially not controlled by any third party", a not-so-subtle reference to the US. </p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">To put Paris in his corner, Mr Xi may see an opening with his French counterpart.</p></section><section data-component="text-block" class="sc-189fa0a-0 insmih"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">President Macron has in the past pushed back on following US policies on China. He caused controversy during his trip to Beijing last year by saying Europe should not follow Washington “blindly” on Taiwan.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">And while Mr Macron is one of the strongest backers of a raft of trade measures that have angered Beijing in recent weeks, he also wants Chinese companies to build their EV plants in France.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Even so, Mr Macron has proved he will be no pushover. Last week, as he was preparing to roll out the carpet for President Xi’s visit, he met Sikyong Penpa Tsering, the leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile, in Paris.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">One of Mr Macron’s key priorities will also be to warn China of the danger of backing Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Like the United States, France and most of the EU want Beijing to stop supplying weapons components to Moscow.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">“It is in our interest to get China to weigh in on the stability of the international order,” said Mr Macron in an interview with the Economist published on Thursday.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">“We must, therefore, work with China to build peace,” he added.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">President Xi has so far refused to do anything to stop Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">In his Le Figaro opinion column he wrote that China “understands the repercussions of the Ukraine crisis on the people of Europe” and emphasised that Beijing is not “a party to or a participant in it”, adding that “China has been playing a constructive role in striving for peaceful settlement of the crisis”.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Whatever the outcomes of his visit to France, President Xi‘s visits to Hungary and Serbia will prove that China still has allies in the eastern corner of Europe.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb"><i class="sc-ed73b9f2-0 gyrAHo">Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring</i></p></section></div>

<li><strong>Starbucks needs to improve its U.S. stores</strong>: Former CEO Howard Schultz believes that Starbucks' poor quarterly report is due to a lack of improvement in its U.S. stores, specifically in terms of the mobile order and pay experience and the creation of new drinks.</li>
<li><strong>Customer experience is key</strong>: Schultz emphasizes the importance of a "maniacal focus on the customer experience" through the eyes of a merchant, rather than relying on data.</li>

<li><strong>Analysts are looking for an explanation</strong>: Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore suggested that Starbucks may be facing repercussions from its position on conflict in the Middle East, which could be affecting its U.S. traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Schultz has no formal role at Starbucks</strong>: Schultz, who led Starbucks to become a coffee giant, stepped down as CEO over a year ago and does not have a formal role within the company, but remains a prominent voice on its operations.</li>

            <strong>Sydney —</strong> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/australia">Qantas Airways</a> has agreed to pay 120 million Australian dollars<strong> </strong>($79 million) to settle a lawsuit over the sale of thousands of tickets on already canceled flights, in an attempt to end a reputational crisis that has engulfed the airline.

            The company will split 20 million Australian dollars between more than 86,000 customers who booked tickets on the so-called “ghost flights” and pay a fine of 100 million instead of defending the lawsuit it had previously vowed to fight, Qantas and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said on Monday.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvunlqux000a3b6jsltjuowm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The fine is the biggest ever for an Australian airline and among the largest globally in the sector, although some Australian banks and casino operators have faced higher penalties.

            The settlement “means we can compensate affected customers much sooner than if the case had continued in the Federal Court,” added Hudson, noting the court still must sign off on the settlement.

            If the court approves, the settlement will resolve a dispute that featured prominently at a time when Qantas’s brand value tanked in consumer surveys amid a spike in complaints about cancellations.

            After the ACCC filed its lawsuit last August, Hudson’s longserving predecessor, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/04/business/australia-qantas-ceo-hnk-intl/index.html">Alan Joyce</a>, brought forward his retirement. Hudson became CEO in September.

            The payout, however, would pale against the net profit of 1.47 billion Australian dollars that analysts on average forecast Qantas to report in the year to end-June, according to LSEG data.

            The ACCC lawsuit centered on the months after Australia’s border reopened in 2022 following two years of Covid restrictions, and airline cancellations and lost luggage complaints spiked globally amid staffing shortages.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvunor9a000y3b6j7ricdngu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Qantas had argued that it faced similar challenges to airlines around the world, but the ACCC said its actions broke consumer law. It had said the airline sometimes sold tickets to flights weeks after they were canceled.
