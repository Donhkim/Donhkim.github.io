<ol>
<li>Benny Gantz, a centrist member of Israel's war cabinet, has given Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an ultimatum: develop a plan for the future of the war in Gaza or he will leave the government.</li>
<li>Gantz's departure would not necessarily topple the emergency wartime government, but would further strain the fragile coalition and make Prime Minister Netanyahu even more reliant on his hard-line partners.</li>
<li>Gantz warned that if Netanyahu chooses the "path of zealots" and drags the country into chaos, he and his coalition will leave the government and turn to the people to build a new government that earns their trust.</li>
<li>The ultimatum highlights the growing tension between Gantz, a centrist, and Netanyahu, a conservative, within the government.</li>
<li>The situation could lead to a political crisis in Israel, potentially weakening Netanyahu's position and paving the way for a government shake-up.</li>

<li>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has recovered the body of Ron Benjamin, a 53-year-old Israeli hostage who was taken captive by Hamas during an attack in October.</li>

<li>The IDF confirmed that Benjamin was killed on October 7, the same day as the attack, at the Mefalsim intersection, and his body was later taken to Gaza by Hamas militants.</li>
<li>The body was only recently identified, and Benjamin's family has been informed of his death.</li>
<li>Benjamin was a family man and had been taking part in the cycle ride when he decided to drive home, unaware of the attack that was unfolding.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Representative Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican, criticized Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, for her behavior during a House Oversight committee hearing on Thursday night.</li>
<li>The hearing turned into a verbal brawl when Greene told Representative Jasmine Crockett, a Texas Democrat, that her "fake eyelashes" were interfering with her reading, leading to instant backlash and a call to strike Greene's comments from the record.</li>
<li>Chairwoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, described Greene's actions as "absolutely unacceptable" and asked to strike the comments from the record.</li>
<li>The chairman of the committee, James Comer, refused to enforce the committee's rules on decorum, leading Crockett to take a jab at Greene, suggesting that discussing someone's physical appearance is not allowed in the committee.</li>
<li>The altercation went viral on social media, with a video of the altercation posted by a senior digital editor for liberal news site MeidasTouch on Twitter, which showed the heated exchange between Greene and Crockett.</li>

<ol>
<li>A federal jury convicted David DePape of attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assaulting a family member, and he was sentenced to an unspecified number of years in prison.</li>
<li>The defense argued that DePape's untreated mental illness made him vulnerable to believing conspiracy theories that led him to plot to kidnap House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and others.</li>
<li>Judge Corley rejected the prosecution's request for a 40-year prison sentence and the application of a terrorism enhancement, but still deemed DePape a threat.</li>
<li>The judge's decision means that DePape's sentence could be reconsidered if he provides new information, but Stanford law professor Robert Weisberg notes that the judge will need to carefully document her consideration of DePape's statements.</li>
<li>DePape's federal sentencing may have implications for his upcoming state-level trial in San Francisco Superior Court, where he faces charges including attempted murder.</li>

    <div><div class="post-body"><p>Prosecutors sought a longer, 40-year prison sentence and the application of a terrorism enhancement, an argument which Corley rejected Friday. She said, however, that DePape remained a threat.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys argued Friday that untreated mental illness left DePape vulnerable to believing conspiracy theories that drove him to plot to kidnap House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and others he said were part of a cabal of powerful public figures, as he testified during his trial.</p>
<p>A federal jury convicted DePape in November of attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assaulting her family member.</p>
<p>Stanford law professor Robert Weisberg said Corley’s order Saturday puts the judge in a “slightly tricky position,” to maintain an open mind about changing DePape’s sentence based on anything he says. And the judge will need to make a record that she considered the defendant’s statement, even if she doesn’t alter the sentence.</p>
<p>“I mean, she’ll have to do that with some elegance,” Weisberg said.</p>
<p>“There are so many strange things about this case and the behavior of the defendant, it’s hard to say,” Weiberg added. “He may just take the opportunity to give another speech.”</p>
<p>Effects of the continued federal sentencing may ripple into a separate trial scheduled to open as early as May 24, where DePape faces state-level charges in San Francisco Superior Court, including attempted murder.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Yemen's Houthi rebels attacked an oil tanker</strong> in the Red Sea with a ballistic missile, damaging the Panama-flagged, Greek-owned vessel, the Wind. The attack occurred early on Saturday morning.</li>
<li><strong>The attack caused significant damage</strong> to the oil tanker, resulting in flooding, loss of propulsion and steering, and a fire on board. However, no casualties were reported, and the crew was able to restore the vessel's propulsion and steering.</li>
<li><strong>The attack is part of a larger campaign by the Houthis</strong> to disrupt shipping and trade in the region. The Houthis have launched over 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel, and sunk another since November.</li>
<li><strong>The Houthis are also targeting Israeli interests</strong> in the region, allegedly in response to Israel's military attacks on Gaza. The Houthis have been demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed over 35,000 Palestinians.</li>
<li><strong>The United States has been involved in airstrikes against the Houthis</strong>, which has led to a decline in Houthi attacks in recent weeks. However, the threat of Houthi attacks still lingers, and shipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden remains low due to the ongoing conflict.</li>

Both China and Russia maintain ties over military equipment and oil to Iran, the Houthis' main benefactor. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The missile strike “caused flooding which resulted in the of loss propulsion and steering,” Central Command said on the social platform X. “The crew of M/T Wind was able to restore propulsion and steering, and no casualties were reported. M/T Wind resumed its course under its own power.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center and the private security firm Ambrey similarly acknowledged the attack earlier Saturday.

The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Houthi attacks have dropped in recent weeks as the rebels have been targeted by a U.S.-led airstrike campaign in Yemen. Shipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden still remains low because of the threat, however.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The Houthis claimed that they shot down the Reaper on Thursday with a surface-to-air missile. They described the drone as “carrying out hostile actions” in Yemen’s Marib province, which remains held by allies of Yemen’s exiled, internationally recognized government. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Since the Houthis seized the country’s north and its capital, Sanaa, in 2014, the U.S. military has previously lost at least five drones to the rebels.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN">Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land. </p></div></div>
