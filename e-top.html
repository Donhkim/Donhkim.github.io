    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Israel's successful hostage rescue operation</strong>: Israel rescued 4 hostages from Gaza, a significant success since the start of the war. The operation was carried out by Israeli forces and resulted in the death of at least 274 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.</li>
<li><strong>Complex situation in cease-fire talks</strong>: The rescue operation comes at a sensitive time in the 8-month-old war, with Israel and Hamas weighing a US proposal for a cease-fire and the release of remaining captives. Both sides face pressure to make a deal, but Hamas still insists on an end to the war, while Israel is committed to destroying the militant group.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on cease-fire talks</strong>: The successful rescue operation may lead to renewed pressure on Hamas to negotiate a deal, as it brings home 4 fewer hostage bargaining chips. However, Hamas may also dig in and resist a settlement, given its repeated refusal to agree to a ceasefire.</li>
<li><strong>Israeli perspective</strong>: The rescue operation is seen as a significant success by Israel, which is still reeling from the Hamas attack and agonizing over the fate of the 80 captives and remains of over 40 others still held in Gaza. Israeli hard-liners are likely to seize on the operation as proof that military pressure alone will bring the rest back.</li>
<li><strong>Humanitarian crisis in Gaza</strong>: The operation has deepened the suffering of people in Gaza, who have had to endure the brutal war and a humanitarian catastrophe. The Gaza Health Ministry reports at least 274 Palestinian deaths, but it does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its tallies.</li>

                                        <p>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel’s dramatic weekend <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-8-6-2024-a5d1ef04763a5ed17de2d050ebc5d490">rescue of four hostages</a></span> from the Gaza Strip, in an operation that local health officials say killed 274 Palestinians, came at a sensitive time in the 8-month-old war, as Israel and Hamas weigh a U.S. proposal for a cease-fire and the release of the remaining captives.</p><p>Both sides face renewed pressure to make a deal: The complex rescue is unlikely to be replicated on a scale needed to bring back scores of remaining hostages, and it was a powerful reminder for Israelis that there are still surviving captives held in harsh conditions. Hamas now has four fewer bargaining chips.</p><p>But they could also dig in, as they repeatedly have over months of indirect negotiations mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt. Hamas is still insisting on an end to the war as part of any agreement, while Israel says it is still committed to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-hamas-israel-netanyahu-biden-resettlement-war-796948b31c7aa8ed90c51edb41738eef">destroying the militant group</a></span>.</p>
    

<p>Here is a look at the fallout from the operation and how it might affect cease-fire talks:</p><h2>ELATION, AND MOUNTING CALLS FOR A DEAL</h2><p>The rescue operation was Israel’s most successful since the start of the war, bringing home four of the roughly 250 captives seized by Hamas in its Oct. 7 cross-border attack, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-hostages-profiles-80b14cd4a796aa265ebfcc5bb5928477">including Noa Argamani</a></span>, who became an icon of the struggle to free the hostages. </p><p>The raid also killed at least 274 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, deepening the suffering of people in Gaza who have had to endure the brutal war and a humanitarian catastrophe. The ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its tallies.</p>




    
<p>The rescue was met with elation in Israel, which is still reeling from the Hamas attack and agonizing over the fate of the 80 captives and the remains of over 40 others still held in Gaza. Israeli hard-liners are likely to seize on it as proof that military pressure alone will bring the rest back.</p><p>But only three other hostages have been freed by military force since the start of the war. Another three were mistakenly killed by Israeli forces after they escaped on their own, and Hamas says others have been killed in Israeli airstrikes.</p>
    

<p>“If anyone believes that yesterday’s operation absolves the government of the need to strike a deal, they are living a fantasy,” Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in the mass-selling Yediot Aharonot newspaper. “There are people out there who need to be saved, and the sooner the better.”</p><p>Even the Israeli army’s spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, acknowledged the limits of military force. “What will bring most of the hostages back home alive is a deal,” he told reporters.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

They deliberated for about an hour before they were released for the day.</p><p>His lawyers opted not to call him to the stand, though last Friday they had <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hunter-biden-gun-trial-prosecutors-defense-case/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">raised the possibility</a></span> that he would testify. </p><p>Prosecutors said in their closing argument Monday that the central issue is whether Hunter Biden was an unlawful user or addicted to a controlled substance when he purchased the firearm. They went over witness testimony, text messages, photographs, bank withdrawals and <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hunter-biden-interview-memoir-substance-abuse/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hunter Biden's memoir</a></span>. Prosecutors acknowledged the evidence was very "personal," ugly" and "overwhelming" but said it was "absolutely necessary" to prove his addiction.  </p>    
  <p>Two of the three charges Hunter Biden faces are related to accusations that he made false statements on a federal gun form about his drug use, certifying he was not a user of or addicted to any controlled substance during a period when prosecutors allege he was addicted to crack cocaine.  </p><p>He's also been charged with owning the gun unlawfully, possessing the weapon for 11 days before <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hallie-biden-hunter-biden-federal-gun-trial-testimony/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hallie Biden</a></span>, with whom he was romantically involved, found and discarded it.

<p>Defense lawyer Abbe Lowell said in his closing that the prosecution's case was built on "conjecture and suspicion," and prosecutors had unfairly used Hunter Biden's own words in his texts and his memoir out of context.  </p><p>Prosecutors said Hunter Biden's rehabilitation treatments were themselves evidence that he knew he was an addict and satisfied their burden to prove that he knowingly made false statements about his drug use for the purchase.  </p><p>But Lowell countered that Hunter Biden's admission that he was an addict was an expression of "what had he had been" and not who he was at the time, and they were a "cry for help" from someone looking back.   </p><p>Lowell argued there were gaps in the evidence of Hunter Biden's use of drugs during the 11-day period that he owned the firearm, arguing that key witnesses,  like Hunter Biden's ex-girlfriend <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hunter-biden-gun-trial-fbi-agent/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Zoe Kestan</a></span>, did not have any proof of his drug use.

<p>Lowell also pointed to testimony from Gordon Cleveland, the gun shop employee who sold Hunter Biden the weapon and testified that he did not appear to be under the influence at the time of purchase.  	</p><p>While prosecutor Leo Wise did not directly reference the first family members who have been attending, he reminded the jury "the people sitting in the gallery are not evidence" and "their presence in the courtroom has no bearing on the case." While President Biden has not been in the courtroom, first lady Jill Biden has been there nearly every day. The Bidens' daughter Ashley Biden, Mr. Biden's siblings Valerie and Jimmy Biden and Hunter Biden's wife Melissa Cohen Biden all sat in the front row with the first lady on Monday. 	</p><h2> Witness testimony  </h2><p>The prosecution wrapped its case Friday against President Biden's son after testimony from Hunter Biden's ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, his ex-girlfriend Zoe Kestan and Hallie Biden, the widow of his brother Beau Biden. The man who allegedly sold Hunter Biden the gun, Gordon Cleveland, also testified.  </p><p>Hallie Biden, considered to be the prosecution's star witness, testified last week that she "panicked" when she found the weapon, and she "just wanted to get rid" of the gun and bullets.  </p><p>"I didn't want him to hurt himself or the kids to find it and hurt themselves," she said. Hallie Biden testified that Hunter Biden had introduced her to crack cocaine after her husband's death. "It was a terrible experience that I went through, and I'm embarrassed and ashamed, and I regret that period of my life," she said. </p><p>At the heart of the prosecution's case is whether Hunter Biden knowingly lied about using drugs. Prosecutor Derek Hines in his opening statement noted that "addiction may not be a choice, but lying and buying a gun is a choice."  </p><p>Cleveland testified that Hunter Biden did not seem confused by the form when he sold him the firearm in Oct. 2018.  </p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/09/1fd5bfee-0101-470d-a3a4-8794b9665706/thumbnail/620x413/339f16d3b033f6d8434b316bac2f7c58/gettyimages-2156387921.jpg?v=e6a7e661b3d1c604b3ae2bec0d66302a#" alt="Hunter Biden Gun Trial Continues In Delaware " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/09/1fd5bfee-0101-470d-a3a4-8794b9665706/thumbnail/620x413/339f16d3b033f6d8434b316bac2f7c58/gettyimages-2156387921.jpg?v=e6a7e661b3d1c604b3ae2bec0d66302a 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/09/1fd5bfee-0101-470d-a3a4-8794b9665706/thumbnail/1240x826/7530d9331c342e90d3943b6628afdf08/gettyimages-2156387921.jpg?v=e6a7e661b3d1c604b3ae2bec0d66302a 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E"></span>

But she maintained that her father never used illegal drugs in front of her. She also acknowledged she had never observed what her father looked like when he was using drugs. </p><p>Jury deliberations resume Tuesday.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rebecca Grossman, a wealthy socialite, has been sentenced to 15 years to life in prison</strong> for the deaths of two boys, Mark and Jacob Iskander, who were killed in a street race-related crash in 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Grossman was convicted of second-degree murder and other charges</strong>, after a crash that killed the 11-year-old Mark and 8-year-old Jacob, and injured their mother and younger brother.</li>
<li><strong>The judge rejected a prosecution request for a 34-year sentence</strong>, citing Grossman's lack of a criminal record and philanthropic history, despite acknowledging the "incredibly selfish behavior" that led to the deaths.</li>
<li><strong>Grossman's defense team had argued that Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón was "catastrophically incompetent" in preparing for the case</strong>, potentially leading to the wrongful conviction of Grossman.</li>
<li><strong>The District Attorney's office and Grossman's family have expressed their condolences to the victims' family</strong>, with the DA stating that the incident is a "stark reminder of the grave consequences of irresponsible behavior behind the wheel."</li>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal judge presiding over the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/projects/trump-investigations-civil-criminal-tracker/">classified documents case</a></span> against former President Donald Trump and two of his associates struck a paragraph from the indictment on Monday but denied a defense request to dismiss some of the charges.</p><p>The paragraph concerns allegations that Trump, in 2021 while no longer president, showed a classified map of a foreign country to a representative of his political action committee while discussing a military operation that he said was not going well. </p><p>Defense lawyers said the paragraph was prejudicial because it included information that was not irrelevant to the indictment, which accuses Trump of illegally retaining classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate, and U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon on Monday agreed that the language’s inclusion in charging documents was “not appropriate.”</p>
    

<p>She left the rest of the indictment intact, denying in her 14-page order a defense request to dismiss actual charges in the indictment. But even as she did that, she chided special counsel Jack Smith’s team for having included in the indictment language that she said was “legally unnecessary to serve the function of an indictment” and for creating “arguable confusion” in the allegations.</p>



<p>The motion to dismiss the counts is one of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-classified-documents-delay-trial-election-83be6fb5362e7bb2b7aaf6371a9acabf">multiple pretrial requests and disputes</a></span> that for months have piled up before Cannon, snarling the progress of the case and prompting the judge last month to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-classified-documents-judge-cannon-6f910c3cbe8d91e493ab5fb13019d45f">indefinitely postpone a trial that had been set for May 20</a></span> in Fort Pierce, Fla. </p>
    
<p>She has scheduled additional arguments for later this month, including on a Trump challenge to the legality and funding of the Justice Department’s appointment of Smith as special counsel last year.</p><p>The delays are all the more startling given that many legal experts had seen the classified documents case as exceedingly straightforward in its allegations that Trump had illegally <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-classified-documents-maralago-jack-smith-632d6e0f6c8000138bc7c9d47529e20c">hoarded classified documents</a></span> from his presidency at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., and obstructed FBI efforts to get them back. </p>
    

<p>The prosecution is one of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/projects/trump-investigations-civil-criminal-tracker/">four criminal cases Trump is facing</a></span> as he seeks to reclaim the White House.</p><p>The defendants in this particular motion had sought to throw out more than a half-dozen counts in the indictment, which also accuses Trump of conspiring with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-classified-documents-justice-department-special-counsel-2025feb3f0f4e3820d14387c67ce4316">valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira</a></span> to conceal the sensitive files from the government.</p><p>The defendants had challenged counts related to obstruction and false statements, but Cannon said in an order Monday that “the identified deficiencies, even if generating some arguable confusion, are either permitted by law, raise evidentiary challenges not appropriate for disposition at this juncture, and/or do not require dismissal even if technically deficient, so long as the jury is instructed appropriately and presented with adequate verdict forms as to each Defendants’ alleged conduct.”</p><p>Cannon has already rejected multiple other motions to dismiss the case, including one that suggested that Trump was authorized under a statute known as the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-jack-smith-classified-documents-b862ec627ac0070e5353ac324d8d333f">Presidential Records Act</a></span> to keep the documents with him after he left the White House and to designate them as his personal files.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Missouri Governor Mike Parson has denied the clemency request of condemned inmate David Hosier, setting the stage for his execution by lethal injection on Tuesday.</li>
<li>Hosier, 69, is facing the death penalty for the 2009 murders of a Jefferson City couple, Angela and Rodney Gilpin, with whom he had a romantic relationship that ended roughly a month before the killings.</li>

                                        <p>ST. LOUIS (AP) — Missouri Gov. Mike Parson on Monday turned down a clemency request for condemned inmate <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/execution-date-set-missouri-inmate-hosier-58f9b156cf4fd640e04b90c7253f3a1c">David Hosier</a></span>, a move that likely clears the way for his execution.</p><p>Hosier, 69, faces lethal injection Tuesday for the 2009 deaths of a Jefferson City couple, Angela and Rodney Gilpin. Randy Dampf, a Jefferson City police officer at the time of the killings and now an investigator for the county prosecutor, said Hosier had a romantic relationship with Angela Gilpin and was angry with her for breaking it off.</p><p>“Ms. Angela Gilpin had her life stolen by David Hosier because he could not accept it when she ended their romantic involvement. He displays no remorse for his senseless violence,” Parson, a Republican and a former county sheriff who has overseen 10 executions since taking office in 2018, said in a statement. “For these heinous acts, Hosier earned maximum punishment under the law.”</p>
    

<p>Larry Komp, a federal public defender and one of Hosier’s attorneys, said no court appeals are pending.</p><p>Hosier, in an earlier phone interview with The Associated Press, had expressed displeasure with his lawyers’ clemency petition, which focused on the trauma of his Indiana State Police sergeant father being killed in the line of duty when Hosier was 16. Hosier thought it should have focused on the lack of fingerprints, DNA or eyewitnesses tying him to the Gilpins’ deaths. Glen Hosier was shot to death by a murder suspect in 1971 after entering a home.</p>



<p>“They did exactly the opposite of what I wanted them to do,” Hosier said of the clemency petition. “I told them I didn’t want the ‘boo-hoo, woe is me.’ All that stuff happened 53 years ago, OK? It has nothing to do with why I’m sitting here right now.”</p>
    
<p>Komp called Parson’s decision disappointing.</p><p>“It sends the wrong message to execute and marginalize a veteran and an individual harmed by the tragedy of his father being killed in the line of duty, which spun his life into a different direction,” Komp said in an email. “The context of his life history with the paucity of evidence related to his guilt makes this a compounding of tragedies, nothing is gained by killing him.”</p>
    

<p>Hosier spent four years in active duty in the Navy and later worked as a firefighter and EMT in Jefferson City. He acknowledged his 2009 affair with Angela Gilpin and that she ended it and reconciled with her husband. In September 2009, they were shot to death near the doorway of their apartment.</p><p>Detective Jason Miles said Hosier made numerous comments to other people threatening to harm Angela Gilpin in the days before the killings.</p><p>After the shootings, police found an application for a protective order in Angela Gilpin’s purse, and another document in which she expressed fear that Hosier might shoot her and her husband.</p><p>Hosier was an immediate suspect, but police couldn’t find him. They used cellphone data to track him to Oklahoma. A chase ensued when an Oklahoma officer tried to stop Hosier’s car. When he got out, he told the officers, “Shoot me, and get it over with,” court records show.</p>
    

<p>Officers found 15 guns, a bulletproof vest, 400 rounds of ammunition and other weapons in Hosier’s car. The weapons included a submachine gun made from a kit that investigators maintain was used in the killings, though tests on it were inconclusive.</p><p>A note was found in the front seat of Hosier’s vehicle. “If you are going with someone do not lie to them,” it read in part. “Be honest with them if there is something wrong. If you do not this could happen to YOU!!”</p><p>Hosier said he wasn’t fleeing to Oklahoma but was simply on a long drive to clear his mind. He had the guns because he likes to hunt, he said. He didn’t recall a note in the car.</p><p>Hosier wheezed at times when he spoke to AP, and his voice was weak. In mid-May, he was <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/missouri-execution-david-hosier-aeb2662ce734588d305094df0e07e8f9">taken from the prison to a hospital</a></span> — a rare move for death row inmates.

<li>A recent study published in Nature Ecology and Evolution claims that African elephants may have a unique naming system, where they give each other unique names.</li>
<li>Researchers observed how elephants communicated with each other, taking note of which elephants called out specific sounds and which appeared to respond.</li>
<li>The names given to elephants were in the form of low rumbles that elephants can hear from long distances, which are too low for humans to hear.</li>
<li>A machine learning model was used to try to determine which elephant was being addressed at a time, but it only guessed correctly around 28% of the time.</li>
<li>The study's author, Mickey Pardo, explained that humans and elephants both use names, but not in the majority of their utterances, so a high percentage of correct guesses was not expected.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tax cuts ahead</strong>: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced that the Conservative manifesto will include tax cuts, promising to "keep cutting people's taxes".</li>
<li><strong>Fully funded and costed</strong>: Sunak emphasized that the tax cuts would be "fully funded and costed", meaning that the party has a plan to fund these policies and ensure they are financially sustainable.</li>
<li><strong>No increase in Income Tax, NI, or VAT</strong>: The article states that both the Conservatives and Labour have ruled out increasing the rate of Income Tax, National Insurance, or VAT, indicating that the focus will be on reducing existing tax burdens rather than introducing new ones.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term goals</strong>: The article mentions that the Conservatives aim to abolish National Insurance completely in the long term, when it is deemed affordable to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Election manifesto details</strong>: The article expects the Tory manifesto, to be launched on Tuesday, to include specific pledges, such as scrapping stamp duty for first-time buyers of properties costing up to £425,000, but notes that it will not include anything on inheritance tax.</li>

                                        <p>BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) — Soldiers are searching mountainous forests near a city in northern Malawi after a military plane carrying the country’s vice president and a former first lady went missing in the area Monday, President Lazarus Chakwera said.</p><p>The plane carrying 51-year-old Vice President Saulos Chilima, former first lady Shanil Dzimbiri and eight others left the southern African nation’s capital, Lilongwe, at 9:17 a.m. and had been expected to land 45 minutes later at Mzuzu International Airport, about 370 kilometers (230 miles) to the north. </p>
    
<p>But air traffic control told it to not attempt a landing and to turn around because of bad weather and poor visibility, Chakwera said in an address broadcast live on state TV channel MBC. </p><p>Air traffic control lost contact with the aircraft and it disappeared from radar a short time later, he said.</p>
    

<p>“I know this is a heartbreaking situation. I know we are all frightened and concerned. I too am concerned,” Chakwera said. “But I want to assure you that I am sparing no available resource to find that plane. And I am holding onto every fiber of hope that we will find survivors.”</p>



<p>Mzuzu is Malawi’s third biggest city and the capital of the northern region. It lies in a hilly, forested area dominated by the Viphya mountain range, which has vast plantations of pine trees.</p><p>The president vowed that search operations would continue through the night and said authorities using telecommunications towers tracked the last known position of the plane to a 10-kilometer (6-mile) radius in one of the plantations. That area was the focus of the Malawi Defense Force search and rescue operation, he said.</p>
    
<p>“I have given strict orders that the operation should continue until the plane is found,” Chakwera said.</p><p>Chakwera said the U.S., the U.K., Norway and Israel offered assistance in the search operation and had provided “specialized technologies” that the president hoped would help find the plane sooner.</p>
    

<p>Chakwera said Dzimbiri, the ex-wife of former President Bakili Muluzi, was also one of the passengers. The group was traveling to attend the funeral of a former government minister.
