    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Norway, Ireland, and Spain have announced they will recognize a Palestinian state, a move seen as largely symbolic but historic for the Palestinian cause.</li>
<li>The recognition of a Palestinian state comes amid Israel's ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza and increased international criticism of Israel's conduct in the conflict.</li>
<li>Israel has responded by recalling its ambassadors to Norway, Ireland, and Spain, as well as summoning their envoys to its foreign ministry to express its disapproval of the recognition.</li>
<li>The decision by Norway, Ireland, and Spain is seen as a significant development in the stalled peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, with many experts calling for new efforts to establish a two-state solution.</li>
<li>The recognition of a Palestinian state is not a new development, as over 140 countries already recognize a Palestinian state. However, the announcements by Europe's three countries could potentially build momentum towards a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</li>

                                        <p>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Norway, Ireland and Spain said Wednesday they would recognize a Palestinian state, a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-palestinian-state-recognition-what-to-know-ed18d4cc50b20c8238e0de0068080eb0">historic but largely symbolic move</a></span> that further deepens Israel’s isolation more than seven months into its <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">grinding war against Hamas in Gaza</a></span>. Israel denounced the decisions and recalled its ambassadors to the three countries.</p><p>Palestinian officials welcomed the announcements as an affirmation of their decades-long quest for statehood in east Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip — territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war and still controls.</p><p>While some 140 countries — more than two-thirds of the United Nations — recognize a Palestinian state, Wednesday’s cascade of announcements could build momentum at a time when even close allies of Israel have piled on criticism for its conduct in Gaza.</p>
    
<p>The timing of the move was a surprise, but discussions have been underway for weeks in some European Union countries about possibly recognizing a Palestinian state. Proponents have argued that the war has shown the need for a new push toward a two-state solution, 15 years after negotiations collapsed between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government opposes Palestinian statehood.</p>

<p>In that assault, Hamas-led militants stormed across the border, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. The ICC prosecutor is also seeking arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders. Israel’s ensuing offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, and has caused a humanitarian crisis and a near-famine.

<p>Under interim peace accords in the 1990s, Israel collects tax revenue on behalf of the Palestinians, and it has used the money as a tool to pressure the PA. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, Smotrich froze the transfers, but Israel agreed to send the money to Norway, which transferred it to the PA.

<p>Their announcements came in swift succession. Norway, which helped broker the Oslo accords that kicked off the peace process in the 1990s, was the first. “There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition,” said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.</p><p>The country plans to upgrade its representative office in the West Bank to an embassy.</p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="European countries are recognizing a Palestinian state While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so.

  <p>"Pursuing further legal action against the City could have plunged Uvalde into bankruptcy, something that none of the families were interested in as they look for the community to heal," the statement said.</p><p>The money will come from the city's insurance coverage, attorney Josh Koskoff told reporters at a news conference.</p>

<p>"These families could have pursued a lawsuit against the city, and there's certainly grounds for a lawsuit," Koskoff said. "Let's face it, sadly, we all saw what we saw … but instead of suing the city and jeopardizing the finances of anybody, the families have accepted simply the insurance."</p><p>The city said the settlement will allow people to remember the shooting while "moving forward together as a community to bring healing and restoration to all those affected."</p><p>"We will forever be grateful to the victims' families for working with us over the past year to cultivate an environment of community-wide healing that honors the lives and memories of those we tragically lost," the city said in a statement. "May 24th is our community's greatest tragedy."</p><p>The families were also working on a separate settlement with Uvalde County, Koskoff said.</p>

"The whole world saw that. No amount of money is worth the lives of our children. Justice and accountability has always been my main concern. We've been let down so many times.

            The hearing was the first before Cannon since she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/07/politics/judge-postpones-trump-classified-documents-trial/index.html#:~:text=Judge%20Aileen%20Cannon%20has%20indefinitely,case%20goes%20to%20a%20jury.">indefinitely delayed</a> the start of the trial, which had been scheduled to begin as early as this week. It has been more than a month since the judge last held a public, in-person hearing in the case – though she has held at least one sealed proceeding since then.

            Trump is charged with taking classified national defense documents from the White House after he left office and of resisting the government’s attempts to retrieve the materials. Trump, Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira have all pleaded not guilty.

            During Wednesday’s hearing, Harbach slammed Woodward, saying he chose not to report the alleged incident until months later and has repeatedly changed his recollection of the conversation.

            “This is a lawyer whose allegations amount basically to him being extorted,” Harbach said of Woodward, waving his arms.

            The judge quickly scolded Harbach, telling the attorney to “calm down.” Cannon questioned why there was no evidence gathered of what happened in the 2022 conversation, saying, “Why do those comments [about Woodward] have to be made?”
    </p>

            “That is not true, and I didn’t say that,” Harbach shouted back. The prosecutor said that that there was no recording of the conversation between Bratt and Woodward, but that Smith’s team has preserved any record they have of the meeting.

            When postponing the trial, Cannon pointed to the mountain of unresolved pretrial issues for not putting a new date on the calendar. Wednesday kicks off a stretch of hearings scheduled through late July that will get the case through some – but not all – of the pretrial issues.

            Cannon’s slow pace in the case <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/03/politics/legal-fights-judge-trump-documents-trial/index.html">has attracted criticisms from outside legal experts</a>, who have accused the Trump-appointed judge of playing into delay tactics by the GOP’s presumptive White House nominee. Unless Cannon picks up her momentum considerably, it appears unlikely the charges will go before a jury before the 2024 election. If Trump wins the White House, it is expected he will make the charges against him go away.

            Until recent days, several major motions from Trump attacking the prosecution were not even publicly docketed. The proceedings have become mired in disputes over what should be redacted in public filings.

            On Tuesday, hundreds of pages of previously sealed court filings <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/mar-a-lago-documents-walt-nauta-donald-trump/index.html">were posted publicly</a> as part of efforts by the former president to have the charges against him thrown out. Those filings included a previously sealed March 2023 ruling by a federal judge in Washington, DC, finding there was “sufficient” evidence that Trump committed crimes, allowing investigators to obtain information from his former lawyer that would normally be protected by attorney-client privilege.
    </p>

            Trump is seeking to throw out that evidence, as well as the evidence obtained in the FBI’s search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022, from which investigators obtained many of the documents underlying several of the charges against Trump.

            In her order Sunday allowing for the filings to be made public, Cannon took a shot at prosecutors – one of several swipes she’s made at Smith’s office. She expressed “concern” the special counsel’s office had sought redactions of information in the newly unsealed filings after previously giving its OK for that information to be published in full in earlier court filings.

            “The Court is disappointed in these developments. The sealing and redaction rules should be applied consistently and fairly upon a sufficient factual and legal showing,” Cannon wrote. “And parties should not make requests that undermine any prior representations or positions except upon full disclosure to the Court and appropriate briefing.”

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate on Wednesday confirmed the 200th federal judge of President Joe Biden’s tenure, about a month earlier than when Donald Trump <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/4d4cb7d5b1e07e357324539ec0bc8098">hit that mark</a></span> in his term, though Trump still holds the edge when it comes to the most impactful confirmations — those to the Supreme Court and the country’s 13 appellate courts.</p><p>The march to 200 culminated with the confirmation of Angela Martinez as a district court judge in Arizona. The milestone reflects the importance that Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., placed on judicial confirmations after Trump put his enormous stamp on the federal judiciary with the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-14th-amendment-immunity-supreme-court-d3f001f66c5c3e85302b8772753ed769">confirmation of three Supreme Court justices</a></span>.</p><p>“Reaching 200 judges is a major milestone,” Schumer said just before the 66-28 vote. “Simply put, our 200 judges comprise the most diverse slate of judicial nominations under any president in American history.”</p>
    

<p>The current pace of judicial confirmations for this White House came despite Biden, a Democrat, coming into office in 2021 with far fewer vacancies, particularly in the influential appellate courts, than Trump, a Republican, did in 2017. </p>



<p>“There is more work to do,” Biden said in a statement after the vote. “Going forward, I will continue my solemn responsibility of nominating individuals who have excelled in their professional careers, who reflect the communities they serve and who apply the law impartially and without favoritism.”</p>
    
<p>It’s unclear whether Biden can eclipse his predecessor’s 234 judges before the year ends, though. </p><p>Democrats have solidly backed the president’s judicial nominees, but there have been some cracks in that resolve in recent weeks. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he would not support nominees who do not have some bipartisan support, and the two Democratic senators from Nevada are opposing a nominee who would become the nation’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/muslim-judge-biden-nomination-fight-adeel-mangi-6891b1523928390184fb71afac47e9ee">first Muslim appellate court judge</a></span>. They did so after some law enforcement groups came out against the nomination.</p>
    

<p>The White House is aware of the obstacles as they rush to surpass Trump’s accomplishment. It’s a high water mark that remains a point of pride for the former president and senior Republicans who made it happen, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Filling dozens of judicial vacancies requires time on the Senate floor calendar, which becomes more scarce as senators in the narrowly divided chamber shift into election-year campaign mode. </p><p>Of the more than 40 current judicial vacancies nationwide, half are in states with two Republican senators. That matters because for district court judges, home-state senators still can exercise virtual veto power over a White House’s nominations due to a long-standing Senate tradition.</p><p>White House officials say they have no illusions about the challenges they face but feel reaching 235 is possible. That doesn’t please Republicans.</p><p>“Unfortunately, they learned from our example about prioritizing lifetime appointments,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Meanwhile, liberal advocacy groups are thrilled with the results so far. </p>
    

<p>“I just cannot rave enough about these judges,” said Jake Faleschini, who leads nominations work at the Alliance for Justice. “It’s been nothing short of transformative of the federal judiciary in terms of both excellence, but also demographic and professional diversity.”</p><p>At this stage in his term, Trump had two Supreme Court justices and 51 appellate court judges confirmed to lifetime appointments. Biden has tapped one Supreme Court justice and 42 appellate court judges. Biden has more confirmations of the district judges who handle civil and criminal cases. Those nominations tend to be less hard fought.</p><p>Biden has emphasized adding more female and minority judges to the federal bench. On that front, 127 of the 200 judges confirmed to the bench are women. Fifty-eight are Black and 36 are Hispanic, according to Schumer’s office. Thirty-five judges are Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, more than any other administration, according to the White House.</p>
    

<p>In the appellate courts, 30 of the 42 circuit judges confirmed during Biden’s term are women, according to the White House. Thirteen Black women have been chosen as circuit judges, more than all previous administrations combined. </p><p>Under Biden, more Hispanic judges have been confirmed to the appellate courts than any other administration. </p><p>As abortion access remains a vital priority for the Biden administration and a key argument for the president’s reelection bid, the White House also points to several judges with backgrounds on the issue. They include Judge Julie Rikelman of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, who before her nomination argued on behalf of the abortion clinic in Dobbs vs Jackson, the 2022 ruling that dismantled Roe vs. Wade; and Nicole Berner, a former attorney at Planned Parenthood who now serves on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. </p>
    

<p>Conservatives say it is fine to have diversity, but that should not be the focus.</p><p>“I think the right standard isn’t trying to check boxes with nominees, but to try to find the men and women who are going to be faithful to the Constitution and the rule of law,” said Carrie Severino, president of JCN, a conservative group that worked to boost support for Trump’s nominees.</p><p>About a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/01/13/how-trump-compares-with-other-recent-presidents-in-appointing-federal-judges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-quarter</a></span> of the judges Trump nominated were women and about 1 in 6 were minorities, according to the Pew Research Center. </p><p>Asked about the diversity of Biden’s nominees, GOP senators said there was too much focus on “identity politics.”</p><p>“I’m interested in competent lawyers who will administer justice fairly. Now, there are women that can do that. There are men that can do that. There are people of color that can do that,” said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. “But their primary characteristic that they’re proudest of is racial identify or gender identify, and activist. And I just don’t think that’s what the American people want to see in their justice system.”</p><p>Proponents of diversifying the federal judiciary counter that people who come before the court have more trust in the legal process when they see people who look like them. They said it’s important to diversify the professional backgrounds of judges, too, so that more public defenders and those with a civil rights or non-profit background are considered.</p><p>“The American people deserve federal judges who not only look like America, but understand the American experience from every angle,” said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman.</p>

<li>Justine Payton, a 28-year-old woman, was quarantined in a Hare Krishna ashram in Philadelphia in December 2020 with only $72 to her name.</li>
<li>Payton had spent years working 7 days a week in the ashram, with limited freedom and strict rules, including reporting any infractions to the leader, Mangal-arti.</li>
<li>Payton had relocated to Philadelphia to help open the Mantra Lounge meditation center at the behest of Mangal-arti's "spiritual master", Devamrita Swami, a prominent figure in the Hare Krishna movement.</li>
<li>Payton felt a sense of purpose and community in the Hare Krishna movement, which had attracted her with its inclusive practices such as yoga, vegan meals, and volunteer work.</li>
<li>Despite her dedication to the movement, Payton was unhappy with her living situation and had reached a breaking point, leading her to reflect on her circumstances and consider her future.</li>

She rose at 4:30 each morning and her days ended at 9:30 p.m. If she violated the home’s strict rules — sneaking a piece of chocolate, say — her fellow devotees would report her to their leader, whom they knew as Mangal-arti. </p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Ms. Payton had moved to Philadelphia to help open the Mantra Lounge meditation center at the behest of Mangal-arti’s “spiritual master,” Devamrita Swami, a New York-born, Yale-educated leader in the Hare Krishna movement. The responsibility was an honor, she believed at the time. The movement had given her joy, purpose and community when she desperately needed it. Now she was reaching new followers with the same things that first attracted her: cheap yoga and vegan meals, and then meditation, chanting, and volunteer work.</p><p class="css-zry96z" aria-live="polite" role="note"><a class="css-1081t4c" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=8WXW7">Subscribe to The Times</a> to read as many articles as you like.</p></div></div></div>

    <div><section class="content__body"><p><em>New Delhi </em>— Indian justice officials have changed course amid outrage over the bail terms set for a teenager accused of killing two people while driving a Porsche at high speed while drunk and without a license. The 17-year-old son of a wealthy businessman  had been ordered to write a 300-word essay and work with the local traffic police for 15 days to be granted bail — a decision that was made within 15 hours of his arrest.</p><p>He is accused of killing two young people while speeding in his luxury car on Sunday in the western Indian city of Pune. </p><p>The lenient bail conditions initially imposed by the local Juvenile Justice Board shocked many people, including officials, across India. The local police approached the board with an appeal to cancel his bail and seeking permission to treat the boy, who is just four months shy of his 18th birthday, as an adult, arguing that his alleged crime was heinous in nature. </p>    
  <p>In 2015, India changed its laws to allow minors between 16 and 18 years of age to be tried as adults if they're accused of crimes deemed heinous. The change was prompted by the notorious 2012 <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/india-convicts-4-men-in-fatal-gang-rape-on-new-delhi-bus/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Delhi rape case</a></span>, in which one of the convicts was a minor. Many activists argued that if he was old enough to commit a brutal rape, he should not be treated as a minor.</p><p>On Wednesday night, after three days of outrage over the initial decision, the Juvenile Justice Board canceled the teen's bail and sent him to a juvenile detention center until June 5. It said a decision on whether he could be tried as an adult, which would see him face a more serious potential sentence, would be taken after further investigation.</p>

<p>Late Sunday night, police say the teen, after drinking with friends at two local bars in Pune, left in his Porsche Taycan, speeding through narrow roads and allegedly hitting a motorcycle, sending the two victims — a male and female, both 24-year-old software engineers — flying into the air and killing them. </p><p>The parents of both victims have urged authorities to ensure a strict punishment for the teen.</p><p>The suspect was first charged with causing death by negligence, but that was changed to a more serious charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. On Wednesday he was also charged with drunk driving offenses.</p><p>Police have arrested the suspect's father and accused him of allowing his son to drive despite being underage, according to Pune Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar. The legal age for driving in India is 18. Owners of the two bars where the minor was served alcohol have also been arrested and their premises seized.</p>

There is no disputing how important the chipmaker’s numbers are to the broader earnings picture. S&amp;P 500 earnings are on pace to rise 7.6% this season. Nvidia alone is responsible for one-third of the entire index’s earnings growth, according to Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at financial data firm LSEG.</p><p>While Apple and Microsoft have the largest earnings weightings on the S&amp;P 500, no company will have more of an actual effect on overall S&amp;P 500 earnings than Nvidia due to both its huge market cap and its outlandish earnings growth. Nvidia is the fourth-biggest stock in the S&amp;P 500, but its earnings and revenue growth this quarter is unmatched by any of the other megacaps.</p><p>Analysts are expecting first-quarter earnings per share of $5.59. That is more than five times the $1.09 that the chipmaker reported a year ago. On the revenue front, Wall Street is projecting revenue of $24.65 billion, triple the $7.19 billion in the year-ago quarter.</p><p>But keep in mind, Nvidia’s results have also significantly surprised to the upside in each of the reports from the past year.

The big-box retailer projects same-store sales of up 0% to 2% versus the Street’s expectation for 1.5% growth. Meanwhile, earnings guidance of $1.95 to $2.35 has a midpoint of $2.15, which is below the $2.19 expected by analysts.</p><p>However, the full-year forecast is reaffirmed, implying better performance in the back half of the year. While they feel the U.S. consumer remains largely “resilient” overall, Target executives told analysts on the call that “currently, 1 in 3 Americans has maxed out or is nearing the limit on at least one of their credit cards. For these reasons and more, we remain cautious in our near-term growth outlook. Notably, we expect discretionary trends will continue to remain pressured in the short-term but to normalize over time.” </p><p>TJX gave weak second-quarter guidance, with earnings per share at 88 cents to 90 cents, below the 94 cent estimate. Same-store sales are projected to grow 2% to 3%, a bit conservative compared to Wall Street’s expectation of up 3%. The company raised its full-year earnings guidance, but that is mostly because of the off-price retailer’s first-quarter beat. But considering the weak second quarter as well, the full-year outlook implies there is greater hope for the second half.</p><p>Last night, Urban Outfitters executives told analysts to expect more markdowns this quarter — particularly at its more troubled namesake stores — to clear out inventory before the back-to-school season.
