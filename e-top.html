            Now Cohen is the witness whom prosecutors are relying on to deliver testimony that can help them prove Trump falsified business records when he allegedly reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 to Daniels to keep her from going public about a past encounter ahead of the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair.

            Cohen is the only witness who will testify about Trump’s alleged involvement in both the decision to pay Daniels and the plan to reimburse Cohen for advancing the money. Cohen will likely serve as the narrator for the prosecution and take the jury from the initial meeting in which Pecker, Cohen and Trump allegedly agreed to buy negative stories that could hurt Trump’s presidential run to the payment made to Daniels just days before Election Day to an Oval Office meeting in February 2017, just weeks after Trump was sworn in.

            Prosecutors allege that during the February meeting, Trump and Cohen agreed how Cohen would be paid back.

            Prosecutors have waited to call Cohen until the end of their case, after introducing phone records, emails, text messages and bank records that they hope bolster his credibility with the jury. They have not tried to hide from the jury that he and other witnesses have plenty of problems.

            He will also face blistering cross-examination by Trump attorney Todd Blanche.

            “Even before he takes the stand, Cohen has been attacked and undermined by the prosecution’s own witnesses. On one hand, he could be damaged goods before he takes the stand.

<li>Dozens of students walked out of Duke University's commencement ceremony on Sunday as comedian Jerry Seinfeld was about to give his address, citing Palestinian flags and chanting "free Palestine".</li>
<li>The walkout was seen on videos posted on social media, with some students leaving the crowd of graduates at the university's football stadium, while others chanted "Jerry! Jerry!" in response to Seinfeld's introduction.</li>
<li>Seinfeld, who has supported Israel since the recent Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants, spoke at the ceremony and received an honorary degree from Duke, despite the protests, according to a livestream of the ceremony.</li>
<li>Seinfeld's speech focused on jokes about the students, artificial intelligence, and privilege, and he defended the concept of privilege, saying "use your privilege" and growing up as a Jewish boy from New York gave him a privilege as a comedian.</li>
<li>The university has stated that it respects the right of everyone at Duke to express their views peacefully, and understands the depth of feeling in the community, while also celebrating the achievement of the graduates.</li>

Jerry!"</p>    
  <p>The 70-year-old Seinfeld, who has supported Israel since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants, recently sparked controversy over his comments on what remains acceptable fodder for comedy today.</p><p>On Sunday, he received an honorary degree from Duke and delivered the commencement address without major interruptions, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSsk-HKUp5s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">livestream</a> of the ceremony showed. The livestream did not show the students walking out.</p>

    </p>
<p>His speech largely steered clear of politics and instead focused on jokes about the students, artificial intelligence and privilege.</p><p>"A lot of you are thinking, 'I can't believe they invited this guy.' Too late," he said, after vowing to "defend" the concept of privilege.</p><p>"I say, use your privilege. I grew up a Jewish boy from New York. That is a privilege if you want to be a comedian," he added.</p><p>As Seinfeld spoke, the departed graduates chanted, "Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest" from the parking lot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/us/as-jerry-seinfeld-receives-an-honorary-degree-at-duke-students-walk-out-in-protest.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The New York Times</a> reported.</p>

<p>The actor has not commented publicly on the walkout. </p><p>In a statement to CBS News, Frank Tramble, vice president for marketing, communications and public affairs at Duke, said: "We're excited and delighted for the Class of 2024 and their families. We understand the depth of feeling in our community, and as we have all year, we respect the right of everyone at Duke to express their views peacefully, without preventing graduates and their families from celebrating their achievement."</p><p>The demonstration by students is the latest manifestation of protests that have <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/violence-erupts-at-some-pro-palestinian-campus-protests/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">roiled U.S. campuses</a></span> for several weeks as students call for universities to divest from arms suppliers and other companies fueling and profiting from the war.</p><p>The protests prompted universities such as <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/columbia-university-commencement-2024/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Columbia</a></span> and the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/usc-removes-outside-speakers-and-honorees-from-2024-commencement/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">University of Southern California</a></span> to cancel or restructure their main graduation ceremonies.</p><p>At the University of Michigan, students briefly interrupted the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pro-palestine-protesters-briefly-interrupt-university-of-michigan-graduation-ceremony/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">ceremony earlier this month</a></span>. </p><p>"Peaceful protests like this have taken place at U-M commencement ceremonies for decades," university spokesperson Colleen Mastony said after the ceremony.</p><p>This week, Xavier University of Louisiana and the University of Vermont <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/universities-rescind-commencement-invitations-u-n-ambassador-linda-thomas-greenfield-gaza/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">rescinded a commencement invitation</a></span> to United Nations Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield because of student outcry over the conflict in the Gaza Strip. Administrators at both universities cited pressure from students and the community over the Biden administration's support for Israel in its war with Hamas.</p>

<p>At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a small group of demonstrators staged what appeared to be a silent protest during commencement at Camp Randall Stadium on Saturday. A photo posted by the Wisconsin State Journal showed about six people walking through the rear of the stadium, with two carrying a Palestinian flag.</p><p>Marc Lovicott, a spokesperson for campus police, said the group, which he believed were students because they were wearing caps and gowns, "was kind of guided out but they left on their own." No arrests were made.</p><p>Dozens of graduating students at Virginia Commonwealth University walked out on an address by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. While some of the estimated 100 students and family members who left during the Republican governor's speech showed support for Palestinians, others held signs signaling opposition to Youngkin's policies on education, according to <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/vcu-graduates-walkout-during-gov-youngkins-speech-at-commencement-ceremony/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WRIC-TV</a>.</p><p>At the University of Texas, Austin, a student held up a Palestinian flag during a commencement ceremony and refused to leave the stage briefly before being escorted away by security.</p><p>And at the University of California, Berkeley, a small group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators began waving flags and chanting during commencement and were escorted to the back of the stadium, where they were joined by others, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/uc-berkeley-commencement-19445404.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according to the San Francisco Chronicle</a>. There were no major counterprotests, but some attendees voiced frustration.</p>

<ol>
<li>Former US President Donald Trump held a rally on the Jersey Shore, attended by 80,000 supporters, as part of his efforts to win the Democrat-held state of New Jersey in the 2024 elections.</li>
<li>Trump arrived late to the event, around 6:30pm local time, and delivered a speech in which he vowed to win the state of New Jersey and made jibes at his political opponents, including President Joe Biden, whom he dubbed a "total moron".</li>
<li>Thousands of fans attended the rally, many wearing Trump masks and American flag-themed outfits, and the event had a festival atmosphere with long lines and busy bars and restaurants.</li>
<li>Trump 2024 flags were pitched on the beach, and the event was held in Wildwood, a town that is typically sleepy during the off-season.</li>

                                        <p>TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) — A strong earthquake shook the border of Mexico and Guatemala early Sunday, driving frightened residents into the streets.</p><p>The temblor struck just before 6 a.m. near the Mexican border town of Suchiate, where a river by the same name divides the two countries. The epicenter was just off the Pacific coast, 10 miles (16 kilometers) west-southwest of Brisas Barra de Suchiate, where the river empties into the sea.</p><p>The earthquake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.4, according to the U.S. Geological Survey and a depth of 47 miles (75 kilometers).</p><p>In Mexico, there were no immediate reports of damage, but more mountainous, remote parts of the border are prone to landslides.</p><p>Across the border Guatemala’s national disaster prevention agency shared photos of small landslides onto highways in the Quetzaltenango region and large cracks in walls in a hospital in San Marcos on its social media accounts, but there were no reports of deaths.</p>
    

<p>In Tapachula, near the border, civil defense brigades were moving through the city looking for signs of damage.</p><p>Didier Solares, an official with Suchiate’s Civil Defense agency, said so far they had not found damage. </p>



<p>“Luckily, everything is good,” Solares said. “We are talking with companies, to the (rural areas) via radio and there’s nothing, there’s no damage thank God,” he said. </p><p>The early morning quake still gave people a fright.</p>
    
<p>In the mountainous and picturesque colonial city of San Cristobal, the shaking was strong.</p><p>“Here we got up because we have the seismic alert service,” said resident Joaquin Morales. “The alert woke me up because it comes 30 seconds before (the quake).” </p><p>In Tuxtla Chico, a town near Tapachula, María Guzmán, a teacher said: “It was horrible, it felt strong. It was a real scare.”</p><p>Later Sunday, there was a swarm of at least two dozen small earthquakes in Mexico’s northern state of Baja California, near the U.S. border. The largest of the quakes was of 4.6 magnitude, while the majority were between between 2.5 and 3.7.</p><p>No immediate damage was reported in the sparsely populated region roughly 30 miles ( 50 kilometers) south of a relatively unpopulated area south of El Centro, California.</p><p>They did not appear related to the quake in Suchiate, which is almost 2,330 miles (3,750 kilometers) to the southeast.</p>

    <div><section class="content__body"><p><strong><em>The following is a transcript of an interview with Secretary of State Antony Blinken that aired on May 12, 2024.</em></strong></p><hr><p>MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face the Nation. We are learning more about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza as thousands are fleeing what was once a safe zone, the southern city of Rafah. The challenges facing the Biden administration, from a diplomatic standpoint continue to grow too. Although the U.S. supports Israel's right to retaliate against Hamas for the brutal October 7 attack that killed more than 1,200 people. There are deep concerns about the Palestinian death toll, as even Prime Minister Netanyahu conceded that his forces have in fact killed more civilians than members of Hamas. We begin this morning with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who joins us from the State Department. Good morning, Mr. Secretary. I know military experts say Gaza is as complicated and challenging a battlefield as any modern warfare has seen. But back in December, President Biden said Israel conducted indiscriminate bombing. In February, he said Israel's offensive was over the top. And then this past week, he was asked on CNN about pausing the delivery of 3,500 bombs. Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p>    
  <p>PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers. I made it clear that if they go into Rafah…I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah- to deal with the cities to deal with that problem.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>

    </p>
<p>MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, is Israel living up to international humanitarian law standards?</p><p>SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY BLINKEN: Well first Margaret, good morning, and as you know, we put out a full report on that. But let me say this from the start. From day one, President Biden has been determined to support Israel in defending itself and trying to make sure that October 7 never happens again. At the same time, he's been very clear that in doing that, it's imperative that Israel protect civilians, and make sure that humanitarian assistance gets to those who need it. And that's what we've been doing from day one. The report that- that we put out, lays out some of the concerns that we've had throughout this period when it comes to humanitarian assistance, particularly the early months after October 7. And when it comes to the use of weapons, concerns about incidents where given the totality of the damage that's been done to children, women, men, it was reasonable to assess that, in certain instances, Israel acted in ways that are not consistent with international humanitarian law. It's also critical to note that Israel itself has accountability processes to get at this. There are hundreds of ongoing inquiries looking at different incidents that have taken place since October 7. There are criminal investigations that are going forward unlike most other countries in the world, Israel has the ability, the means and the actions to self correct. But we've been on this every single day.</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have been able then to conclude that Israel has violated US laws and weapons sharing agreements?</p><p>SECRETARY BLINKEN: No. We've concluded is in the case of the the use of weapons, as you said, this is an extraordinarily complex military environment in which you have an enemy, Hamas, that committed the most atrocious terrorist attacks on Israel, October 7, and then retreats to Gaza, hides behind and underneath civilians, in hospitals, schools, mosques, apartment buildings. And that makes it very difficult to determine, particularly in the midst of war, exactly what happened and to draw any final conclusions from any one incident. So we have a number of incidents that we continue to look at, to try to get the best possible assessment. The Israelis themselves are doing the same thing. Our assessments will be ongoing. But as I said, given the totality of what we've seen in terms of civilian suffering, in terms of children, women, men caught in this crossfire Hamas is making who've been killed or been injured. It's reasonable to assess that in a number of instances. Israel has not acted in a manner that's consistent with international humanitarian law.</p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'>
    </p>
<p>MARGARET BRENNAN: So I understand you're still collecting evidence but on the policy, can you clarify? Because even the lead Democrat on House Armed Services says it's not clear. Is the US slowing down the delivery of any weapons to Israel at this point beyond the 3,500 so-called dumb bombs?</p><p>SECRETARY BLINKEN: So let me be clear about this too. First, just to take a step back, no president- no president has done more To defend Israel when it really mattered than Joe Biden. He was there in Israel in the days after October 7, the first American President to go to Israel in the midst of a war. When Iran mounted an unprecedented attack on Israel launching 300 projectiles, including ballistic missiles, the United States for the first time ever participated in Israel's active defense. And we brought together a coalition of countries to defend against the Iranian attack. But we've also been very clear over many months now about our concerns about a major military operation in Rafah. As you know, Margaret, most of the population from Gaza, displaced from the north, and from Central Gaza, has gone to Rafah, there are about 1.4 million people there. And we said to Israel that we cannot, will not support an operation in Rafah, a major military operation, in the absence of a credible plan to protect civilians.</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN: -- and they still haven't delivered.</p><p>SECRETARY BLINKEN:-- We have not seen that plan. We have not seen that plan--</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So- So are you following the delivery of any weapons beyond these 3500 bombs? Are you pausing, for example, precision munitions as some Republicans have claimed?</p><p>SECRETARY BLINKEN: The answer to that- the answer that is no. What the President said, and what he's been clear about, in private conversations with the Israelis, which unfortunately, leaked to the press, so the President responded forthrightly when he was asked about it. But what we've been clear about is that if Israel launches this major military operation to Rafah, then there's certain systems that we're not going to be supporting and supplying for that operation. But at present, the only thing that we've delayed and are holding back are these high payload bombs, because we're in an ongoing conversation with Israel, given the impact that those weapons can have, when they're used in densely populated areas, including an area like Rafah--</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So you still might deliver them?</p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'>
    </p>
<p>SECRETARY BLINKEN: So we're in an active conversation with Israel about that. We have real concerns about the way they're used. But here's something else that is critically important, Margaret. We believe two things. One, you have to have a clear, credible plan to protect civilians, which we haven't seen. Second, we also need to see a plan for what happens after this conflict in Gaza is open- is over. And we still haven't seen that because what are we seeing right now? We're seeing parts of Gaza that Israel has- has cleared of Hamas, where Hamas is coming back, including in the North, including in Khan Younis. As we look at- at Rafah, they may go in and have some initial success, but- but potentially at an incredibly high cost to civilians, but one that is not durable, one that's not sustainable. And they will be left holding the bag on an enduring insurgency because a lot of armed Hamas will be left no matter what they do in Rafah. Or if they- if they leave and get out of Gaza as we believe they need to do, then you're going to have a vacuum and a vacuum that's likely to be filled by chaos by anarchy, and ultimately by Hamas again. So we've been working for many, many weeks on developing credible plans for security, for governance, for rebuilding. We haven't seen that come from Israel, we've been working with Arab countries and others on that plan. We need to see that too. We have the same objective as Israel. We want to make sure that Hamas cannot govern Gaza again. We want to make sure it's demilitarized. We want to make sure that Israel gets its leaders. That's what we're determining. We have a different way. And we think a more effective, durable way of getting that done. We remain in conversation with Israel about exactly that.</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, your national security memorandum that you signed, says Israeli civilian harm mitigation efforts are quote "inconsistent, ineffective and inadequate." The prime minister himself said Israel assesses the IDF killed 14,000 terrorists and 16,000 civilians. Does the U.S. share the Israeli assessment that more civilians have been killed than actual terrorists?  </p><p>SECRETARY BLINKEN: Yes, we do and I think the report makes clear that while Israel has processes, procedures, rules, regulations to try to minimize civilian harm, given the impact that this operation, this war in Gaza has had on the civilian population–</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN: And yet, you're still surging weapons to Israel.</p><p>SECRETARY BLINKEN: – that those have not been- those have not been applied consistently and effectively. There's a gap between the stated intent and some of the results we've seen, but because it's so complicated, in the midst of a war, and particularly in the midst of a war where you have an enemy that hides in civilian infrastructure, hides behind civilians, to make final determinations on these individual incidents. We're looking at the totality of what's happened. We think it's reasonable to assess based on what's happened, that there have been acts that have been inconsistent with Israel's obligations under international humanitarian law, but we haven't drawn definitive conclusions. We need to pursue these investigations, just as Israel is doing itself.</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I have so many more questions about this, but I have to also ask you about Ukraine because Russia is making this push, as you know, into Kharkiv and the White House says that Russia is expected to increase troop levels. Is this the reality? Is this the cost of the delay in the U.S. delivering weapons to those frontlines?</p><p>SECRETARY BLINKEN: Look, there's no- there's no doubt there's been a cost in the months-long delay in getting the supplementary budget request approved and the equipment sent out to- to Ukraine. Just this week, we did a drawdown of about $400 million in defense equipment for Ukraine coming from the supplemental. So we're doing everything we can to rush this assistance out there. Europeans are doing the same. Look, I'm convinced that Ukraine can effectively hold the line in the east, it can continue to press the advantages achieved for itself in the Black Sea, where it's getting as much out through the Black Sea, feeding the world as it did before the Russian re-invasion of Ukraine, as well as to hold Russian forces at risk, including in Crimea to make it more difficult for them to continue this aggression. We've been providing the systems to do that, but it's a challenging moment. We are not going anywhere, and neither are more than some 50 countries that are supporting Ukraine. That will continue and if Putin thinks he can outlast Ukraine, outlast its supporters. He's wrong.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The flow of aid into Gaza has almost entirely dried up in the past week, according to the United Nations, following the closure of two border crossings by Israel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The closures were implemented in response to a Hamas rocket attack near Kerem Shalom and an Israeli military operation against Hamas in Rafah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The closure of the border crossings has reduced the number of aid trucks entering Gaza by about 75% since October, contributing to a cumulative food deficit that is expected to worsen a looming famine in the territory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aid groups are in desperate need of a drastic increase in the amount of food, medicine, and other goods entering Gaza to address the humanitarian crisis, with estimates suggesting that around 300,000 liters of fuel are needed daily for humanitarian purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The near-total stoppage of aid has exacerbated the situation, leaving only a few sporadic deliveries, including six trucks of flour and some fuel, which have not been enough to mitigate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

    <div><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The flow of aid into Gaza has almost entirely dried up in the past week, according to the United Nations, at a time when humanitarian agencies say the enclave needs a drastic increase in the amount of food, medicine and other goods to tackle a looming famine.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Since the start of the war, most aid for Gaza has entered through two border crossings in the southern end of the territory. Israel shut down one of those, Kerem Shalom, after a <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/05/world/middleeast/hamas-rocket-kerem-shalom-israel.html" title="">Hamas rocket attack</a> nearby killed four Israeli soldiers on May 5. The next day, Israel’s military seized and closed the second, in Rafah, on the Egyptian border, as part of what it called a “limited operation” against Hamas, bringing the flow of aid to <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/world/middleeast/israel-egypt-gaza-aid.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">a near-total stop</a>.</p><div class="css-1dv1kvn"><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Six trucks of flour arrived through the Kerem Shalom crossing on Saturday, and on Friday, some fuel also came through the same crossing point, according to Juliette Touma, the communications director for the main U.N. agency that aids Palestinians, UNRWA. She said that no other supplies arrived through Kerem Shalom this past week and that the Rafah crossing remained closed.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">“That’s all since May 6,” Ms. Touma said in a text message. “Basically nothing.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The Israeli agency that coordinates aid to Palestinians, COGAT, said on Sunday that Israel was “operating to enable the flow of aid to Rafah” through a road that runs through part of the length of the enclave. It did not provide additional details.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The extremely limited amount of aid will almost certainly aggravate a cumulative food deficit that has built up in the past seven months.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Before the war began last October, about 500 aid trucks and additional commercial trucks a day carried supplies into Gaza. But the number entering the territory through the two main border crossings has fallen by about 75 percent since Oct. 7, according to the United Nations. Some food has also been delivered by air and sea and, more recently, through the Erez border crossing in northern Gaza, but aid groups say it is insufficient to make up for the deficit at the main border crossings.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">At the same time, Ms. Touma said that around 300,000 liters of fuel is needed per day for all humanitarian purposes, including to run generators in hospitals and relief operations. Aid groups said last week that they had just a few days of <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/world/middleeast/un-officials-warn-that-aid-efforts-face-imminent-threat-from-lack-of-fuel.html" title="">fuel stocks</a> left.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Only 157,000 liters of fuel entered Gaza on Friday, Ms. Touma said. COGAT put the figure at 200,000 liters. The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">“At this desperate moment, exacerbated by acts impeding the entry of humanitarian aid in Gaza through the three crossings, there is a dire shortage of fuel, which is hindering everything,” Volker Türk, the U.N.’s high commissioner for human rights, <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2024/05/comment-un-high-commissioner-human-rights-volker-turk-gaza" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> on Sunday.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Israel’s military said that Hamas’s deadly rocket attack toward Kerem Shalom last Sunday was launched from the area of Rafah, in southern Gaza. When Israel’s military captured the Rafah border crossing last week, it told people to evacuate from the east of the city. Since then, the military has expanded the evacuation orders.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Mr. Türk said that he could “see no way” that the latest evacuation order imposed on civilians in Rafah “can be reconciled with the binding requirements of international humanitarian law.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">In Nuseirat, in central Gaza, the local authorities were bracing for a potential public health crisis, the town’s mayor, Iyad Maghari, said in a statement released on Sunday by Gaza’s government press office.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Mr. Maghari said the municipality had only 48 hours worth of fuel left and would soon have to halt what few services remained after seven months of war.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">“We call on all U.N. organizations to intervene urgently and quickly to supply the fuel necessary to operate water wells, sewage pumps and waste collection,” Mr. Maghari said in the statement, adding that otherwise Nuseirat could soon see “sewage overflowing and waste piling up in the streets.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">One reason for the overall hold up in aid is that Egypt, where most of the assistance for Gaza is collected and loaded, is refusing to allow trucks from the Rafah crossing to drive on to Kerem Shalom, <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/world/middleeast/israel-egypt-gaza-aid.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">according to two U.S. officials and a Western official who are involved in the aid operation</a>, as well as two Israeli officials with knowledge of the situation. The American and Israeli officials say they believe Egypt is trying to pressure Israel to pull back its forces from Rafah.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">After rocket sirens sounded in the area of Kerem Shalom again on Sunday, Israel’s military said that two launches from Rafah had been intercepted by air defenses.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-1smqmx3 etfikam0">Liam Stack contributed reporting.</p></div></div>

<p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">It’s been a busy weekend for union organizing efforts at U.S. Apple stores, with the union at one store voting to authorize a strike, while workers at another store voted against forming a union.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Back in 2022, workers in Towson, Maryland became <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/18/apple-store-union-maryland-win-vote/">the first formally recognized union at an Apple retail store</a>. That union, which is part of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, voted Saturday to <a href="https://www.goiam.org/news/iam-core-members-at-first-unionized-u-s-apple-retail-store-vote-to-authorize-strike/">authorize a strike</a>. The date of this potential strike has yet to be determined.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“This vote today is the first step in demonstrating our solidarity and sends a clear message to Apple,” said the IAM CORE Negotiating Committee in a statement. “The passage of the strike sanction vote highlights IAM CORE’s unwavering commitment to advocating for the rights and well-being of workers in the face of challenges. As discussions with Apple management continue, we remain committed to securing tangible improvements that benefit all employees.”</p>

	
	


	
	


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The union says it has been negotiating with Apple since January 2023 over issues including work-life balance, unpredictable scheduling, and wages.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“We deeply value our team members and we’re proud to provide them with industry leading compensation and exceptional benefits,” an Apple spokesperson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-12/apple-store-in-new-jersey-votes-against-unionizing-cwa-says">told Bloomberg</a>. “As always, we will engage with the union representing our team in Towson respectfully and in good faith.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bloomberg also reported that a vote to unionize a Short Hills, New Jersey store with the Communication Workers of America has failed. Before the vote, the CWA <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-charges-apple-additional-labor-law-violations">filed an unfair labor practice charge</a> against Apple for allegedly retaliating against one of the organizers at the store by scheduling “unprecedented multiple meetings with his supervisor and denying requests for leave.”</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Earlier this week, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-06/apple-illegally-interrogated-nyc-retail-staff-us-labor-board-rules?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxNTE3NjcxNiwiZXhwIjoxNzE1NzgxNTE2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTRDMwVThEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIyMUUyRjFBQUYzNjA0MDM1ODU2MTZFOEY2NzI5RUJDNSJ9.ERcJ18ESl-5on5xFFydEHY1r0K5NebWB-7KI9-cXsSo"> Apple violated federal labor laws</a> in 2022 by confiscating union flyers and interrogating staff about unionizing efforts at the Apple store in New York’s World Trade Center.</p>
