<p>“What I was doing, I was doing at the direction of and benefit of Mr. Trump,” Cohen testified.</p><p>Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied having sexual encounters with the two women.</p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/michael-cohen">Cohen</a></span> is by far the prosecution’s most important witness, and though his testimony lacked the electricity that defined Daniels’ turn on the stand last week, he nonetheless linked Trump directly to the payments and helped illuminate some of the drier evidence such as text messages and phone logs that jurors had previously seen.</p>




    

<p>The testimony of a witness with such intimate knowledge of Trump’s activities could heighten the legal exposure of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee if jurors deem him sufficiently credible. But prosecutors’ reliance on a witness with such a checkered past — <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-michael-cohen-74aaf72511d64fceb1d64529207bde64">Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payments</a></span> — also carries sizable risks with a jury and could be a boon to Trump politically as he fundraises off his legal woes and paints the case as the product of a tainted criminal justice system.</p><p>The men, once so close that Cohen boasted that he would “take a bullet” for Trump, had no visible interaction inside the courtroom. The sedate atmosphere was a marked contrast from their last courtroom faceoff, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-michael-cohen-fraud-lawsuit-7f6e536e97d77ef1cd441e4d5ec41ee4">when Trump walked out of the courtroom</a></span> in October after his lawyer finished questioning Cohen during his civil fraud trial.</p><p>This time around, Trump sat at the defense table with his eyes closed for long stretches of testimony as Cohen recounted his decade-long career as a senior Trump Organization executive, doing work that by his own admission sometimes involved lying and bullying others on his boss’s behalf.</p>
    

<p>Jurors had previously heard from others about the tabloid industry practice of “catch-and-kill,” in which rights to a story are purchased so that it can then be quashed. But Cohen’s testimony, which continues Tuesday, is crucial to prosecutors because of his direct communication with the then-candidate about embarrassing stories he was scrambling to suppress.</p><p>Cohen also matters because the reimbursements he received from a $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels, which prosecutors say was meant to buy her silence in advance of the election, form the basis of 34 felony counts charging Trump with falsifying business records. Prosecutors say the reimbursements were logged, falsely, as legal expenses to conceal the payments’ true purpose. Defense lawyers say the payments to Cohen were properly categorized as legal expenses.</p><p>Under questioning from a prosecutor, Cohen detailed the steps he took to mask the payments. When he opened a bank account to pay Daniels, an action he said he told Trump he was taking, he told the bank it was for a new limited liability corporation but withheld the actual purpose.</p>
    

<p>“I’m not sure they would’ve opened it,” he said, if they knew it was ”to pay off an adult film star for a nondisclosure agreement.”</p><p>To establish Trump’s familiarity with the payments, Cohen told the jury that Trump had promised to reimburse him. The two men even discussed with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/weisselberg-trump-perjury-new-york-b76cde56c6cb983ab8789f95d5a0c6c0">Allen Weisselberg, a former Trump Organization chief financial officer</a></span>, how the reimbursements would be paid as legal services over monthly installments, Cohen testified.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP correspondent Eric Tucker reports Michael Cohen is really important to the hush money case against Donald Trump.</p>
    
</div><p>Trump checked in with Pecker about the matter, asking him how “things were going” with it, Cohen said. Pecker responded, ‘We have this under control, and we’ll take care of this,” Cohen testified.</p><p>Cohen also said he was with Trump as Trump spoke to Pecker on a speakerphone in his Trump Tower office.</p><p>“David had stated that it’s going to cost them $150,000 to control the story,” Cohen said. He quoted Trump as saying: “No problem, I will take care of it,” which Cohen interpreted to mean that the payment would be reimbursed.</p><p>To lay the foundation that the deals were done with Trump’s endorsement, prosecutors elicited testimony from Cohen designed to show Trump as a hands-on manager. Acting on Trump’s behalf, Cohen said, he sometimes lied and bullied others, including reporters.</p><p>“When he would task you with something, he would then say, ‘Keep me informed. Let me know what’s going on,’” Cohen testified. He said that was especially true “if there was a matter that was troubling to him.”</p><p>Defense lawyers have teed up a bruising cross-examination of Cohen, telling jurors during opening statements that he’s an “admitted liar” with an “obsession to get President Trump.”</p><p>Prosecutors aim to blunt those attacks by acknowledging Cohen’s past crimes to jurors and by relying on other witnesses whose accounts, they hope, will buttress Cohen’s testimony.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>A part of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore was deliberately destroyed with controlled explosions on Monday, clearing the way for the full return of shipping to one of the busiest sea routes in the US.</li>
<li>The bridge had collapsed on March 26 after a cargo ship, the Dali, struck it, causing six construction workers to lose their lives.</li>
<li>The controlled demolition broke apart chunks of the collapsed bridge, with authorities confirming that the operation went according to plan.</li>
<li>The Dali remained at the scene since the accident and has been covered in scrap metal from the bridge, with 21 crew members still on board maintaining the vessel.</li>
<li>The demolition took place after the body of the sixth and last victim of the incident was recovered last week, and the operation was delayed over the weekend due to bad weather.</li>

The White House, in tandem with other countries, has also increased pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to form a plan to address the humanitarian crisis caused by the war, and for the so-called "day after," to figure out who or what will replace Hamas as Gaza's governing body.</p>    
  <h2>Pressure mounts on Netanyahu</h2><p>The Biden administration cautioned again over the weekend that Israel needs an exit plan for the war, and that even if Hamas can be defeated, without a viable alternative to govern Gaza, the group long designated by both Israel and the U.S. as a terrorist organization could stage a comeback.</p><figure class="embed embed--type-video embed--type-content_video is-video embed--float-left embed--size-medium ">

    </p>
<p>Very public cracks are now appearing between Israel's government and its military, meanwhile. Senior military officials have started openly demanding that Netanyahu decide what will replace Hamas to run Gaza — saying if that isn't determined, Israeli forces could wind up stuck there.</p><p>Many Israeli troops' families have similar concerns. Over the weekend, a letter signed by 600 family members of current IDF soldiers called on Netanyahu's government to forego a Rafah ground assault, warning that it "could be no less than a death trap."</p><p>"Any reasonable person understands that when they have been announcing and warning for months about entering Rafah, there are those who are working to prepare the ground and harm the forces there," the families warned in the letter.</p><p>The Biden administration has made it clear it will not supply weapons for what it considers an ill-advised full-scale military operation in Rafah, but Netanyahu has refused to back down from his vow to carry out that assault, saying there are several Hamas battalions holed up in the city.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Thousands protest against "Kremlin-style" foreign influence law</strong>: Thousands of people took to the streets of Tbilisi, Georgia, to protest a proposed law that would require non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to register as "pursuing the interests of a foreign power" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Police clash with protesters, hundreds detained</strong>: The protest turned violent, with police using tear gas and water cannons against the protesters. The Interior Ministry reported that 20 people were detained, including two American citizens and one Russian national.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Government faces backlash over proposed law</strong>: Critics of the law, including some in the West, have accused the Georgian government of trying to emulate Russia's authoritarian tactics. Russia has used similar legislation to crack down on independent media and activists critical of the Kremlin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investigation launched into police use of force</strong>: In response to the violence, Georgia's Special Investigation Service launched an investigation into the alleged use of "excessive force" by law enforcement against the protesters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Controversial bill aims to regulate NGOs</strong>: The proposed law, which is expected to pass, would require NGOs to register as "pursuing the interests of a foreign power" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad. The law has sparked concerns about government crackdown on civil society and freedom of speech.</p>

<p>Vovchansk, among the largest towns in the area whose pre-war population of 17,000 had dwindled to just 2,500 before Russia renewed its ground assault last week, has emerged as a key focus of the pitched battles engulfing the Kharkiv region. By Monday, only 200 to 300 residents remained, said Kharkiv Gov. Oleh Syniehubov, as Russian forces closed in from three sides. </p>

<p>That makes this period a window of opportunity for Moscow and one of the most dangerous for Kyiv in the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">two-year war</a></span>, they said. By intensifying offensive operations, Russia seeks to stretch Ukraine’s forces thin and forge breakthroughs. </p><p>Russian forces claimed to have taken an additional 90 square kilometers (35 square miles), which has not been independently confirmed. </p><p>Opening a new front from two points along the border with the Russian region of Belgorod was the easiest tactic to pin down and divert Ukrainian forces from heavy battles raging in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Russia’s most sought-after prize. </p>
    

<p>“The enemy identified the most geographically convenient place ... the state border line,” said Yurii Federenko, commander of the ACHILLES battalion of the 92nd brigade. His unit was among others rotated into the northeast from the Donetsk region to stabilize the northeast front, he said. </p><p>He fears a similar front may be opened in the Sumy region, which also shares a border with Russia.</p><p>The string of villages captured along the contested gray zone, where enemy shelling precludes the building of fortifications, were also the easiest for Moscow’s forces to nab. Their momentum will likely slow as they approach better fortified settlements, Ukrainian commanders said. </p><p>Small batches of U.S. military aid have started to trickle into the front line in the form of much needed artillery, said Federenko, whose unit received some of the aid. But it will take at least two months before incoming supplies will meet Kyiv’s needs to hold the line, he said. Until they arrive, Ukraine won’t be able to seize the battlefield initiative, he said. </p>
    

<p>“They now have an opportunity to attack us while we cannot properly reply,” he said. </p><p>Russia’s offensive seeks to take advantage of this window of time. “In order to achieve success, in my opinion, in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the enemy needed to spread ... our defense forces. Accordingly, the enemy started the campaign in Kharkiv region specifically,” Federenko said. </p><p>Top Biden administration officials and Ukrainian national security officials held a 90-minute call on Monday to discuss the situation on the ground in Ukraine as Russia intensifies its bombardment around Kharkiv.</p><p>National security adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, and Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff spoke with Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, and head of the office the president Andriy Yermak, according to Sullivan.</p><p>“It was a detailed conversation about the situation on the front, about the capabilities that they are most in need of, and a real triage effort to say, ’Get us this stuff this fast so that we can be in a position to effectively defend against the Russian onslaught,” Sullivan told reporters at a White House briefing.</p>
    

<p>Sullivan added that a new influx of U.S. weaponry for Kyiv was expected to be announced by the U.S. administration in the coming days.</p><p>The Kharkiv incursion has effectively pinned Ukrainian forces in the region, while potentially drawing precious reserves away from heavy battles in the Avdiivka and Chasiv Yar areas of the Donetsk region, where Russia’s advance has been far more significant and strategically important.</p><p>Ukrainian local officials said they feared Vovchansk’s fate may mirror that of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, Ukrainian cities where fierce fighting and scorched earth tactics forced Ukrainian withdrawals. </p>
    

<p>Russian forces were inching closer to Vovchansk, and heavy battles were ongoing on the town’s outskirts. Using assault infantry units Russian forces are attempting to secure positions in three directions, as Ukrainian forces attempt to dislodge them using firepower. Ukrainian commanders describe the battles as dynamic and complicated.</p><p>Russian troops have so far entrenched themselves in the villages of Strilecha, Pylna, Borysivka, Krasne, Oliynykove, Mrakovets, Pletenivka, and from there were launching attacks near Hlyboke Zelene Hatysche, and Buchansk.</p><p>The capture of the Donetsk city of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-avdiivka-2e827b4cae4698b3f6b80a421447fab8">Avdiivka</a></span> in February opened a door for the Kremlin’s troops to push westward, deeper into Donetsk. Russia illegally annexed Donetsk and three other regions in 2022 shortly after it invaded Ukraine, and taking control of all of Donetsk is one of the Kremlin’s main war goals.</p><p>If Ukraine isn’t able to halt Moscow’s advance, it could create conditions for a possible attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. </p><p>It could also create a “buffer zone” to protect Belgorod, where frequent Ukrainian attacks have embarrassed the Kremlin.

<ol>
<li><strong>Rishi Sunak attacks Keir Starmer on defence</strong>: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has launched a attack on Labour leader Keir Starmer, claiming that a Labour government would make the UK less safe.</li>
<li><strong>Defence spending</strong>: Sunak accused Labour of not matching his pledges on defence spending, including a commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2030.</li>
<li><strong>Labour's response</strong>: Labour has said it would meet the same 2.5% target when conditions allow, and accused the Conservative government of "hollowing out" the armed forces and "wasting billions of pounds on procurement".</li>
<li><strong>Government's plan</strong>: The Conservative government has said it plans to meet its 2.5% pledge by shrinking the size of the civil service, but think tanks have warned that the spending would need to come from cuts to other departments.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill, the man behind the GameStop meme stock craze, appeared online for the first time in three years, causing a surge in the price of GameStop shares.</li>
<li>Gill posted a tweet showing a meme used by gamers when things get serious, followed by a YouTube video he made in the past summarizing his "bull case" for GameStop.</li>
<li>GameStop shares rose more than 74% on the news, with the stock being halted eight times due to volatility. Other meme stocks like AMC Entertainment Holdings also saw significant gains.</li>
<li>The surge in GameStop shares suggests that Gill may have reignited the "short squeeze" phenomenon, where hedge funds who had bet against the company are forced to buy back shares to offset their losses.</li>
<li>Gill's online appearance comes three years after he became a cause célèbre for sparking a David vs. Goliath battle between individual investors and large hedge funds, resulting in a significant increase in GameStop's stock price.</li>

                                        <p>The man at the center of the pandemic meme stock craze appeared online for the first time in three years, sending the prices of the quirky and volatile shares sharply higher Monday. </p><p>Keith Gill, better known as “Roaring Kitty,” posted an image Sunday on the social platform X of a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1789807772542067105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">man sitting forward in his chair</a></span>, a meme used by gamers when things are getting serious. </p><p>He followed that tweet with a YouTube video from years before when he championed the beleaguered company GameStop saying, “That’s all for now cuz I’m out of breath. FYI here’s a quick 4min video I put together to summarize the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&amp;src=cashtag_click" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$GME</a></span> bull case.”</p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/business-bf7f6f6155a9ebf107430806d806330a">GameStop</a></span> in 2021 was a video game retailer that was struggling to survive as consumers switched rapidly from discs to digital downloads. Big Wall Street hedge funds and major investors were betting against it, or shorting its stock, believing that its shares would continue on a drastically downward trend. </p>
    

<p>Gill and those who agreed with him changed the trajectory of a company that appeared to headed for bankruptcy by buying up thousands of GameStop shares in the face of almost any accepted metrics that told investors that the company was in serious trouble. </p>

<p>That began what is known as a “short squeeze,” when those big investors that had bet against GameStop were forced to buy its rapidly rising stock to offset their massive losses. </p><p>At Monday’s opening bell it appeared that Gill had reignited the phenomenon as shares of GameStop more than doubled. They closed Monday up 74%. It’s the biggest intraday trading jump for GameStop since the meme craze of early 2021. Other meme stocks like the theater chain AMC were jolted higher as well. </p>
    
<p>Trading in GameStop was halted eight times before noon on Monday due to volatility. </p><p>Gill became a cause célèbre in 2021 after his posts on the Reddit subcategory Wallstreetbets ignited a David vs. Goliath battle with large hedge funds that were betting heavily against the survival of GameStop. </p>
    

<p>The small guys won, at least for a while, driving shares of GameStop up more than 1,000% in 2021 and other meme stocks as well. The struggling movie theater chain AMC jumped 2,300% in a very short span of time in the same year. </p><p>Some big traders posted colossal losses as GameStop raced from less than $20, to close to $400 each. Citron Research, Melvin Capital and other well-known hedge funds <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/business-97934416d32c66b0d8f958d13a75fb62">lost an estimated $5 billion</a></span>, according to analytics firm S3 Partners. </p><p>Some of those new and smaller investors believed, at least in part, that Ryan Cohen, co-founder of Chewy.com, could push the traditional retailer in a more online direction. Cohen built up a stake in GameStop before eventually joining the board and last year <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gamestop-cohen-ceo-meme-703d0652b751544d66e5fbe6cd2d7945">becoming its CEO</a></span>. </p><p>Joining the meme surge Monday was AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., which leapt 78%. Koss Corp. a headphone manufacturer, spiked 37% and BlackBerry, the one time dominant smartphone maker, rose 7%. The retailer Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, another meme stock, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bed-bath-beyond-bankruptcy-filing-a597c1013b2f641b7b32e87ad81be6d8">sought bankruptcy protection</a></span> last year. </p><p>Some meme stocks, including GameStop and AMC, had been climbing earlier this month, and rapidly.</p>
    

<p>Shares of GameStop Corp., which have faded steadily since 2021, had already risen 57% this month. In January, GameStop reported its first annual profit since 2018, although it’s still unclear if Cohen’s turnaround plan will succeed. </p><p>AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., had risen 10% over the past 30 days. </p><p>Those companies broke out Monday following Gill’s tweet. </p><p>The dynamics of the market as far as companies like GameStop are concerned have changed, however. </p><p>When Gill and an online army of retail investors began buying up shares of GameStop, more than 140% of the company’s tradeable shares were being shorted. You arrive at that distorted number because some traders were borrowing against already shorted stocks to build even bigger bets against the company, vastly increasing their losses when the stock began to climb. </p><p>The short positions against GameStop’s tradable shares now stand just over 24%, slightly more than the 22.5% recorded in January. </p>
    

<p>Gill reaped a big profit investing in a troubled video-game company, but denied when he <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/keith-gill-roaring-kitty-gamestop-fee89914ac530675c0017a485b6aa8ee">appeared virtually at a Congressional hearing</a></span> that he used social media to drive up GameStop’s stock price. </p><p>He told lawmakers at the time simply, “I like the stock.” </p><p>As Roaring Kitty, Gill had vanished from messaging boards after posting a video in June 2021 of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1406054126555967495" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kittens going to sleep</a></span>. </p><p>The story of Roaring Kitty and the meme stock craze was <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/dumb-money-gamestop-stock-meme-movie-70d3395c7069c4192f261b88ca476fca">turned into a movie</a></span> last year called “Dumb Money.” </p>
