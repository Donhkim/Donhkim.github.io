a clear rebuke of some Israeli operations in Gaza, it stopped short of definitively saying that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) campaign had breached international law.</p></div><div

that Israel did not fully co-operate with US efforts to "maximise" humanitarian aid into Gaza in the initial months of the conflict.

                                        <p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — An unusually strong solar storm hitting Earth could produce northern lights in the U.S. this weekend and potentially disrupt power and communications.</p><p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a rare severe geomagnetic storm warning when a solar outburst reached Earth on Friday afternoon, hours sooner than anticipated. The effects were due to last through the weekend and possibly into next week.</p>



<p>NOAA alerted operators of power plants and spacecraft in orbit to take precautions, as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p><p>“For most people here on planet Earth, they won’t have to do anything,” said Rob Steenburgh, a scientist with NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center.</p><div class="AudioEnhancement" data-separate-event="audioModule" data-separate-value="AP AUDIO: Strong solar storm could disrupt communications and produce northern lights in US" data-module="" data-gtm-region="AP AUDIO: Strong solar storm could disrupt communications and produce northern lights in US" data-align-center="" data-module-number="2" data-main-module-number="2">

        AP AUDIO: Strong solar storm could disrupt communications and produce northern lights in US
    </h1>
    
    
    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP correspondent Shelley Adler reports a solar storm may have an effect on the U.S.</p>
    
</div><p>The storm could produce northern lights as far south in the U.S. as Alabama and Northern California, according to NOAA. But it was hard to predict and experts stressed it would not be the dramatic curtains of color normally associated with the northern lights, but more like splashes of greenish hues.</p>
    

<p>“That’s really the gift from space weather — the aurora,” said Steenburgh. He and his colleagues said the best aurora views may come from phone cameras, which are better at capturing light than the naked eye.</p><p>Snap a picture of the sky and “there might be actually a nice little treat there for you,” said Mike Bettwy, operations chief for the prediction center.</p>
    
<p>The most intense solar storm in recorded history, in 1859, prompted auroras in central America and possibly even Hawaii. “We are not anticipating that” but it could come close, said NOAA space weather forecaster Shawn Dahl.</p><p>This storm — ranked 4 on a scale of 1 to 5 — poses a risk for high-voltage transmission lines for power grids, not the electrical lines ordinarily found in people’s homes, Dahl told reporters. Satellites also could be affected, which in turn could disrupt navigation and communication services here on Earth.</p>
    

<p>An extreme geomagnetic storm in 2003, for example, took out power in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa.</p><p>Even when the storm is over, signals between GPS satellites and ground receivers could be scrambled or lost, according to NOAA. But there are so many navigation satellites that any outages should not last long, Steenburgh noted.</p><p>The sun has produced strong solar flares since Wednesday, resulting in at least seven outbursts of plasma. Each eruption — known as a coronal mass ejection — can contain billions of tons of plasma and magnetic field from the sun’s outer atmosphere, or corona.</p><p>The flares seem to be associated with a sunspot that’s 16 times the diameter of Earth, according to NOAA. It’s all part of the solar activity that’s ramping up as the sun approaches the peak of its 11-year cycle.</p><p>NASA said the storm posed no serious threat to the seven astronauts aboard the International Space Station. The biggest concern is the increased radiation levels, and the crew could move to a better shielded part of the station if necessary, according to Steenburgh.</p>
    

<p>Increased radiation also could threaten some of NASA’s science satellites. Extremely sensitive instruments will be turned off, if necessary, to avoid damage, said Antti Pulkkinen, director of the space agency’s heliophysics science division.</p><p>Several sun-focused spacecraft are monitoring all the action.</p><p>“This is exactly the kinds of things we want to observe,” Pulkkinen said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

<ol>
<li>The trial of Donald Trump for allegedly violating campaign finance laws has concluded for the week, with more witness testimony heard in court.</li>
<li>The trial is related to allegations that Trump paid hush money to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in the weeks leading up to the 2016 presidential election.</li>
<li>The trial is being held in a federal court in Manhattan and is expected to continue for several weeks.</li>
<li>The prosecution claims that Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, arranged the payments and that Trump was aware of them. The defense argues that the payments were not intended to influence the election.</li>
<li>The trial has attracted widespread media attention and is seen as a test of the justice system's ability to hold public figures accountable for their actions.</li>

                                        <p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California’s budget deficit is at least $45 billion, a shortfall so large it prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday to propose painful spending cuts impacting immigrants, kindergarteners and low-income parents seeking child care in a state often lauded for having the world’s fifth-largest economy.</p><p>Officially, Newsom said the state’s deficit is $27.6 billion. But really, it’s closer to $45 billion when including <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/california-budget-deficit-gavin-newsom-09507c2b312e454baa50d38c94218a1d">previous spending reductions</a></span> that Newsom and the state Legislature agreed to in March. Including reductions in public education spending, which Newsom has not included, the deficit would be even billions of dollars more, according to recent analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office.</p><p>The size of the deficit is important as it will shape the national perspectives of Newsom, who is a top surrogate for President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign and who is widely believed to harbor presidential aspirations of his own. Newsom has spent much of his time in office basking in the glow of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-california-gavin-newsom-5aa5ab19800a5e91c209ff1268ac40bc">historic budget surpluses</a></span> that allowed him to greatly expand state spending. But back-to-back budget deficits — with more on the horizon — are testing California’s commitment to those increases.</p>
    

<p>So far, Newsom has not gutted some of his splashiest policy advancements, including <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/california-health-coronavirus-pandemic-business-education-c4dc90efd2de3059148f50c47d4937cd">free kindergarten</a></span> for all 4-year-olds and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/california-medicaid-expansion-undocumented-immigrants-34d8deb2186e9195b253f499e81a3d77">free health insurance</a></span> for all low-income adults regardless of their immigration status. But as Friday’s proposal showed, Newsom is willing to chip away at some of those promises to balance the budget.</p>



<p>While Newsom has not taken away health insurance from anyone, he proposed the state stop paying for health care workers to care for some 14,000 disabled immigrants in their home. That would save the state $94.7 million. While he hasn’t pulled back the state’s commitment to expanded kindergarten, he proposed eliminating $550 million that would have helped school districts build the facilities they need to teach all of those extra students.</p>
    
<p>After promising to pay for child care for another 146,000 children from low-income families, Newsom on Friday proposed pausing that expansion at 119,000. And after promising to boost how much money doctor’s get to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/california-medicaid-rates-gavin-newsom-optometrists-ca1d0fac1f662de24eca5289ff8885c1">treat Medicaid patients</a></span>, Newsom on Friday proposed canceling $6.7 billion that had been set aside to do that. </p>
    

<p>The cuts prompted outrage from across the political and ideological spectrum. Anthony Wright, executive director of the consumer advocacy group Health Access California, said the removal of in-home care for immigrants with disabilities would result in those people becoming “further impoverished or end up in much more expensive nursing home care.”</p><p>Yolanda Thomas, a member of the Child Care Providers United negotiations team, said cutting the child care slots means “we cannot build a stronger economy when our lowest paid workers ... don’t have somewhere safe to send their children during their shifts.” </p><p>For every question on Friday, Newsom had a similar response.</p><p>“I prefer not to make this cut. These are programs, propositions that I have long advanced, many of them,” he said. “But you’ve got to do it. You have to be responsible.”</p>
    

<p>Before the coronavirus pandemic, California’s revenues were growing at about 5% per year. From 2019-20 through 2021-22, revenues grew an astounding 55%. That’s because California got a lot of money from the federal government to blunt the impact of the pandemic. And it’s because the stock market had historic increases, fueling a rapid expansion of wealth among California’s richest residents — generating a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/business-health-california-pandemics-coronavirus-pandemic-2522f2b710bbb32383ab33865a1a9333">tax windfall for the state</a></span>.</p><p>State budgeting is a guessing game, where governors and lawmakers have to predict how much money they will have and plan to spend it. Following the bountiful years of the pandemic, California’s guesses have been way off. The Newsom administration now predicts state revenues will be $83.1 billion lower than they thought for the 2022-23 and 2023-24 fiscal years.</p><p>“If you knew that those were unrealistically high and totally unsustainable revenue levels, why wouldn’t you put a little bit more in the reserves,” said state Sen. Roger Niello, a Republican and vice chair of the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee. “If that’s the case, you know it’s going to come crashing down and you are going to have a big deficit to cover.”</p>
    

<p>Newsom defended California’s previous budget actions, noting the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/business-california-legislature-sacramento-gavin-newsom-483802c13cc4729dcc51860ef1bc6893">state Constitution</a></span> required the state to return a big chunk of that surplus to taxpayers in the form of rebates. Newsom said it “provided a lot of support at the time to people who needed money.”</p><p>“I feel like we were doing the best we could under that circumstance,” he said. </p><p>Newsom on Friday repeatedly vowed he would not sign a sweeping tax increase on individuals. But he did propose suspending a popular tax deduction for businesses, which many see as a tax increase. </p>
    

<p>In total, Newsom is proposing $32.8 billion in cuts over two years, including eliminating 10,000 unfilled state jobs and an 8% cut to state operations — including things like eliminating landlines. He promised there would be no layoffs, furloughs or salary cuts for the state’s more than 221,000 state workers.</p><p>Democratic legislators applauded Newsom’s effort to deal with multiple years of deficits and vowed to protect spending for social safety net fundings and classrooms.</p><p>“Nobody knows what challenges California may face, so we must always stay prepared,” Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Assembly Budget Chair Jesse Gabriel said in a joint statement. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Newsom proposed eliminating $550 million for school facilities, not $500 million.</p>
