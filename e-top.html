    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>French elections are held every 5 years, but the President can call a snap election at any time, as long as it's at least 1 year after the previous vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>France has a National Assembly with 577 seats, and a party needs a majority of 289 seats to pass laws. In the previous government, President Emmanuel Macron's alliance had only 250 seats and relied on support from other parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voting takes place over two rounds, with the first round being a vote by a majority of voters to elect a candidate. In this election, only 76 candidates were elected in the first round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most elections go to a second round, where only candidates who won more than 12.5% of ballots cast are allowed to stand. This often results in a two-candidate runoff, but this election has a record-high number of three-way runoffs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The high number of three-way runoffs in the second round has led to many centrist and left-wing candidates advancing to the final round, which is expected to have a significant impact on the outcome of the election.</p>

            Members of the French parliament, known as “deputies,” are elected for five years – but the president can call a snap election whenever they please, so long as it’s at least one year after the previous vote.
    </p>

            France’s parliament, known as the National Assembly, has 577 seats, one for each of its electoral districts. For an absolute majority, a party needs 289. In the outgoing government, Emmanuel Macron’s alliance had only 250 seats, and so needed support from other parties to pass laws.

            Voting takes place over two rounds, always on Sunday.

            If a candidate wins a majority of votes in the first ballot on a 25% turnout, they win the seat. Only 76 candidates were elected in the first round: 39 from the far-right National Rally and its allies, 32 from the left-wing New Popular Front, and just two from Macron’s Ensemble.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_EB0741DB-556D-47DF-912E-9C4D65631CDE@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Most elections go to a second round. Only those who won more than 12.5% of ballots cast by registered voters are allowed to stand in the second round, meaning it is often fought between two candidates.
    </p>

            But this second round has the highest-ever number of three-way runoffs. This has led to more than 200 centrist and left-wing candidates agreeing to step down to avoid splitting the vote and keep the far right out of power.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/lag_E364438D-96BC-4C79-9B94-51794B7A93BB@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Once the parliament is elected, the president typically appoints a prime minister from the party with the most seats. Macron now faces the uncomfortable prospect of having to appoint a prime minister from a different party to his own.

<li><strong>Trump's conviction may not be overturned</strong>: Despite Trump's lawyers filing a motion to set aside the verdict, experts believe that the judge will likely find that the conviction survives, citing "harmless error" (no harm, no foul) doctrine.</li>
<li><strong>Immunity opinion may not apply</strong>: Even if the judge rules that presidential immunity retroactively invalidates some evidence used at trial, the conviction would still stand if the evidence is deemed "harmless".</li>
<li><strong>Judge may find evidence still overwhelming</strong>: According to former Manhattan financial crimes prosecutor John Moscow, the judge will likely find that removing the challenged evidence would not have changed the verdict, and Trump would still have been convicted.</li>
<li><strong>Trump's lawyers filing 330.30 motion</strong>: Trump's lawyers are expected to file a 330.30 motion to set aside the verdict, which is a pre-sentencing motion arguing that the trial was so flawed it would never survive an appeal.</li>

    <div><div class="post-content"><p><em>Raises concerns that Dr. O’Connor’s medical assessments of President Biden have been influenced by his involvement in the Bidens’ business schemes</em></p>
<p>WASHINGTON—Following evidence of President Joe Biden’s declining mental state, House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) today is calling on President Biden’s physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, to appear for a transcribed interview regarding his medical assessments of President Biden and his private endeavors with the Biden family’s business schemes. Chairman Comer also is requesting Dr. O’Connor produce all documents and communications in his possession related to his involvement in the Biden family’s financial activity.</p>
<p>“After a concerning debate performance by President Biden against former President Donald Trump on June 27, journalists have rushed to report on what Americans have seen plainly for years: the President appears unwell. Americans question President Biden’s ability to lead the country, and the Committee on Oversight and Accountability is investigating circumstances surrounding your assessment in February of this year that ‘President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old-male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency …’  Recently, it was reported that you have ‘never recommended that [President] Biden take a cognitive test.’ The Oversight Committee is concerned your medical assessments have been influenced by your private business endeavors with the Biden family,” <strong>wrote Chairman Comer.</strong></p>
<p>Amid reports President Biden has “lost all independence,” on July 3, 2024, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated she spoke with Dr. O’Connor and that President Biden has not been evaluated since February of this year. Yet on a phone call with Democratic governors the same day, President Biden “told the assembled governors he was checked out by a doctor and that everything was fine.” Prior to his current position, Dr. O’Connor was involved with the Biden family’s influence peddling schemes. Recent evidence obtained by the Committee shows Dr. O’Connor’s and James Biden’s involvement with Americore Health, LLC, a company that operated rural hospitals and is currently involved in bankruptcy proceedings. James Biden, the President’s brother, <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/comer-releases-evidence-of-direct-payment-to-joe-biden/">used funds from Americore to pay Joe Biden $200,000</a> as the company was facing financial distress. James Biden received payments for $400,000 and $200,000, characterized as loans, from the company that were wired directly to his bank account “based upon representations that his last name, ‘Biden,’ could ‘open doors’ and that he could obtain a large investment from the Middle East based on his political connections.” During his transcribed interview, <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/James-Biden-Transcript-1.pdf">James Biden confirmed</a> Dr. O’Connor provided him counsel in connection with the alleged work he was performing for Americore. </p>
<p>“You have repeatedly refused most interview requests from the media, and the Committee now turns to you to provide answers regarding your independence because of the mixed and confused messaging coming from the White House regarding the President’s ability to perform his job,” <strong>continued Chairman Comer.</strong> “The statements by the White House Press Secretary and President Biden appear inconsistent, and the Committee seeks to understand the extent of your role at the White House at this time. Given your connections with the Biden family, the Committee also seeks to understand if you are in a position to provide accurate and independent reviews of the President’s fitness to serve. To understand the extent of your involvement in the Biden family’s financial activity, we request that you produce all documents and communications in your possession regarding Americore and James Biden.  Additionally, the Committee requests you make yourself available for a transcribed interview with Committee counsel.”</p>

<p>More Democratic lawmakers are expected to voice their concerns that Biden step aside, but others are mounting efforts to stand by the president and return the focus on Trump and the danger they say he poses to the country and democracy.</p>



<p>Biden himself was personally calling lawmakers through the weekend. On Saturday, he joined a call with campaign surrogates and reiterated that he has no plans to leave the race, despite a political situation that is increasingly precarious. </p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know about the 2024 Election Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020.

<p>Biden’s campaign team is calling and texting lawmakers to try and head off more potential defections. They are also asking high-profile Biden supporters to speak out, in hopes of bringing those with lingering concerns back in line. </p><p>Calls to bow out popped up from different directions.</p><p>Alan Clendenin, a Tampa city councilman and member of the Democratic National Committee, said on Sunday, “I believe it is in the best interest of our country and the world that President Joe Biden step aside and allow Vice President Kamala Harris to carry forward his agenda as our Democratic nominee.”</p><p>And director Rob Reiner, who has helped organize glitzy Hollywood fundraisers for Biden in the past, posted on X, “It’s time for Joe Biden to step down.”</p><p>With the Democratic convention fast <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/replacing-biden-nomination-options-dnc-democratic-convention-d23c02047b6a2c991737915972a2fa4c">approaching</a></span>, the short term is especially critical. Those who feel Biden is no longer up to the task are imploring Democrats to replace him at the top of the ticket before, they argue, it’s too late. </p><p>Biden’s Friday <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/president-joe-biden-campaign-wisconsin-abc-news-e4657f86f5e82b10a5fefb526bc49b08">interview with ABC</a></span> has not convinced some who remain skeptical. That’s despite a weekend boost coming from other key Democrats who had raised previous questions but now have <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-debate-democrats-congress-election-aa619e71e1e09868abe22d19fc48e351">moved to support Biden</a></span>, led by Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina. </p>
    

<p>Democratic fundraising bundler Barry Goodman, a Michigan attorney, said Sunday that he still backs Biden but, should he step aside, he’d back Harris. That’s notable since Goodman was also a finance co-chairman for both of the statewide campaigns of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has also been mentioned as a top-of-the-ticket alternative. </p><p>“We don’t have much time,” Goodman said. “I don’t think the president gets out. But if he does, I think it would be Kamala.”</p><p>Biden nonetheless found an exceedingly friendly audience at Mount Airy, where Pastor Louis Felton likened the president to Joseph and the biblical story of his “coat of many colors.” In it, Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers, only to eventually obtain a high place in the kingdom of the pharaoh and have his brothers beg him for assistance without initially recognizing him. </p>
    

<p>“Never count Joseph out,” Felton implored. Then, referring to Democrats who have called on Biden to step aside, he added, “That’s what’s going on, Mr. President. People are jealous of you. Jealous of your stick-to-itiveness, jealous of your favor. Jealous of God’s hand upon your life.” </p><p>That came after Biden entered to applause and a cry of “Let him know we are with him!” </p><p>“There is no election we can not win,” Felton told those assembled. “We are together because we love our president.” </p><p>He also called Biden “a fighter” and “winner” and led a prayer where he said, “Our president gets discouraged. But today, through your holy spirit, renew his mind, renew his spirt, renew his body.” </p><p>The visit gave Biden a chance to energize African-American voters, who are Democrats’ largest and most-loyal bloc of support. It could also send a message to members of the Congressional Black Caucus, whose endorsement the president will need as he works to quell potential rebellion on Capitol Hill.</p>
    

<p>After the church service, Biden visited a campaign office in Philadelphia, where Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat who won a tough 2022 race while recovering from a stroke, offered a forceful endorsement of the president. </p><p>“There is only one guy that has ever beaten Trump,” Fetterman said. “And he is going to do it twice and put him down for good.” </p><p>Biden also has a scheduled rally later with union members in Harrisburg. Stepping off Air Force One there, the president was asked if the Democratic Party was behind him and emphatically responded, “Yes.” He returns to Washington, where leaders from NATO countries will gather for a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nato-summit-trump-biden-europe-ukraine-e45273ef1bd408d72245f8f7fd1ec5c0">three-day summit</a></span> beginning Tuesday. </p><p>Despite the sentiments of the likes of Fetterman, though, others aren’t fully convinced. </p><p>Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told CNN that Biden “needs to answer those questions that voters have” while adding, “If he does that this week, I think he will be in a very good position and we can get back to what this campaign needs to be.”</p><p>Biden has rejected undergoing independent cognitive testing, arguing that the everyday rigors of the presidency were proof enough of his mental acuity. Still, California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff told NBC on Sunday that he’d be “happy if both the president and Donald Trump took a cognitive test.” </p><p>As some Democrats have done, Schiff also seized on Biden suggesting during the ABC interview that losing to Trump would be acceptable “as long as I give it my all.” </p><p>“This is not just about whether he gave it the best college try,” Schiff said “but rather whether he made the right decision to run or to pass the torch.” </p><p>—-</p><p>Weissert reported from Washington. Associated Press writers Zeke Miller and Lisa Mascaro in Washington, Michelle Price in New York, Meg Kinnard in Chapin, South Carolina, and Bill Barrow in New Orleans contributed to this report.</p>

<p>The heat and humidity could team up to spike temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (about 38 degrees Celsius) in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, said Jacob Asherman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service (NWS).</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 4 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 4 of 4</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest region, records could be broken in Oregon state in cities including Eugene, Portland and Salem, Asherman said. Dozens of other records throughout the US could fall, he said, causing millions to seek relief from the blanket of heat in cooling centres from Bullhead City, Arizona, to Norfolk, Virginia.</p>
<h2 id="increase-in-temperatures-likely-this-week">Increase in temperatures likely this week</h2>
<p>The NWS said on Saturday it was extending the excessive heat warning for much of the southwest into Friday.</p>
<p>Three-digit temperatures are likely, higher by 15F to 30F (8-16C) than average in the west of the US into next week, the NWS said.</p>
<p>The eastern US could also be bracing for more hot temperatures. Baltimore and other parts of Maryland are under an excessive heat warning as heat index values could climb to 110F (43C), forecasters said.</p>
<p>“Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors,” read a National Weather Service advisory for the Baltimore area. “Young children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles under any circumstances.”</p>

<p>Some 362km (225 miles) south, firefighters battled the French Fire that threatened Mariposa, a gateway to Yosemite National Park. The fire spread over 323 hectares (800 acres) was 5 percent contained as winds calmed on Friday, helping firefighters make some progress.</p>
<p>Southern Texas faces a different threat early next week when remnants of Hurricane Beryl are expected to dump heavy rains on the region.</p>
<p>The US Midwest has been facing extreme heat since June, with temperatures climbing beyond 100F (37.8C).

            The Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week could be an “attractive” target for violent extremists or other people looking to sow chaos by disrupting a high-profile political event, according to a threat assessment from federal agencies and the Milwaukee Police Department obtained by CNN.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clybsifmr000b3b6kxqdkvjpr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            This election season has seen a “resurgence in disruptive tactics targeting election symbols” that are very likely meant to “instill fear and disrupt operations at election-related critical infrastructure facilities,” according to the assessment. The report was prepared by the FBI, US Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security, and Wisconsin state and city law enforcement officials. Homeland Security’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis distributed the assessment to federal, state and local officials in recent days.

            There is “no credible reporting to indicate a threat” to the Republican National Convention, but “violent threat actors” may view the convention “as an attractive target due to its symbolic nature and link to the 2024 general election,” says the threat assessment, which was dated July 2.

            One of the “disruptive tactics” that law enforcement officials are worried about is “swatting,” in which a caller makes a bogus crime report intended to trigger a massive law enforcement response to a target’s residence. Since December, at least four swatting incidents have been aimed at the homes of elections officials, CNN previously <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/13/politics/swatting-election-officials-invs/index.html">reported</a>.

            The Republican National Convention, taking place July 15-18, is expected to draw some 50,000 people as Republicans nominate Donald Trump as their presidential candidate.

data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, is facing criticism from opposition parties, media and families of Israeli hostages, who accuse him of undermining efforts to reach a ceasefire and secure the release of the hostages, for his own political survival.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“We appeal to the heads of the security agencies and the negotiating team – all eyes are on you. Do not let Netanyahu sabotage the deal again. We must rescue all the hostages,” the families said at a news conference near the defence ministry in Tel Aviv on Saturday.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">As a potential agreement draws near, Netanyahu has shown a pattern of retreating from hostage negotiations. On multiple occasions in recent months, he has been accused of obstructing progress that could bring an end to the conflict, whether through public pronouncements, covert communications, or by limiting the negotiating team’s authority.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">There are concerns over the substantial influence wielded by the far-right ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, whom Netanyahu relies on for his ruling coalition and who are opposed to a ceasefire.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">A few hours after Netanyahu sent Barnea to Doha to study the proposal, Ben-Gvir threatened to quit and collapse the governing coalition. In a post on social media on Saturday, Smotrich said he would “not be part of a government that agrees to the proposed outline and ends the war without destroying Hamas and bringing back all the hostages”.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">On Sunday evening, Netanyahu echoed the positions of his far-right ministers by stating that any Gaza ceasefire deal must allow for Israel to keep fighting until it achieved its war objectives. He added that the deal must prohibit weapons smuggling to Hamas via the Gaza-Egypt border, and should not allow for thousands of armed militants to return to northern Gaza. In a statement, Netanyahu also said Israel would maximise the number of live hostages returned.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Netanyahu’s popularity plummeted after the 7 October attack by Hamas, which exposed serious flaws in Israeli security. Most political observers say Netanyahu <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/04/pressure-grows-on-benjamin-netanyahu-to-back-gaza-ceasefire-plan" data-link-name="in body link">would lose elections</a> if they were held now. At an anti-government protest in Tel Aviv on Sunday, Orly Nativ, a 57-year-old social worker, joined the hundreds of flag-wielding demonstrators. “Enough is enough,” Nativ said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The head of the National Unity party, Benny Gantz, who in June quit the emergency government in a sign of divisions over Netanyahu’s post-conflict plans for Gaza, said: “Netanyahu, not everything depends on you. But you must show commitment, determination and sincere intentions this time as well. You know as well as I do that since the previous proposal, we have lost many of the hostages, who died in captivity.”</p><figure id="f4bb0487-201c-4614-99e4-8ff1c2e5140f" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"><figcaption class="dcr-1fujct4"><span class="dcr-1inf02i"><svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span class="dcr-1qvd3m6">People working to put out fires on Sunday after Hezbollah launched missiles on the Galilee area of northern Israel.</span> Photograph: Avi Ohayon/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Pressure is mounting on Israel, as a Gaza ceasefire could also allow for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/02/israel-hezbollah-war-warning" data-link-name="in body link">de-escalation between Hezbollah and Israel</a>.

The militant group still wants mediators to guarantee a permanent cease-fire, while Netanyahu is vowing to keep fighting until Israel destroys Hamas’ military and governing capabilities.</p><p>“Any deal will allow Israel to return and fight until all the goals of the war are achieved,” Netanyahu said in a statement Sunday that was likely to deepen Hamas’ concerns about the proposal.</p><p>Sunday’s “Day of Disruption” started at 6:29 a.m., the same time Hamas militants launched the first rockets toward Israel in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. Protesters blocked main roads and demonstrated outside of the homes of government ministers.</p>
    

<p>Near the border with Gaza, Israeli protestors released 1,500 black and yellow balloons to symbolize those fellow citizens who were killed and abducted.</p>



<p>Hannah Golan said she came to protest the “devastating abandonment of our communities by our government.” She added: “It’s nine months today, to this black day, and still nobody in our government takes responsibility.”</p>
    
<p>Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-rockets-airstrikes-tel-aviv-11fb98655c256d54ecb5329284fc37d2">in the surprise attack</a></span> and took 250 others hostage. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 38,000 Palestinians, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.</p><p>About 120 hostages remain captive after more than 100 hostages were released as part of a November cease-fire deal. Israel has already concluded that more than 40 of the remaining hostages are dead, and there are fears that the number will grow as the war drags on.</p>
    

<p>The United States has rallied the world behind a proposal for a phased cease-fire in which Hamas would release the remaining captives in return for a lasting cease-fire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. But Hamas wants guarantees from mediators that the war will end, while Israel wants the freedom to resume fighting if talks over releasing the last batch of hostages drag on.</p><p>Israel continues to battle pockets of Palestinian militants across Gaza after months of heavy bombing and ground operations that have devastated the territory’s main cities and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. On Sunday, Israel issued new evacuation orders for parts of Gaza City, which was heavily bombed and largely emptied early in the war.</p><h2>Bodies found with hands tied</h2><p>The Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis said the bodies of three Palestinians were retrieved from the area of the Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel. A hospital statement said they were handcuffed, and an Associated Press reporter saw one of the bodies with bound hands.</p>
    

<p>Abdel-Hadi Ghabaeen, an uncle of one of the deceased, said they had been working to secure the delivery of humanitarian aid and commercial shipments through the crossing. He said he saw soldiers detain them on Saturday, and that the bodies bore signs of beatings, with one having a broken leg.</p><p>The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.</p><p>Thousands of Palestinians have been detained since the start of the war, and many of those who have been released, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-war-hamas-palestinians-sde-teiman-3ca025f6ca412ce07c0c41cf11c52c6f">as well as some Israelis who have worked at detention facilities</a></span>, say detainees have been tortured and held under harsh conditions. Israeli authorities have denied abusing prisoners.</p><p>Israeli airstrikes overnight and into Sunday meanwhile killed at least 13 Palestinians, including the undersecretary of labor in the largely dismantled Hamas-run government.</p><p>Ihab al-Ghussein was among four people killed in a strike on a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City, according to the Civil Defense, a first responders group under the Hamas-run government. Hamas mourned his loss in a statement and said a strike earlier in the war had destroyed his house and killed his wife and daughter. </p>
    

<p>The Israeli military said it had struck a militant complex “in the area of a school building,” as well as a nearby Hamas weapons-making facility in Gaza City after taking steps to mitigate harm to civilians.</p><p>The military separately announced that one of its officers was killed in battle in the southern Gaza town of Rafah, bringing the total number of Israeli soldiers killed to 680 since the start of the war.</p><h2>Israel trades fire with Hezbollah</h2><p>The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said early Sunday that it launched dozens of projectiles toward northern Israel, targeting areas more than 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the border, deeper than most launches. A 28-year-old man was seriously wounded, Israel’s national rescue service reported. </p>
    

<p>Another attack near the border wounded three people, one of them seriously, according to the Galilee Medical Center. Israeli media reported that the critically wounded individual was an American citizen. There was no immediate confirmation from the army.</p><p>Hezbollah began launching rocket and mortar attacks after the outbreak of the war in Gaza. The range and severity of the attacks and Israel’s counterstrikes have escalated in recent weeks, raising fears of an all-out war that would have <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-gaza-war-iran-conflict-260c308e5e6f85d30d8ebd0352c6bcb3">catastrophic consequences</a></span> for people on both sides of the border.</p><p>Mediators from the United States, Egypt and Qatar have intensified their efforts in the past week to broker an agreement between Israel and Hamas. Hezbollah has said <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hezbollah-israel-hamas-lebanon-gaza-b75185ba722bf31c4982e579541a12f0">it will halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza</a></span>.</p><p>The compromise on Saturday by Hamas could lead to the first pause in fighting since November and set the stage for further talks, though all sides still warned that a deal is not yet guaranteed.</p><p>Washington’s phased deal would start with a “full and complete” six-week cease-fire during which older, sick and female hostages would be released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. During those 42 days, Israeli forces would withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza and allow the return of displaced people to their homes in northern Gaza.</p><p>War-weary Palestinians in the Gaza Strip appeared pessimistic, after previous instances in which the two sides appeared to be closing in on a deal.</p><p>“We have lived nine months of suffering,” said Heba Radi, a mother of six children living in a tent in the central city of Deir al-Balah, where she has been sheltering since they fled their home in Gaza City. “The cease-fire has become a distant dream.”</p><p>___ Magdy reported from Cairo.
