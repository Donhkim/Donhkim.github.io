    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Supreme Court limits federal obstruction law</strong>: The Supreme Court has ruled that the charge of obstructing an official proceeding, which has been used to charge hundreds of Capitol riot defendants and former President Donald Trump, requires proof that defendants tried to tamper with or destroy documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact on Capitol riot defendants</strong>: The decision will not affect the overwhelming majority of the approximately 1,000 people who have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to Capitol riot-related federal crimes, as most were not charged with obstruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential impact on Trump's case</strong>: It's unclear how the decision will affect the case against Trump, which includes charges other than obstruction. Special counsel Jack Smith has said the charges faced by Trump would not be affected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential for released defendants</strong>: Under the ruling, dozens of defendants could seek new sentences, ask to withdraw guilty pleas, or have charges dropped. Most defendants convicted of obstruction were also convicted of another felony, so their sentence may not be significantly impacted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong>: The high court has returned the case of former Pennsylvania police officer Joseph Fischer to a lower court to determine if Fischer can be charged with obstruction, and a decision is expected on Monday in Trump's case, which involves claims of immunity from prosecution.</p>

Only some of the people who <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege">violently attacked the Capitol</a></span> on Jan. 6, 2021, fall into that category.</p><p>The overwhelming majority of the approximately 1,000 people who have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to Capitol riot-related federal crimes were not charged with obstruction and will not be affected by the outcome.</p><p>Still, the decision is likely to be used as fodder for claims by Trump and his Republican allies that the Justice Department has treated the Capitol riot defendants unfairly. </p>
    

<p>It’s unclear how the court’s decision will affect <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc">the case against Trump</a></span> in Washington, which includes charges other than obstruction. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc">Special counsel Jack Smith</a></span> has said the charges faced by the former president would not be affected. </p>



<p>Trump’s case is on hold while the Supreme Court considers a separate case in which Trump is claiming immunity from prosecution. A decision is expected on Monday. </p><p>Under the ruling issued Friday, dozens of defendants could seek new sentences, ask to withdraw guilty pleas, or have charges dropped. Most defendants convicted of obstruction were also convicted of another felony so their sentence may not be significantly impacted - if at all.</p>
    
<p>The high court returned the case of former Pennsylvania police officer Joseph Fischer to a lower court to determine if Fischer can be charged with obstruction. Fischer has been indicted for his role in disrupting Congress’ certification of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-wins-white-house-ap-fd58df73aa677acb74fce2a69adb71f9">Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential election victory</a></span> over Trump. </p>
    

<p>Fischer is among about 350 people who have been charged with obstruction. Some pleaded guilty to — or were convicted of — lesser charges.</p><p>Republicans, who have cast the Jan. 6 defendants as victims of political persecution, are certain to seize on the ruling to argue the rioters have been unfairly prosecuted by the Justice Department. Trump has embraced Jan. 6 defendants on the campaign trial, and floated pardons for the rioters if he wins in November.</p><p>Trump posted on his Truth Social platform shortly after the decision, calling the ruling “Big News!” He shared another message that described the ruling as a “massive victory” for “J6 political prisoners.”</p><p>It’s also likely to slow down cases in a court already clogged with Jan. 6 defendants as judges are forced to grapple with how to apply the ruling.</p><p>“It’s going to be a big mess,” said Randall Eliason, a professor at George Washington University Law School and former federal prosecutor in Washington.</p><p>Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the court’s opinion, joined by conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, and by liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a former federal public defender who also wrote a separate opinion.</p>
    

<p>Reading the obstruction statute broadly “would also criminalize a broad swath of prosaic conduct, exposing activists and lobbyists to decades in prison,” Roberts wrote.</p><p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett dissented, along with Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.</p><p>Barrett, one of three justices appointed by Trump, wrote that the law clearly encompasses the events of Jan. 6. “The riot forced Congress to suspend the proceeding, delaying it for several hours,” she wrote.</p><p>She said her colleagues in the majority did “textual backflips to find some way — any way — to narrow the reach” of the obstruction law. </p><p>Roberts, Jackson and Barrett made strikingly different word choices in their opinions. While Roberts described the attack as a “breach of the Capitol,” Barrett described the events as a riot and the participants as rioters. Jackson wrote that “an angry mob stormed the United States Capitol.”</p>
    

<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland said he was disappointed with the decision, which he said “limits an important federal statute.” Still, Garland said the cases against the “vast majority” of people charged in the attack won’t be affected.</p><p>“January 6 was an unprecedented attack on the cornerstone of our system of government — the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the next,” he said. “We will continue to use all available tools to hold accountable those criminally responsible for the January 6 attack on our democracy.”</p><p>Roughly 170 Capitol insurrection defendants have been convicted of obstructing or conspiring to obstruct the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress, including the leaders of two far-right extremist groups, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/jan-6-enrique-tarrio-seditious-conspiracy-trial-f8738f17552cda21eef6d89504da2a0e">the Proud Boys</a></span> and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/oath-keepers-founder-guilty-of-seditious-conspiracy-42affe1614425c6820f7cbe8fd18ba96">the Oath Keepers</a></span>. A number of defendants have had their sentencings delayed until after the justices rule on the matter.</p>
    

<p>Some rioters have even won early release from prison while the appeal was pending over concerns that they might end up serving longer than they should have if the Supreme Court ruled against the Justice Department. They include Kevin Seefried, a Delaware man who <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-delaware-prisons-6057e74630701e1f77cf84aacbb3caaf">threatened a Black police officer</a></span> with a pole attached to a Confederate battle flag as he stormed the Capitol. Seefried was sentenced last year to three years behind bars, but a judge recently ordered that he be released one year into his prison term while awaiting the Supreme Court’s ruling.</p><p>Seventeen of the 18 trial judges who have weighed in have allowed the charge to stand. Among them, U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump appointee, wrote that “statutes often reach beyond the principal evil that animated them.”</p><p>But U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, another Trump appointee, dismissed the charge against Fischer and two other defendants, writing that prosecutors went too far. A divided panel of the federal appeals court in Washington reinstated the charge before the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case.</p><p> Alito and Thomas rejected calls that they step aside from the Jan. 6 case because of questions raised about their impartiality.</p><p>The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, which has handled Jan. 6 prosecutions, said no one who has been convicted of or charged with obstruction will be completely cleared because of the ruling. Every defendant also has other felony or misdemeanor charges, or both, prosecutors said.</p><p>For around 50 people who were convicted, obstruction was the only felony count, prosecutors said. Of those, roughly two dozen who still are serving their sentence are most likely to be affected by the ruling.</p><p>More than 1,400 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related federal crimes.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer, Rebecca Santana and Lindsay Whitehurst contributed to this report.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court">https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court</a></span>.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Supreme Court overturns Chevron doctrine</strong>: The Supreme Court has ruled that federal agencies cannot interpret laws in ways that contradict Congressional intent, ending a 40-year precedent known as the Chevron doctrine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GOP lawmakers praise the decision</strong>: Republican lawmakers, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have praised the decision, arguing that it limits the power of unelected government officials and ensures that Congress retains its authority to make law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chamber of Commerce supports the decision</strong>: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a leading business lobby, also supports the decision, citing its potential to create a more predictable and stable regulatory environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Critics of Chevron doctrine see it as a power grab</strong>: Critics of the Chevron doctrine argued that it allowed federal agencies to usurp Congressional authority and push their own political agendas, often leading to inconsistent regulations that made it difficult for businesses to plan and invest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consequences for regulation</strong>: The decision is likely to have significant consequences for the way federal agencies regulate industries, potentially leading to more transparency and accountability in regulatory decision-making.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The US Supreme Court has ruled that cities can ban homeless people from sleeping rough, allowing local governments to enforce rules against people sleeping in public places without worrying about the US constitution's limits on cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ruling, which is the court's most significant decision on homelessness since the 1980s, is a win for cities that have been pushing for stricter regulations to address rising homelessness and concerns about cleanliness and safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The case began in Grants Pass, Oregon, where three homeless people sued the city after receiving citations for sleeping and camping outside. The city argued that criminal penalties were necessary to enforce local laws banning homeless people from public spaces, while the homeless residents claimed that those penalties violated the Eighth Amendment of the US constitution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homelessness is on the rise in the US, with around 653,000 people lacking homes in 2023, the largest number since tracking began in 2007. The problem is particularly acute in cities like Grants Pass, where the population has doubled in 20 years but the supply of affordable or public housing has not kept pace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Supreme Court's decision allows cities to take a more hardline approach to addressing homelessness, rather than focusing on providing solutions like affordable housing and social services. The ruling is likely to have significant implications for cities across the US, which are struggling to address rising homelessness and the underlying causes of the crisis.</p>

Around 653,000 people did not have homes in 2023, the largest number since tracking began in 2007, according to US government figures. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There were also an estimated 256,000 people living without shelter on a given night across the country last year, according to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/2023-AHAR-Part-1.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">Department of Housing and Urban Development.</a></p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Grants Pass's population has doubled to 40,000 in the last 20 years, but its supply of affordable or public housing has not.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Soaring housing costs led to a sizeable number of people losing their homes.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Town officials responded by passing laws that fined people for sleeping or camping in public. Over time, those fines stacked up, reaching thousands of dollars for some.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Unable to pay for multiple citations, three homeless people sued the city.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Their lawsuit reached the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which decided in 2022 that the restrictions in Grants Pass were so tight that they amounted to an effective ban on being homeless within city limits.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The court had determined four years earlier in a similar case in Idaho that the constitution “bars a city from prosecuting people criminally for sleeping outside on public property when those people have no home or other shelter to go to".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"></p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Meanwhile, the homeless crisis has continued to worsen.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Jennifer Friedenbach, of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, said that money and resources should "go towards getting folks off the streets".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“What we know is that arresting and fining people for being homeless doesn't work," she said. "It doesn't get anybody off the streets. It wastes municipal resources, and it exacerbates homelessness."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Supreme Court's Grants Pass decision will now allow cities to take more severe measures without the fear of legal recourse.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The first problem with putting homeless people in jail is that it is extremely expensive, and when they get out, the person is still homeless and now even less apt to finding employment with a criminal record, says Elizabeth Funk, founder of DignityMoves, a nonprofit dedicated to ending unsheltered homelessness.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“We need to be thinking about how to get this problem solved," she says. "It's not going to be fining people for doing something they can't avoid. It's helping them.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Some of the highest concentrations of homeless are on the West Coast. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">California, with its moderate temperatures, accounts for nearly half of all homeless people who live outside and has a total of 123,423 homeless, according to data from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Cities across the country have been wrestling with how to combat the growing crisis. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The issue has been at the heart of recent election cycles in West Coast cities, including Los Angeles, where officials have poured record amounts of money into creating shelters and affordable housing while homelessness has still increased.</p></div></div>

Kind of confused on where the jury is at and what they're still deliberating about," Read supporter Emma Lowry <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-supporters-murder-trial-verdict-watch/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">told WBZ-TV</a></span> outside court.</p>

<p>But, it's not unusual for juries to take their time in high-profile trials.</p><h2>Karen Read case compared to other high-profile trials</h2><p>The <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oj-simpson-death-victims-families-judgment/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">O.J. Simpson</a></span> trial lasted eight months and the jury deliberated for just four hours before he was acquitted.</p><p>The first <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/tag/aaron-hernandez/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Aaron Hernandez</a> trial lasted nearly three months before a jury convicted him.

They heard testimony from 74 witness and saw more than 600 pieces of evidence presented over nearly two months.</p><h2>Karen Read verdict results</h2><p>The jury is deliberating three charges against Read in the death of her boyfriend, Boston Police officer John O'Keefe on <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-trial-timeline-john-okeefe/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">January 29, 2022</a></span> - second degree murder, manslaughter while operating under the influence of alcohol and leaving the scene where there has been personal injury and death.</p><p>"Nobody knows what's going on in that jury room," retired Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Jack Lu told WBZ.  "One of the ways of doing it for the jury is to start with exhibit number one and go step by step by step."</p>

    </p>
<p>"I think the defense is getting a little worried," legal expert Jennifer Roman told WBZ of the deliberations. "I think the prosecution's feeling a little bit better."</p><p>"The jury also has a lot of choices to make here because of the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-murder-trial-verdict-watch-jury-deliberations/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">nature of the charges</a></span>," Roman said. "They could always find her not guilty of one charge, but then find her guilty of a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-trial-verdict-watch-case/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">lesser charge</a></span>."</p><h2>Karen Read jury's first decision</h2><p>"All of this, of course, means that the jury has to believe that Karen Read actually hit John O'Keefe with her motor vehicle. If they find that, then they've got to weed through all of this other debate about what's the correct charge to convict of, if anything, and what does all this evidence mean?" Roman said.</p><p>"If they can't get a unanimous decision about that, then that's where the jury deliberations end. They have to find that she hit him in order to proceed with the rest of these deliberations."</p><p>"We don't know where they're at in their deliberations. We don't know if they're stuck on step one or if they've decided unanimously on step one and now they're debating about the charges," Roman told WBZ.</p><h2>What is a hung jury?</h2><p>If the Read trial ends with a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/hung_jury" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">hung jury</a>, in other words, they can't reach a verdict, it would lead to a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/retrial" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">retrial</a>.</p><p>"I'm concerned it's going be a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-murder-trial-day-3-verdict-watch/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">hung jury</a></span>. And I say that because the jury is representative of the population of people, and you can go to a party and talk to 10 different people, and you're going to have 5 or 6 on one side, 4 or 5 on the other, who all view this case differently," Roman said.</p>

<p>"If this was a hung jury, I have no doubt that the prosecution would retry this case. I question if, on a retrial, they would still go for the second-degree murder charge. I do think that that was a bit of a stretch." </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Age gap</strong>: President Joe Biden is 3 years and 7 months older than former President Donald Trump, although the age difference seemed more pronounced during their debate.</li>
<li><strong>Biden's debate performance</strong>: Biden's hoarse voice and limited vocal range made it difficult for him to clearly express his differences with Trump, leading Trump to comment that neither he nor Biden knew what Biden had said.</li>
<li><strong>Trump's debate behavior</strong>: Trump repeated his lies about fraud in the 2020 election and refused to accept the results of a future election unless it's "fair and legal", further eroding trust in democracy.</li>
<li><strong>Contrasting styles</strong>: The debate highlighted the vastly different communication styles of the two candidates, with Biden struggling to articulate his points and Trump using aggressive rhetoric to deflect criticism.</li>
<li><strong>Overall tone of the debate</strong>: The debate was marked by a confrontational and divisive tone, with Trump repeatedly interrupting Biden and the two candidates failing to find common ground on many issues.</li>

            Biden, hoarse and displaying little vocal range, was often unable to express his differences with Trump with clarity. At one point, after Biden had trailed off as he defended his record on border security, Trump said: “I really don’t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don’t think he knows what he said, either.”

            Trump, meanwhile, at times repeated his frequent election denialism. He said he’d accept the results of the 2024 election if it’s “fair and legal,” but then repeated his lies about fraud in the 2020 election.

            It was the first time either man had debated since 2020, and they made history Thursday night: It was the first time a sitting president and a former president had ever debated. The two clashed over abortion, immigration, foreign policy, inflation and more.

            Their showdown took a bitter and personal turn. Biden highlighted Trump’s criminal convictions. Trump responded by invoking Biden’s son, Hunter, who was also recently convicted. Then Biden accused Trump of having sex with porn star Stormy Daniels while Trump’s wife was pregnant.

            Biden was hoarse and at times unintelligible. Words often ran together. He stumbled, particularly when he tried to cite statistics and legislation. He rarely raised his voice to hammer home points of emphasis — missing opportunities to attack Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, his Supreme Court appointments that led to the reversal of Roe v. Wade’s abortion rights protections and more.

            It was the exception that proved the rule – and history suggests it was a kind of self- or campaign-imposed rule on Thursday night for Trump to not be seen taunting or mocking Biden’s difficulties. Four years ago, the first general election debate of the cycle was a mess for Trump, who constantly interrupted Biden and shouted over the moderators. If not exactly a lesson learned, then his tone in Atlanta was a correction designed to erase memory of that damaging, helter-skelter performance.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Iowa Supreme Court clears the way for 6-week fetal heartbeat abortion ban</strong>: The Iowa Supreme Court has ruled 4-3 to remove the injunction blocking the enforcement of the state's "fetal heartbeat" abortion law, which bans most abortions after fetal cardiac activity can be detected, typically around six weeks of pregnancy.</li>
<li><strong>Exceptions to the ban</strong>: The law has exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.</li>
<li><strong>Division within the Iowa Supreme Court</strong>: The court is divided on the issue of abortion, with the majority ruling in favor of lifting the injunction, while the dissenting judges argue that the law is unconstitutional and that "reproductive autonomy" is a fundamental right.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers</strong>: The ruling means that Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, the lead plaintiff in the case, will no longer have a court order blocking the law, and the case will be sent back to the district court.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty for the future of abortion in Iowa</strong>: The decision may lead to future legal challenges and uncertainties for the status of abortion in Iowa, with the court's split decision indicating that the issue is far from settled.</li>

Federal courts at the time defined an undue burden as a "substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In 2018, the court went a step farther, finding there was a fundamental right to abortion. But in 2022, the court, with by then a more conservative makeup, reversed that decision.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">That opened the door for what the court's majority on Friday agreed is rational basis as the appropriate standard for policies limiting abortions. It allows the state to impose a restriction if it has a rational basis for doing so — in this case, protecting the life of the unborn — and does not deny a fundamental right.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Stated simply, we can find no principled basis under our due process precedents to apply the heightened scrutiny of an undue burden test to abortion," McDermott wrote, adding that "every ground the state identifies is a legitimate interest for the legislature to pursue, and the restrictions on abortion in the fetal heartbeat statute are rationally related to advancing them."</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Dissents argue ruling undermines women's rights</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Chief Justice Susan Christensen and Justice Edward Mansfield both wrote dissents, joined by each other and by Justice Thomas Waterman.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Christensen, in her dissent, wrote that the majority decision "strips Iowa women of their bodily autonomy," and that Iowa should have kept its prior legal standard banning abortion restrictions that impose an undue burden on pregnant woman.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">More:</strong><a href="/story/news/2024/06/28/iowa-supreme-court-lets-6-week-abortion-ban-take-effect-how-iowans-reacted-kim-reynolds/74205895007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:23|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">What Kim Reynolds, Democrats are saying about the Iowa Supreme Court abortion ruling:</a></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">She focused in particular on the law's exceptions, including permitting abortions for women "whose life is endangered" but explicitly forbidding abortions "when continuation of the pregnancy will create a serious risk ofsubstantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"In my opinion, the only female lives that this statute treats with any meaningful regard and dignity are the unborn lives of female fetuses," she wrote. "After that, this statute forces pregnant women (and young girls) to endure and suffer through life-altering health complications that range from severe sepsis requiring limb amputation to a hysterectomy so long as those women are not at death’s door."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Mansfield's dissent likewise suggested that the standard imposed by the majority "gives no weight to a woman's autonomy over her body" and said the Iowa Constitution protects the right not to have children just as much as it protects the rights of parents.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We need to ask whether a woman has a fundamental right of personal autonomy over her body as part of the 'life' and 'liberty' protected by (the Iowa Constitution)," Mansfield wrote. "I think that answer is clearly yes. We then should ask whether a law practically banning abortion is an improper invasion of that right — notwithstanding the State’s undeniable interest in promoting and preserving human life."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Mansfield wrote that the appropriate balance is to keep the "undue burden" standard in place through the 15th week of pregnancy. Christensen in her dissent concurred that the Iowa Constitution provides that much protection for abortion rights "at the very least."</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Plaintiffs call ruling 'devastating blow' to abortion rights</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In statements, leaders from Planned Parenthood and Iowa City's Emma Goldman Clinic warned that Friday's ruling will have long-lasting and harmful repercussions for Iowa women.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Ruth Richardson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, said abortion is "essential, time-sensitive health care."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Every person deserves to have the full range of sexual and reproductive health care they need, including abortion, no matter their ZIP code," she said.

Maybe there were too many voices and perspectives and data points put in his head, one campaign source suggested to me, and that just threw him off.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">While that analysis may be correct, the claim that the president was tired and overworked will do little to quell the very real fears that Mr Biden’s advanced age may impact his ability to win this election.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">These fears over the president’s age, mental fitness and stamina - and the insistence that something must be done about it - are far from new.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Back in September, the prominent political columnist David Ignatius, who was a confidant of Mr Biden’s, stated that the president should step aside. In February, Ezra Klein of the New York Times said much the same in a column that generated both buzz and irritation among those inside the White House.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Until now, those voices have been one-offs. That changed after last night’s poor debate performance.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"></p></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Name-calling and insults - key moments from Biden and Trump’s debate</figcaption></p><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In the early hours of Friday morning, a string of high-profile Democratic strategists, pundits, and former officials joined the call for Mr. Biden to bow out. I appeared on Morning Joe, an American political morning show that the president frequently watches. Joe Scarborough, the host of the program and a defender of the president, made the point that while Mr Biden can still govern the country, perhaps he no longer has what it takes to win the election.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">So where does that leave Joe Biden?</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">First, it is important to remember that the decision of whether to continue is - more or less - entirely his. At this point, if he doesn’t want to step back, it’s virtually impossible for him to be removed from the ticket. One campaign source told me any decision to step down would be made by a very small group that includes the president, his wife and his sister, Val Biden.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Second, right now the conversation about whether to replace Mr Biden is happening in public among pundits and former officials but it’s still only happening in private among those with actual influence.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Indeed this morning, several of the president’s allies (who are also, awkwardly, being floated as his potential replacements) took to television and social media to defend him.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">California Governor Gavin Newsom said he was “very proud of the president". Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro told Democrats to “stop worrying". Senator John Fetterman put it bluntly, saying: “I refuse to join the Democratic vultures on Biden’s shoulder.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">My reporting suggests no changes will be made imminently. The team wants to give the president a chance to get out in public and erase the memory of that debate appearance. He has rallies and public events where they say he will be strong and vigorous.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On Saturday, Mr Biden will travel to the ultra-wealthy Hamptons region of New York for fundraisers with Democratic donors.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A source on the campaign tells me that, at the moment, the chance of him stepping aside is only around 5%. But if donors were to abandon him en masse, they acknowledge that could change and prompt a speedier decision about his candidacy.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Polling on the public’s reaction to the debate should filter in over the next few days. That too will guide the discussions.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Already the campaign is pointing to snap polling data from the debate that shows independent voters had a more unfavourable response to Donald Trump than to Joe Biden. They hope that is replicated in later polls.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Joe Biden has been discounted many times before in his political career. When he first ran for Senate he was told he was too young. When he thought of running for president in 2016 he was told it wasn’t his turn. And in 2020 many people felt he didn’t represent the future of a diverse Democratic Party.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He has developed a habit of ignoring sceptics. The only people he really trusts are the few close advisers who’ve been with him for years. I’ve been told those advisers, including Ron Klain and Mike Donilon (who prepared him for this disastrous debate), also happen to believe that Joe Biden is the only person who can beat Donald Trump.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">They were right in 2020. Are they still right today?</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Yes, Joe Biden has a history of bouncing back, but many Democrats are worried this time is different.</p></div></article></div>

(Thomas Hawk via Flickr)</p>                                </div><p>The court’s press room is still buzzing this morning over Bloomberg’s scoop yesterday on the brief but mistaken posting of the court’s disposition in <em>Moyle v. United States</em> and <em>Idaho v. United States</em>, about emergency abortion care.</p>
<p>But today, the courtroom will reclaim its rightful place as the center of the drama in the building.</p>
<p>Opinion season has seen some unusual occurrences this spring. On May 16, there was Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s cryptically short bench announcement in <em>Smith v. Spizzirri</em>, a low-profile arbitration case. “Stay means stay,” was all she said. “The opinion of the court is unanimous.”<span id="more-316870"></span></p>
<p>On May 23, Justice Samuel Alito had two opinions to announce just as the controversy over two flags flown at his homes, associated with the Stop the Steal and Christian nationalist movements, was unfurling around him. He looked like he would rather be anywhere else as he delivered two uncharacteristically short oral summaries.</p>
<p>And a couple of weeks ago, we had the first oral dissent of the term, by Sotomayor in <em>Garland v. Cargill</em>. Today, we will have two more dissents from the bench.</p>
<p>The courtroom’s public gallery is pretty full today, but the bar section is almost empty, except for Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar and several members of her team, plus a handful of other lawyers. Michael Dreeben of Special Counsel Jack Smith’s office, who argued for the government in <em>Trump v. United States</em>, was here yesterday, but he is not here today.</p>
<p>There are no spouses of the justices in the VIP box this morning.</p>
<p>After some recent court sessions in which one justice or another was absent, all are present as they take the bench. Chief Justice John Roberts says that Justice Neil Gorsuch “has the opinion of the court in two cases this morning.”</p>
<p>Gorsuch, who was absent yesterday, is conveniently back this morning to deliver his summaries in two pretty big cases, <em>Ohio v. Environmental Protection Agency</em> and <em>Harrington v. Purdue Pharma</em>. Gorsuch can be pretty abrupt with his presentations, so much so that when he delivered the court’s opinion in <em>FBI v. Fikre</em>, in March, all I could think of was something I had seen on TV about a week before: Al Pacino’s breakneck announcement of “Oppenheimer” as best picture winner at the Oscars.</p>
<p>Today, Gorsuch presents the background for both of his cases, but when it comes to the holdings, he keeps it short. “This complicated case does not lend itself to easy oral presentation,” he says of the EPA decision.</p>
<p>The chief justice is next with the opinion in <em>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy</em>. He takes a more thorough approach in explaining why a defendant facing civil penalties for securities fraud is entitled to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment.</p>
<p>Roberts finishes, then turns his head in the direction of Sotomayor. She launches immediately into a summary of her dissent, which is joined by Justice Elena Kagan as well as Jackson. The majority decision is “a devastating blow to the manner in which our government functions,” she says. It’s a line not in her written dissent, which is always a highlight of dissents from the bench.</p>
<p>“Do not mistake judicial hubris with the protection of individual rights,” she continues. “Because the court fails to act as a neutral umpire when it rewrites established rules in the manner it does today, I, along with Justices Kagan and Jackson, respectfully dissent,” she says.</p>
<p>Roberts does not bat an eye at her little shot at his famous metaphor. He moves on to announce the last opinion of the day, the per curiam dismissal of the two Idaho abortion cases. He makes no reference to the Bloomberg scoop, but reads the per curiam part in full before announcing the lineup of concurring and dissenting opinions.</p>
<p>Then, he turns his head again, and it turns out that Jackson is prepared to make her first dissent from the bench.</p>
<p>“Today’s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho,” Jackson says. “It is delay.”</p>
<p>“While this court dawdles and the country waits, pregnant people experiencing emergency medical conditions remain in a precarious position,” she says. “This court had a chance to bring clarity and certainty to this tragic situation, and we have squandered it.”</p>
<p>She finishes, and Roberts looks to Marshal Gail Curley to gavel the day’s session to a close. There is no announcement that tomorrow, which has been listed as a likely opinion day, will be the court’s last.</p>
<p>Soon after, there is some discussion in the press room when the court adds Monday, July 1, as another opinion day. The chief justice, who usually heralds the final opinion day from the bench, has yet to mention when that will be.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Seine River in Paris, France, is not ready for the 2024 Summer Olympics, which start in one month, due to unsafe levels of bacteria linked to fecal matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the latest tests, E. coli bacteria was detected at 10 times above the acceptable levels, which can cause a range of health issues including diarrhea, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and sepsis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enterococci bacteria have also been detected in the river water for weeks, and while levels were better in the latest test, they were still unsafe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Paris mayor's office attributed the poor water quality to "unfavourable hydrological conditions, little sunshine, below-average seasonal temperatures, and upstream pollution".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The water quality has not improved despite three consecutive weeks of testing, and it is unclear if the river will be clean enough for the scheduled Olympic swimming events.</p>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-pier-us-military-aid-hunger-1dedd321e2a4e5fdba5a26cbbc51df77">pier built by the U.S. military</a></span> to bring aid to Gaza has been removed due to weather to protect it, and the U.S. is considering not re-installing it unless the aid begins flowing out into the population again, U.S. officials said Friday. </p><p>While the military has helped deliver desperately needed food through the pier, the vast majority of it is still sitting in the adjacent storage yard and that area is almost full. Aid agencies have had difficulty moving the food to areas further into Gaza where it is most needed because the humanitarian convoys have come under attack. </p><p>The U.N., which has the widest reach in delivering aid to starving Palestinians, hasn’t been distributing food and other emergency supplies arriving through the pier since June 9. The pause came after the Israeli military used an area near the pier to fly out hostages after their rescue in a raid that <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-06-09-2024-61eb1be9a9d0cf2dbf250cd4a8ed4dbf">killed more than 270 Palestinians</a></span>, prompting a U.N. security review over concerns that aid workers’ safety and neutrality may have compromised.</p>
    

<p>U.N. World Food Program spokesman Steve Taravella said Friday that the U.N. participation in the pier project is still on pause pending resolution of the security concerns.</p>



<p>While always meant to be temporary and never touted as a complete solution to the problems getting humanitarian aid into Gaza, President Joe Biden’s $230 million project has faced a series of setbacks since aid first rolled ashore May 17 and has been criticized by relief groups and congressional Republicans as a costly distraction.</p>
    
<p>The pier has been used to get more than 19.4 million pounds, or 8.6 million kilograms, of food into Gaza, but has been stymied not only by aid pauses but unpredictable weather. Rough seas damaged the pier just days into its initial operations, forcing the military to remove it temporarily for repairs and then reinstall it. Heavy seas on Friday forced the military to remove it again and take it to the Israeli port at Ashdod.</p>
    

<p>Several U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss military movements, said the military could reinstall the pier once the bad weather passes in the coming days, but the final decision on whether to reinstall it hasn’t been made.</p><p>Sabrina Singh, a Pentagon spokeswoman, acknowledged that she doesn’t know when the pier will be reinstalled. “When the commander decides that it is the right time to reinstall that pier, we’ll keep you updated on that.,” she said.</p><p>She also said Friday that there is a need for more aid to come into Cyprus and be transported to the pier. She noted that the secure area onshore is “pretty close to full,” but that the intention is still to get aid into Gaza by all means necessary. She said the U.S. is having discussions with the aid agencies about the distribution of the food.</p><p>But, she added, “Of course, if there’s not enough room in the marshalling yard, then it doesn’t make sense to put our men or women out there when there’s nothing to do.”</p><p>Palestinians are facing widespread hunger because fighting in the nearly nine-month <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">Israel-Hamas war</a></span>, Israeli restrictions on border crossings that are far more productive than the sea route and the attacks on the aid convoys have severely limited the flow of food, medicine and other supplies.</p><p>—-</p><p>Ellen Knickmeyer contributed from Washington. </p>

            “Warren Buffett has been exceedingly generous to the Gates Foundation through more than 18 years of contributions and advice,” Mark Suzman, the foundation’s chief executive, said in a statement to CNN. “We are deeply grateful for his most recent gift and contributions totaling approximately $43 billion to our work.” (Melinda announced in May that she would leave <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/13/investing/melinda-gates-resigns-foundation/index.html">the organization</a>, and her <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/07/business/melinda-french-gates-goodbye-letter-gates-foundation/index.html">last day was June 7</a> — but the foundation has not yet changed its name.)
