<li>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has expanded its operation in Rafah, Gaza, from airstrikes to ground operations, including bulldozing, as seen in new satellite images obtained by CNN.</li>
<li>The ground operations are taking place outside of the immediate border crossing area, with IDF forces operating over a mile outside of the Rafah crossing gate.</li>
<li>The satellite images show the destruction of buildings in the area, with some structures completely destroyed and others showing signs of being razed by bulldozers and heavy machinery.</li>
<li>The images also show smoke rising from recent military strikes and the start of makeshift forward operating bases being set up by IDF vehicles near bulldozed areas.</li>
<li>The ground operations in Rafah bear a striking resemblance to those conducted by the IDF in other parts of Gaza, including the initial ground invasion in late October 2023.</li>

    <div><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">House Republicans largely failed to land damaging blows on Wednesday as they questioned public school leaders from three politically liberal parts of the country, accusing them of “turning a blind eye” to an alarming rise in antisemitism in classrooms since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">In contrast to similar Congressional hearings for university leaders, which prompted upheaval at several colleges in recent months, the leaders of elementary and secondary school districts from New York City, Berkeley, Calif., and Montgomery County, Md., mostly managed to hold their ground. In some cases, they turned the charges of failing to confront antisemitism back on their Republican questioners.</p><div class="css-1dv1kvn"><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The school leaders fielded rapid-fire questions from Republican members of a House education subcommittee on a broad range of accusations made by some Jewish students, parents, educators and advocacy groups. Those groups have filed complaints to the U.S. Department of Education, saying that the districts violated federal civil rights laws by allowing a hostile climate for Jewish students.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The leaders said that both students and faculty members who engaged in overt antisemitic acts had been disciplined. They also disputed some of the allegations, saying that subsequent investigations had not borne out the initial incendiary reports.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Here are four takeaways from the hearing.</p><h3 class="live-blog-post-content css-lhc8w e1gnsphs0" id="link-4bc5a3e1"><span>Republicans failed to land the same heavy blows they did against university presidents.</span></h3><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The congressional inquiry into primary and secondary schools followed <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/05/us/harvard-university-of-pennsylvania-mit-antisemitism-congress.html" title="">two contentious hearings</a> on <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/nyregion/columbia-university-president-nemat-shafik-hearing.html" title="">antisemitism in higher education</a>.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">At a hearing in December, the presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology fell into the trap of relying on lawyerly answers rather than appealing to common sense.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Then last month, Columbia University leaders took a different approach, promising a crackdown. That helped stir further protests and eventually led to arrests on the school’s Manhattan campus, prompting a surge of pro-Palestinian activism across the country.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The public school leaders seemed to fare better on Wednesday than the university presidents, assuming a calm and unapologetic posture and at times pushing back against tough questions from Republican committee members.</p><div class="css-1jjjg2j e16pjgrl0"><figure class="sizeMedium css-sx232s" aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div class="css-1xb94ky"><span class="css-1dv1kvn">Video</span><div><div class="css-n27z15"><div class="css-mm3pwi"><div class="css-1g7y0i5 e1drnplw0"><button tabindex="100" class="css-1rtlxy" type="button" aria-label="close"><svg viewbox="0 0 60 60" fill="none"><circle cx="30" cy="30" r="30" fill="white" fill-opacity="0.9"></circle><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M38.4844 20.1006L39.8986 21.5148L21.5138 39.8996L20.0996 38.4854L38.4844 20.1006Z" fill="black"></path><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M21.5156 20.1006L20.1014 21.5148L38.4862 39.8996L39.9004 38.4854L21.5156 20.1006Z" fill="black"></path></svg></button><p class="css-rdbib0 e1drnplw1"></p><div class="css-18ow4sz e1drnplw2"><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><div class="css-uzyn7p"><dl class="css-p98d0w"><dt class="css-xx7kwh"></dt><dd class="css-4gvq6l"><p class="css-8hvvyd">“Mr. Banks, does Israel have the right to exist as a Jewish state?” “Absolutely.” “Ms. Silvestre?” “Yes.” “Ms. Ford Morthel?” “Yes.” “Does — is the phrase, ‘From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,’ is that antisemitic?” “I think most Jewish people experience that as antisemitic, and as such, it is not allowed in our schools.” “You would say it is?” “I would say it is antisemitic.” “Ms. Silvestre?” “It is if the intent is the destruction of the Jewish people, yes.” “And it is.

In their testimonies, the leaders spoke to the necessity of protecting all of their students from discrimination.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">“I stand up not only against antisemitism,” Mr. Banks said. “I stand up against Islamophobia and all other forms of hate.

It’s about teaching. You have to raise the consciousness of young people. And the challenge we have as a system is that we do have some adults who bring their own bias into the classroom. And we’ve got to figure out how do we unpack all of it at the same time. But the ultimate answer for antisemitism is to teach, to expose young people to the Jewish community so that they understand our common humanity. And I would certainly ask that to my colleagues from across the nation, and I would call on Congress, quite frankly, to put the call out to action, to bring us together to talk about how we solve for this. This, this convening for too many people across America in education feels like the ultimate gotcha moment. It doesn’t sound like people are actually trying to solve for something that I believe we should be doing everything we can to solve for.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption class="css-1ifeaca e3rygrp0"></figcaption></figure></div><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The hearing, he said, felt like “the ultimate gotcha moment.” He added that the antidote to antisemitism is education.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">“You have to raise the consciousness of young people,” he said.</p><h3 class="live-blog-post-content css-lhc8w e1gnsphs0" id="link-53a7d0bb"><span>Discipline of students and faculty was a major point of contention.</span></h3><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Republican representatives asked repeatedly about the kinds of disciplinary action that would be taken in response to acts of antisemitism on school grounds, and particularly whether educators accused of inappropriate actions had been, or would be, fired.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">In response, the school leaders emphasized that antisemitism was unacceptable. “Let me be clear,” said Karla Silvestre, the school board president in Montgomery County. “We do not shy away from imposing consequences for hate-based behavior, including antisemitism.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">But the leaders mostly tried to avoid broad statements about the grounds for termination or suspension. In union districts, like the one in New York City, there are often lengthy processes that administrators have to follow when they pursue disciplinary action.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Ms. Ford Morthel said California’s strict rules regarding divulging personnel information can make people think teachers who cross a line are not punished.

<ol>
<li><strong>Trial postponed indefinitely</strong>: Donald Trump's federal trial in Florida over his alleged mishandling of classified documents while in office has been indefinitely postponed.</li>
<li><strong>Judge's decision</strong>: US District Judge Aileen Cannon made the decision, citing that setting a trial date without resolving significant questions over trial evidence would be "imprudent".</li>
<li><strong>Previous trial date cancelled</strong>: The judge had previously set a trial start date of May 20, 2024, which has now been cancelled.</li>
<li><strong>Implications</strong>: This means that the trial is unlikely to begin, let alone be resolved, before the November election.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing investigation</strong>: The trial is part of an ongoing investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.</li>

            The sprawling stretch of Racine County, which sits between Chicago and Milwaukee, has been at the center of an intense local political debate over the development through one whipsaw election after another. Residents who live and work nearby told CNN they were happy to see the projects — and the jobs — but it was hardly a guarantee that their own economic anxieties would be allayed.

            “Things are really uncertain, not knowing what’s going to happen with interest rates and what’s going to happen with the whole economy,” said Dave Flannery, whose family operates the Apple Holler orchard and farm just a few miles from where Biden is set to visit on Wednesday. “Personally, I’m very optimistic in terms of our future, but at times it’s very scary out there.”

            Tom Oberhaus, whose family owns Cozy Nook Farm about an hour away near Waukesha, said inflation is one of the biggest criticisms he has about the Biden administration. While he’s not a huge admirer of Trump and hoped for a Republican alternative, he said he would gladly return to the economic policies of the Trump era.

            Biden has spent the last two years on the road touting the trillions of dollars of infrastructure and construction spending that resulted from legislation he signed, much of it passed through Congress on a bipartisan basis. But leading economists have argued the very funding that helped fuel economic growth also caused rising prices — clouding Biden’s ability to sell those achievements to voters.

            “It’s important for him to be here to hammer home his economic messages and make it real for people,” Mandela Barnes, the state’s former lieutenant governor, told CNN. “Some people are still thinking about the $1,500 check they got from Trump.”

            Wednesday was Biden’s fourth trip to Wisconsin so far this year, an indication of how central the state is to the President’s reelection roadmap. Wisconsin is a pillar of the so-called blue wall with Michigan and Pennsylvania — all three of which Trump won in 2016 and Biden flipped four years later.

            In 2020, Biden won Wisconsin by fewer than 21,000 votes.

            The Biden campaign and its acolytes don’t see it that way, citing polling that shows the president’s agenda has been popular among the party’s most loyal voters, as well as independents. The White House points to figures from Navigator – a Democratic-aligned polling firm that bills itself as a “resource for progressives” – as informing its views of the agenda’s popularity. In April, Navigator polled 1,000 voters on the policies in Biden’s State of the Union address and found broad support.

            “He doesn’t have to choose between a progressive path and a moderate path,” said Bharat Ramamurti, Biden’s former deputy director of the National Economic Council. “The agenda he has pursued is the consensus path.”

            As the Democratic Party’s priorities evolve, consensus has taken different forms — and sometimes required Biden to shift his own positions to the left.

            A self-professed capitalist, he pledged during the 2020 campaign not to demonize the rich. Soon after taking office, Biden repeatedly began pushing for policies that tax wealthy individuals and corporations, a shift that emerged from a “Unity Task Force” established by the campaign seeking input from progressive economists.
    </p>

            Perhaps no policy is more illustrative of this shift than <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-art-institutes/index.html">student loan forgiveness</a>. Biden started out the 2020 campaign supporting only the most limited student loan forgiveness — such as discharging loans when a borrower declared bankruptcy or died.
    </p>

            But on the eve of a March 2020 debate with progressive firebrand Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was proposing blanket cancellation of student loans, Biden widened his embrace of loan forgiveness. And as president, Biden announced his support for income-based forgiveness that would cancel more than $360 billion in government loans.

            While that plan was blocked by the Supreme Court, Biden has used regulation and agency authorities to cancel some $146 billion in student debt.

            “It never felt like it was truly something he wanted to do during the campaign,” said the former Biden adviser. “And now it’s one of his premier economic agenda items.”

            Individual issues like student loan forgiveness tend to poll well among voters, especially young voters, whose monthly payments are a larger portion of their take-home pay. The White House cites findings from a focus group conducted by Navigator, the firm run by former Democratic campaign officials, as proof that voters want to see more government action on student loans.

<p>A spokesperson for Willis declined to comment on the Court of Appeals decision to take up the matter.</p><p>In his order, McAfee said he planned to continue to address other pretrial motions “regardless of whether the petition is granted ... and even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court.” But Trump and the others could ask the Court of Appeals to stay the case while the appeal is pending.</p>

Faced once again with the threat posed by a fringe and extremist politician – who Netanyahu had elevated into government – the prime minister had given every appearance of blinking, underlining his reliance on far-right coalition allies such as Ben-Gvir and the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The two are widely assessed to hold Netanyahu’s future political survival in their hands. While Netanyahu could survive them quitting his coalition over a ceasefire deal with Hamas or the failure to launch a full-scale assault on Rafah, the politics of the Israeli right threaten him in more fundamental ways.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">During the course of the war, the uncompromising position of Ben-Gvir in particular has widened support for his extremist brand of politics, attracting some on the right of Netanyahu’s Likud party.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">A settler and lawyer, Ben-Gvir was cleared by Israel’s high court to serve as a cabinet minister despite convictions for incitement to racism and for supporting a terror group – Meir Kahane’s banned Kach party. In 2015, in the immediate aftermath of the murder of members of the Palestinian Dawabshe family in an arson attack on a West Bank village, he was filmed as an attender at a wedding party of a radical settler along with now sanctioned anti-Arab activist Bentzi Gopstein.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">In the footage, guests could be seen stabbing a picture of Ali Dawabshe, a toddler who died during the attack, waving guns and firebombs and singing. Netanyahu, who described the images as “shocking”, would later give Ben-Gvir a portfolio with responsibility for Israel’s police.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The conditions of Israel’s illegal occupation of the West Bank have become ever more extreme under the influence of Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, prompting an escalating round of international sanctions against those involved in settler violence.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Smotrich was arrested in 2005, with three others, during the Israeli evacuation of the Gaza settlements by the Shin Bet domestic security agency on suspicion of terrorism, although he was released three weeks later without charge.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">He has described himself as a “proud homophobe” and stated that Israel’s judicial system should be based on Torah law.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">During the seven months of the war in Gaza, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich have pushed the most hardline positions.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">According to reports in the Hebrew media last month, Ben-Gvir demanded of the Israeli chief of staff at a briefing: “Why are there so many arrests [in Gaza]?</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Can’t you kill some? Do you want to tell me they all surrender? What are we to do with so many arrested? It’s dangerous for the soldiers.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">An unnamed Israeli minister quoted by Ynet said Ben-Gvit had not explicitly suggested killing individuals who had surrendered.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">What seems increasingly clear, however, is that in bending to the bidding of the far-right fringe, including over Rafah and a ceasefire, Netanyahu is increasingly out of step with the majority of Israelis.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">A series of polls in recent days, including for the Israel Democracy Institute, has found that 56% of the Jewish public believe that a deal to secure the release of hostages should take top priority, compared with a third who believe that an offensive against Rafah should be the government’s main focus.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">A poll for Israel’s Channel 13 tells a similar story of scepticism in the Israel public, with 52% believing a Rafah operation will not deliver victory against Hamas, compared with 30% who believe it will. Perhaps most striking, however, is a poll by rightwing newspaper Israel Hayom, which found that 28% thought the “preferred victory picture” would represent the hostages’ release, while 17% chose an image representing the destruction of Hamas.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“Even Netanyahu, despite a thousand differences, knows what most people want,” wrote Efraim Ganor in a comment piece for the Jerusalem Post earlier this week: “The release of the hostages.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“He also knows what is important and good for the people of Israel. However, he is obeying Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, because that is what is good for Netanyahu for clear [political] reasons – and not for the people of Israel.”</p></div></div>

<p></p><p>The U.S., Egypt and Qatar are meanwhile ramping up efforts to close the gaps in <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-ceasefire-negotiations-7cec005ccd59dbd817ef9614a8611ca4">a possible agreement</a></span> for at least a temporary cease-fire and the release of some of the scores of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. Israel has linked the threatened Rafah operation to the fate of those negotiations. CIA chief William Burns, who has been shuttling around the region for talks on the cease-fire deal, met Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss closed-door negotiations.</p>
    

<p></p><p>With the seizure of Rafah, Israel now controls all of Gaza’s crossings for the first time since it withdrew troops and settlers from the territory nearly two decades ago, though it has maintained a blockade with Egypt’s cooperation for most of that time. The Rafah crossing has been a vital conduit for humanitarian aid since the start of the war and is the only place where people can enter and exit. Kerem Shalom is Gaza’s main cargo terminal.</p><p></p><p>The U.N. World Food Program deputy executive director, Carl Skau, told The Associated Press that the agency has lost access to its Gaza food warehouse in Rafah, which he said was “communicated as a no-go zone.”</p><p></p><p>“We understand that it’s still there, but we are extremely worried of looting,” Skau said during a visit to neighboring Lebanon, adding that a U.N. logistics warehouse in Rafah had already been looted. He said the WFP was able to secure a warehouse in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, but has not stocked it with food yet.</p>



<p></p><p>Associated Press journalists heard sporadic explosions and gunfire in the area of the Rafah crossing overnight, including two large blasts early Wednesday. On Wednesday afternoon, hospital records showed at least 25 people were wounded after Israeli artillery fire struck a part of central Rafah, an area Israel did not call on Palestinians to evacuate ahead of its operation. The military had no immediate comment.</p><p></p><p>An Israeli military official said that Hamas had fired unidentified projectiles at Kerem Shalom on Wednesday, confirming an earlier claim from the militant group. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity pending an official announcement, said the attack would make it difficult to continue aid deliveries but that the crossing would reopen Thursday. </p>
    

<p></p><p>COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of Palestinian civilian affairs, said the Kerem Shalom crossing reopened early Wednesday and released video of what it said were aid trucks entering the 1-kilometer-long (half-mile) area of the crossing. The video then showed their cargo being unloaded. Typically, Palestinian drivers from the other side of the crossing must pick up the aid after it is unloaded and drive it to distribution destinations within Gaza. The video did not show the aid being picked up. </p><p></p><p>Juliette Touma, the director of communications for UNRWA, said no aid had entered as of late afternoon Wednesday and that the U.N. agency had been forced to ration fuel, which is imported through Rafah. </p><p></p><p>Gaza’s Health Ministry meanwhile said at least 46 patients and wounded people who had been scheduled to leave Tuesday for medical treatment have been left stranded.</p>
    
<p></p><p>U.N. agencies and aid groups have ramped up humanitarian assistance in recent weeks as Israel has lifted some restrictions and opened an additional crossing in the north under pressure from the United States, its closest ally. </p><p></p><p>But aid workers say the closure of Rafah, which is the only gateway for the entry of fuel for trucks and generators, could have severe repercussions, and the U.N. says northern Gaza is already in a state of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-famine-world-food-program-israel-hamas-war-476941bf2dc259f85a706408b2a665ff">“full-blown famine.”</a></span></p><p></p><p>Skau of the WFP said some food has been delivered to the north in recent weeks.</p><p></p><p>“When we got up there, people were coming out of the rubble extremely weak, not even able to carry the box of food,” he said, adding that an increase in infectious diseases among children could worsen the crisis in the north.</p><p></p><p>“It’s that combination of widespread disease and acute malnutrition that is that deadly cocktail,” he said.</p><p></p><p>COGAT said 60 aid trucks entered through the northern crossing on Tuesday. Some 500 trucks entered Gaza every day before the war. </p>
    

<p></p><p>The war began when Hamas militants breached Israel’s defenses on Oct. 7 and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-hostages-0c14750240138853a70e38b0c09ef157">swept through nearby army bases and farming communities</a></span>, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Hamas is still believed to be holding around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others after most of the rest were released during a November cease-fire.</p><p></p><p>The war has killed over 34,800 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, and has driven some 80% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.

But Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners have threatened to bring down his government if he calls off an offensive or makes too many concessions in the cease-fire talks. </p><p></p><p>The U.S. has historically provided Israel with enormous amounts of military aid, which has only accelerated since the start of the war. </p><p></p><p>The paused shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) bombs and 1,700 smaller ones, with the U.S. concern focused on how the larger bombs could be used in a dense urban setting, a U.S. official said Tuesday on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. The official said no final decision had been made yet on proceeding with the shipment.</p>
