    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The US Supreme Court has struck down a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, which are rapid-fire gun accessories used in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.</li>
<li>The court's conservative majority ruled that the Justice Department was wrong to declare bump stocks as transforming semiautomatic rifles into illegal machine guns, as each trigger depression in rapid succession still only releases one shot.</li>
<li>The ruling has thrust guns back into the center of the political conversation, with some Democrats criticizing the reversal of a GOP administration's action and some Republicans supporting the ruling.</li>
<li>The decision reinforces the limits of executive reach and highlights the need for congressional action to address gun control. Two justices, Alito and Sotomayor, separately emphasized the potential for bipartisan legislation to provide a more lasting policy.</li>
<li>The Trump-era ban on bump stocks was originally implemented at the time to take pressure off Republicans to act on gun control following the Las Vegas mass shooting and another mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida.</li>

The decision came after a gunman in Las Vegas attacked a country music festival with assault rifles equipped with the accessories.</p><p></p><p>The gunman fired more than 1,000 rounds into the crowd in 11 minutes, sending thousands of people fleeing in terror as hundreds were wounded and dozens killed.</p><p></p><p>The ruling thrust guns back into the center of the political conversation with an unusual twist as Democrats decried the reversal of a GOP administration’s action and many Republicans backed the ruling.</p>
    

<p></p><p>The 6-3 majority opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas found the Justice Department was wrong to declare that bump stocks transformed semiautomatic rifles into illegal machine guns because, he wrote, each trigger depression in rapid succession still only releases one shot.</p><p></p><p>The ruling reinforced the limits of executive reach and two justices — conservative Samuel Alito and liberal Sonia Sotomayor — separately highlighted how action in Congress could potentially provide a more lasting policy, if there was political will to act in a bipartisan fashion. </p><p></p><p>Originally, imposing a ban through regulation rather than legislation during Donald Trump’s presidency took pressure off Republicans to act following the massacre and another mass shooting at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/school-shooting-parkland-florida-2084c00ad62a93bee257da06f1b907cc">a high school in Parkland, Florida</a></span>. Prospects for passing gun restrictions in the current divided Congress are dim.</p>
    
<p></p><p>President Joe Biden, who supports gun restrictions, called on Congress to reinstate the ban imposed under his political foe. Trump’s campaign team meanwhile, expressed respect for the ruling before quickly pivoting to his endorsement by the National Rifle Association.</p>
    

<p></p><p>As Trump courts gun owners while running to retake the presidency, he has appeared to play down his own administration’s actions on bump stocks, telling NRA members in February that “nothing happened” on guns during his presidency despite “great pressure.” He told the group that if he is elected again, “No one will lay a finger on your firearms.” </p><p></p><p>The 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas was carried out by a high-stakes gambler who killed himself, leaving his exact motive a mystery. A total of 60 people were killed in the shooting, including Christiana Duarte, whose family called Friday’s ruling tragic.</p><p></p><p>“The ruling is really just another way of inviting people to have another mass shooting,” said Danette Meyers, a family friend and spokesperson. “It’s unfortunate that they have to relive this again. They’re really unhappy.”</p>



<p></p><p>The opinion comes after the same Supreme Court conservative supermajority handed down <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-mississippi-state-government-delaware-california-massachusetts-3983cecfd1107c263d5309ec0d80a966">a landmark decision</a></span> expanding gun rights in 2022. The high court is also expected to rule in another gun case in the coming weeks, challenging a federal law intended to keep guns away from people under <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-guns-restrictions-domestic-violence-f75dc9b59d8cd02acf17d220ecf6ebb9">domestic violence restraining orders</a></span>. </p>
    

<p></p><p>The arguments in the bump stock case, though, were less about Second Amendment rights and more about whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a Justice Department agency, had overstepped its authority.</p><p></p><p>Bump stocks are accessories that replace a rifle’s stock, the part that rests against the shoulder. Invented in the 2000s, they harness the gun’s recoil energy so that the trigger bumps against the shooter’s stationary finger, allowing the gun to fire at a similar speed as an automatic weapon.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Court majority found that the 1934 law against machine guns defined them as weapons that could automatically fire more than one shot by a single function of the trigger. Bump stocks don’t fit that definition because “the trigger must still be released and reengaged to fire each additional shot,” Thomas wrote. He also pointed to over a decade of ATF’s findings that claimed bump stocks weren’t automatic weapons.</p><p></p><p>The plaintiff, Texas gun shop owner and military veteran Michael Cargill, applauded the ruling in a video posted online, predicting the case would have ripple effects by hampering other ATF gun restrictions. “I’m glad I stood up and fought,” he said.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-right="">

<li>The Justice Department has decided not to prosecute Attorney General Merrick Garland for contempt of Congress, despite a House vote to hold him in contempt for refusing to turn over audio recordings of President Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur.</li>
<li>The House voted 216-207 to hold Garland in contempt, with all Democrats voting against the measure and all Republicans voting in favor of it.</li>
<li>The Department of Justice (DOJ) argued that Garland's responses to subpoenas from Congress did not constitute a crime, and therefore, the DOJ will not prosecute him or take any other action to punish him.</li>
<li>The DOJ did provide lawmakers with Hur's report without redactions, facilitated his congressional testimony, and produced transcripts of the interview with Biden, among other materials.</li>
<li>House Republicans, who had been pushing for the audio recordings, were denied, and the House vote to hold Garland in contempt was seen as a way to assert their power and challenge the Justice Department's actions.</li>

            A Texas bankruptcy court judge has approved the liquidation of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ personal assets, setting the stage for repayment to the families of Sandy Hook shooting victims.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxewadte000e3j6h9rbtkxqt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Last week, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/06/media/alex-jones-assets-sandy-hook/index.html">Jones agreed to convert</a> his personal bankruptcy into a Chapter 7 liquidation. Judge Christopher Lopez on Friday agreed to that move.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxewb8r2000g3j6hphjlvwog@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Jones’ decision to seek bankruptcy protection comes after he agreed to demands from the families of Sandy Hook victims, whom he owes more than $1 billion in damages he caused by lying about the 2012 school massacre.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxf1hto00000356j1nrpqlug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The judge said an interim trustee will be appointed to oversee Jones’ estate, as is standard in these cases. Jones’ attorney Vickie Driver told the court $2.8 million from the sale of Jones’ ranch could be sent to the trustee.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxewc8m7000i3j6hxguekamt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The seismic ruling paves the way for Jones to give up Infowars, the influential conspiracy empire he founded in the late 1990s. Over the years, Jones has used the media company to poison the public discourse with lies and conspiracy theories, and he also enriched himself, making millions of dollars in the process.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxewd0xk000k3j6hadx954ub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Judge Lopez on Friday will consider liquidating Jones’ company Free Speech Systems, the parent company of Infowars, to pay the judgments to the Sandy Hook families.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxf26pit0008356jima2wclx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Jones had been opposed to liquidating Infowars and in recent days ranted on his show about what could be its impending shutdown, urging his audience to buy his products to support him.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxex7uqv000m3j6hism7x00c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Echoing those remarks he used to drum up support, Jones said Friday that his notorious media property is likely to go away as part of the ongoing bankruptcy case.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxex7w6g000o3j6h5ky7xhvl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “This is probably the end of Infowars here very, very soon,” Jones told reporters just before he entered the bankruptcy court in Houston Friday, but added, “It’s just the beginning of my fight against tyranny.”
    </p>

  

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxez0m4k0000356jp6xkik9l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Regardless of whether the judge ultimately liquidates InfoWars, whatever proceeds are gained from a sale of the company will amount to just a fraction of what he owes families of Sandy Hook victims. Still, the families, who have not received payment of the approximately $1.5 billion in judgments they have won, have pushed for InfoWars’ liquidation, along with Free Speech Systems, Infowars’ parent company.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxez0neg0002356jyqoz1o3z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The families argued to the court that there is “no prospect” the Jones’ company could produce a proper reorganization plan under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would allow the company to remain operational through its restructuring.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxez0neg0003356jv5y9g444@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Although the trustee could opt to sell the entire company to a potential buyer, the attorneys representing Sandy Hook families expect that Jones’ Infowars empire will be sold off piece by piece, with the proceeds going to their clients. That would make it unlikely – but not impossible – that InfoWars could continue operating, even in a liquidation.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxez0neg0004356jbknn7afg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The process of shutting down Infowars could play out quickly. A court-appointed trustee would be tasked with securing the assets and then selling off Jones’ media empire, including the website, studio space and broadcasting equipment.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxez0neg0005356jx5l643ik@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Nothing the judge would rule on Friday would prevent Jones from spreading conspiracy theories and lies online. X CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/09/business/alex-jones-restored-x-elon-musk-poll/index.html">restored Jones’ social media account</a> in December 2023 after a five-year ban from the platform. And Jones could go on any number of far-right outlets to share his outlandish views.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxez0neg0006356j85v44jpz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            But the Sandy Hook families are hoping to seize Jones’ social media accounts, arguing they are a key part of his InfoWars business that allow Jones to promote his brand. And Jones may not be welcome at some venues: He had been listed as a guest on the Milwaukee stop on Tucker Carlson’s live tour but was recently dropped from the lineup without explanation.

            Since founding Infowars in the late 1990s, Jones has pushed several conspiracy theories, including the lie that the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, mass school shooting was a so-called “false flag” operation staged by the government and that the grieving family members of 20 child victims were “actors.” Jones makes money on those conspiracy theories by hawking high-priced dietary supplements to his audience.

            The mood Friday on Jones’ Infowars was somber, with the far-right outlet’s hosts speculating on its future. Chase Geiser, an Infowars host who had driven with Jones to the courthouse where the bankruptcy hearing was underway, made a brief appearance on the outlet, attempting to twist the judge’s decision as one that would net Jones an even larger audience.

            Jones’ regularly scheduled program was replaced with previously recorded interviews, airing conversations with Tucker Carlson and Russell Brand.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that Ukraine surrender four southeastern regions that Russian troops partly occupy and renounce plans to join NATO as conditions for Russia to "immediately" stop hostilities and start negotiations to end the war.</li>
<li>Putin's demands would require Ukraine to capitulate and lose more than one-fifth of its sovereign territory, including Crimea which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.</li>
<li>The Russian leader's remarks come ahead of an international "peace" conference organized by Ukraine in Switzerland this weekend, where President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to call for Russia's complete withdrawal of military forces and end to Moscow's occupation of Ukraine.</li>
<li>Ukraine has refused to accept Putin's conditions, and Zelensky has reiterated his call for Russia's withdrawal from occupied areas and an end to the occupation of Ukraine.</li>
<li>Putin's demands would essentially amount to a surrender by Ukraine and a significant loss of territory, while Ukraine has insisted on maintaining its sovereignty and territorial integrity.</li>

The agency said that overly-saturated soils from the precipitation created the opportunity for flash floods and could bring 10 additional inches of rain in some locations. </p><p>The last time such a warning was issued was in 2022, CBS News senior weather producer David Parkinson said. As of Friday, the risk for excessive rainfall has been downgraded to moderate, he added. </p>

    </p>
<p>Despite the downgraded warning, there is still potential for significant damage and flooding. The NWS said early Friday that continued rainfall could bring "considerable to locally <a href="https://x.com/NWS/status/1801439352641491055" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">catastrophic urban flooding</a>" through the day across South Florida. The service's Miami station says that a <a href="https://x.com/NWSMiami/status/1801526582823231736" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">flood watch </a>will remain in effect through Friday evening. </p><p>About 20 inches of rain – nearly 2 feet – had fallen in some areas, and forecasters said another <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&amp;issuedby=MFL&amp;product=AFD&amp;format=CI&amp;version=1&amp;glossary=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">2 to 4 inches of rain</a> is possible Friday, with some areas seeing even higher amounts.  While hurricane forecaster Alex DaSilva told the Associated Press that June is Florida's wettest month, he said it's "<a href="https://apnews.com/article/rain-florida-flooding-what-to-know-6f0a512f1406cee0e37a31df1c75d3cf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">unusual</a>" how much rain has come in just a few days. </p><p>Two weather systems are behind the weather, DaSilva told the AP, saying that they are working to essentially channel in moisture from the Caribbean. </p><p>"It is essentially a fire hose turned on jet mode," DaSilva said. "We also have a stalled front across Florida, which has helped to enhance the precipitation." </p>

<p>As of Friday afternoon, the NWS' Miami office said that the "plume of enhanced moisture" that has been sitting over South Florida in recent days has shifted south, with the bulk of it now lying over the Florida Keys. Scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected in the southern part of the state for the rest of the day, although they won't be as widespread as earlier in the week. Still, because the clouds are moving out, the region will see more intense heat supporting more heavy downpours, the office said. </p><p>"Some areas could see between 1-2" of rain, with localized higher amounts possible through the day which could trigger concerns for flash flooding, especially for vulnerable areas that received several inches of rain over the past several days," forecasters said. </p><p>More storms are expected through the weekend before triple-digit temperatures are expected to creep in the middle of next week. </p><p>The torrential downpour and flooding that has shut down streets and even caused a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sarasota-rain-record-flooding-nearly-4-inches-hour-it-could-happen-again-weather/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">1-in-1,000-year event</a></span> farther north in Sarasota, comes at the beginning of the Atlantic hurricane season, which officials predicted would be "<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/atlantic-hurricane-season-2024-predictions-colorado-state/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">extremely active</a></span>."</p><p>This hurricane season, which officially started June 1, is expected to bring up to <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-names-list-2024-season/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">25 named storms</a></span>, up to 13 hurricanes and between four and seven major hurricanes that are at least category 3. Major hurricane status, however, does not mean lesser-grade hurricanes or storms will not pose significant threats of their own, as hurricane grading relies alone on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which only accounts for wind speed and not storm surge, flooding and other impacts. </p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Parkland, Florida school building where 17 people were killed in a shooting six years ago is being demolished, sparking mixed emotions among still grieving parents.</li>
<li>The demolition began on Friday, with some family members of the victims in attendance. The perpetrator, Nikolas Cruz, was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2022.</li>
<li>Some parents, like Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter Alyssa was killed, want the building gone, as it serves as a painful reminder of the tragedy. However, others, like Gena and Thomas Hoyer, who lost their son Luke, prefer to leave the building standing as a memorial to their child.</li>
<li>The local school board in Broward County has yet to determine what will replace the building, with suggestions including a field for the school's band or JROTC, as well as a pathway to a temporary memorial.</li>
<li>The school shooting in 2018 is considered one of the deadliest in U.S. history, and the demolition of the building is seen as a step towards healing for some family members, while others prefer to honor the victims by keeping the building standing.</li>

The criminal returned to the scene of the culminating crime of his presidency.</p><p>And he returned in triumph, enjoying the spectacle as House and Senate Republicans “bowed and prayed to the neon god they made.” ​</p><p>The scene was appalling. The capitulation to Trump by Mitch McConnell, and the adoration of Trump by all those other Republican members of Congress, was contemptible. What has happened to any sense of Republican self-respect?</p><p>The scene was also ridiculous. Trump reportedly made his usual quota of bizarre statements. His narcissism was on full display. But the Republican elected officials bent the knee. What has happened to any sense of Republican seriousness?</p><p>Moral indignation and intellectual despondency are both justified reactions to this moment of Trumpian triumph. But there’s of course another justified reaction: Alarm.</p><p>Because what happened yesterday could have some real effect.</p><p>Say you’re a Republican business type. You never liked Trump, but you went along in 2016. You hung in there in 2020. But you were shaken by January 6th.</p><p>You spent the next three years hoping the party would move beyond Trump—though you continued to support congressional Republicans as a check on the excesses of the Biden administration and the Democrats. You hoped one of the other Republican candidates would take off in 2023. You voted for Nikki Haley in the primary in 2024. You watched Mike Pence, his former vice president, say he wouldn’t vote for Trump.</p><p>So you told yourself—and of course you told your wife@—that you just might not be able to vote for Trump in November.</p><p>But now Nikki says he’s okay. Now Mitch has welcomed his back. </p><p><span>So now you tell yourself: </span><em>Hey, if they’re okay with him, I’m okay with him. If they can live with this, I can live with this. Trump’s not gonna be too crazy. He’s going to govern as a normal Republican. Yes, he’’ll say some ridiculous things—but it won’t really be too bad. In fact, he’ll do some good. I’m comfortable voting for him again. And I think I can get my better half to go along too.</em></p><p>So yesterday marked the culmination of the “normie” Republican’s progress, from “Never Again Trump” in 2021, to “I’d Prefer Not Trump” in 2022 and 2023, to “I’m OK with Trump and I’m Writing a Check” in 2024.</p><p>I don’t want to overstate how many votes we’re talking about here. But making it harder to persuade some Republicans to join the “can’t support Trump” camp of Mike Pence and Paul Ryan—let alone to sign up in the “need to vote against Trump” brigade of Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger–is not nothing. The permission structure grows ever stronger for the return home of more normie Republicans.</p><p><span>And if they </span><em>all</em><span> return home, Donald Trump won’t just be visiting Capitol Hill every now and then. He’ll be moving back into the White House on January 20, 2025. </span></p><p><strong> —William Kristol</strong></p><p><hr></p><p><span>2016 was only eight years ago. 2016 was a </span><em>lifetime </em><span>ago.

<li>A federal court has temporarily blocked the Education Department from enforcing new regulations aimed at protecting transgender students in schools, pending further litigation.</li>
<li>The regulations, issued in April, seek to interpret Title IX to ban discrimination in schools based on sex, including gender identity and sexual orientation.</li>
<li>Specifically, the rules would require schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity and to use students' preferred pronouns.</li>
<li>The regulations are set to take effect on August 1 and would impact every K-12 school, college, and university that accepts federal funding.</li>
<li>Opponents of the regulations argue that they are likely to prevail in the lawsuit, and the court has temporarily blocked the regulations pending the outcome of the litigation.</li>

<p>LONDON (AP) — The Princess of Wales said Friday she she is “making good progress” in her cancer treatment and will attend Saturday’s royal Trooping the Color ceremony, Kate’s first public appearance since her diagnosis. </p>



<p>The 42-year-old wife of Prince William has not made any public appearances this year. She announced in March that she was undergoing chemotherapy for an unspecified form of cancer.</p>





<p>“I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,” Kate said in a statement released Friday, adding that she faces “a few more months” of treatment. </p>



<p>“I’m looking forward to attending The King’s Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet,” Kate said. </p>



<p>The announcement is a significant milestone, but does not mark a return to full-time public duties for Kate.</p>



<p>Trooping the Color, also known as the King’s Birthday Parade, is an annual military parade that marks the monarch’s official birthday in June. King Charles III, who also is being treated for an undisclosed form of cancer, is due to oversee the ceremony, in which troops in full dress uniform parade past the king with their ceremonial flag, or “color.”</p>





<p>Kate is expected to travel in a horse-drawn carriage from Buckingham Palace with the couple’s children — Prince George, 10; Princess Charlotte, 9; and Prince Louis, who is 6 — before watching the ceremony from a building beside the parade ground. She may also join other royals for a traditional Buckingham Palace balcony appearance.</p>



<p>Kate’s announcement in March came after speculation proliferated on social media about her well being and absence from public view. She has revealed few details about her illness, which was discovered after what she described as major abdominal surgery in January.</p>



<p>In a March video message, Kate said the diagnosis had come as “a huge shock, and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family.”</p>





<p>On Friday Kate thanked members of the public, saying she had been “blown away by all the kind messages of support and encouragement.”</p>





<p>“I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal,” she said. “Thank you so much for your continued understanding, and to all of you who have so bravely shared your stories with me.”</p>



<p>Charles, 75, disclosed his cancer in February, and has recently eased back into public duties. He attended commemorations this week for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe on June 6, 1944.</p>



<p>Charles is likely to travel to Saturday’s event by carriage with Queen Camilla and is expected to watch the ceremony seated on a dais, rather than on horseback as he did last year.</p>

            “They also have damaged aid trucks and dumped life-saving humanitarian aid onto the road.  On May 13, 2024, Tzav 9 members looted and then set fire to two trucks near Hebron in the West Bank carrying humanitarian aid destined for men, women, and children in Gaza,” he said.

            “We will not tolerate acts of sabotage and violence targeting this essential humanitarian assistance,” he said. “We will continue to use all tools at our disposal to promote accountability for those who attempt or undertake such heinous acts, and we expect and urge that Israeli authorities do the same.”

            In a statement Friday, Tzav 9 described the Biden administration’s imposition of sanctions as “shocking,” adding, “It is a fatal blow to the families who aim to stop the aid to the enemy Hamas in time of war.”

    <div><div class="wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content css-ibbk12" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"><p>At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States military launched a secret campaign to counter what it perceived as China’s growing influence in the Philippines, a nation hit especially hard by the <a href="/news/2024/1/18/what-is-disease-x-and-how-will-pandemic-preparations-help-the-world">deadly virus</a>, an investigation by the Reuters news agency has found.</p>
<p>Through phony internet accounts meant to impersonate Filipinos, the military’s propaganda efforts morphed into an anti-vaccination campaign, Reuters reported in a story released on Friday. Social media posts decried the quality of face masks, test kits and the first vaccine that would become available in the Philippines – China’s Sinovac inoculation.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 4 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 4 of 4</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>The clandestine operation has not been previously reported. It aimed to sow doubt about the safety and efficacy of vaccines and other life-saving aid that was being supplied by China, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-covid-propaganda/" target="_blank">Reuters investigation</a> found.</p>
<p>It identified at least 300 accounts on X, formerly Twitter, that matched descriptions shared by former US military officials familiar with the operation. Almost all were created in the middle of 2020 and centred on the slogan #Chinaangvirus – Tagalog for “China is the virus.”</p>
<p>“COVID came from China and the VACCINE also came from China, don’t trust China!” one typical tweet from July 2020 read. The words were posted next to a photo of a syringe beside a Chinese flag and a soaring chart of infections. Another post read: “From China – PPE, Face Mask, Vaccine: FAKE. But the Coronavirus is real.”</p>
<p>After Reuters asked X about the accounts, the social media company removed the profiles, determining they were part of a coordinated bot campaign based on activity patterns and internal data.</p>

<p>The US military’s anti-vax effort began in the spring of 2020 and expanded beyond Southeast Asia before it was terminated in mid-2021.</p>
<p>The Pentagon tailored the campaign to local audiences across Central Asia and the Middle East using a combination of fake social media accounts on multiple platforms to spread fear of China’s vaccines among Muslims at a time when the virus was killing tens of thousands of people each day.</p>
<p>A key part of the strategy: amplify the disputed contention that, because vaccines sometimes contain pork gelatin, China’s shots could be considered forbidden under Islamic law.</p>
<p>The military programme started under former President Donald Trump and continued months into Joe Biden’s presidency – even after alarmed social media executives warned the new administration that the Pentagon had been trafficking in COVID misinformation, Reuters said.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Americas Coverage Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>The Biden White House issued an edict in spring 2021 banning the anti-vax effort, which also disparaged vaccines produced by other rivals, and the Pentagon initiated an internal review.</p>
<p>Spokespeople for Trump and Biden did not respond to requests for comment about the clandestine programme, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>A senior Department of Defense official acknowledged the US military engaged in secret propaganda to disparage China’s vaccine in the developing world, but the unnamed official declined to provide details.</p>
<p>A Pentagon spokeswoman said the US military “uses a variety of platforms, including social media, to counter those malign influence attacks aimed at the US, allies and partners”. She alleged China started a “disinformation campaign to falsely blame the United States for the spread of COVID-19”.</p>
<h2 id="ismayed-disappointed-disillusioned">‘Dismayed, disappointed, disillusioned’</h2>
<p>In an email, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it has long maintained the US government manipulates social media and spreads misinformation.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Philippines Department of Health said the “findings by Reuters deserve to be investigated and heard by the appropriate authorities of the involved countries”.</p>
<p>Some American public health experts condemned the Pentagon programme, saying it put civilians in jeopardy for potential geopolitical gain.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s defensible,” said Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Dartmouth College’s Geisel School of Medicine. “I’m extremely dismayed, disappointed and disillusioned to hear that the US government would do that.”</p>
<p>The effort to stoke fear about Chinese inoculations risked undermining overall public trust in government health initiatives, including US-made vaccines that became available later, Lucey and others said.</p>
<p>Although the Chinese vaccines were found to be less effective than the American-led shots by Pfizer and Moderna, all were approved by the World Health Organization. Sinovac did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>“It should have been in our interest to get as much vaccine in people’s arms as possible,” said Greg Treverton, former chairman of the US National Intelligence Council, which coordinates the analysis and strategy of Washington’s many spy agencies.</p>
<p>What the Pentagon did, Treverton said, “crosses a line”.</p>
