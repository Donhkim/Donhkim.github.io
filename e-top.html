Kind of like walking on Mars.”</p>

<p>Dozens of locations in the West and Pacific Northwest tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing this week.</p>
    
<p>At Death Valley National Park, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer the National Park Service keeps near the visitor center. It’s not precise, registering the temperature anywhere from 1 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit higher than more modern instruments kept by the National Weather Service nearby, providing a more impressive reading for pictures.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

<p>“This is an incredibly popular place to be, as you can see from the visitors behind me,” supervisory park ranger Jeanette Jurado said Tuesday by the thermometer, which read 120 F (48.9 C). “But even in the wintertime, people might find that 80 degrees in December is unusual and worthy of taking a picture.”</p><p>An excessive heat warning was also in place for much of Washington and Oregon on Tuesday, with the potential for temperatures to reach up to 110 F (43.3 C) in areas, posing a major risk for heat-related illness, the National Weather Service said. Temperatures in parts of Idaho, including Boise, were expected to reach over 100 F (37.7 C) on Tuesday.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

        </div><p>The early U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was record warm <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/record-heat-climate-change-june-el-nino-copernicus-95f7028e64c2271b7445a11b247afef8">for the 13th straight month</a></span> and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.</p>
    

<p>In eastern California’s sizzling desert, a high of 128 F (53.3 C) was recorded over the weekend at Death Valley National Park, where a visitor, who was not identified, died Saturday from heat exposure. Another person was hospitalized. </p><p>They were among six motorcyclists riding through the Badwater Basin area in scorching weather, the park said in a statement. The other four were treated at the scene. Emergency medical helicopters were unable to respond because the aircraft cannot generally fly safely over 120 F (48.8 C), officials said. </p><p>Death Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.</p><p>“It’s impressive,” Thomas Mrzliek, of Basel, Switzerland, said of the triple-digit heat. “It like a wave that hits when you get out of the car, but it’s a very dry heat. So it’s not as in Europe.”</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

<p>Across the desert in Nevada, Las Vegas already had hit 103 F (39.4 C) by 9:30 a.m. Tuesday and was likely to approach 120 F (48.8 C) again by day’s end. </p><p>“Intense heatwave will continue to set records through the end of the week before moderating as increasing monsoonal moisture returns to the area,” the National Weather Service in Las Vegas said. </p><p>In Arizona, the average temperatures for the first eight days of July have been the hottest on record for Phoenix and Yuma, said the National Weather Service in Phoenix. It said both cities will remain at about 10 degrees above normal over the next few days, with highs mostly between 112 F (44.4 C) and 120 F (48.8 C). </p><p>Extreme heat and a longstanding drought in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.</p>
    

<p>In California, firefighters were battling least 18 wildfires Tuesday, including a 41-square-mile (106-square-kilometer) blaze in the mountains of Santa Barbara County. The Lake Fire was only 12% contained, and forecasters warned of a “volatile combination” of high heat, low humidity and northwest winds developing late in the day.</p><p>North of Los Angeles, the 2-square-mile (5-square-kilometer) Vista Fire chewed through trees in the San Bernardino National Forest and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible across the region. A small but smoky blaze, dubbed the Royal Fire, burned through more than 150 acres (60 hectares) of forest west of Lake Tahoe and sent ash raining down on the tourist town of Truckee, California. Neither fire was contained Tuesday.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

                    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. and an array of other NATO allies will send Ukraine dozens of air defense systems in the coming months, including at least four of the powerful Patriot systems that Kyiv has been desperately seeking to help fight off Russian advances in the war, according to a new joint agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Watch in the player above.</strong></p>
<p>“Today I’m announcing a historic donation of air defense equipment for Ukraine,” President Joe Biden said Tuesday at the opening of the NATO summit in Washington. “The United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Italy will provide Ukraine with the equipment for five additional strategic air defense systems.”</p>
<p>In addition, he said that in the coming months the United States and others will provide dozens of other tactical air defense systems and hundreds of munitions for them.</p>
<p>The announcement was made with much fanfare as the summit opened at the Mellon Auditorium, where the North Atlantic Treaty was first signed in 1949, establishing NATO. There both Biden and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg spoke urgently about the importance of the alliance and the need to stand together in support of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin wants nothing less than to “wipe Ukraine off the map,” Biden said. “And we know Putin won’t stop in Ukraine. But make no mistake, Ukraine can and will stop Putin.”</p>
<p>According to the joint statement released Tuesday, the U.S., Germany and Romania will send Ukraine additional Patriot batteries, while the Netherlands and others will provide Patriot components to make up one more battery. Italy will provide a SAMP-T air defense system.</p>
<p>Other allies, including Canada, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom, will provide a number of other systems that will help Ukraine expand its coverage. Those systems include NASAMS, HAWKs, IRIS T-SLM, IRIS T-SLS and Gepards. And other nations have agreed to provide munitions for those systems.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a social media post on Tuesday, made it clear that air defense is still his country’s key request, and he has repeatedly asked for more Patriot systems.</p>
<p>“We are fighting for more air defense systems for Ukraine, and I’m confident we will succeed,” he said. “We are also striving to secure more aircraft, including F-16s. Additionally, we are pushing for enhanced security guarantees for Ukraine, including weapons, financial aid, and political support.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, he said Ukraine urgently needs seven more Patriot batteries to fend off Russian strikes against the power grid, the military and civilian areas using destructive glide bombs.</p>
<p>The Patriot systems, he said, would help prevent Russian aircraft from flying close enough to drop the glide bombs on civilians and critical infrastructure. He said Russia had been firing 3,000 bombs into his country each month.</p>
<p>The commitment for new air defense systems comes as Russia continues its relentless bombardment of Ukraine, including a massive barrage that struck a children’s hospital in Kyiv on Monday and killed at least 42 people.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Zelenskyy urged “decisive actions” from the U.S. and Europe to strengthen his troops and vowed to do everything possible to defeat Russia.</p>
<p>The United States has already sent Ukraine two Patriot missile systems — one late last year and, according to U.S. officials, another last month. And Romania’s top defense body said late last month that the country would donate a Patriot missile system to neighboring Ukraine.</p>
<p>A number of European allies have been reluctant to part with their air defense systems, as they worry about possible threats from Russia as well.</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin two years ago set up a coalition of more than 50 countries to help gather and coordinate contributions of weapons and training to Ukraine.</p>

            “Normally, early-season storm activity doesn’t tell us much about what is going to happen the rest of the time,” Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University, told CNN. “But when storms are strong in the tropical Atlantic and eastern Caribbean, it tends to be a harbinger of a very busy season.”
    </p>

            The busiest part of Atlantic hurricane season doesn’t typically begin until mid-August and peaks in September, but Beryl – which initially formed in late June – behaved like it already arrived. The water Beryl raced through was as warm as it should be in September, so it behaved like a September hurricane.

            “Beryl confirms what we thought about (this) season, that given the extremely warm (water) temperatures that we currently have, we could experience mid-season-type storms earlier than normal,” Klotzbach said.

            Beryl rapidly intensified faster than any other storm on record this early in the season when its winds increased by 65 mph in just 24 hours, according to Klotzbach. Rapid intensification is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/12/us/hurricanes-climate-change/">becoming more likely</a> as the climate crisis advances.

            “Beryl’s early and rapid intensification is indicative of the types of extreme weather events we may see more frequently in a warming world,” according to Mona Hemmati, a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University’s Climate School. Beryl “encapsulates many of the fears scientists have for this hurricane season,” Hemmati told CNN.

            The storm took advantage of extremely warm waters and eventually strengthened into the Atlantic’s earliest Category 5 hurricane on record – one of several milestones no other early July hurricane has reached.

            Beryl’s unprecedented performance only solidified a chorus of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/18/weather/la-nina-hurricane-season-climate/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expert voices</a> – including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/04/weather/hurricane-season-forecast-climate/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Klotzbach’s team at Colorado State</a> – who called for a hyperactive hurricane season well before the first three named storms – Alberto, Beryl and Chris – formed.

            “This early season activity is a likely warning sign that things are going to be very busy once we move closer to the peak of the season,” Klotzbach cautioned.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyentv7t000p3b6jneonkaxt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Klotzbach’s group of forecasters at Colorado State increased the number of named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes expected this season in an <a href="https://tropical.colostate.edu/Forecast/2024-07.pdf" target="_blank">update to their hurricane season forecast</a> Tuesday. They now predict the Atlantic season will have 25 named storms including 12 hurricanes, half of which will become major hurricanes of at least Category 3 strength.
    </p>

            The forecast also relies on a burgeoning <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/13/weather/el-nino-la-nina-summer-forecast-climate/index.html">La Niña</a> that should ease wind shear – the change in wind speed or direction at different heights in the atmosphere – over the Atlantic. High levels of wind shear can tear apart an active storm or prevent one from forming in the first place. Without it, more storms could form and strengthen.
    </p>

            But extremely warm water will stick around through the peak of hurricane season and storms could take full advantage of it to overcome wind shear, just like Beryl did.
    </p>

            The extremely warm water kept Beryl incredibly strong, even in the face of disruptive wind shear that should have weakened it considerably. This also happened during <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/weather/hurricane-season-el-nino-climate/index.html">last year’s hurricane season</a> when El Niño brought increased wind shear but incredibly warm water still helped 20 named storms form.

            For now, a brief pause in Atlantic tropical activity is expected over the next week or two due in part to a large area of dry, dusty air and some bouts of moderately disruptive wind shear.

            Plumes of dry air filled with Saharan dust traveling across the Atlantic from Africa are typical around this time of year. It can sometimes even reach the United States and help produce stunning sunsets.

            But dry, dusty air isn’t a friend to tropical systems. It cuts off the moisture a system needs to survive, so the National Hurricane Center isn’t highlighting any areas to watch for tropical development over the next week.

            When the break will end and the busiest part of hurricane season will get underway is the “million dollar question,” according to Klotzbach. Tropical activity could ramp up again later in July or hold off until August depending on how several atmospheric factors play out in the next couple of weeks, he told CNN.

            Either way, with such an extreme ocean heat to tap into, Beryl proved the door is wide open for a prolific season.

<h2>Massachusetts State Police union responds to suspension</h2><p>On Tuesday, State Police Association of Massachusetts president Brian Williams said the union "will never condone the unacceptable language used in personal text messages" sent by Proctor.</p><p>"To date, we have received no information to indicate that his suspension was the result of anything other than these text message exchanges," Williams' statement read. "We would like to reiterate that unless the department's ongoing investigation proves otherwise, yesterday's actions have no relationship to salacious allegations of cover-ups, collusion or conspiracies offered by the defense."</p><p>Read is accused of hitting and killing her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, with her SUV in 2022. Her defense claims she is the victim of a coverup by several people, including law enforcement.</p><p>The monthslong trial, which gained national attention, ended with a mistrial due to a hung jury.</p>

<p>"Every member of the Massachusetts State Police hopes that the O'Keefe Family finds peace, comfort, and closure as they continue to mourn the loss of their loved one," Williams said in his statement. "Until the focus is shifted away from collateral issues and back to investigating and prosecuting the death of John O'Keefe, the justice his family deserves will be delayed."</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The prosecution has presented a strong case against Sen. Bob Menendez (D-New Jersey), alleging that he is guilty of corruption and misuse of power. The article highlights specific evidence, including incriminating text messages and the origins of cash and gold bars found in his home.</li>
<li>Menendez has offered multiple explanations for the cash and gold, including that his wife, Nadine, kept the door to the closet locked, which the prosecution has called "preposterous" and "defy[ing] logic".</li>
<li>The prosecution argues that Menendez had access to the closet and knew about the cash and gold, but has not been able to provide a credible explanation for their presence.</li>
<li>In a related development, Menendez has been accused of trying to influence the prosecution of a friend who was indicted for bank fraud in 2018 by trying to have a New Jersey federal prosecutor handpicked by him.</li>
<li>The case against Menendez is nearing its end, and the article suggests that the prosecution's argument is likely to sway the jury in favor of conviction.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Ariane-6 rocket blasts off on maiden flight</strong>: Europe's new rocket, Ariane-6, has successfully launched from a launchpad in French Guiana at 19:00 GMT.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstration mission</strong>: The rocket was on a demonstration mission to put a clutch of satellites in orbit, and crews on the ground in Kourou applauded as it soared into the sky.</li>
<li><strong>Anomaly with upper stage</strong>: After climbing smoothly to the desired altitude and releasing the satellites, the upper stage of the rocket experienced an anomaly right at the end of the flight, resulting in premature shut down of the auxiliary power unit (APU).</li>
<li><strong>Cost and development</strong>: Ariane-6 was developed at a cost of €4bn (£3.4bn) and is intended to replace the Ariane-5 rocket, which has been in service since 1999.</li>
<li><strong>First test for Ariane-6</strong>: This was the first test flight of Ariane-6, which is expected to become the main workhorse for European satellite launches. Despite the anomaly, the launch was seen as a promising start for the new rocket.</li>

    <div><div class="field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body"><p><strong>Note</strong>: View the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-07/affadavit_for_968_x_accounts.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">affidavit for search of 968 X accounts here</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-07/affidavit_for_two_domains.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">affidavit for domains seizure here</a>.</p>

<p>The Justice Department today announced the seizure of two domain names and the search of 968 social media accounts used by Russian actors to create an AI-enhanced social media bot farm that spread disinformation in the United States and abroad. The social media bot farm used elements of AI to create fictitious social media profiles — often purporting to belong to individuals in the United States — which the operators then used to promote messages in support of Russian government objectives, according to affidavits unsealed today.</p>

<p>In conjunction with the domain seizures and search warrant announced today, the FBI and the Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF), in partnership with Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), the Netherlands General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD), Netherlands Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD), and Netherlands Police released a <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2024/240709.pdf">joint cybersecurity advisory</a> detailing the technology behind the social media bot farm, including details regarding how the bot farm’s creators leveraged their bespoke AI system in furtherance of the scheme. The advisory will allow social media platforms and researchers to identify and prevent the Russian government’s further use of the technology. In addition, X Corp. (formerly, Twitter) voluntarily suspended the remaining bot accounts identified in the court documents for terms of service violations.</p>

<p>“With these actions, the Justice Department has disrupted a Russian-government backed, AI-enabled propaganda campaign to use a bot farm to spread disinformation in the United States and abroad,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “As the Russian government continues to wage its brutal war in Ukraine and threatens democracies around the world, the Justice Department will continue to deploy all of our legal authorities to counter Russian aggression and protect the American people.”</p>

<p>“Today’s action demonstrates that the Justice Department and our partners will not tolerate Russian government actors and their agents deploying AI to sow disinformation and fuel division among Americans,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. “As malign actors accelerate their criminal misuse of AI, the Justice Department will respond and we will prioritize disruptive actions with our international partners and the private sector. We will not hesitate to shut down bot farms, seize illegally obtained internet domains, and take the fight to our adversaries.”</p>

<p>“Today’s actions represent a first in disrupting a Russian-sponsored Generative AI-enhanced social media bot farm,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “Russia intended to use this bot farm to disseminate AI-generated foreign disinformation, scaling their work with the assistance of AI to undermine our partners in Ukraine and influence geopolitical narratives favorable to the Russian government. The FBI is committed to working with our partners and deploying joint, sequenced operations to strategically disrupt our most dangerous adversaries and their use of cutting-edge technology for nefarious purposes.”</p>

<p>“We support all civic engagement, civil dialogue, and a robust exchange of ideas,” said U.S. Attorney Gary Restaino for the District of Arizona. “But those ideas should be generated by Americans, for Americans. The disruption announced today protects us from those who use unlawful means to seek to mislead our citizens and our communities.”</p>

<p>“The disruption announced today is the result of a combined response with our international partners to a serious and unique threat,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Morris Pasqual for the Northern District of Illinois. “Multiple U.S. and foreign governmental components worked closely and efficiently to address the threat and develop and execute a mitigation strategy. Through vigorous enforcement efforts and collaborative international partnerships, the Justice Department works tirelessly to disrupt criminal cyber activity.”</p>

<p><b><u>Overview</u></b></p>

<p>According to court documents, a bot farm is an enhanced software package which allows for the creation of false personas on social media platforms. Bot farms are enhanced by integrating components which contain artificial intelligence, such as image production or text generation.</p>

<p>As described in the affidavits filed in support of the warrants, development of the social media bot farm was organized by an individual identified in Russia (Individual A). In early 2022, Individual A worked as the deputy editor-in-chief at RT, a state-run Russian news organization based in Moscow. Since at least 2022, RT leadership sought the development of alternative means for distributing information beyond RT’s standard television news broadcasts. In response, Individual A led the development of software that was able to create and to operate a social media bot farm. As planned, the social media bot farm would create fictitious online personas for social media accounts, through which RT, or any operator of the bot farm, could distribute information on a wide-scale basis. The development was executed by Individual B and others, who hid their identities and location (Russia) while beginning to purchase infrastructure for the social media bot farm in April 2022.</p>

<p>In early 2023, with the approval and financial support of the Presidential Administration of Russia (aka the Kremlin), a Russian FSB officer (FSB Officer 1) created and led a private intelligence organization (P.I.O.), as explained in the affidavits. The P.I.O.’s membership was comprised of, among others, employees at RT, including Individual A. The true purpose of the P.I.O. was to advance the mission of the FSB and the Russian government, including by spreading disinformation through the social media accounts created by the bot farm.</p>

<p>According to the affidavits, FSB Officer 1, Individual A, and other members of the PIO had access to the social media bot farm. The following are examples of Russian-government narratives that the bot farm posted on X in October and November 2023:</p>

<ul><li>A purported U.S. constituent replied to a candidate for federal office’s social media posts regarding the conflict in Ukraine with a video of President Putin justifying Russia’s actions in Ukraine;</li>
</ul>


<ul><li>A purported resident of Minneapolis, Minnesota, posted a video of President Putin discussing his belief that certain geographic areas of Poland, Ukraine, and Lithuania were “gifts” to those countries from the Russian forces that liberated them from Nazi control during World War II;</li>
</ul>


<ul><li>A purported U.S. resident of a city identified only as “Gresham,” posted a video claiming that the number of foreign fighters embedded with Ukrainian forces was significantly lower than public estimates;</li>
</ul>





<ul><li>The same purported individual posted a video of President Putin claiming that the war in Ukraine is not a territorial conflict or a matter of geopolitical balance, but rather the “principles on which the New World Order will be based.”</li>
</ul>


<p>To register the fictitious social media accounts, the social media bot farm relied on private email servers, which in turn relied on the two domain names seized by the FBI. An individual who controls an internet domain can create email accounts using the domain. For example, an individual controlling the domain name www.example.com can create email accounts using @example.com (e.g., EmailAddress@example.com). Here, the actors obtained and controlled the domain names “mlrtr.com” and “otanmail.com” from a U.S.-based provider. They then used those domains to create the email servers that ultimately allowed them to create fictitious social media accounts using the bot farm software.</p>

<p>The FSB’s use of U.S.-based domain names, which the software used to register the bots, violates the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In addition, the accompanying payments for that infrastructure violate federal money laundering laws.</p>

<p>The Justice Department commends members of the private sector who coordinated with law enforcement efforts on this disruption, including X for its voluntary efforts to suspend the identified bot accounts from its platform. Prior to the government’s action, X identified and suspended a significant number of the bot accounts.</p>

<p>The Justice Department’s investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>The National Security Division’s National Security Cyber Section, U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona, and U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois are prosecuting the case, with valuable assistance from the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Oldest president in Iran</strong>: Masoud Pezeshkian, 69, has been elected as the oldest president in Iran's history, with a career spanning decades as a member of Parliament and cabinet minister.</li>
<li><strong>Low voter turnout</strong>: The election was marked by a low voter turnout, with less than half of Iran's eligible voters participating, and only 25% casting a ballot for Pezeshkian.</li>
<li><strong>Moderate win in hardline-dominated system</strong>: As a moderate, Pezeshkian will need to navigate a system dominated by hardliners, which may limit his ability to implement significant reforms.</li>
<li><strong>Limited expectations and ambitions</strong>: Expectations for Pezeshkian's presidency are low, and his ambitions seem modest, with a focus on delivering on his election promises within the limits of laws and regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Characterized as an "ethical reformist"</strong>: Professor Hassan Mohammadi from the University of Tehran described Pezeshkian as an "ethical reformist" who will try to deliver on his election promises, but within the constraints of the system.</li>

<p>In other words, Pezeshkian has no grand vision to reshape Iran's authoritarian theocracy, or to challenge the supremacy of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's conservative Supreme Leader, even though many Iranians long for just that.</p><p>What he is likely to do, is try to soften some of the regime's harsher measures, such as the rules on mandatory head coverings for women.</p><p>"The morality police, fines and other types of punishment must be put aside," Pezeshkian said on the campaign trail in June.

<p>Hardliners will inevitably push back, and that may well be the first real test of the new president's power. </p><p>In fact, Pezeshikian has apparently already had a taste of what's to come. Two days ago, the president-elect had a friendly phone call with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Iran's important neighbor Turkey, which successfully embraces both Islamic and secular life. </p><p>A prominent <a href="https://x.com/e_souzanchi?t=oeAkOv5j1Ws5Tt2GDpxQlg&amp;s=08" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Iranian academic posted</a> on X that, after that phone call, the Turkish Airlines office in Tehran was closed and sealed because female Turkish staff inside were not wearing headscarves in line with Iran's rules.</p><p>During his campaign, Pezeshkian also intimated that he would free up the internet and make more websites accessible. At the moment, it is tightly restricted in Iran. Social media sites such as TikTok, Facebook and X are officially banned, as is access to U.S. and European news sites, including CBS News.</p><p>Many young, tech-savvy Iranians have become adept at getting around the restrictions, but it's cumbersome, and when the regime slows down internet speeds at politically sensitive times, the whole system becomes unusable. </p><p>A national survey recently found Iran's internet service is among the worst in the world.</p><p>Pezeshkian says he wants to make it better.</p>

<p>"Filtering the internet has made the middle men and those who sell anti-filtering software richer," he said. "It is hurting users, and costing them a lot of money."</p><p>This, too, will pit Pezeshkian against conservative members of the establishment who — with reasonable cause — fear freer access to uncensored news and information could lead to more civil unrest.</p><figure class="embed embed--type-video embed--type-content_video is-video embed--float-left embed--size-medium ">

<li>A company called American Rounds has installed computerized vending machines in grocery stores in Alabama, Oklahoma, and Texas that sell ammunition to customers, requiring age verification and facial recognition software to ensure customers are old enough to purchase the bullets.</li>
<li>The company claims that the machines are "quick and easy" to use and as secure as online sales or retail stores, as they use age-verification technology to prevent underage purchases.</li>
<li>Gun control advocates, such as Everytown for Gun Safety, criticize the idea of selling ammunition through vending machines, arguing that it will increase access to guns and lead to more shootings, citing statistics on mass killings in the US.</li>
<li>The company's CEO, Grant Magers, maintains that the product is pro-Second Amendment and focused on responsible gun ownership, and that the vending machines can improve the environment for the community by providing a secure way to purchase ammunition.</li>
<li>The company has plans to expand to more locations, including Colorado, and claims that customers were initially surprised but eventually saw the similarity to sales at stores like Walmart, which requires age verification for certain types of ammunition.</li>

                                        <p>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — A company has installed computerized vending machines to sell ammunition in grocery stores in Alabama, Oklahoma and Texas, allowing patrons to pick up bullets along with a gallon of milk.</p><p>American Rounds said their machines use an identification scanner and facial recognition software to verify the purchaser’s age and are as “quick and easy” to use as a computer tablet. But advocates worry that selling bullets out of vending machines will lead to more shootings in the U.S., where gun violence killed at least 33 people <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gun-violence-shootings-july-fourth-90bd7b9473e280e14429489decafd552">on Independence Day alone</a></span>. </p><p>The company maintains the age-verification technology means that the transactions are as secure, or more secure, than online sales, which may not require the purchaser to submit proof of age, or at retail stores, where there is a risk of shoplifting. </p><p>“I’m very thankful for those who are taking the time to get to know us and not just making assumptions about what we’re about,” CEO Grant Magers said. “We are very pro-Second Amendment, but we are for responsible gun ownership, and we hope we’re improving the environment for the community.”</p>
    

<p>There have been 15 mass killings involving a firearm so far in 2024, compared to 39 in 2023, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/mass-killings/index.html">according to a database</a></span> maintained in a partnership of The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. </p>



<p>“Innovations that make ammunition sales more secure via facial recognition, age verification, and the tracking of serial sales are promising safety measures that belong in gun stores, not in the place where you buy your kids milk,” said Nick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety. “In a country awash in guns and ammo, where guns are the leading cause of deaths for kids, we don’t need to further normalize the sale and promotion of these products.”</p>
    
<p>Magers said grocery stores and others approached the Texas-based company, which began in 2023, about the idea of selling ammunition through automated technology. The company has one machine in Alabama, four in Oklahoma and one in Texas, with plans for another in Texas and one in Colorado in the coming weeks, he said. </p>
    

<p>“People I think got shocked when they thought about the idea of selling ammo at a grocery store,” Magers said. “But as we explained, how is that any different than Walmart?” </p><p>Federal law requires a person to be 18 to buy shotgun and rifle ammunition and 21 to buy handgun ammunition. Magers said their machines require a purchaser to be at least 21.</p><p>The machine works by requiring a customer to scan their driver’s license to validate that they are age 21 or older. The scan also checks that it is a valid license, he said. That is followed by a facial recognition scan to verify “you are who you are saying you are as a consumer,” he said.</p><p>“At that point you can complete your transaction of your product and you’re off and going,” he said. “The whole experience takes a minute and a half once you are familiar with the machine.” </p><p>The vending machine is another method of sale, joining retail stores and online retailers. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://smokinggun.org/report/underage-ammo-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A March report</a></span> by Everytown for Gun Safety found that several major online ammunition retailers did not appear to verify their customers’ ages, despite requirements. </p>
    

<p>Last year, an online retailer <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="agreed%20to%20maintain%20an%20age%20verification%20system%20for%20customers%20buying%20ammunitio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settled a lawsuit</a></span> brought by families of those killed and injured in a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-us-news-ap-top-news-greg-abbott-shootings-32220cb5316b4fbf9dd7f9d5b125c6f9">2018 Texas high school shooting</a></span>. The families said the 17-year-old shooter was able to buy ammunition from the retailer who failed to verify his age. </p><p>Vending machines for bullets or other age-restricted materials is not an entirely new idea. Companies have developed similar technology to sell alcoholic beverages. A company has marketed automated kiosks to sell cannabis products in dispensaries in states where marijuana is legal.</p><p>A Pennsylvania police officer created a company about 12 years ago that places bullet-vending machines in private gun clubs and ranges as a convenience for patrons. Those machines do not have the age verification mechanism but are only placed in locations with an age requirement to enter, Master Ammo owner Sam Piccinini said. </p>
    

<p>Piccinini spoke with a company years ago about incorporating the artificial intelligence technology to verify a purchaser’s age and identity, but at the time it was cost-prohibitive, he said. For American Rounds, one machine had to be removed from a site in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, because of disappointing sales, Magers said. </p><p>Magers said much of the early interest for the machines has been in rural communities where there may be few retailers that sell ammunition. The American Rounds machines are in Super C Mart and Fresh Value grocery stores in small cities, including Pell City, Alabama, which has a population over 13,600, and Noble, Oklahoma, where nearly 7,600 people live. </p><p>“Someone in that community might have to drive an hour or an hour and a half to get supplied if they want to go hunting, for instance,” Margers said. “Our grocery stores, they wanted to be able to offer their customer another category that they felt like would be popular.”</p>
