"He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020," added the actor.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate," Clooney said. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The fundraising event, co-hosted by Clooney in Los Angeles and also featuring Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand, brought in a single-night record of roughly $30m (£23m) for the Biden campaign. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Biden camp has hit back at the Hollywood star, with an unnamed source telling US media: “The President stayed for over 3 hours [at the fundraiser], while Clooney took a photo quickly and left.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The president's campaign also pointed out that when he attended the fundraiser he had just arrived in Los Angeles from Italy, where he had been at the G7 summit.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In his op-ed, Clooney said: "Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"This is about age. Nothing more," he continued. "We are not going to win in November with this president."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Clooney added that his concerns matched those of "every" member of Congress with whom he had spoken.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Asked to respond, Mr Biden's campaign referred to a letter the president sent Democrats in Congress that said he was "firmly committed" to his candidacy and beating Trump.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Yet public dissent continues to grow within Mr Biden's party as he faces scrutiny while hosting the Nato summit in Washington.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mrs Pelosi, a highly influential voice among Capitol Hill Democrats, on Wednesday appeared to disregard Mr Biden's insistence that he was determined to forge on.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">When asked if he should stay in the election race, she told MSNBC's Morning Joe: "I want him to do whatever he decides to do. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run. We are all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Acknowledging the demands on the president during the Nato summit, Mrs Pelosi told MSNBC: "I said to everyone - let's just hold off. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I am very proud of the president."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Around a dozen elected Democrats have suggested he abandon his campaign since his 27 June debate with Trump.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On Tuesday night, Michael Bennet of Colorado became the first Democratic senator to publicly dissent. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Although he did not call for Mr Biden to quit outright, he said Trump would win the election, possibly by a "landslide".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On Wednesday afternoon, Peter Welch of Vermont became the first Senate Democrat to openly call on Mr Biden to withdraw, "for the good of the country", as he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed.  </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told reporters he was "deeply concerned" about Mr Biden's ability to win the election.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Pat Ryan, a congressman from New York, earlier in the day told the New York Times: “For the good of our country, for my two young kids, I’m asking Joe Biden to step aside."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Biden campaign repeated the president's statement that he was "running this race to the end". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries plans to speak to Mr Biden by Friday to discuss the concerns brought by several congressional party members.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Overall support from elected Democrats remains robust, however. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Gavin Newsom, the California governor who was named by Clooney as a potential replacement, said he was still “all in” with Mr Biden. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Congressional Black Caucus, a group of roughly 60 politicians, and progressive  House members like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, have publicly backed Mr Biden. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On Tuesday, Chuck Schumer, the leading Democrat in the Senate, said: "I'm with Joe." Axios, however, reports that Mr Schumer has been privately telling donors he is open to dumping Mr Biden.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Two unnamed senior Democrats, speaking to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, said there had been a "convergence" of opinion over the last 24 hours between elected Democrats, donors and groups that support the president's party. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">One of the sources said all of the interests have reached “a near consensus” about what Mr Biden should do.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Questions about the Democrat's campaign were also swirling at the Nato summit in Washington DC.</p></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Nancy Pelosi says it's the president's decision to continue</figcaption></p><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Biden ignores questions from reporters during meeting with Starmer</figcaption></p><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he was confident the US would remain a committed member of the alliance - no matter who sits in the White House next year, Mr Biden or Nato-sceptic Mr Trump.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">At a news conference, the BBC asked Mr Stoltenberg if all 32 members of the alliance shared his optimism, despite the concerns over Mr Biden's candidacy.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"I'm not saying we can always disregard concerns,” said Mr Stoltenberg. "But the more dangerous the world is, the more obvious it is we need Nato."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He added: "It is in the interest of all of us to stand together. That also applies for the United States."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Biden will deliver a rare solo news conference on Thursday, and on Monday will record an interview with NBC News, to be broadcast later in the evening.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In the swing state of Pennsylvania on Wednesday, Democratic voters who spoke to the BBC had mixed feelings about Mr Biden.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Karren Gillchrist, in Harrisburg, said she remained firmly behind Mr Biden because “he knows exactly what he’s talking about”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But in Elizabethtown, Melissa Nash, working on her laptop in a cafe, said: “I’m torn because I’m not a fan of Trump, but at the same time you need somebody strong to lead the country.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><i id="additional-reporting-from-rebecca-hartmann-in-pennsylvania" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog">Additional reporting from Rebecca Hartmann in Pennsylvania</i></p></div></article></div>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The 32-members of NATO on Wednesday formally declared Ukraine on an “irreversible” path to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nato-ukraine-explainer-washington-summit-7ad69ed9a58b23fc3d4a0df4f7bc5bf7">membership in the Western military alliance</a></span>, offering a bare but more binding assurance of protection once its war with Russia ends.</p><p>NATO member countries individually and in Wednesday’s joint statement from their summit in Washington announced a series of steps aimed at bolstering Ukraine’s defenses.

But the commitments still fall short of the striking power Ukraine says it needs to defeat the invading Russian forces.</p>
    

<p>The final statement called China — which the West says provides components for Russia’s weapons — a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nato-china-pacific-washington-59876b88cad3ccf15cc5443912fe3d5b">“decisive enabler”</a></span> of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">Russia’s war against Ukraine</a></span>.</p>



<p>“Ukraine’s future is in NATO,” alliance members said in their statement. “We will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership.”</p>
    
<p>The alliance welcomed Ukraine’s democratic, economic and security reforms needed to join and said it would get an invitation “when Allies agree and conditions are met.”</p><p>While the leaders stand ready to offer Ukraine the means to defend itself in a war now in its third year, nowhere do they say that Ukraine should prevail over Russia. Indeed, their statement said that “NATO does not seek confrontation, and poses no threat to Russia. We remain willing to maintain channels of communication with Moscow to mitigate risk and prevent escalation.”</p>
    

<p>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg underlined that Ukraine <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nato-ukraine-summit-membership-russia-weapons-26bea768680e784a43d79172ebdefa30">will not join the alliance’s ranks</a></span> immediately. But he insisted that must happen after the war is over to ensure that Russia never attacks Ukraine again.</p><p>Of the overall NATO assistance, he said, “We are not doing this because we want to prolong a war. We are doing it because we want to end a war as soon as possible.</p><p>Stoltenberg also delivered a passionate defense of the military alliance itself Wednesday when reporters asked about the possibility that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, a NATO critic, could pull U.S. support for the alliance if he wins in November. </p><p>Trump has been an unofficial but primary topic at the summit, especially among East European governments that believe their country could be targets of future Russian aggression.</p><p>The criticism of the alliance from the United States, Stoltenberg said, without naming Trump, has “not been about NATO. It’s about NATO allies not investing enough in NATO. And that has changed.”</p>
    

<p>As NATO leaders met in Washington, Trump on the campaign trail Tuesday renewed his threat not to defend any NATO members from a Russian attack if their military spending does not meet NATO’s target of at least 2% of their gross domestic product. But since 2021, the number of allies meeting this target has <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nato-defense-spending-stoltenberg-biden-5246409eec70745e6e936d997073a6f4">increased from six to 23</a></span>.</p><p>“The United States has been understood,” Stoltenberg said. “Allies have acted.”</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, was asked several times on Fox News Radio whether he wants the U.S. to exit NATO. He answered, “No, I want them to pay their bills.”</p><p>The U.S. and some other countries have opposed membership for Ukraine during the conflict with Russia to avoid an escalation of tensions that could lead to a larger war. They also have stressed that Ukraine must take <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-war-democracy-elections-corruption-96ba4df874521bb7b3ca1cf54dd99598">significant steps to address corruption</a></span> as well as other systemic reforms.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has long bitterly opposed neighboring Ukraine’s fight to join the Western alliance, declaring it an encroachment on Russia’s security and interests.</p>
    

<p>“I think it’s very important to give a message to the Kremlin from here — that Ukraine’s path and bridge towards NATO membership is now irreversible,” Finnish President Alexander Stubb told reporters.</p><p>President Joe Biden reaffirmed U.S. support for Ukraine but also more broadly the importance of NATO. He noted that since he took office not only has military spending increased but the number of battle groups has doubled on NATO’s eastern flank. </p><p>“We can and will defend every inch of NATO territory, and we will do it together,” Biden said.</p><p>Zelenskyy, in Washington for the NATO summit, had stressed what he called Ukraine’s urgent need for the F-16 fighter jets in a speech to friendly Republican lawmakers Tuesday night. He said his country needed more than 100 to start to counter devastating Russian air attacks on Ukraine’s cities, energy infrastructure and other vital targets. He said Russia was using 300 jets to carry out the attacks.</p>
    

<p>Six nations, including the United States, are training Ukrainians on the F-16s, but officials have not released precise numbers or all the locations. </p><p>Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Gen. David Allvin, just returned from Morris Air National Guard Base in Tucson, Arizona, where the U.S. training is taking place. Of the initial class of 12 Ukrainian pilots, seven completed training in May and the remaining five are expected to do so in August, Allvin said. </p><p>The pilots have learned to fly the fighter jet and will get follow-on training once they leave the U.S., but the value of getting Ukraine’s F-16 program running is more about the longer-term, he said. “I don’t know that it’s realistic to assume that it’s going to be a game-changer on the battlefield right now,” Allvin said.</p><p>Zelenskyy, meanwhile, met behind closed doors with senators for nearly an hour Wednesday and requested more defense help, said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. Zelenskyy also met with the Republican speaker of the House. </p><p>Separately Wednesday, the U.S. and Germany announced they would begin “episodic deployments” of long-range missiles to Germany in 2026, including Tomahawk, SM-6 and hypersonic missiles.</p><p>The announcement is notable because land-based firing of some of those missiles from within Europe would have been banned under the former Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. They were banned because the conventional missiles could have been modified to be nuclear capable and their use on the European continent would have meant that potential targets would have had no time to react. </p><p>Kimball said while the deployment is likely being done to reassure allies, Russia may respond by deploying conventional or nuclear weapons of its own.</p><p>European and U.S. allies have <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-nato-summit-patriot-air-defense-6bf639e3a76e9ea8adbdadabd2660490">announced other new arms deliveries</a></span>, such as dozens of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-electricity-power-plant-russia-attack-air-defenses-d02555dd2e4f3f7c6447f26085ae4eb0">air defense systems</a></span>, including Patriots, this week. </p><p>The promises of new weapons come after opposition from Republican lawmakers allied to Trump <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-aid-congress-republicans-trump-johnson-mcconnell-4cb76cfdefc38f35c1bda2ac8915b179">blocked a U.S. support package to Ukraine</a></span> for months earlier this year, allowing Russia to make battlefield gains against Ukrainian forces who were fighting with dwindling arms and ammunition.</p><p>Europeans and NATO, as a lesson from that setback, have vowed to take on more of the responsibility for ensuring a reliable flow of military support to Ukraine.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Cook reported from Brussels.

being held face down by security guards</a> outside its hotel in downtown Milwaukee, to be fired and face criminal charges in a statement on Wednesday.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The hotel giant issued the statement on Wednesday afternoon, 10 days after Mitchell died outside the Kilbourn Avenue hotel. The statement directly refers to Aimbridge Hospitality, the hotel operator, who has said its cooperating with a police investigation.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Hyatt joins the family of D’Vontaye Mitchell in their calls for transparency, accountability and justice for this senseless tragedy," Hyatt's statement said. "We believe that the employees of Aimbridge Hospitality who were involved should be terminated and that criminal charges should be filed."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Hyatt's statement came as the Mitchell family, supporters and attorneys held a demonstration outside of a police and court building. The family has been critical of <a href="/story/news/crime/2024/07/08/ben-crump-calls-for-justice-outside-hyatt-in-dvontaye-mitchell-death/74326442007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">what they describe as a lack of transparency and justice</a>, noting that charges have not been filed against the worker.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">At the demonstration, attorneys said they have spoken with a hotel worker who said security acted with excessive force and is prepared to testify to that effect should the case turn into legal action.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Earlier on Wednesday, the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office said in a statement <a href="/story/news/crime/2024/07/10/milwaukee-da-reviewing-mans-death-outside-hyatt-as-homicide-case/74354008007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">that it was investigating Mitchell's death as a homicide</a>.

So we need to make sure that we set the record straight in regard to what's going on and who's talking in our community," he said. "This is still within the medical examiner's office. This is still being reviewed for an autopsy from a standpoint of understanding exactly what happened."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">At the press conference with the chief, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he spoke with the Mitchell family on Tuesday and called the death a "tragedy." He said that the city's Office of Community Wellness and Safety had been in touch with the family as well.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"It's a family member who is no longer with them and that's a tragedy regardless of how it happens," Johnson said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Mitchell, 43, died around 4 p.m. June 30 after allegedly entering the women's bathroom at the hotel, located at Milwaukee, 333 W. Kilbourn Ave. Crump said Mitchell was having a mental health crisis, but no information has yet to be released by the Milwaukee Police Department.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Police said in an initial news release that security held him down following what it described as a disturbance and subsequent fight as he was escorted out.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The security guards involved in holding down Mitchell have been suspended, according to Hyatt.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Aimbridge Hospitality did not immediately respond to an email for comment on Hyatt's statement. In a previous statement, the company said it offered "our sincere condolences to Mr. Mitchell's family and loved ones."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We continue to do everything we can to support law enforcement's ongoing investigation into this incident and have no further comment at this time. We remain committed to maintaining a safe and welcoming environment for all hotel guests and associates," the July 5 statement said.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/02/PMJS/74284014007-image-2.jpg?width=660&amp;height=660&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Dvontaye Mitchell and his 8-year-old daughter Morgan."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Dvontaye Mitchell and his 8-year-old daughter Morgan." data-c-credit="Mitchell Family"></p></figure><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">Mitchell's family reacts to video of his death</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Mitchell spent the last few minutes of his life being repeatedly beaten by a security guard with a retractable baton as onlookers failed to intervene, said attorneys for his family outside the DA's office on Wednesday.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Members of Mitchell’s family, now planning his funeral, told reporters they were "repulsed and shocked" by video footage they viewed alongside Crump, and Milwaukee lawyers B’Ivory Lamarr and William Sulton.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The footage was supplied by Hyatt, shows Mitchell running from something or someone and seeking safety in the women's bathroom in the hotel, the lawyers said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“D’Vontaye was trying to run for his life,” said Sulton. It's not clear what Mitchell was running from, attorneys team said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When he was confronted by the guards, he had his hands up, but was dragged to the floor and beaten, while he begged for the blows to stop, according to the attorneys.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">They joined dozens of supporters, many wearing T-shirts with Mitchell’s image, in marching from the District Attorney's Office to the Hyatt Regency Milwaukee.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“To see them beat him over and over and over …. they could have stopped at any time,” said Mitchell’s wife DeAsia Harmon, her voice choked by tears. “They murdered him.

<p>Netanyahu agreed to send the Israeli delegation back to the talks after Hamas replied to the latest draft cease-fire proposal with some requested changes, but both sides have remained at odds on key points of a staged truce process.

<p>The pier project, always touted by U.S. officials as an additive measure and not a solution to the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, has been plagued by logistical challenges, mostly weather related, and it has never managed to facilitate a significant flow of aid materials. </p><p>After being knocked out of service again by rough seas, operations on the pier were to be reestablished this week — but then the structure could be permanently dismantled. The removal could come as soon as next week, but no final decision has been made according to U.S. military officials. </p>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The House on Wednesday passed a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration, a proposal Republicans have prioritized as an election-year talking point even as research shows noncitizens illegally registering and casting ballots in federal elections is exceptionally rare.</p><p>The legislation, approved largely along partisan lines but with five Democrats voting in favor, is unlikely to advance through the Democratic-led Senate.

Noncitizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections, nor is it allowed for any statewide elections.</p>
    

<p>Research and audits in several states show there have been incidences of noncitizens who successfully registered to vote and cast ballots, but it happens rarely and is typically by mistake. States have mechanisms to check for it, although there isn’t one standard protocol they all follow.</p>

<p>Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a key backer of the bill, said in a news conference earlier this week that the Democratic opposition means many Democrats “want illegals to participate in our federal elections; they want them to vote.”</p>
    
<p>During a speech Wednesday, he called the vote a “generation-defining moment.”</p><p>“If just a small percentage, a fraction of a fraction of all those illegals that Joe Biden has brought in here to vote, if they do vote, it wouldn’t just change one race,” he said. “It might potentially change all of our races.”</p>
    

<p>On his Truth Social platform this week, Trump suggested that Democrats are pushing to give noncitizen migrants the right to vote and urged Republicans to pass the legislation — the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act — or “go home and cry yourself to sleep.”</p><p>The fixation on noncitizen voting is part of a broader and long-term <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-immigrant-voting-noncitizens-elections-explained-cf4c73b336147b5f5d9c2a22b2564994">Trump campaign strategy</a></span> of casting doubt on the validity of an election should he lose, and he has consistently pushed that narrative during his campaign rallies this year. Last month in Las Vegas, he told supporters, “The only way they can beat us is to cheat.” It also is part of a wider Republican campaign strategy, with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-immigrants-noncitizen-trump-republicans-2024-1c65429c152c2a10514b5156eacf9ca7">GOP lawmakers across the country</a></span> passing state legislation and putting noncitizen voting measures on state ballots for November.</p><p>One Democrat who voted for the GOP bill, Rep. Vincente Gonzalez, said he only did so because the bill was doomed in the Senate.</p><p>“It’s not going anywhere,” said Gonzalez, who represents a competitive border district in Texas. “It’s just another Republican messaging bill.”</p><p>The majority of Democrats and voting rights advocates have said the legislation is unnecessary because it’s already a felony for noncitizens to register to vote in federal elections, punishable by fines, prison or deportation. Anyone registering must attest under penalty of perjury that they are a U.S. citizen. Noncitizens also are not allowed to cast ballots at the state level. A <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-voting-rights-new-york-city-ohio-29e7c1a42d859b717167260f7d2e808f">handful of municipalities</a></span> allow them to vote in some local elections.</p>
    

<p>They also have pointed to surveys showing that millions of Americans <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/millions-americans-dont-have-documents-proving-their-citizenship-readily" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t have easy access</a></span> to up-to-date documentary proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate or passport, and therefore the bill could inhibit U.S. citizen voters who aren’t able to further prove their status.</p><p>During the Wednesday floor debate, Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, expressed concern that the bill would disenfranchise various American citizens. </p><p>He mentioned military members stationed abroad who couldn’t show documentary proof of citizenship in person at an election office, as well as married women whose names have changed, Native Americans whose tribal IDs don’t show their place of birth and natural disaster survivors who have lost their personal documents.</p>
    

<p>Morelle said he doesn’t see the bill as an attempt to maintain voter rolls, but as part of larger GOP-led plans to question the validity of the upcoming election.</p><p>“The false claim that there is a conspiracy to register noncitizens is a pretext for trying to overturn the 2024 election, potentially leading to another tragedy on January 6th, 2025,” he said.</p><p>Yet Republicans who support the bill contend the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/immigration">unprecedented surge of migrants</a></span> illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border creates too large a risk of noncitizens slipping through the cracks and casting ballots that sway races in November.</p>

<li>A NATO summit attendee has expressed concerns that President Joe Biden may not win re-election, citing his mental deterioration and failure to recognize someone he knew well.</li>
<li>The attendee, Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, said that most NATO leaders believe Biden cannot serve another four years as president, regardless of political ideology.</li>
<li>Bremmer's comments come almost two weeks after Biden's poor debate performance, which has led some Democratic party members to call on the president to step aside and be replaced on the November ticket.</li>
<li>NATO leaders are reportedly more concerned about the possibility of Donald Trump becoming president again, citing his policies on Russia, Ukraine, and NATO.</li>

As of Wednesday, he is leading Biden for the Oval Office by 2.3 points, according to national poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight.</p><p>Trump, who has been critical of NATO in the past, recently faced criticism from alliance members following comments at a February rally. Trump said if a NATO country were invaded by Russia, "I would not protect you [the country]. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want." His remarks come as Russia continues its over two-year-long war following the invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg responded to Trump's comments by reminding reporters of NATO's Article 5 clause, which requires member states to defend one another. He emphasized, "One for all, all for one applies to all Allies and is the heart of NATO."</p><p><em>Newsweek </em>reached out to Trump's campaign for comment via email on Wednesday.</p><p>Bremmer said that "The vast majority of the foreign leaders that are here in Washington right now, they want Biden to win," but he noted "right now, they mostly think he won't."</p><p>Bremmer said a world leader had told him Biden was "repeating the same anecdote twice in an individual meeting," and he had also been told of an instance where the President was "not recognizing someone that he knew quite well when he came up and introduced him." Bremmer said that many of the leaders have seen Biden's "deterioration" from spending time with him at various global meetings and conferences.</p><p>He noted that many leaders are concerned about how Biden could even "campaign effectively for another four months, never mind carry out four more years after that. And again, they won't say that publicly because they are allies."</p><p>He also pointed out that NATO leaders' concerned over the next U.S. presidency has bled into many conversations. "You'd think this would be all about Ukraine and all about NATO but I mean the reality is the United States is the linchpin of NATO and if they can't count on the U.S. they've got a serious problem," he said. <a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2024/6/pdf/240617-def-exp-2024-en.pdf" target="_blank" class="multivariate">According to NATO's latest estimates</a>, the U.S. is on track to contribute $755 billion to the alliance in 2024, 3.38 percent of it's GDP.</p><p>Given the political state of the world, with countries "on the front line with a war where the Russians have invaded Ukraine and NATO is standing up. They feel like they have a lot more at stake with this U.S. election than most Americans do," Bremmer said.
