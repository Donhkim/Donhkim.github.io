<ol>
<li>The Supreme Court appears poised to allow emergency abortions in Idaho when a pregnant patient's health is at serious risk, according to a copy of the opinion briefly posted on the court's website.</li>
<li>The court would reinstate a lower court order that allowed hospitals in Idaho to perform emergency abortions to protect a pregnant patient's health, reversing its earlier order that allowed an Idaho abortion ban to temporarily go into effect.</li>
<li>The 6-3 vote would leave the issues at the heart of the case unresolved, and key questions about abortion would remain unanswered, according to Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's concurrence.</li>
<li>Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch dissented from the decision, which would not be the court's final ruling as the decision has not been officially released.</li>
<li>The decision may be motivated by the court's reluctance to make an abortion-related decision on the merits in an election year, with a new poll showing that 7 in 10 U.S. adults favor protecting access to abortions for patients in medical emergencies.</li>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court">The Supreme Court</a></span> appears poised to allow emergency <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/abortion">abortions</a></span> in Idaho when a pregnant patient’s health is at serious risk, according to a copy of the opinion briefly posted on the court’s website Wednesday and obtained by Bloomberg News.</p><p>The <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rJo5436tVr08/v0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">document</a></span> suggests the court will find that it should not have gotten involved in the case over Idaho’s strict abortion ban so quickly. By a 6-3 vote it would reinstate a lower court order that had allowed hospitals in the state to perform emergency abortions to protect a pregnant patient’s health. </p><p>Such an outcome would leave the issues at the heart of the case unresolved. It would also mean key questions remain unanswered, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in a concurrence. </p><p>“Today’s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho. It is delay,” she wrote. </p><p>The Supreme Court acknowledged that its publications unit inadvertently posted a document Wednesday. An opinion in the Idaho case would be issued “in due course,” court spokeswoman Patricia McCabe said in a statement.</p>
    

<p>Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch are listed as dissenting from the decision. </p>



<p>The finding may not be the court’s final ruling because the justices’ decision has not been officially released. The decision would mean the case would continue at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court, and could end up back before the justices. </p>
    
<p>The Supreme Court may be reluctant to make an abortion-related decision on the merits – rather than procedural grounds – in an election year, said Greer Donley, a reproductive law scholar and professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. </p><p>A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults favor protecting access to abortions for patients who are experiencing miscarriages or other pregnancy-related emergencies. </p>
    

<p>The decision would reverse the Supreme Court’s earlier order that allowed an Idaho abortion ban to temporarily go into effect, even in medical emergencies. Several women have since needed medical airlifts <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-emtala-hospitals-emergency-room-2fdc3943ffc9278f885263f722cc262f">out of state</a></span> in cases in which abortion is routine treatment to avoid infection, hemorrhage and other dire health risks, Idaho doctors have said. </p><p>The nation’s top health official, Xavier Becerra, held a scheduled meeting with Idaho doctors and patients to discuss the state’s strict abortion ban in Boise Wednesday. Sarah Thompson, an Idaho OB/GYN, said that if a woman’s water breaks early in pregnancy, when the fetus has no chance of survival, she is unable to treat the patient by delivering the baby early.</p><p>“While there’s nothing we can do to save her baby, there is something we can do to preserve her health and her future fertility,” Thompson said.</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said that it hoped the court “listened to the scientific evidence and medical experts and will ultimately affirm the availability of emergency abortion care for people in every state,” said general counsel Molly Meegan.</p>
    

<p>The case started when the Biden administration sued Idaho, arguing that its abortion ban conflicted with federal healthcare law because doctors wouldn’t be allowed to provide abortions to stabilize pregnant patients in rare emergency cases when their health is at serious risk.</p><p>Idaho argued its ban does allow abortions to save a pregnant patient’s life and that federal law does not require the exceptions to expand. The state attorney general’s office declined to comment Wednesday.</p><p>Katie Daniel, the state policy director of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said an Idaho state court had ruled that women’s lives don’t need to be in immediate danger to act.</p><p>Most Republican-controlled states began enforcing restrictions after the justices <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0">overturned Roe v. Wade</a></span> two years ago, and Idaho is among 14 states that outlaw abortion at all stages of pregnancy with very limited exceptions.</p><p>The case is likely to return to the Supreme Court again, said Rachel Rebouche, dean of the Temple University Beasley School of Law and a reproductive law scholar. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-life-of-mother-texas-appeal-83770a43f44c908d81b5fa0dfc0d87e4">ruled in a similar case</a></span> that the federal law does not take precedence over an abortion ban in Texas.</p>
    

<p>So while the Supreme Court’s ruling would allow abortion in medical emergencies in Idaho, at least for now, Rebouche said, “Nearly 38 million people live in the 5th Circuit. That’s a lot of people whose lives aren’t changed at all by this.”</p><p>Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said that a decision without explicit guarantees that patients could get abortions in medical emergencies would be “catastrophic.”</p><p>Reports of pregnant women being <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/pregnancy-emergency-care-abortion-supreme-court-roe-9ce6c87c8fc653c840654de1ae5f7a1c">turned away from U.S. emergency rooms</a></span> spiked after the Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling overturning the constitutional right to abortion, according to federal documents obtained by The Associated Press.</p>
    

<p>If the high court were to rule in Idaho’s favor, it would create a “world in which women would have to lose their reproductive organs,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University health law and policy professor who is an expert on the federal EMTALA law.</p><p>The Justice Department’s lawsuit came under a federal law that requires hospitals accepting Medicare to provide stabilizing care regardless of a patient’s ability to pay. The law is the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA. </p><p>Nearly all hospitals accept Medicare, so emergency room doctors in Idaho and other states with bans would have to provide abortions if needed to stabilize a pregnant patient and avoid serious health risks such as the loss of reproductive organs, the Justice Department argued.</p><p>Idaho argued that its exception for a patient’s life covers dire health circumstances and that the Biden administration misread the law to circumvent the state ban and expand abortion access.</p><p>Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said his group was glad the Justice Department says its arguments apply to rare cases. </p><p>Doctors have said Idaho’s law has made them fearful to perform abortions, even when a pregnancy is putting a patient’s health severely at risk. The law requires anyone who is convicted of performing an abortion to be imprisoned for at least two years.</p><p>A federal judge initially sided with the Democratic administration and ruled that abortions were legal in medical emergencies. After the state appealed, the Supreme Court allowed the law to go fully into effect in January.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Amanda Seitz and Linley Sanders in Washington, Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, Devi Shastri in Milwaukee and Hallie Golden in Seattle contributed to this report.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court">https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court</a></span>.</p>

<p>Earlier, on Wednesday afternoon, troops led by army general commander Juan Jose Zuniga had stormed the presidential palace and taken up positions in the square outside. News reports indicated a tank slammed the palace doors.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 3 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>But within hours, Zuniga urged the soldiers to withdraw, after leaders from around the world blasted the army’s actions as illegal.</p>
<p>President Arce hailed the withdrawal as a victory for Bolivia’s democracy and addressed the country’s citizens in the aftermath, some of whom had taken to the streets in protest of the alleged coup attempt.</p>
<p>“Many thanks to the Bolivian people,” said Arce. “Long live democracy.”</p>
<p>Dramatic footage on Bolivian television showed Arce facing down Zuniga and a group of soldiers in a palace hallway on Wednesday. “I am your captain, and I order you to withdraw your soldiers, and I will not allow this insubordination,” Arce said.</p>
<p>The news agency Reuters reported that Zuniga was ultimately arrested.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-the-alleged-coup-occur">Why did the alleged coup occur?</h2>
<p>Since taking office in 2020, President Arce has led an embattled government, fending off pressure from both the left and the right.</p>
<p>Under his leadership, right-wing forces in provinces like Santa Cruz have led deadly strikes against measures they believe are designed to keep them from power. Just last year, a prominent opposition leader, Luis Fernando Camacho, was <a href="/news/2023/1/2/bolivia-sees-more-unrest-following-opposition-leaders-arrest">arrested</a> for his alleged role in 2019’s political arrest.</p>
<p>And on the left, President Arce faces pushback from his former political mentor, ex-President Evo Morales, who has declared his intention to replace Arce in the 2025 presidential race.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Americas Coverage Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>Adding to the political turmoil has been nationwide fuel shortages and a financial crisis that has seen its currency reserves crater.</p>
<p>“The president of the country is in a bit of a problem, in the sense that he’s got a low approval ratings. The last one in March, he was at 38 percent. The economy’s not doing well at all. And he’s also involved in a protracted battle with Evo Morales, the ex-president of the country,” explained Al Jazeera correspondent John Holman. “So this is a difficult time for President Luis Arce.”</p>
<p>Zuniga was Arce’s hand-picked leader for Bolivia’s military. But as he entered the presidential palace on Wednesday, Zuniga cited the malaise in the country as a motivation.</p>
<p>“The three chiefs of the armed forces have come to express our dismay. There will be a new cabinet of ministers. Surely things will change, but our country cannot continue like this any longer,” Zuniga told a local TV station.</p>
<p>“Stop destroying, stop impoverishing our country, stop humiliating our army.”</p>
<p>The general added that he would continue to recognise Arce as the commander-in-chief “for now”. But he explained that his aim was to “restore democracy” and “free political prisoners”.</p>
<p>Local media reports indicated that Arce had stripped Zuniga of his role atop the country’s military earlier in the week, fuelling tensions between the two leaders.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3005706" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3005706" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3005706" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-26T230123Z_606032789_RC29J8ATAXNB_RTRMADP_3_BOLIVIA-POLITICS-1719448048.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80" alt="People march through the streets of Bolivia." data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3005706" class="wp-caption-text">People gather in support of the government as President Luis Arce in Cochabamba, Bolivia [Patricia Pinto/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="domestic-condemnation">Domestic condemnation</h2>
<p>But as armed soldiers and armoured vehicles filled the Plaza Murillo in the centre of the capital La Paz, the backlash came swiftly.</p>
<p>The country’s largest labour union announced an indefinite strike in defence of Arce’s government. Videos circulating on social media appear to show crowds of people chasing away pro-coup forces.</p>
<p><span>Former President Morales also denounced the military’s actions, calling for criminal prosecution against Zuniga and anyone who helped him.</span></p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>“We will not allow the armed forces to violate democracy and intimidate people,” he said.</p>
<p>Even the right-wing leader who replaced Morales, former President Jeanine Añez, rejected the military’s advances.</p>
<p>“Total repudiation of the military mobilisation in the Plaza Murillo, attempting to destroy the constitutional order,” she <a href="https://twitter.com/JeanineAnez/status/1806056057136959714" target="_blank">wrote</a> on the social media platform X, adding that Arce “must leave through the vote in 2025”.</p>
<p>From the presidential palace, Arce broadcast a video presenting a united front, standing alongside all his ministers. He pledged to “confront any attempt that threatens our democracy”.</p>
<p>“To the Bolivian people and the entire international community, our country today is facing an attempted coup d’etat,” Arce said in the video.</p>
<p>“The Bolivian people are called today. We need the Bolivian people to organise and mobilise against the coup d’etat in favour of democracy. We cannot allow once again coup attempts to take Bolivian lives.”</p>

<p></p>
<h2 id="a-history-of-coups">A history of coups</h2>
<p>Wednesday’s scenes brought alarm to the Andean nation, where ex-President Morales has long maintained he was removed from office in a 2019 coup, after he ran for a fourth term in office.</p>
<p>Bolivia has had a long history of political unrest since it gained independence in 1825. Kathryn Ledebur of the Andean Information Network said, of all the South American nations, Bolivia is considered the one that has experienced the most coups.</p>
<p>“But it enjoyed a very long period of democracy until the 2019 coup,” she explained in an interview with Al Jazeera. “I think it’s very important to remember that Bolivia had an illegal government with the support of the military and a coup in 2019.”</p>
<p>That, she said, has fed scepticism among the public towards the armed forces, something reflected on the streets of La Paz on Wednesday. “The military has a bad reputation,” Ledebur said.</p>
<p>While she acknowledged some military officers were charged with crimes, the institution itself “didn’t receive significant legal consequences or any sort of punishment or restructuring after this very anti-democratic activity in 2019 and 2020.”</p>
<p>Wednesday’s actions, however, send a strong signal about the continued threat that the military may pose, Ledebur added. “It’s a very very clear sign that the army is not firmly entrenched in democracy, nor the rest of the armed forces.”</p>
<p>Photos from The Associated Press showed soldiers clearing away journalists near the presidential palace during the alleged coup.</p>
<p>Ultimately, President Arce replaced General Zuniga with Jose Wilson Sanchez, who ordered all mobilised troops to return to their barracks.</p>
<p>“No one wants the images we’re seeing in the streets,” Wilson Sanchez said. The public prosecutor’s office said it open a criminal investigation into those behind the failed attempt against the government.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3005708" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3005708" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3005708" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-26T230534Z_709851244_RC29J8AX8L9L_RTRMADP_3_BOLIVIA-POLITICS-1719448060.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80" alt="Kids eat ice cream in front of a hand-written sign denouncing the coup in Bolivia." data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3005708" class="wp-caption-text">Students stand next a banner that reads, ‘No to the Coup d’etat’ on June 26 [Patricia Pinto/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="international-appeals-for-peace">International appeals for peace</h2>
<p>As images of the alleged coup started to circulate across the globe, world leaders from countries like Brazil, Mexico and Colombia expressed alarm and denounced what they considered an attack on democracy.</p>
<p>“We express the strongest condemnation of the attempted coup d’etat in Bolivia,” said Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a popular left-wing leader.</p>
<p>Honduran President Xiomara Castro, meanwhile, called the mobilisation a “criminal coup d’etat”. Gabriel Boric, the president of the neighbouring country of Chile, issued his own statement: “We cannot tolerate any breach of the legitimate constitutional order in Bolivia or anywhere else.”</p>
<p>But the condemnation stretched well beyond Latin America. A White House spokesperson said the United States “urges calm and restraint”. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said his organisation “expresses its solidarity with the Bolivian government and people”.</p>
<p>The Organization of American States (OAS) — an international group comprised of 32 member states — also weighed in with an appeal to the military.</p>
<p>“We condemned the events in Bolivia. The army must submit itself to the legitimately elected civil power,” OAS leader Luis Almagro said while the turmoil unfolded.</p>
<p>Holman, the Al Jazeera correspondent, warned that the outpouring of support did not mean that President Arce’s troubles were over.</p>
<p>As General Zuniga was arrested, Holman explained that the military leader made unverified allegations that this apparent coup was organised by Arce himself to boost his dismal approval ratings.</p>
<p>“For now, stability of a sort returns,” Holman said. “It’s a really difficult, combustible situation right now in a country that has become deeply divided and polarised. The fact that whatever happened this afternoon has ended isn’t going to take away the explosive nature from the country.”</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The US Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 in favor of President Biden's administration in a case involving social media censorship. The majority opinion, written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, held that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue the federal government over its attempts to influence social media censorship policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conservative justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Clarence Thomas dissented from the majority opinion. Justice Alito wrote a strong dissenting opinion, blasting the majority's decision as "unjustifiably refusing" to intervene on behalf of those allegedly victimized by COVID-era censorship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court's decision means that the federal government can continue to influence social media censorship policies without facing legal challenge. This has significant implications for online speech and the First Amendment rights of individuals and organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The case arose from a challenge to the Biden administration's effort to influence social media companies to suppress certain COVID-19-related speech. The administration had allegedly pressured social media companies to suppress certain content, and the court's decision allows this activity to continue without legal challenge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision is a significant victory for the Biden administration and its efforts to shape social media content. However, it may also set a precedent for future challenges to government efforts to influence online speech, and the decision may be appealed or challenged in future cases.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>A group of 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists, led by Joseph Stiglitz, have written a letter warning that former President Trump would be a disaster for the economy if he wins the election, citing concerns about inflation.</li>
<li>At least 9 of the economists who signed the 2020 letter also made similar warnings about Trump's economic dangers in 2016, including that he "promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options".</li>
<li>The economists' concerns about inflation are centered around Trump's "fiscally irresponsible budgets" and the potential for him to "reignite this inflation" if elected.</li>
<li>Several of the economists who signed the letter were part of a group of 370 economists who urged voters not to support Trump in the 2016 election, criticizing his economic policies and lack of understanding of economics.</li>
<li>Despite these warnings, Trump won the 2016 election, and the economists' warnings have been rebuked by some who argue that Trump's economic policies have been successful and have led to strong economic growth.</li>

<li><strong>Julian Assange returns to Australia</strong>: After 14 years of legal battles, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has arrived back in his native Australia, after a plea deal allowed him to walk free from a London prison.</li>
<li><strong>Plea deal and sentencing</strong>: Assange pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information, and was sentenced to time already served, effectively freeing him from prison.</li>
<li><strong>Assange's wife speaks out</strong>: Stella Assange, his wife, emphasized that her husband needs time to recover and spend time with their family, citing the "dangerous precedent" set by the US government's case against him.</li>
<li><strong>Assange's legal battle</strong>: The charges against Assange stemmed from his association with Wikileaks, which released classified documents exposing human rights abuses and civilian casualties in US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</li>
<li><strong>Australian Prime Minister's involvement</strong>: Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was instrumental in securing Assange's release, and Assange's lawyer revealed that the two had discussed his case over the phone.</li>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — A defiant former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández was sentenced in New York Wednesday to 45 years in prison for teaming up with some bribe-paying drug traffickers for over a decade to ensure over 400 tons of cocaine made it to the United States.</p><p>Judge P. Kevin Castel sentenced Hernández to 45 years in a U.S. prison and fined him $8 million, saying that the penalty should serve as a warning to “well educated, well dressed” individuals who gain power and think their status insulates them from justice when they do wrong.</p><p>A jury convicted him in March in Manhattan federal court after a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/honduras-president-hernandez-drug-trafficking-trial-03ff42d25f3ee3d5c93a7d2f024dc67b">two-week trial</a></span>, which was <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/honduras-president-juan-orlando-hernandez-trial-54d84620058796054ec5b1bffd5246a3">closely followed in his home country</a></span>. </p><p>“I am innocent,” Hernández said through an interpreter at his sentencing. “I was wrongly and unjustly accused.”</p><p>In a lengthy extemporaneous statement interrupted several times by the judge who repeatedly reminded him that this was not a time to relitigate the trial, Hernández portrayed himself as a hero of the anti-drug trafficking movement who teamed up with American authorities under three U.S. presidential administrations to reduce drug imports.</p>
    

<p>But the judge said trial evidence proved the opposite and that Hernández employed “considerable acting skills” to make it seem that he was an anti-drug trafficking crusader while he deployed his nation’s police and military, when necessary, to protect the drug trade.</p>



<p>Castel called Hernández a “two-faced politician hungry for power” who protected a select group of traffickers. </p>
    
<p>As the sentence was announced, the bespectacled Hernández in a dull green prison uniform stood next to his lawyer in front of two U.S. marshals. After shaking hands with his lawyer and turning to nod toward the packed spectator section, Hernández hobbled out of court with the help of a cane and a brace on one foot.</p><p>Prosecutors had sought a sentence of life in prison, plus 30 years, the same as the recommendation from the court’s probation officers.</p>
    

<p>Hernández, 55, served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people.</p><p>He was arrested at his home in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, three months after leaving office in 2022 and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/honduras-united-states-drug-trafficking-tegucigalpa-909a140a41a73126313bd2fff760057c">was extradited to the U.S.</a></span> in April of that year.</p><p>U.S. prosecutors say Hernández worked with drug traffickers as long ago as 2004, taking millions of dollars in bribes as he rose from rural congressman to president of the National Congress and then to the country’s highest office.</p><p>Hernández acknowledged in trial testimony that drug money was paid to virtually all political parties in Honduras, but he <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/honduras-president-hernandez-drug-trafficking-trial-7fe5042423fe1124ac85eccaf08e40c8">denied accepting bribes himself</a></span>.</p><p>Hernández insisted in his lengthy statement Wednesday that his trial was unjust because he was not allowed to include evidence that would have caused the jury to find him not guilty. He said he was being persecuted by politicians and drug traffickers. </p><p>“It’s as if I had been thrown into a deep river with my hands bound,” he said. </p><p>In Honduras Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador Laura Dogu called the sentencing an important step in combating the social consequences of drug trafficking.</p>
    

<p>“Here in Honduras and in the United States, we cannot forget that the actions of Juan Orlando have made the people suffer,” Dogu said.</p><p>Luis Romero, a Honduran criminal lawyer and analyst, said the sentence was a surprise to many people in Honduras who believed he would receive a life sentence.</p><p>At a news conference in Honduras, Hernández’s wife, Ana García, said her husband was innocent and called the sentencing a “judicial lynching.” García — who is planning to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/honduras-president-drug-trafficking-hernandez-cecda5df1d44d2db2dc74cfb53a3925b">run for president</a></span> next year — said she looked forward to her husband’s appeal.</p><p>“Today is only a chapter in a series of injustices,” she said.</p><p>Trial witnesses included traffickers who admitted responsibility for dozens of murders and said Hernández was an enthusiastic protector of some of the world’s most powerful cocaine dealers, including notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, who is serving a life prison term in the U.S. </p><p>During his remarks, the judge noted that Guzman had given a $1 million bribe in 2013 directly to Hernández’s brother, Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández, a former Honduran congressman who was <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-honduras-manhattan-courts-united-states-4309764879f1674a1e6be314d8161473">sentenced to life</a></span> in a U.S. prison in 2021 in New York for his own conviction <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-honduras-united-states-drug-trafficking-congress-f33c586b8bdc1c5d92f3706bf4e143c5">on drug charges</a></span>.</p>
    

<p>Hernández shook his head when he heard Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacob Gutwillig tell the judge that he chose to “commit evil.”</p><p>“No one, not even the former president of a country, is above the law,” Gutwillig said. </p><p>Hernández was sentenced in a federal courthouse less than two blocks from where former U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to be sentenced July 11 following his conviction on charges of falsifying business records.</p><p>As he announced the sentence, Castel spoke at length about the ways Hernández had received a fair trial and described much of the key evidence that emerged at trial to prove guilt.</p>
    

<p>Castel described the number of killings linked to the drug trade during Hernández’s political career as “staggering,” saying one drug trafficking witness admitted at the trial that he aided 56 killings and another said he was involved in 78 murders before he began cooperating with U.S. authorities.</p><p>He noted that Hernández only helped the drug traffickers who aided his political ambitions, and not all the time.</p><p>“No, he was too smart for that,” Castel said. The judge said Hernández aided traffickers whenever he could.</p><p>“His No. 1 goal was his own political survival,” Castel said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press Writer Marlon González in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, contributed to this report.</p>

            Protesters in Kenya say they will go ahead with a “One Million People March” on Thursday despite Ruto accepting their key demand of scrapping the bill. A <a href="https://x.com/bonifacemwangi/status/1805960630660145357" target="_blank">poster shared widely</a> on social media calls on all generations to return to the streets across the country on Thursday and block roads leading to the capital Nairobi.

            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spoken with Ruto since the clashes to urge restraint. According to a State Department readout of their call, Blinken “underscored the importance of security forces demonstrating restraint and refraining from violence and encouraged prompt investigations into allegations of human rights abuses.”

            Dramatic scenes in the nation’s capital Nairobi saw government buildings set on fire and a ceremonial mace stolen from the parliament in the melee. Kenyan lawmakers were evacuated from the parliament as police went up against protesters, CNN affiliate NTV Kenya reported.

            The PRWG alleged in a statement published by Amnesty International Kenya that police targeted young, unarmed protesters outside the parliament, with the violence continuing into the night.

            “We saw plainclothes policemen shooting protesters as early as 11 a.m. There was a clear directive to kill protesters,” Law Society of Kenya president Faith Odhiambo alleged in an interview with CNN on Wednesday evening. “There was no intent to let the protesters move around.”

Our message to the government is that if a country is built on fear, one day people will stop fearing. And that’s what we saw on Tuesday.”

<p><b> WHAT ARE COOKIES AND HOW ARE THEY USED?</b></p>

<p>Like many companies, we use cookies (small text files placed on your computer or device) and other tracking technologies on the Services (referred to together from this point forward as “Cookies”, unless otherwise stated), including HTTP cookies, HTML5 and Flash local storage/flash cookies, web beacons/GIFs, embedded scripts, ETags/cache browsers, and software development kits. </p>

<p><b> First-party Cookies</b> </p>

<p>First-party Cookies are placed by us (including through the use of third-party service providers) and are used to allow you to use the Services and their features and to assist in analytics activities.</p>

<p><b> Third-party Cookies</b></p>

<p>Certain third parties may place their Cookies on your device and use them to recognize your device when you visit the Services and when you visit other websites or online services. These third parties collect and use this information pursuant to their own privacy policies. Third-party Cookies enable certain features or functionalities, and advertising, to be provided on the Services. </p>

<p><b> Types of Cookies</b></p>

<p>The Services use the following types of first and third-party Cookies for these purposes:</p>

<p><b> Strictly Necessary Cookies:</b> These Cookies are required for Service functionality, including for system administration, security and fraud prevention, and to enable any purchasing capabilities. You can set your browser to block these Cookies, but some parts of the site may not function properly.</p>

<p><b> Information Storage and Access:</b> These Cookies allow us and our partners to store and access information on the device, such as device identifiers.   </p>

<p><b> Measurement and Analytics:</b> These Cookies collect data regarding your usage of and performance of the Services, apply market research to generate audiences, and measure the delivery and effectiveness of content and advertising. We and our third-party vendors use these Cookies to perform analytics, so we can improve the content and user experience, develop new products and services, and for statistical purposes. They are also used to recognize you and provide further insights across platforms and devices for the above purposes.</p>

<p><b> Personalization Cookies:</b> These Cookies enable us to provide certain features, such as determining if you are a first-time visitor, capping message frequency, remembering choices you have made (e.g., your language preferences, time zone), and assist you with logging in after registration (including across platforms and devices).  These Cookies also allow your device to receive and send information, so you can see and interact with ads and content.</p>

<p> <b> Content Selection and Delivery Cookies:</b> Data collected under this category can also be used to select and deliver personalized content, such as news articles and videos.</p>

<p> <b> Ad Selection and Delivery Cookies:</b> These Cookies are used to collect data about your browsing habits, your use of the Services, your preferences, and your interaction with advertisements across platforms and devices for the purpose of delivering interest-based advertising content on the Services and on third-party sites.

If you reject these Cookies, you may see contextual advertising that may be less relevant to you.</p>

<p><b> Social Media Cookies:</b> These Cookies are set by social media platforms on the Services to enable you to share content with your friends and networks. Social media platforms have the ability to track your online activity outside of the Services. This may impact the content and messages you see on other services you visit.</p>

<p>We and third parties may associate Measurement And Analytics Cookies, Personalization Cookies, Content Selection, Delivery Cookies, and Reporting, Ad Selection, Delivery and Reporting Cookies, and Social Media Cookies with other information we have about you.</p>

You can also use the methods described below to manage Cookies. You must take such steps on each browser or device that you use. If you replace, change or upgrade your browser or device, or delete your cookies, you may need to use these opt-out tools again. As some Cookie-management solutions also rely on Cookies, please adjust your browser Cookie settings carefully, following the relevant instructions below. </p>

<p>Browser Controls: You may be able to disable and manage some Cookies through your browser settings. If you use multiple browsers on the same device, you will need to manage your settings for each browser. Please click on any of the below browser links for instructions: </p>

<p>These are examples of our advertising providers and this is not an exhaustive list. In addition, we are not responsible for the effectiveness of any of these providers’ opt-out mechanisms.  </p>

<p>After you opt out, you will still see advertisements, but they may not be as relevant to you.  </p>

<p><b> Mobile Settings:</b> You may manage the collection of information for interest-based advertising purposes in mobile apps via the device’s settings, including managing the collection of location data. To opt out of mobile ad tracking from Nielsen or other third parties, you can do so by selecting the “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” (for Android devices) options in your device settings. </p>

<p><b> Connected Devices:</b> For connected devices, such as smart TVs or streaming devices, you should review the device’s settings and select the option that allows you to disable automatic content recognition or ad tracking.  Typically, to opt out, such devices require you to select options like “limit ad tracking” or to disable options such as “interest-based advertising,” “interactive TV,” or “smart interactivity”.  These settings vary by device type.  </p>

<p><b> Cross-Device Tracking:</b> If you would like to opt out of our browser-based cross-device tracking for advertising purposes, you may do so by using the various methods described above.  You must opt out separately on each device and each browser that you use. For more information about cross-device matching, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance. If you opt out of cross-device tracking for advertising purposes, we may still conduct cross-device tracking for other purposes, such as analytics.  </p>

<p>Consequences of Deactivation of Cookies: If you disable or remove Cookies, some parts of the Services may not function properly. Information may still be collected and used for other purposes, such as research, online services analytics or internal operations, and to remember your opt-out preferences. </p>
