    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Democratic concerns about Biden's fitness for office persist</strong>: Despite President Joe Biden's Friday night TV interview, Democratic concerns about his fitness for office and ability to effectively campaign against Donald Trump have not been alleviated.</li>
<li><strong>Growing unease among Democrats</strong>: The unease among Democrats is growing, with a fifth House Democrat, Angie Craig of Minnesota, joining others in calling for Biden to step aside. More Democrats may follow suit.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns about losing the presidency and House seats</strong>: Many Democrats are concerned about losing the presidency, House seats, and Senate majority if Biden leads the ticket due to his perceived weak campaign against Trump.</li>
<li><strong>Biden dismisses concerns</strong>: Biden responded to concerns about his debate performance by dismissing it as a "bad episode" and saying only "the Lord Almighty" could convince him to end his bid for re-election.</li>
<li><strong>Pressure to withdraw mounts</strong>: The pressure on Biden to withdraw from the election is mounting, with some Democrats, including Texas congressman Lloyd Doggett, calling for him to make a decision sooner rather than later to allow a new candidate to step in and challenge Trump.</li>

That has been more so for Ms Harris as questions swirl around Mr Biden's re-election bid.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">However, some Democrats acknowledge concerns about Ms Harris as a presidential candidate. She struggled to gain her footing early in her vice-presidency as she was given responsibility for issues including immigration, student debt and voting rights. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Low approval ratings have dogged her in office, although they have improved in recent months. She has since refocused her attention on issues such as abortion rights, which Democrats believe will be crucial in November.</p></div></article></div>

<li>
<p><strong>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's first news conference</strong>: Sir Keir Starmer, the newly elected Prime Minister, held his first news conference in the State Dining Room of No10 Downing Street, a change from the previous government's preferred location.</p>

<p><strong>Government's approach to problems</strong>: Starmer touted his government's approach as being based on "raw honesty", citing the need to confront challenges in areas like prisons and the NHS head-on.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two radio hosts have claimed that they were supplied with questions from aides to President Joe Biden before separate interviews with him, which has raised concerns about the extent of his campaign's control over his public appearances.</li>
<li>Biden's campaign has defended the practice, saying that it is common for interviewees to share topics they would prefer, and that agreeing on topics in advance is not a prerequisite for the interview.</li>
<li>The acknowledgment by Biden's campaign comes as it has been criticized for heavily controlling his public events to minimize potential gaffes and scripted appearances.</li>
<li>The controversy arises as Biden appeared tired and confused during a recent debate, sparking questions about his ability to handle the demands of the presidency at the age of 81.</li>
<li>The debate was notable for its lack of real-time fact-checking, with both parties deciding in advance not to have their moderators fact-check the candidates' statements in real-time.</li>

There were two victims out front of the residence, he said. </p><p>Officers found multiple people injured inside the home and performed first aid on as many as they could, the police chief said. Partygoers told officers "the suspect had fled," and gave them a vehicle description. </p>    
  <p>Other officers coming into the neighborhood saw a vehicle that fit the description, Mallery said. A Florence police officer and sheriff's deputy tried to nab the suspect, the chief said, but he fled.</p><p>A chase ensued, police said, and only ended when the suspect's car drove into a ditch off the roadway. Mallery said it is believed the suspect shot himself while driving and crashed his vehicle. The suspect was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was taken to St. Elizabeth's Hospital where he was pronounced dead, police said.  </p>

<p>Three of the victims were taken to UC Health Hospital. They are currently listed in critical but stable condition, officials said. It appears they will make a "full recovery," the chief said. </p><p>The suspect was known to the partygoers and they identified him to the police. He had been convicted for a previous sex crime, Mallery said, but it doesn't seem to be tied to the shooting.</p><p>"He just showed up," said Mallery, who added that everyone was attending a 21st birthday pool party in honor of the homeowner's son. "Our hearts and prayers go out to the families of the victims."</p><p>The police chief identified the victims during the news conference. The victims are Shane Miller, 20, from Florence, Hayden Rybicki, 20, from Elsmere, Delaney Eary, 19, from Burlington, and Melissa Parrett, 44, from Florence.</p>

But all sides cautioned that a deal is still not guaranteed.</p><p>The two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations, told the Associated Press that Washington's phased deal would first include a "full and complete" six-week cease-fire that would see the release of a number of hostages, including women, older people and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. During the 42 days, Israeli forces would withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza and allow the return of displaced people to their homes in northern Gaza, the officials said.</p>

    </p>
<p>Over that period, Hamas, Israel and mediators would negotiate the terms of the second phase that could see the release of the remaining male hostages, both civilians and soldiers, the officials said. In return, Israel would free additional Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The third phase would see the return of any remaining hostages, including bodies of dead captives, and the start of a years-long reconstruction project.</p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/06/2a976475-028c-4b9f-bb34-e00186b2ca35/thumbnail/620x413/19eb6cb6d1afefc0abc139cbeb11ed1e/ap24188251651437.jpg?v=57e8061b2038d609da26e467de5ddfb8#" alt="South Korea Israel Palestinians " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/06/2a976475-028c-4b9f-bb34-e00186b2ca35/thumbnail/620x413/19eb6cb6d1afefc0abc139cbeb11ed1e/ap24188251651437.jpg?v=57e8061b2038d609da26e467de5ddfb8 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/06/2a976475-028c-4b9f-bb34-e00186b2ca35/thumbnail/1240x826/752ca06395819bb8a0315004ba60fafe/ap24188251651437.jpg?v=57e8061b2038d609da26e467de5ddfb8 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E"></span>

<p>In line with previous proposals, the deal would see around 600 trucks of humanitarian aid entering Gaza daily — including 50 fuel trucks — with half of them bound for the hard-hit northern of the enclave, the two officials said. Following Israel's assault on the southernmost city of Rafah, aid supplies entering Gaza have been reduced to a trickle.</p><p>Israel launched the war in Gaza after Hamas' October attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. Israel says Hamas is still holding about 120 hostages — about a third of them now thought to be dead.</p><p>Since then, the Israeli air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The offensive has caused widespread devastation and a humanitarian crisis that has left hundreds of thousands of people on the brink of famine, according to international officials.</p><p>Months of on-again off-again cease-fire talks have stumbled over Hamas' demand that any deal include a complete end to the war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has offered to pause the fighting but not end it until Israel reaches its goals of destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities and returning all hostages held by the militant group.</p><p>Netanyahu's office did not respond to requests for comment, and there was no immediate comment from Washington.</p><figure class="embed embed--type-video embed--type-content_video is-video embed--float-left embed--size-medium ">

  <p>The idea to mummify bodies likely came from watching other remains naturally undergo the process amid the desert's dry conditions. The mummified bodies were also decorated with reed blankets, clay masks, human hair and more, according to archaeologists. </p><p>While UNESCO has designated the region as a World Heritage Site, the declaration may not save all of the relics. Multiple museums, including the Miguel de Azapa Archaeological Museum in the ancient city of Arica, put the Chincorro culture on display. Some mummies and other relics are safely ensconced in those climate-controlled exhibits, but the remains still hidden in the arid desert remain at risk. </p>

<p>"If we have an increase in sea surface temperatures, for example, across the coast of northern Chile, that would increase atmospheric humidity," said Claudio LaTorre, a paleo-ecologist with the Catholic University of Chile. "And that in turn would generate decomposition, (in) places where you don't have decomposition today, and you would lose the mummies themselves." </p><p>Other clues that archaeologists can find in the environment may also be lost. </p><p>"Human-induced climate change is one aspect that we're really worried about, because it'll change a number of different aspects that are forming the desert today," said LaTorre. </p><p>Arriaza is working to raise awareness about the mummies, hoping that that will lead to even more preservation. </p>

<p>While unemployment is still historically low, its rate of increase could be a sign of deteriorating economic conditions. That’s where the so-called <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/what-is-sahm-rule-unemployment-predictor-recession/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/what-is-sahm-rule-unemployment-predictor-recession/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/what-is-sahm-rule-unemployment-predictor-recession/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sahm Rule</a> comes in.</p>



<p>It says that when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate rises by at least a half-percentage point from its low during the previous 12 months, then a recession has started. This rule would have signaled every recession since 1970.</p>



<p>Based on the latest unemployment figures from the Labor Department’s monthly report on Friday, the gap between the two has <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmacro&amp;stream=business" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmacro&amp;stream=business" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosmacro&amp;stream=business" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">expanded to 0.43</a> in June from 0.37 in May.</p>



<p>It’s now at the highest level since March 2021, when the economy was still recovering from the pandemic-induced crash. </p><p></p>



<p>The creator of the rule, Claudia Sahm, was an economist at the Federal Reserve and is now chief economist at New Century Advisors. She has previously explained that even from low levels a rising unemployment rate can set off a negative feedback loop that leads to a recession. </p>



<p>“When workers lose paychecks, they cut back on spending, and as businesses lose customers, they need fewer workers, and so on,” she wrote in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-07/one-highly-accurate-recession-indicator-could-be-wrong-this-time" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-07/one-highly-accurate-recession-indicator-could-be-wrong-this-time" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-07/one-highly-accurate-recession-indicator-could-be-wrong-this-time" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Bloomberg opinion column</a> in November, adding that once this feedback loop starts, it is usually self-reinforcing and accelerates.</p>



<p>But she also said the pandemic may have caused so many disruptions in the economy and the labor market that indicators like the Sahm Rule that are based on unemployment may not be as accurate right now.</p>



<p>A few weeks ago, however, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/economist-sahm-who-devised-recession-rule-says-the-fed-is-playing-with-fire-.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/economist-sahm-who-devised-recession-rule-says-the-fed-is-playing-with-fire-.html" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/economist-sahm-who-devised-recession-rule-says-the-fed-is-playing-with-fire-.html" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sahm told CNBC</a> that the Federal Reserve risks sending the economy into a recession by continuing to hold off on rate cuts.</p>



<p>“My baseline is not recession,” she said on June 18. “But it’s a real risk, and I do not understand why the Fed is pushing that risk. I’m not sure what they’re waiting for.”</p><p></p>



<p>That came days after the Fed’s June policy meeting when central bankers kept rates steady after holding them at 5.25%-5.5%—the highest since 2001—since July 2023. </p>



<p>The Fed meets again at the end of this month and is expected to remain on hold, but odds are rising that a cut could happen in September.</p>



<p>Sahm also said last month that the Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s stated preference to wait for a deterioration in job gains is a mistake and that policymakers should instead focus on the rate of change in the labor market.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“We’ve gone into recession with all different levels of unemployment,” she explained. “These dynamics feed on themselves. If people lose their jobs, they stop spending, [and] more people lose jobs.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Wall Street has had a more sanguine view of the economy, citing last year’s widespread recession predictions that proved wrong as well as the AI boom that’s helping to fuel a wave of investment and earnings growth.</p><p></p>



<p>Last month, Neuberger Berman senior portfolio manager Steve Eisman also pointed to the boost in infrastructure spending.</p>



<p>“We’re just powering through, and I think the only conclusion you can reach is that the U.S. economy is more dynamic than it’s ever been in its history,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/13/big-short-investor-steve-eisman-the-u-s-economy-is-more-dynamic-than-its-ever-been.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/13/big-short-investor-steve-eisman-the-u-s-economy-is-more-dynamic-than-its-ever-been.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">he told CNBC</a>.</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 dTdzGq article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get global CEO perspectives on the biggest stories in business. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=finance" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">Sign up for free</a><p>.</p></div></div>
