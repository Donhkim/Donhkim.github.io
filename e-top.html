The Trump team later in the day used its opportunity to question Daniels to paint her as motivated by personal animus and profiting off her claims against Trump.</p>
    
<p>“Am I correct that you hate President Trump?” defense lawyer Susan Necheles asked Daniels.</p><p>“Yes,” she acknowledged.</p><p>Daniels’ statements are central to the case because in the final weeks of Trump’s 2016 Republican presidential campaign, his then-lawyer and personal fixer, Michael Cohen, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-cohen-stormy-daniels-grand-jury-d48153fc2d3fe7a656e8a24ad1acd082">paid her $130,000 to keep quiet</a></span> about what she says was an awkward and unexpected sexual encounter with Trump in July 2006 at a celebrity golf outing in Lake Tahoe. Trump has pleaded not guilty.</p>




    

<p>Led by a prosecutor’s questioning, Daniels described how an initial meeting at a golf tournament, where they discussed the adult film industry, progressed to a “brief” sexual encounter that she said Trump initiated after inviting her to dinner and back to his hotel suite.</p><p>She said she didn’t feel physically or verbally threatened, though she knew his bodyguard was outside the suite. There was also what she perceived as an imbalance of power: Trump “was bigger and blocking the way,” she said.</p><p>At the time, Trump was married to his wife, Melania, who has not been in court for the trial. Daniels said Trump told her they did not sleep in the same room, prompting him to shake his head at the defense table.</p><p>After it ended, Daniels said, “It was really hard to get my shoes because my hands were shaking so hard.”</p><p>“He said: ‘Oh, it was great. Let’s get together again, honey bunch,’” Daniels said. “I just wanted to leave.”</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

<p>Trump’s reaction to her testimony at the defense table prompted Judge Juan Merchan to summon his lawyers to a quiet discussion at the bench.</p><p>“I understand that your client is upset at this point, but he is cursing audibly, and he is shaking his head visually and that’s contemptuous. It has the potential to intimidate the witness and the jury can see that,” Merchan said, adding, “I am speaking to you here at the bench because I don’t want to embarrass him.”</p><p>“I will talk to him,” Blanche replied.</p><p>In the years since the encounter was disclosed, Daniels has emerged as a vocal Trump antagonist, sharing her story innumerable times and criticizing the former president with mocking and pejorative jabs. But there was no precedent for Tuesday’s testimony, when she came face-to-face with Trump and was asked under oath in an austere courtroom to describe her experiences to a jury weighing whether to convict a former American president of felony crimes for the first time in history.</p><p>She told jurors how she met Trump because the adult film studio she worked for at the time sponsored one of the holes on the golf course. She said they had a brief conversation when Trump’s group passed through, chatting about the adult film industry and her directing abilities. The celebrity real estate developer remarked that she must be “the smart one” if she was making films, Daniels recalled.</p>
    

<p>Later, in an area known as the “gift room,” where celebrity golfers collected gift bags and swag, Trump remembered her as “the smart one” and asked her to dinner, Daniels said.</p><p>She said her then-publicist suggested in a phone call that Trump’s invitation was a good excuse to skip a work dinner and would “make a great story” and perhaps help her career.</p><p>“What could possibly go wrong?” she recalled the publicist saying.</p>
    

<p>The two saw each other periodically in the ensuing years, when she said she spurned Trump’s advances. </p><p>In 2011, several years after she and Trump were last in touch, she said she learned from her agent that the story of her encounter with Trump had made its way to a magazine.</p><p>She said she agreed to an interview for $15,000 because “I’d rather make the money than somebody make money off of me, and at least I could control the narrative.” The story never ran, but later that year, she was alarmed when an item turned up on a website.</p><p>Perhaps seeking to preempt defense claims that she was in urgent need of a massive payout, Daniels testified that she was in the best financial shape of her life when she authorized her manager to shop her story during the 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p>She said she had no intent of approaching Cohen or Trump to have them pay her.</p><p>“My motivation wasn’t money,” she said. “It was to get the story out,” she testified.</p><p>But Necheles zeroed in on that point, pressing Daniels on the fact that she <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/stormy-daniels-trump-defamation-lawsuit-0ee5623fc8965ad3d2fc77a7126d24c7">owes Trump hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees</a></span> stemming from an unsuccessful defamation lawsuit and that she tweeted in 2022 that she “will go to jail before I pay a penny.”</p><p>“That was me saying, ‘I will not pay for telling the truth,’” Daniels testified Tuesday.</p><p>She later forcefully denied that she was trying to squeeze Trump for money.</p><p>“You were looking to extort money from President Trump,” Necheles said.</p><p>“False,” Daniels responded.</p><p>“Well, that’s what you did,” the lawyer said.</p><p>“False,” Daniels answered.</p><p>Daniels was expected to return to the witness stand Thursday, when the trial resumes.</p><p>Testimony so far has made clear that at the time of the payment to Daniels, Trump and his campaign were reeling from the October 2016 publication of the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-access-hollywood-hush-money-new-york-2c52279a45ede2a111ff1fe447d2fdac">never-before-seen 2005 “Access Hollywood” footage</a></span> in which he boasted about grabbing women’s genitals without their permission.</p><p>Before that video was made public, “there was very little if any interest” in Daniels’ claims, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-stormy-daniels-hush-money-election-2024-d2f9badee0b28a60d32bc98c0d4e783f">according to testimony earlier in the trial</a></span> from her then-lawyer, Keith Davidson. A deal was reached with the National Enquirer for Daniels’ story, but the tabloid backed out. Davidson began negotiating with Cohen directly, hiked up the price to $130,000, and reached a deal.</p><p>After the deadline for the $130,000 payment from Cohen came and went, she authorized Davidson to cancel the deal. He did, by email, according to documents shown in court. But about two weeks later, the deal was revived.</p><p>Daniels testified that she ended up with about $96,000 of the $130,000 payment, after her lawyer and agent got their cuts.</p><p>She also said she was steadfast in abiding by her nondisclosure agreement with Cohen, declining to comment to The Wall Street Journal for a November 2016 story that reported she had been in discussions to tell her story on “Good Morning America” but that nothing had come of it.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Judge Aileen Cannon has postponed the trial of former President Donald Trump's classified documents case</strong>: The trial, which was previously set for May, has been indefinitely postponed due to significant issues surrounding classified evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The postponement means there are no trial dates currently set for the other three criminal cases against Trump</strong>: This includes his trial for alleged hush money payments to a former adult film star, as well as other cases related to his alleged misuse of charity funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cannon's order pushes the trial closer to the 2024 election</strong>: The postponement means that the trial may not take place until after the election, potentially delaying any legal resolution until after the new Administration has taken office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The judge's new schedule outlines a process that will take at least until late July</strong>: Cannon has listed all the legal disputes that need to be decided before a jury can hear the case, which will take several months to resolve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The postponement raises questions about whether Trump will face legal consequences before the election</strong>: The uncertainty surrounding the timing of the trial raises questions about whether Trump will face legal consequences before the election, and whether the justice system will intervene before the outcome of the election is known.</p>

            In an order Tuesday, Cannon cancelled the May trial date and did not set a new date. While Trump was in criminal court Tuesday for his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-05-07-24/index.html">hush money trial in New York</a>, Cannon’s move means there are no trial dates currently set for the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/07/politics/trump-indictments-criminal-cases/">other three criminal cases against him</a>.

            By indefinitely postponing the classified documents trial, Cannon’s order pushes it closer to the 2024 election – and potentially afterward.

            The judge’s new schedule lays out all the legal disputes that Cannon must decide before a jury could hear the case. Cannon said that process will take at least until late July of this year.
    </p>

            Cannon noted in her Tuesday order that there are eight substantive pending motions she has yet to decide. She also reiterated that she believes the national security mishandling allegations in the case “present novel and difficult questions.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvwwlf0t000u3b6j70da22fh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Though all parties agreed that the case wouldn’t be ready to go before a jury in May, prosecutors still pushed for a July trial date, while Trump and his co-defendants proposed dates in August and September. Although Trump’s attorneys have continuously asserted in court filings that a pre-election trial would be “unfair.”

            The further delayed trial also could put Trump’s two federal cases on a collision course.

            In Washington, DC, the former president is charged with alleged crimes he committed during his presidency to reverse the 2020 election results. That case, also brought by special counsel Jack Smith’s team, has been on pause <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/25/politics/takeaways-trump-immunity-supreme-court/index.html">while the Supreme Court considers Trump’s claims of sweeping immunity</a>. A decision from the high court is expected by July.

            Trump is charged in the Florida case with mishandling classified documents and with working with two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, to obstruct the Justice Department’s investigation. All three have pleaded not guilty.

            Cannon said in her new scheduling order that she will hold a hearing on what had been considered Trump’s longshot request for records from the Biden administration.

            The move by Cannon is a significant win for the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee. The proceeding will give Trump and his attorneys a platform to air unfounded theories about the prosecution, including the accusation that it is politically motivated.
    </p>

            Attorneys for Smith have vehemently denied allegations of political bias and opposed the move to hold the hearing as unnecessary and unjustified.

            In his bid for records from the Biden administration, Trump has argued that he is entitled to a broad swath of records from various federal agencies, including from President Joe Biden’s White House, because Trump claims those agencies are effectively part of the prosecution team.

            Smith’s office countered that Trump’s theories were “baseless,” that the discovery request was “frivolous,” and that the defense lawyers’ arguments had fallen well short of the high threshold for holding such a proceeding.

            Biden’s speech was a somber – yet impassioned – moment of reflection amid a tense and pivotal time in his reelection push. The October 7 attack and the subsequent war in Gaza has proved to be one of the most politically fraught periods of Biden’s presidency, one that is particularly personal for the longtime supporter of Israel who views antisemitism as antithetical to American values.

            But Biden’s staunch support for Israel’s war against Hamas, which has now led to the deaths of more than 34,000 Palestinians, has caused deep fractures in the coalition that sent him to the White House in 2020. Protests on college campuses over Israel’s campaign and the Biden administration’s support for it have spread across the nation, highlighting potential political problems that the president is facing with the younger voters he needs to win a second term.

            On Tuesday, during his keynote address at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum’s annual Days of Remembrance ceremony at the US Capitol, Biden sought to draw direct links between the horrors experienced by Jews under the Nazi regime to what happened in Israel last year and rising antisemitism after Hamas’ attack.

            “This ancient hatred of Jews didn’t begin with the Holocaust – it didn’t end with the Holocaust, either, or even after our victory in World War II. This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,” Biden said.

            “Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7 – including Hamas’ appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize. It’s absolutely despicable – and it must stop,” he said, raising his voice.

            The president and his administration now face another potential tipping point in the war. The speech came as Israel’s military has issued a call for residents of the eastern part of the Gazan city of Rafah to “evacuate immediately,” raising questions about whether Israel’s long-threatened assault on the city will soon be carried out – a move that the Biden administration has strongly cautioned against.

Biden and his top lieutenants have repeatedly and emphatically made clear to their Israeli counterparts that they want to see a clear plan to protect civilians before any troops enter the area. While National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Biden “again made this clear” in a Monday call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it’s not clear such a plan has been presented to the US.

            Biden’s speech came one day after Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. To mark the day, Biden’s campaign issued a lengthy list of former President Donald Trump’s antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/11/politics/trump-despots-advisers-sound-alarm/index.html">has allegedly said</a> that Adolf Hitler “did some good things.” The speech was also not written to focus on drawing a political contrast with Trump, as so many of Biden’s speeches are these days, the senior administration official said.

After all, it is not often that Serbia finds itself as part of a three-stop tour by an international leader of such stature.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">But Serbia has been deepening its relationship with China in recent years, even as it continues with negotiations to join the European Union.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Mr Xi is likely to use his trip to highlight his criticisms of Nato. His visit coincides with the 25th anniversary of the US airstrikes on China’s embassy in Belgrade. And in an editorial for the Serbian newspaper, Politika, the president made it clear that feelings over that incident still run high.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">“We should never forget,” he wrote. “The Chinese people cherish peace, but we will never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.”</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">That kind of rhetoric resonates in Serbia, where the vast majority of people oppose Nato membership. That is a key factor in why this stop on Mr Xi’s European tour makes perfect sense.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 esMqKN"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-83607862-1 ijYvQn"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6c7a/live/38fc1970-0c99-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6c7a/live/38fc1970-0c99-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6c7a/live/38fc1970-0c99-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6c7a/live/38fc1970-0c99-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6c7a/live/38fc1970-0c99-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6c7a/live/38fc1970-0c99-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6c7a/live/38fc1970-0c99-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6c7a/live/38fc1970-0c99-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Oliver Bunic/Bloomberg  A visitor lays flowers on a monument at the site of a former Chinese Embassy ahead of the state visit of China's President Xi Jinping, in Belgrade, Serbia, on Tuesday, May 7, 2024" class="sc-83607862-0 jvrVsN"><span class="sc-83607862-2 jPBxZH">Oliver Bunic/Bloomberg </span></div></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 cvIHve"><figcaption class="sc-d523993f-0 ibDkCb">Nato's 1999 bombing campaign was aimed at pushing Serb forces out of Kosovo</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Commercial connections are also a factor. The two countries signed a free trade agreement last year, building on a “comprehensive strategic partnership” in 2016 – the year of Mr Xi’s previous visit to Serbia.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">China now claims to be the largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Serbia. Its ambassador, Li Ming, says that Hisense, along with mining company Zijin and tyre manufacturer Linglong, provide 20,000.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">UN trade figures actually put China in fifth place on the foreign direct investment list, behind Germany, Italy, the US and Russia.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Nonetheless, the Chinese investments are eye-catching – and only likely to increase. Serbia has just taken delivery of its first Chinese electric high-speed trains. They will eventually run alongside Swiss-made rolling stock on the Belgrade-Budapest railway, which is being reconstructed with Chinese expertise and finance.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">And that is just the start. Serbia’s infrastructure minister, Goran Vesic, says Chinese partners will work on other infrastructure, including roads, bridges, tunnels and sewage. “There is really a lot of room for co-operation with Chinese companies,” he told Serbia’s national broadcaster, RTS.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">No wonder Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vucic, is planning to personally serve the finest wines his country has to offer to his Chinese counterpart during a banquet in Mr Xi’s honour.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 esMqKN"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-83607862-1 ijYvQn"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/82a8/live/929a6910-0c98-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/82a8/live/929a6910-0c98-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/82a8/live/929a6910-0c98-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/82a8/live/929a6910-0c98-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/82a8/live/929a6910-0c98-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/82a8/live/929a6910-0c98-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/82a8/live/929a6910-0c98-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/82a8/live/929a6910-0c98-11ef-91ef-3101b349bfcd.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Reuters/Aurélien Morissard French President Emmanuel Macron drinks coffee in a restaurant with Chinese President Xi Jinping, his wife Peng Liyuan, and Brigitte Macron, on Tuesday, May 7, 2024, at the Tourmalet pass, in the Pyrenees mountains" class="sc-83607862-0 jvrVsN"><span class="sc-83607862-2 jPBxZH">Reuters/Aurélien Morissard</span></div></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 cvIHve"><figcaption class="sc-d523993f-0 ibDkCb">Xi Jinping was treated to a wet day in the Pyrenees at the end of his French visit</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-b77c8bb-0 daiYje"><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Noting that within five years Serbian wine will face no import tariffs in China, Mr Vucic told China Central Television that Serbian wines were “not as expensive as [those] in France” and that he believed Mr Xi was “going to like” his selections.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">This was perhaps a gentle dig at Emmanuel Macron, who hosted Mr Xi for the first stop on his European trip. The French president’s offering was a bottle of Rémy Martin Louis XIII cognac, which would cost the best part of €5,000 in Belgrade.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">A trip to the Pyrenees was also included in the charm offensive – to sweeten pleas by Mr Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for Mr Xi to ensure more balanced trade with Europe and influence Russia’s President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">After Belgrade, the next stop for China’s president will be Budapest, where he will meet his strongest ally among the leaders of EU member states, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.</p><p class="sc-e1853509-0 bmLndb">Chinese investments are also a strong factor there – with a factory for electric car giant BYD among the projects that buttress Mr Orban’s resistance to the EU consensus on everything from migration to providing arms to Ukraine.</p></div></article></div>

<ol>
<li>The UK government has confirmed that a nation state, suspected to be China, hacked into the UK's armed forces' payroll system, compromising the personal information of regular and reserve personnel, veterans, and their families.</li>
<li>The data breach, which was discovered through an investigation, did not appear to have resulted in any data being stolen, but the UK Ministry of Defence took the precaution of alerting those service personnel affected through chain of command.</li>
<li>The hack is believed to have occurred when a contractor responsible for payroll was breached, allowing the malicious actor to gain access to a part of the armed forces' payment network that is separate from the Ministry's core network.</li>
<li>The compromised information includes names, bank details, and in some cases, addresses of those affected, which has raised concerns over potential identity theft and misuse of personal data.</li>
<li>The UK government has chosen not to officially name China as the responsible nation state, despite various news outlets, including Sky News, The Telegraph, and the BBC, reporting that China is the suspected culprit, and China's foreign ministry pre-emptively denying any involvement.</li>
