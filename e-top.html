Torrential rainfall could last through the overnight hours, triggering flash flooding and landslides in Jamaica. This is the <a href="https://x.com/wxjerdman/status/1808087859766677986" target="_blank" rel="" class="">strongest hurricane to strike Jamaica in almost 17 years</a>, since Hurricane Dean in 2007. </li><li class=""><em class="">Wednesday night and early T​hursday</em>: Beryl will make its closest approach to the Cayman Islands, particularly Grand Cayman, with storm surge flooding, high winds and heavy rain.

Storm surge flooding, potentially damaging winds and flooding rain are all possible.

<li>An anonymous ally of the President said that Biden knows he needs to have two successful events in order to stay in a strong position, and that if that doesn't happen, the situation could change.</li>
<li>The President is still considered to be "deeply in the fight" for re-election, according to the ally, indicating that Biden's campaign is still viable but under pressure to recover from his recent debate performance.</li>

    <p>Unfortunately, the provided text is not a news article, but rather a snippet of a news article, and it doesn't contain the actual content of the article. Therefore, I can't extract 5 key points from it.</p>
<p>However, based on the title and the snippet, I can make an educated guess about the content of the article:</p>
<p>The article likely discusses Reform UK leader Richard Tice claiming that a US Republican politician was inspired by his speeches in the European Parliament to run for the White House. The article may provide more details about the specific politician, the nature of their inspiration, and any subsequent connection or endorsement between the two.</p>

            Every effort the president and his White House and campaign teams make to fix the problem end <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/01/politics/biden-campaign-reelection-debate/index.html">up exacerbating it</a>. Biden, for instance, on Tuesday evening joked to donors that he “almost fell asleep onstage” with Trump after two grueling trips to Europe last month. It was an odd way to parry claims that he is no longer fit for the demanding duties of his office as he asks for a second term at age 81.

            The fallout from the debate has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/30/politics/biden-family-camp-david-debate/index.html">created another extraordinary twist</a> in a stunning campaign featuring two presidents, one who is a convicted felon, and the other who is already the oldest to hold the job in history. The debate crystalized many fears of Democrats about Biden’s prospects and played into months of claims by Trump, 78, that his rival is weak and mentally diminished.

            White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/white-house-biden-mental-fitness/index.html">endured a briefing</a> that was almost as painful to watch as the debate itself. She said that while Biden had a cold at the debate, he hadn’t taken medication but was now feeling better. But she declined to go beyond Biden’s already released <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/16/politics/joe-biden-routine-physical-walter-reed/index.html">annual physical results</a> that found him fit for duty in February. The explanations did not account for why Biden trailed off in some answers, sometimes appeared incoherent and stared open-mouthed while Trump spoke during the CNN debate.

            Biden’s team also keeps answering the wrong question.
    </p>

            “The best predictor of future behavior is past performance,” Jean-Pierre said, stressing that the true test of Biden capabilities was his record in office for the past 3½ years.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly55xqpl000l3b6kvsru8yf8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            But the issue that was really posed by the debate was whether voters can imagine him – in his diminished current state – able to fully serve another term that would end when he is 86. Jean-Pierre insisted that “we understand how the American people are feeling. We get it, we do.” But her briefing created only more intrigue about what really went on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/01/politics/joe-biden-immunity-supreme-court/index.html">inside the president’s tight inner circle.</a>
    </p>

            While the first cracks are appearing in the Democratic firewall around the president, the public calls for him to step aside so the party can choose another nominee are not yet anywhere near critical mass. But the calls by senior Democrats for more explanation from the president and for energy in his campaigning are now impossible for Biden and his team to ignore. And the ultimate outcome of the panic over Biden’s performance is now not possible to predict – a hugely vulnerable position for a president seeking a second term.
    </p>

            Democratic Sen. Peter Welch from Vermont said Tuesday: “The big question going into that debate was the age question. … The outcome of the debate was that that question on age was intensified.”
    </p>

            “We have got to deal with that. That’s the real issue, and have frank conversations about it, because at the end of the day, the existential question facing the Democratic Party is how do we keep Trump from being president – and whatever it takes, every decision each of us makes from President Biden down to a precinct captain in the South Side of Chicago should be through the lens of how best do we protect Democracy and protect America,” Welch told CNN’s Abby Phillip on “NewsNight.”

            Perhaps most importantly, the comparison between the wise, sober, statesmanlike Biden and the wild, lawless Trump that the president’s campaign had anticipated for months has been obliterated by speculation over Biden’s health and endurance. Biden needed to use the debate to turn around a race he was in danger of losing, and he may now have squandered his best chance to overtake the ex-president.

            In a new effort to calm public concern, Biden <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-interview-abc-george-stephanopoulos/index.html">will grant an interview</a> to George Stephanopoulos of ABC News on Friday in what is now shaping up as an even more critical test of his acuity than the debate. And he’ll meet Democratic governors in Washington on Wednesday, both in person and virtually, following demands for direct contact that underscored the fact that many Democrats believe Biden’s inner circle has been remote and unresponsive to their concerns over a period of months.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly55xqpm000q3b6k9o1x23pn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            One of those governors, Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, said in a remarkably candid interview with CNN on Tuesday that Biden’s debate was “rough” and that whatever the polls say, it will damage his campaign.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly55xqpm000r3b6kpwldn2m3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “Joe Biden is our nominee, and ultimately that decision on continuing or not will fall to him and his family,” Beshear, who’s been mentioned as a potential replacement nominee if Biden backs out, told Pamela Brown. “But I don’t think there’s anything wrong with asking the president to talk to the American people a little bit more about his health or that debate performance.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly55xqpm000s3b6k61oi0ew3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            He added, “It’s like seeing somebody that you haven’t seen in a while and they seem a little  off, and you asking how they’re doing and then listening to their answer. It’s both showing concern for them but also just trying to make sure that things are OK.”
    </p>

            Like Beshear, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi couched her comments by saying Biden is a great president and that Trump would pose a serious threat to the rule of law. But she also speculated on the president’s health.

            “I think it’s a legitimate question to say, is this an episode or is this a condition?” she asked on MSNBC on Tuesday, adding that it was also a fair question to ask about the presumptive Republican nominee.

            Biden’s political position deteriorated on Tuesday as dawn broke, when Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley told CNN’s Kasie Hunt that the president needed to understand that his decision on whether to stay in the race would reverberate for years to come and that the House and Senate were at stake.
    </p>

            “There’s a large and increasing group of House Democrats concerned about the president’s candidacy, representing a broad swath of the caucus,” another House Democratic lawmaker told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on condition of anonymity to speak candidly. “We are deeply concerned about his trajectory and his ability to win. We want to give him space to make a decision [to step aside], but we will be increasingly vocal about our concerns if he doesn’t.”

            <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/cnn-poll-post-debate/index.html">A new CNN/SSRS poll, meanwhile, showed </a>that three-quarters of Americans believe Democrats would have a better chance of beating Trump with a candidate other than Biden. And even unpopular Vice President Kamala Harris fared better in the matchup with Trump than her boss.

            Another danger sign for the president is that despite his insistence that he will stay in the race, some Democrats are beginning to answer questions about what would happen if he was no longer the nominee – despite the extraordinary logistical challenges that would entail at the Democratic National Convention in August.

<li>The US Supreme Court has handed down a ruling that grants former President Donald Trump broad immunity from prosecution, potentially emboldening him to engage in activities that were previously seen as unethical or illegal.</li>
<li>Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented from the opinion, warning that it could lead to extreme scenarios such as a president accepting bribes, staging a military coup, or ordering the killing of a rival, and being protected from prosecution for all of it.</li>

<li>The opinion has raised concerns that it will broaden the range of actions that presidents are willing to take, as they will be seen as being protected from prosecution for their actions.</li>

<p>“Over the long term, I think it will broaden what presidents are willing to do because they will see that there’s a gray zone that the Supreme Court laid out,” said Princeton University professor Julian Zelizer, who studies political history. The effect of the opinion, he said, will be to “broaden the scope of what’s going to be permissible” and give presidents sufficient cover for acts that may veer into criminality.</p>
    
<p>The <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts</a></span> did not dismiss the case <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc">charging Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential race</a></span>, as Trump had desired, and it left intact the long-established principle that there’s no immunity for purely personal acts. But it significantly narrowed the case by finding that presidents enjoy absolute immunity for their core constitutional duties and are entitled to the presumption of immunity for other official acts.</p>




    

<p>“This is a full-throated endorsement of the unitary executive theory” in a dramatic way, said Cornell University law professor Michael Dorf, referring to the theory that the U.S. Constitution gives the president expansive control over the government’s executive branch.</p><p>From a practical perspective, the court’s opinion means that the trial judge, Tanya Chutkan, must now engage in further fact-finding analysis to determine how much of the conduct alleged in the indictment from special counsel Jack Smith can remain part of the case.</p><p>Importantly for Trump, the one area the conservative majority said was unquestionably off-limits for prosecutors was his command of, and communications with, the Justice Department. </p><p>That includes his directives to department leadership after the 2020 election to conduct what prosecutors said were “sham” investigations into bogus claims of election fraud, as well as his attempts to use the department’s authority to advance his fruitless efforts to remain in power.</p>
    

<p>Though the opinion doesn’t make new law about the interplay between the White House and the Justice Department, Roberts affirmed that a president has “exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials” and may also “discuss potential investigations and prosecutions with his Attorney General and other Justice Department officials to carry out his constitutional duty to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’”</p><p>“I do think that this is a norm-breaking opinion and I can imagine Trump using this as a basis for a complete destruction of DOJ independence,” said Boston College law professor Kent Greenfield.</p><p>That position from the nation’s highest court is welcome news for Trump, particularly as he and his allies have suggested wanting to use the power of the presidency — including, presumably, the investigative authority of the Justice Department — to pursue retribution against political enemies. </p>
    

<p>After his <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-verdict-republicans-revenge-1c35203e6fd5a62d490969bea1eb9174">May conviction in his New York hush money case,</a></span> Trump suggested he might try to retaliate against Hillary Clinton, his 2016 opponent, if he returns to the White House.</p><p>“Wouldn’t it be terrible to throw the president’s wife and the former secretary of state, think of it, the former secretary of state, but the president’s wife, into jail? Wouldn’t that be a terrible thing? But they want to do it,” Trump said in an interview on Newsmax. “It’s a terrible, terrible path that they’re leading us to. And it’s very possible that it’s going to have to happen to them.”</p><p>More recently, he reposted a meme that suggested that <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-impeachments-afghanistan-coronavirus-pandemic-liz-cheney-490f74f08439ee4a7438dfd8d03aac32">former congresswoman Liz Cheney</a></span>, who as the No. 3 Republican in the House broke ranks with her party and voted to impeach Trump over the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege">Jan. 6, 2021 riot</a></span> at the U.S. Capitol, had committed treason and should face a military tribunal.</p>
    

<p>The posts and comments raise concerns given how Trump’s interactions with the FBI and Justice Department as president <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shattered longstanding norms and became central to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation</a></span> into whether he had obstructed an inquiry into potential Russia coordination with his 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p>Trump <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-pardon-michael-flynn-russia-aeef585b08ba6f2c763c8c37bfd678ed">urged his then-FBI director, James Comey</a></span>, to end an investigation into a close ally and fired him weeks later, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-united-states-government-0eb3aeff9821465cb630d81e62cc9450">berated his hand-picked attorney general, Jeff Sessions,</a></span> for having recused himself from the Russia investigation and also sought the termination of Mueller. </p><p>In his report, Mueller did not reach a determination as to whether Trump had illegally obstructed the investigation, declining to make a conclusion in part of because of a Justice Department legal opinion that says sitting presidents cannot be indicted. But he did say that presidents were not “categorically and permanently” immunized for obstructing justice by using their presidential power.</p><p>To be sure, there are safeguards still in place that could prevent most presidents from testing the limits of criminal immunity. The threat of impeachment by Congress remains — Trump was impeached over a call with Ukraine’s leader and Jan. 6, but acquitted by the Senate — as do the practices, protocols and norms that govern Washington bureaucracy. </p><p>Roberts, for one, sought in his majority opinion to downplay the impact, saying Sotomayor was striking “a tone of chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the Court actually does today.”</p><p>But even if the scope of presidential power is not directly expanded by the opinion, there’s no question the ruling could benefit any future president determined to abuse those powers.</p><p>“Not every president will take advantage, but the lesson, I think, of Donald Trump is: one might,” Zelizer said. “Or the lesson of Richard Nixon is: one might. And the ‘one mights’ are the lessons that you’re looking for.”</p>

<p>“This is chilling,” former Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson wrote on the social platform X. “Their idea of a second American Revolution is to undo the first one.”</p>
    
<p>James Singer, a spokesperson for President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign, pointed to this week’s Fourth of July holiday in an emailed statement.</p><p>“248 years ago tomorrow America declared independence from a tyrannical king, and now Donald Trump and his allies want to make him one at our expense,” Singer said, adding that Trump and his allies are ”dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America.”</p>

Democrats, in turn, have accused their Republican counterparts of violence, using the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot in which Trump supporters tried to forcibly overturn his loss to President Joe Biden.</p>

The Israeli military said a number of projectiles which fell in open areas sparked fires, but no injuries were reported.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The military said Nasser commanded Hezbollah’s Aziz Unit, which is responsible for launching rockets from south-western Lebanon, and accused him of directing a “large number of terror attacks”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It also described him as “the counterpart” of Taleb Sami Abdullah, the commander of another unit whose killing last month prompted Hezbollah to launch more than 200 rockets and missiles into northern Israel in a single day.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Since then, there has been a flurry of diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions, with the UN and US warning of the potentially catastrophic consequences of a war that could also draw in Iran and other allied groups.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian group that is also backed by Iran. Both groups are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In recent weeks, Israeli officials have repeatedly warned that they will use military force to restore security along the northern border if diplomacy fails.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“We are striking Hezbollah very hard every day and we will also reach a state of full readiness to take any action required in Lebanon, or to reach an arrangement from a position of strength,” Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday. “We prefer an arrangement, but if reality forces us we will know how to fight.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Hezbollah, heavily armed and long seen as a significantly superior foe to Hamas, has said it does not want a full-out war with Israel and that it will observe in Lebanon any ceasefire in Gaza. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“Israel can decide what it wants: limited war, total war, partial war,” the group's deputy leader, Naim Qassem, said in an interview with the Associated Press on Tuesday. “But it should expect that our response and our resistance will not be within a ceiling and rules of engagement set by Israel.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">So far, more than 400 people have been reported killed in Lebanon, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, and 25 people in Israel, mostly soldiers.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Tens of thousands from communities on both sides of the border have also been displaced.</p></div></div>

The state’s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, told reporters that a crowd rushed toward the preacher to touch him as he was descending from the stage, and volunteers struggled to intervene.</p>
    

<p>An initial report from police suggested that thousands of people then thronged the exits and many slipped on the muddy ground, causing them to fall and be crushed. Most of the dead were women.</p>



<p>The chaos appeared to continue outside the tent when people ran toward the preacher, a Hindu guru known locally as Bhole Baba, as he left in a vehicle. His security personnel pushed the crowd back, causing more people to fall, according to officials.</p>
    
<p>Authorities were investigating and searching for the organizers, whose whereabouts were not known. Police registered a case of culpable homicide against two organizers, but excluded the preacher. Culpable homicide carries a maximum punishment of life imprisonment in India.

<p>A.P.

Followers from across the state — India’s most populous with over 200 million people — traveled to the village, with rows of parked vehicles stretching 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles). </p><p>State official Ashish Kumar said there were insufficient exits in the tent. Experts said the event violated safety norms. “The function was held in a makeshift tent without ensuring multiple exit routes,” said Sanjay Srivastava, a disaster management expert.</p><p>Sonu Kumar was one of many residents who helped move dead bodies after the stampede and its “heart-wrenching” screams.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>French PM warns of far-right majority</strong>: French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has appealed to voters to block the National Rally (RN) party of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella from winning the general election, as the far-right party is in a position to win a majority.</li>
<li><strong>RN leads the first round</strong>: The National Rally party led the first round of the election last Sunday with over 33% of the vote and has already won dozens of seats outright.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of winning majority</strong>: If the RN secures more than half the 577 seats in the National Assembly, it will be able to form a government, a scenario that Attal is warning against.</li>
<li><strong>Three-way run-offs</strong>: The second round of the election will feature more than 300 three-way run-offs due to so many third-placed candidates qualifying on Sunday, making the outcome harder to predict.</li>
<li><strong>Attal's responsibility</strong>: The French PM believes it is his responsibility to urge voters to block the RN from winning a majority, even though many voters may not want to use their vote to block the party.</li>
