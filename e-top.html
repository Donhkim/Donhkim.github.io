    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Israel launched a massive strike</strong> in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday, killing at least 90 people, including children, according to local health officials. The target was believed to be Hamas' shadowy military commander, Mohammed Deif.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Israel claims Deif was killed</strong>, but Hamas has denied this, calling it a "cover-up" for the scale of the "horrific massacre". Official Yahya Sinwar is also believed to have been in the area, but Israel has not confirmed his death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deif was a key figure in Hamas</strong> and is believed to have been involved in planning the October 7 attack on Israeli soil that killed over 1,200 people, sparking the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The strike comes at a delicate time in cease-fire efforts</strong>, with Deif's death potentially giving Israel a major victory and Hamas a psychological blow. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel will not end the war until Hamas' military capabilities are destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deif's killing could also harden Hamas' positions in talks</strong>, as he has been in hiding for over two decades and is believed to be paralyzed. His death could encourage Hamas to become more intransigent in negotiations with Israel.</p>

Not seen in public for years, Deif has long topped Israel’s most-wanted list and is believed to have escaped multiple Israeli assassination attempts. On Oct. 7, Hamas issued a rare voice recording of Deif announcing the “Al Aqsa Flood” operation.</p>
    

<p>The strike came at a delicate time in cease-fire efforts. Deif’s death would hand Israel a major victory and Hamas a painful psychological blow. It also could give Netanyahu a possible opening. Again on Saturday, the prime minister said Israel will not end the war until Hamas’ military capabilities are destroyed. Deif’s death would be a significant step in that direction.</p>



<p>All Hamas leaders are marked for death and “we will reach them all,” Netanyahu said. He added that no hostages had been nearby when the strike occurred.</p>
    
<p>Deif’s killing could also encourage Hamas to harden its positions in talks. He has been in hiding for more than two decades and is believed to be paralyzed. One of the only known images of him is a 30-year-old ID photo released by Israel. Even in Gaza, only a handful of people would recognize him.</p>
    

<p>Saturday’s attack was one of the war’s deadliest. The Gaza Health Ministry reported 90 dead and at least 300 others injured. Associated Press journalists counted over 40 bodies at overwhelmed Nasser Hospital nearby. Witnesses described an attack that included several strikes.</p><p>“A number of victims are still under the rubble and on the roads, and ambulance and civil defense crews are unable to reach them,” the Health Ministry said.</p><p>The Israeli military asserted that “additional terrorists hid among civilians” and described the location as surrounded by trees and several buildings. An Israeli official said the strike hit a fenced area of Khan Younis that was run by Hamas, saying it was not a tent complex but an operational compound. The official described the strike as precise. The army said the compound belonged to Salama.</p><p>Witnesses said the strike landed in Muwasi, the Israeli-designated safe zone that stretches from northern Rafah to Khan Younis. Palestinians have fled to the coastal strip, sheltering mostly in tents with few basic services or supplies. More than 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes.</p>
    

<p>Footage of the aftermath showed a huge crater, charred tents and burnt-out cars. Victims were carried on the hoods and in the hatchbacks of cars, and on donkey carts and carpets.</p><p>“Children were all martyred here. We collected their pieces with our hands,” said one Palestinian man who did not give his name. He estimated there were seven or eight missiles and asserted that first responders were targeted, too.</p><p>At the hospital, a baby in a pink shirt, her face covered with sand, cried while receiving first aid. A small boy lay motionless at the other end of the bed, one shoe gone. Many wounded were treated on the floor.</p><p>There was “the overwhelming stench of blood,” said Louise Wateridge, a spokesperson with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees who visited the hospital and spoke with several patients. Staff said there were no cleaning products left.</p><p>The blast threw a 2-year-old child into the air and the mother was missing, Wateridge said. Another boy had his feet blown off, while an 8-year-old boy was killed. “They told me to go there to be safe,” his grieving mother told her of the area struck.</p>
    

<p>Neighboring Egypt, a mediator in cease-fire talks, condemned the strike. “These ongoing violations against Palestinian citizens add serious complications to the ability of the efforts currently being made to reach calm and a cease-fire,” its Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It also criticized the “shameful silence and lack of action from the international community.”</p><p>Egyptian, Qatari and U.S. mediators have been pushing to narrow gaps between Israel and Hamas over a proposed deal for a three-phase cease-fire and hostage release plan in Gaza.</p><p>The U.S.-backed proposal calls for an initial cease-fire with a limited hostage release and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza’s populated areas. At the same time, the two sides will negotiate terms of the second phase, which is supposed to bring a full hostage release in return for a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p>
    

<p>Netanyahu said he wasn’t moving from the U.S.-backed proposal but listed four conditions: Israel’s right to continue the war until its goals are achieved, the return of as many hostages as possible in the deal’s first stage, no return of Hamas fighters to northern Gaza and the prevention of arms smuggling, including control of the key Philadelphi corridor between Gaza and Egypt.</p><p>Israel launched its campaign in Gaza after <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-rockets-airstrikes-tel-aviv-11fb98655c256d54ecb5329284fc37d2">Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack</a></span> in which militants stormed into southern Israel and abducted about 250 people.</p><p>Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 38,400 people in Gaza and wounded more than 88,000, according to the territory’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-casualties-toll-65e18f3362674245356c539e4bc0b67a">Health Ministry</a></span>.

            But legal scholars note it’s not only the number of Trump nominees that has had such a dramatic impact on the judiciary. It’s who he has nominated that will resonate for decades.

            “We like people in their 30s so they’re there for 50 years or 40 years,” Trump told the crowd at the National Rifle Association’s annual meeting in Dallas in May.

            Trump’s three Supreme Court picks – Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – while not in their 30s, were all under 55 when he nominated them to the bench. Younger than the average nominee, each could have decades to shape rulings and policy across the country.

            But the key common denominator among all of Trump’s picks was not their age, but their conservative credentials.

            “Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint?” conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Trump at a Republican primary debate in 2016. “Not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?”

            “Yes, I would,” Trump replied, without hesitation.

            Once in the White House, Trump relied heavily on the counsel of advisers and outside groups to fill open seats with the help of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was eager to cement conservative domination over the nation’s courts.
    </p>

            “You know what my top priority is. I’ve made it very clear. It’s the judiciary,” McConnell told reporters halfway through Trump’s term. “We intend to keep confirming as many as we possibly can for as long as we’re in a position to do it.”

            Working with the Republican-controlled Senate, Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/19/politics/trump-supreme-court-legacy/index.html">solidified a 6-3 conservative majority</a> on the Supreme Court. The result has been dramatic – even with Trump no longer in the Oval Office. Roe v. Wade has been overturned. The EPA and other federal agencies have been stripped of regulatory power. Affirmative action in college admissions has ended. And, in a case deeply personal to Trump himself, a court decision earlier this month granted the president <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/01/politics/supreme-court-donald-trump-immunity/index.html">near-total immunity</a> while in office.

            Trump also helped conservatives flip three of the nation’s 13 appeals courts, which play a significant legal role in shaping policy across the country. And one of Trump’s district court picks – Judge <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/trump-filing-aileen-cannon-immunity/index.html">Aileen Cannon</a> – is now responsible for overseeing his classified documents case in Florida.

            Trump allies and detractors alike point to a less understood, but clear, shift in the makeup of Trump’s nominations over the course of his first term: a shift away from nominees backed by the powerful conservative legal establishment during his first two years and toward lawyers who embraced more expansive – and at times legally tenuous – views of executive power.
    </p>

            “Some of Trump’s judicial appointees really push the envelope in an ideological way,” Donald B. Ayer, a former deputy attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, told CNN.  “They do things because that’s the result they want to achieve, and that’s just not how the legal system is supposed to work. It’s not supposed to be primarily driven to achieve a given outcome.”

            It’s a legal philosophy that has been aggressively and financially built up in the years Trump has been out office through a constellation of outside groups populated by former Trump officials and lawyers. Much as former officials have created an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/13/politics/trump-rhetoric/index.html">outside policy infrastructure</a> around Trump’s campaign, there has been a corresponding effort on the legal front.

            The groups have repeatedly sued the Biden administration and pressed for investigations into the administration’s actions. But they’ve also served as an unofficial bulwark in their defense of Trump’s own legal travails.

            “Look, when this election is over, based on what they’ve done, I would have every right to go after them,” Trump said of his political opponents in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity last month.

            “I don’t say that we should be the mafia,” Will Chamberlain, senior counsel at the conservative Article III Project and a former adviser to Florida Gov.

            Some in Trump’s circle have even suggested expanding the fight further – into trying to remove sitting judges, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/john-eastman-arizona-not-guilty-plea/index.html">John Eastman</a>, an architect of Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election who also spoke at the conservative DC gathering.

            Two days after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin">Alec Baldwin’s</a> involuntary manslaughter trial began and nearly three years after the fatal “Rust” movie set shooting that led to the charge against him, a New Mexico judge said eight words that left the actor visibly emotional – and marked the trial’s end.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyjeue9800003b6krcgywmb2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “Your motion to dismiss with prejudice is granted,” Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer told Baldwin and his legal team in court on Friday afternoon, prompting an already shaking Baldwin to remove his glasses and sob into his hand before embracing his wife, Hilaria.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyjeue9800013b6k3stcchrs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The ruling concluded nearly three years of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin">back-and-forth legal arguments</a> and turnover in prosecutors leading up to the trial against Baldwin, who faced up to 18 months in prison and a $5,000 fine related to the October 2021 fatal shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the Western film, “Rust.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyjeue9800023b6kvbk975zh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            At the time of the shooting on October 21, 2021, Baldwin was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/12/entertainment/alec-baldwin-trial-rust/index.html">practicing a “cross draw</a>,” pulling a gun from a holster on the side of his body opposite to his draw hand, with a prop gun at a church on the film’s New Mexico set when it fired a live round, killing Hutchins and injuring “Rust” director Joel Souza.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyjeue9800033b6k20iupcvy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            On Thursday, Baldwin’s defense team filed a motion to dismiss the case stating the prosecutors concealed evidence “potentially pointing to an external source of the live ammunition (prop supplier <a href="https://www.cnn.com/entertainment/live-news/alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-trial-07-11-24#h_9f2a9cc22d890ae788a4ab861304243d">Seth Kenney</a>) because the evidence would be favorable to Baldwin,” court documents show.
    </p>

            On Friday, following a chaotic hearing that involved one special prosecutor taking the stand as a witness and another special prosecutor – Erlinda Johnson – resigning from the prosecution team that day, Marlowe Sommer sided with the defense as a result of the evidence issue first brought to light Thursday and granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice, meaning the case cannot be brought again.
    </p>

            Baldwin thanked his supporters <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9XmVoDJyMO/" target="_blank">via an Instagram post</a> Saturday in his first public comments since the charge against him was dropped.
    </p>

            “There are too many people who have supported me to thank just now,” the actor wrote in a post which included a photo taken of him during the trial earlier this week.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clykhpwij00033b6klc9im1qb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Baldwin added: “To all of you, you will never know how much I appreciate your kindness toward my family.”

            Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey, who on Friday answered questions under oath from defense attorney Alex Spiro, said she was disappointed by the dismissal.
    </p>

            “I believe that the importance of the evidence was misconstrued by the defense attorneys, but I have to respect the court’s decision,” Morrissey said following court Friday.
    </p>

            Here’s what led to the dismissal in the Baldwin case.
    </p>

            Marlowe Sommer, who had been adamant about keeping the trial on schedule, was noticeably perturbed early Friday when she halted testimony in the case and dismissed the jury so she could take up Baldwin’s motion to throw out his criminal charge.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyjgdyrq00003b6ko6am42nz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Ahead of her ruling Friday, the judge referred to a dismissal with prejudice as a “very extreme sanction” that would require her to go through each element of the motion and “make a very good record as to why I’m seeing what I’m seeing,” she said.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyjgdzwe00023b6kj6ahvjy4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Baldwin’s team argued state investigators did not properly share with the defense that a man had delivered a box of ammunition purportedly connected to the case to investigators.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyjgdzwe00033b6k35sl0cdj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            In its motion, the defense claimed the state “unilaterally withheld” evidence that could be favorable to Baldwin’s trial, which is a violation of the Brady rule, named after the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/373/83/" target="_blank">1963 Brady v. Maryland case</a>. The rule requires prosecutors “to disclose <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/brady_rule" target="_blank">material, exculpatory information</a> in the government’s possession to the defense,” according to Cornell Law School.
    </p>

            In order to establish a Brady violation, Marlowe Sommer explained Friday, the defendant has to show “the prosecution suppressed evidence, the evidence was favorable to the accused and the evidence was material to the defense.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clykh64k700003b6kr4yz0fag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The defense claimed Baldwin was unaware of the risk live ammunition had been brought to the “Rust” set.
    </p>

            For the state’s prosecutors to establish a link between Baldwin and the live ammunition source, they would have to show Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer for “Rust” who in March was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/06/entertainment/rust-trial-hannah-gutierrez-reed">found guilty of involuntary manslaughter</a> and sentenced to 18 months in prison, had brought the rounds to set, according the motion filed Thursday.

            “Evidence that the live rounds came from Kenney is therefore favorable to Baldwin, which is why the State buried it,” the document states.

            In court Thursday, crime scene technician Marissa Poppell testified retired police officer Troy Teske had delivered a box of ammunition to the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office in March after Gutierrez-Reed’s conviction, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/12/entertainment/alec-baldwin-trial-rust/index.html">CNN previously reported</a>.
    </p>

            Teske, who was a friend of the armorer’s father, told investigators he thought the ammunition could be associated with the “Rust” incident, according to Poppell.
    </p>

            The items, however, were cataloged separately from Baldwin’s case, excluded from the “Rust” case inventory and not tested to see if they matched the lethal round, according to Poppell’s testimony.
    </p>

            Marlowe Sommer said on Friday the suppression-of-evidence element of proving a Brady element was satisfied. “The Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office and the prosecution failed to disclose the supplemental report to defense and provide defense an opportunity to inspect the rounds collected into evidence that Mr. Teske gave,” the judge said.
    </p>

  

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyjhva99000n3b6k62pl11j3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The second Brady element Marlowe Sommer broke down is whether the evidence suppressed by prosecutors was favorable to Baldwin, “either as impeachment or exculpatory evidence,” she said.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyjhvbgw000p3b6k5bm5aaoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “This prong is satisfied. The suppressed evidence is favorable to the accused,” the judge said. “It is impeachment evidence, has even been offered in this trial as impeachment evidence and is potentially exculpatory to the defense.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyji2bmn00003b6ka86alu3l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Marlowe Sommer added the evidence’s exculpatory value couldn’t be analyzed at such a late point in time due to the nondisclosure. She next examined whether the suppressed evidence was material to the case, which she concluded it was.
    </p>



    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyji2d0t00023b6k5cr99knc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “The late discovery of this evidence during trial has impeded the effective use of evidence in such a way that it has impacted the fundamental fairness of the proceedings,” Marlowe Sommer said, adding Baldwin’s defense wasn’t in a position to test the prosecution’s theory regarding the source of the live rounds that killed Hutchins.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyjih4of000h3b6kfg74e4at@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The judge said the state failed to provide the discovery to Baldwin’s defense team, referring to the prosecutor’s withholding of the information as “intentional and deliberate.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyjih65z000j3b6kny7k9gfk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Marlowe Sommer said: “If this conduct does not rise to the level of bad faith, it certainly comes so near to bad faith as to show signs of scorching.”

            The judge also agreed the late evidence was “highly prejudicial” to Baldwin’s case.

            “The jury has been sworn, jeopardy has attached, and this disclosure during the course of trial is so late that it undermines the defendant’s preparation for trial,” Marlowe Sommer said. “There is no way for the court to right this wrong.”
    </p>

            The judge added just before granting the motion to dismiss the case: “The state’s discovery violation has injected a needless, incurable delay into the jury trial. Dismissal with prejudice is warranted to ensure the integrity of the judicial system and the efficient administration of justice.”
    </p>

            Allred said plans to launch a civil case against Baldwin would proceed.

            “We are going to fight to the end for Halyna Hutchins,” Allred said, adding she hopes the district attorney’s office in Santa Fe decides to appeal Friday’s ruling.

            “But I would point out, this was not our case,” Allred said. “Now it will be our case, the civil case, so we have more control of what happens in this case, and we have more power to work to move it forward.”

<ol>
<li><strong>President Biden criticized Project 2025</strong>, a conservative policy agenda, in a campaign stop in Detroit, calling it a "blueprint for a second Trump term" and claiming it was "run and paid by Trump people, his top policy people."</li>
<li><strong>The plan has been criticized by Trump himself</strong>, who has attempted to distance himself from it, saying he knows nothing about it and hasn't seen it. He also claimed it was being used by the Democratic Party to attack him.</li>
<li><strong>The plan was created by the Heritage Foundation</strong>, a conservative think tank, and includes a detailed proposal for how Trump would govern if he is re-elected.</li>
<li><strong>Biden accused Trump of trying to run from the plan</strong>, saying he is "trying to distance himself from overturning Roe vs. Wade" and that the Democratic Party would not let him do so.</li>
<li><strong>Project 2025 proposes a range of policies</strong>, including changes to the economy, taxes, and healthcare, and is intended to serve as a guide for Trump's second term in office if he is re-elected.</li>

It's a blueprint for a second Trump term that every American should read and understand," Mr. Biden told more than 2,000 people at Renaissance High School.</p>    
  <p>Former President Donald Trump, who is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and his campaign have worked to distance themselves from Project 2025. Trump has gone as far as to call some of the proposals "abysmal."</p><p>"I know nothing about Project 2025. I have not seen it, have no idea who is in charge of it, and, unlike our very well received Republican Platform, had nothing to do with it," he wrote on social media on Thursday. "The Radical Left Democrats are having a field day, however, trying to hook me into whatever policies are stated or said."</p>

<p>"Folks, you've probably noticed there's a lot – a lot of speculation lately. What's Joe Biden going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out?" he told the crowd. "Here's my answer: I am running and we're going to win. And nothing's going to change that."</p><p>A spate of travel to battleground states, interviews with journalists and a rare <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watch-biden-press-conference-defying-calls-to-drop-out/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">solo news conference</a></span> have not tamped down the angst within the party about Biden's candidacy and his prospects against Trump in November.</p><p>During his speech, Biden vowed to "shine a spotlight on Donald Trump" and what the presumptive Republican nominee would do if he returned to the White House.</p><p>"He inherited millions of dollars only to squander it. He's filed for bankruptcy six times," Biden said. "He even went bankrupt running a casino. I didn't think that was even possible. Doesn't the house always win in a casino?"</p><p>The president also criticized the media, claiming it was focusing on his errors and not on Trump's. It prompted his supporters to boo reporters in the room — a staple of Trump rallies — though Biden tried briefly to calm the jeers, saying "no, no, no."</p><p>"I guess they don't remember that Trump called Nikki Haley Nancy Pelosi. Well, no — no more. Donald, no more free passes. Today, we're going to shine a spotlight on Donald Trump," he said.</p><p>After the rally, Ken Jacobs, 71, said Biden's speech should put to rest any talk that he couldn't handle another four years in office.</p>

    </p>
<p>"He should repeat that exact speech at the Democratic convention," Jacobs told The Associated Press. "It shows that he has the stamina for this."</p><p>Anne Baxter, 62, told the Associated Press that Biden is correct in staying in the race and decried the media, celebrities and other Democratic leaders calling on him to step down.</p><p>"I'm glad he's not listening to these knuckleheads, because it's not the base," the retired teacher said. "You heard these people here."</p><p>In 2016, Trump won Michigan by a thin margin attributed in part to reduced turnout in predominantly Black areas like Detroit's Wayne County, where Hillary Clinton received far fewer votes than former President Barack Obama did in previous elections.</p><p>Biden reclaimed much of that support four years ago, when he defeated Trump in Michigan by a 154,000-vote margin, but he has work to do. Detroit, which holds a population that is nearly 78% Black, saw a 12% turnout in the Feb. 27 primary, almost half that of the 23% total turnout in the state.</p><p>Key parts of Biden's coalition in Michigan are also upset with him over Israel's offensive following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Michigan holds the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the nation, contributing to over 100,000 people voting "Uncommitted" in Michigan's Democratic primary in February.</p>

The National Weather Service tracks deaths conveyed by its weather forecast offices, where information is gathered from local officials and news media reports. The information is timely and publicly available, but not complete. </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the official source of cause of death reporting, and is based on death certificate data, so its information is more complete but often delayed by years after the weather event. (But even the CDC’s data is not precise nor exact because the process of filling out death certificates isn’t standardized across the nation.)</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Even so, the CDC reported heat-related deaths averaged nearly 900 per year for the five years between 2016-2021, double the five-year average from 15 years earlier.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Meanwhile, initial media reports of heat deaths often look to local authorities as a source. But local governments have different procedures for disclosing deaths — and they aren't consistent in what is considered a heat-related death.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Among the more than 3,000 counties completing death certificates in the U.S., there’s reason to believe the forms are handled differently in every county, said Ashley Ward, director of the Heat Policy Innovation Hub at Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability. </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Death certificates have multiple slots for adding information, with many potential codes available from a standardized set of codes for reporting primary and contributing causes of death. </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When it’s time to complete the form, if heat exposure or other environmental factors contributed to a stroke or heart attack for example, Ward said information about the patient’s activities in the days leading up to their hospitalization or death might only be found deep in the notes from an emergency room doctor.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/nation/2024/06/17/summer-heat-waves-bring-scorching-temperatures-to-us-in-2024/74127684007/" data-t-l=":l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - Summer heat waves bring scorching temperatures to US in 2024" data-g-r="nav_mo" data-g-tn="pgcss" data-g-mtn="pg74127684007" data-g-moh="hpgm" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" data-c-id="74127684007"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/10/USAT/74346728007-usatsi-23709479.jpg?crop=1198,676,x0,y147&amp;width=660&amp;height=372&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt=""><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="55"><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg__ca"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"></use></svg><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_expand"></use></svg></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="Summer heat waves bring scorching temperatures to US in 2024" aria-label="Record-breaking heat waves are expected to impact areas across the U.S. during the summer of 2024 as rising temperatures pose a mounting threat."></p></a><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Heat triggers other health problems. So what counts as a heat death?</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Most deaths that occur due to extreme heat are likely exacerbations of pre-existing medical conditions, said Sameed Khatana, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and a cardiologist at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center. “Can you say confidently that this particular heart attack happened because of this heat wave and it wouldn't have happened if that heat wave didn't occur? That's a big challenge.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When heat is a direct cause of death the question is simpler, said Khatana. “When it’s a contributing factor, that’s where the challenge lies.” </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">There’s also no way to definitively know if heat killed someone unless the signs are very clear.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Autopsies often don’t show heat exposure,” Venkat said. “It’s hard to read heat off the body. Were they working in a hot warehouse, were they exposed to a long period of high temperature? An autopsy won’t necessarily show that.”</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/11/USAT/74374085007-usatsi-23687757.jpg?width=660&amp;height=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/11/USAT/74374085007-usatsi-23687757.jpg?width=1320&amp;height=880&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Maggy Johnston, an outreach coordinator with Mid-Willamette Valley Community Action Agency, wraps a cold towel around Michael Pesterfluid during the heat wave in Salem, Oregon, on July 5, 2024."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Maggy Johnston, an outreach coordinator with Mid-Willamette Valley Community Action Agency, wraps a cold towel around Michael Pesterfluid during the heat wave in Salem, Oregon, on July 5, 2024." data-c-credit="Kevin Neri / Statesman Journal / USA TODAY NETWORK"></p></figure><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Heat has been historic</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">This heat wave has been historic and record-setting: More than 50 cities in California and Nevada <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-forecasts/western-us-heat-wave-to-roll-eastward/1668167" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">broke all-time heat records</a> in the first five days of July, according to AccuWeather.

Palm Springs, California, also ballooned to its all-time record of 124 degrees last week.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The National Weather Service warns that more temperature records are possible in the West this weekend and also that the heat is headed across the country. "This long-duration heat wave remains extremely dangerous and deadly if not taken seriously," the Weather Service said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Dozens of daily record-high temperatures are forecast over much of the West through Saturday. Hazardous heat will expand in coverage over portions of the central and eastern U.S. late this weekend."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Next week looks brutal too: "Confidence is increasing in extremely dangerous heat, particularly for urban areas in the Southeast and East Coast beginning Monday."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The heat wave will also bring danger at night.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Higher nighttime temperatures are especially dangerous for those without access to air conditioning, which is especially a problem if there are power outages during heat waves.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“The stresses on your organs to keep you alive when it’s really hot are intense. When temperatures drop at night, your body has a chance to recover,” Venkat said. “When you don’t get that, it’s pretty serious. There’s a certain threshold beyond which your body just can’t do it anymore.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“If you’re not able to get sleep, and let your heart and lungs and kidneys and liver take a break, it’s more likely one of these systems will fail the next day,” said Venkat. “It’s like any sort of mechanical system, if you run it long enough it will break down.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><em>Contributing: Chris Cann, USA TODAY</em></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"></p></div></div>

  <p>She said there was "a lot of information that has been shared that warrants a further investigation," and she needed to vote her "conscience" and wanted to restore public trust after hearing many hours of public testimony about the election — some of which came from well-known election conspiracy theorists in the Washoe community. </p><p>However, in a statement to CBS News, Andriola said she's asked to revisit her vote on the certification at a Board of Commissioners meeting on July 16, before the vote becomes final under commission rules. She offered no comment on the motivation for her initial refusal to certify the results of her own election. </p>

<p>Washoe County is a crucial battleground county in Nevada, which polling suggests could emerge as a battleground state in the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/election-2024/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">2024 presidential contest</a></span>. It has also been a hotbed of election denialism — a movement bankrolled by a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/officials-overseeing-elections-swing-states-doubt-2020-results/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">charismatic local Trump supporter</a></span>.</p><p>The vote this week represented the latest sign that local officials could be persuaded by election deniers to delay or withhold certification of election results, even when election officials find that the election was free of fraud or malfeasance. </p><p>"The refusal to canvass accurate election results, required by law, has the potential to set a dangerous precedent for elections in Nevada," said Nevada Secretary of State <a href="https://x.com/CiscoAguilar/status/1811219371249058105" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Francisco Aguilar</a> in a statement on X. "It is unacceptable that any public officer would undermine confidence in our democracy."</p><p>The Nevada secretary of state's office and state Attorney General Aaron Ford filed a petition with the Nevada Supreme Court Wednesday asking the court to confirm the commissioners' legal obligation to certify election results, a spokesperson from the secretary of state's office said.  </p>

    </p>
<p>Certification of the vote is an administrative process whereby local officials are legally obligated to confirm the results of the election. There are very few instances where officials are under an obligation not to certify — typically, only when there is a successful court challenge to a vote, which is not the case in the Washoe contest. Certification doesn't inherently mean there were no errors in the process, and in some states, it's required before lawsuits can be filed to contest the results. </p><p>But this kind of episode — which saw local officials blocking the mundane administrative task of certifying the result — is emerging as a strategy among election deniers in pivotal presidential states around the country. Elections experts are concerned that each effort to block certification of the vote at a local level could foreshadow trouble for November's presidential election, where there are strict deadlines for states to certify.</p><p>"Efforts to delay or derail certification could result in chaos and potentially political violence," said David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research. </p><p>"Such efforts to derail democracy are exactly what our adversaries who oppose democracy desire. And it appears those that oppose American democracy are preparing to use this tactic in November, if their preferred candidate loses," Becker added.</p><p>Washoe officials are not alone in refusing to certify races. Recently, local officials in battleground states like Michigan and Georgia have chosen not to certify elections, citing concerns with the integrity of the elections process and often facing vocal outpourings of suspicion about voting during public comment. </p><p>In May, canvassers in Delta County, Michigan, <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michigan-county-refuses-to-certify-vote-growing-election-threat/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">refused to certify a recall election</a></span> after a pressure campaign by local election conspiracy activists. The officials eventually certified the race after Michigan's State Board Of Elections sent the board a letter stating the canvassers would face legal consequences for not following their mandate to certify. </p><p>Also in May, a Republican member of the Fulton County Elections Board in Georgia, Julie Adams, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/republican-member-of-fulton-elections-board-wont-certify-primary-results/IDYT7CZVMZAJXHDAADS7G6JNT4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">refused to certify the presidential primary election</a>, citing a desire to review elections data related to voter rolls. She said that lack of access to the election data from the primary meant she was "unable to fulfill her oath of office," according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p>

    </p>
<p>Adams, who was appointed to the board in February, is a regional coordinator for the Election Integrity Network, a powerful national network of right-wing election conspiracy activists led by former Trump legal adviser Cleta Mitchell, who worked on a number of failed lawsuits to overturn the 2020 presidential election and was on the post-election phone during which Trump asked Raffensperger to "find" him the votes necessary for him to win. <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eligible-voters-swept-up-conservative-activists-purge-voter-rolls/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">EIN-affiliated groups</a></span> seek to undermine voting and ballot counting with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/30/us/politics/republican-poll-monitors-election-activists.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">aggressive election monitoring</a> and a nationwide purge of the voter rolls likely to affect mostly minority and young voters who tend to vote for Democrats. </p><p>Back in Washoe, the decision not to certify came as a surprise to Democratic Commissioner and Chair Alexis Hill. </p><p>"I am kind of shocked and sad," said Hill shortly after the vote. "It's not good for our republic, for our democracy."</p><p>"The results of the recount show how incredibly effective our registrar's office is, with all the pressure they are under," she said.</p>

John Cena walked the red carpet in an embroidered sky blue sherwani and white pants, while Jonas sparkled in a baby pink version — made from a bouclé-style woven fabric embedded with sequins — and matching satin trousers. Jonas arrived with his wife and actor, Priyanka Chopra, who opted for an intricately embellished sunshine yellow sari.

The bride dazzled in hand-embroidered bridal couture by the Indian label Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. Merchant followed the Gujarati tradition of wearing red and white in an opulent red-trimmed ivory ensemble. It featured a 16-foot-long veil adorned with stones and sequins and a long ghagra, or traditional skirt, with a nearly seven-foot-long detachable train, according to her stylist Rhea Kapoor, who <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9VH0xOIDZp/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" target="_blank">shared</a> a first look on Instagram.

            In the days leading up to Friday’s ceremony, the couple took part in several traditional pre-wedding rituals.
