The reported airstrike came hours after Hamas claimed that it fired a barrage of rockets from Gaza toward central Israel as rocket sirens rang for the first time in months in cities like Tel Aviv. </p><p>Gaza's Ministry of Health said in a statement that 35 people had been killed and dozens injured, mostly women and children. In light of the attack, the statement said, "the Ministry of Health confirms that never before in history has such a large number of mass killing tools been amassed and employed together in front of the world as is happening now in Gaza," noting the severe shortages of water, food, medicine, electricity and fuel. </p><p>Eyewitnesses told CBS News' team in Gaza that eight airstrikes hit tents in western Rafah<strong>, </strong>though the reports could not be independently confirmed. The eyewitnesses said the casualties, which included civilians, were rushed to Emirati Hospital. The tents were part of a camp about 200 meters (about 650 feet) away from the largest United Nations warehouse in the Gaza Strip. </p>    
  <p>The Israel Defense Forces acknowledged the strike in a statement Sunday night. </p><p>"A short while ago, an IDF aircraft struck a Hamas compound in Rafah in which significant Hamas terrorists were operating," the IDF said. "The strike was carried out against legitimate targets under international law, using through the use of precise munitions and on the basis of precise intelligence that indicated Hamas' use of the area. The IDF is aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review."</p>

            When prosecutors make their final pitch Tuesday to New York jurors for why they should convict former President Donald Trump of a slew of business crimes, they’ll face the burdensome task of weaving together weeks of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/hush-money-trial-evidence-trump-charges-dg/index.html">testimony and evidence</a> they say proves Trump committed felonies to help his 2016 presidential campaign.

            The closing arguments in Trump’s historic hush money criminal case will give prosecutors from District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office an opportunity to explain to the 12 jurors how each witness they called and piece of evidence they presented bolsters their case for a guilty verdict on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmglp8r00073b6kabeujw3i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            That was already going to be a complicated task for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/politics/hush-money-trial-process-trump-dg/index.html">a trial that’s been underway since mid-April</a> and frequently featured witnesses going over the dry details of business recordkeeping and other mundane testimony. But prosecutors will have an extra degree of difficulty with a long break ahead of closing arguments, as jurors will have been away from the case since Tuesday.
    </p>

  


    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmglp8r00083b6kc9r4gt1n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “There’s plenty of moments during trial where you’re getting a piece of testimony or you’re introducing a document or other exhibit, and the jury is thinking, ‘Well, how does this fit in?’ That’s unavoidable. It’s your job at closing to weave it all together, and to make it make sense. And so that will be especially the case here because this is a long trial,” said CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmglp8r00093b6kmo5g627x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “This, more than even your typical case, is going to be a closing case,” he added.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmglp8r000a3b6kiskoddcn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Former New York prosecutor Bernarda Villalona said prosecutors will use their closing arguments “to tell the story from the very beginning.” She said that unlike their opening statement, which lasted about 40 minutes, prosecutors’ final remarks in the case could go on for several hours and feature a visual aid like a PowerPoint presentation to help walk the jury back through some of the key evidence.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmglp8r000b3b6kof980onk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “The boring is over. The boring part was having them sit down to hear it,” added Villalona, referring to the 12 jurors. “Interestingly enough, the boring part is actually the most important part of the case because the boring part is what gives you the documents. The star witness in this case are the documents, and the documents speak for themselves.”
    </p>

            Trump’s attorneys will present their closing arguments first on Tuesday, followed by the arguments from prosecutors. Once both sides finish their arguments, Judge Juan Merchan will instruct the jury as to the charges it must consider against the former president; then, the jurors will begin their deliberations. The judge has said he expects this to happen on Wednesday.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmglp8r000d3b6k3gpetvtf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The closing arguments will begin exactly a week after the defense rested its case on Tuesday and more than five weeks after opening statements were delivered and the first witness, former tabloid executive David Pecker, took the stand.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmglp8r000e3b6kaesag7vn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The prosecution called 20 witnesses over 19 days in court, with their testimony totaling over 50 hours. Many of their witnesses were not household names, though some, including former Trump attorney Michael Cohen and adult film actress Stormy Daniels — whose alleged affair with Trump is at the center of the case — were high-profile figures whose testimony is no doubt seared into jurors’ minds. (Trump has denied the alleged affair.)
    </p>

  


    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmglp8r000f3b6kkk49jhk5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            For its part, Trump’s team called just two witnesses: a paralegal who entered phone records into evidence and Robert Costello, an attorney who was in talks with Cohen to represent him in 2018.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmglp8r000g3b6k5i3nofep@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree to cover up the reimbursement of hush money payments made before the 2016 election to Daniels. If convicted, Merchan could sentence Trump to probation or a sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison, with a maximum of 20 years.
    </p>

  

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgng3o000o3b6kzrd6ljtp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Prosecutors will likely contend during their closing arguments that each of their witnesses plays a key role in the case, despite their professional rank or proximity to the alleged crimes. They will probably also have to push back against claims by the defense that Cohen, prosecutors’ star witness, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-best-day-analysis/index.html">undermines their case</a> because of his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/takeaways-day-17-trump-hush-money-trial-michael-cohen/index.html">history of dishonesty</a>, Honig said.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000q3b6kuuz6xynz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “The prosecution’s argument will be that all the evidence interlocks and is corroborated and that you don’t have to rely on any one witness’s word on its own. They will say this is a documents case,” he explained, going on to describe the various accounting documents presented during the trial.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000r3b6k7x9sp8mr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “And they’ll say, ‘Michael Cohen’s here to guide you through it, but you don’t need to believe him — everything he says is backed up’” by evidence and other testimony, Honig said.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000s3b6kb7dpsvby@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            During the trial, prosecutors walked jurors repeatedly through the 11 invoices, 12 vouchers and 11 checks — the 34 documents that make up the falsified business records charges — that were used to pay Cohen $420,000 in 2017, money that included the reimbursement for the $130,000 hush money payment “grossed up” to account for taxes.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000t3b6k2bbheaiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Prosecutors showed jurors how Cohen sent the Trump Organization monthly invoices for $35,000, which were processed by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/06/politics/takeaways-from-day-12-of-the-donald-trump-hush-money-trial/index.html">the Trump company’s controller</a> so checks could be cut. Trump signed nine of the 11 checks. (The other two checks were paid from Trump’s revocable trust and signed by former Trump Org. Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and one of Trump’s sons.)
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000u3b6kgytgsiq0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who served for a time as a top prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, said she expects the prosecution to present several themes in their closing arguments, including that most of the people who testified for their case were “Trump witnesses … who you would expect to be friendly to him.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000v3b6k3c2cec4t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The other theme, she said, could be: “Look at the kind of people Trump values,” with prosecutors arguing the former president chose to surround himself with people such as Cohen and Pecker, who were doing Trump’s bidding ahead of the 2016 election.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000w3b6kut1m0e82@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “These are his people, he chose them. And he shouldn’t now get the benefit of, ‘Because they’re flawed you can’t rely on them,’” prosecutors might argue, Agnifilo said.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000x3b6ke2ct16iz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “And even if you do not rely on them,” she said, echoing Honig, “the third theme is going to be, ‘You don’t have to, because everything is corroborated either by other witnesses or documents or records or Trump’s own words.’”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000y3b6k4l97uo8x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The length of the trial may not ultimately prove to be much of a challenge for jurors during their deliberations, Villalona said, since they were allowed to jot down notes during the proceedings and will be able to request some parts of the trial be read back to them.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn000z3b6kmzg54249@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “The good thing about New York is that they could request to have the whole trial read back to them and the judge will do that,” she said. “So if they forgot something David Pecker said on Day 1 or 2 of the trial, they can have that read back.” She added that any of the exhibits put into evidence could also be sent to the jurors for them to take a closer look as they mull a verdict.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn00103b6knsh0cqd7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Still, the closing arguments from each side will be carefully crafted to win not only a verdict in their favor, but also to mark each attorneys’ place in the historic trial, Villalona mused.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwmgnhqn00113b6kdmhgg3y3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “The prosecution and the defense is going to give the closing argument of their career,” she said.

<li><strong>Mandatory national service</strong>: The Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, has announced plans to introduce mandatory national service for 18-year-olds if they win the national election on July 4.</li>
<li><strong>Options for national service</strong>: Young adults will have the choice between spending one weekend a month volunteering over a year or serving in the armed forces for one year.</li>

            Twelve people were injured after a Qatar Airways flight from Doha to Dublin was hit with turbulence on Sunday.

            According to a statement from Dublin Airport, six passengers and six crew members were injured in the incident, eight of which were taken to hospital following assessment. The Qatar Airways flight QR017 experienced turbulence while flying over Turkey, the statement said.

            About 65,000 aircraft suffer moderate turbulence every year in the US, and about 5,500 run into severe turbulence. These numbers, however, might be destined to grow.

            The findings, which were later confirmed by observations, highlight a type of turbulence called “clear air turbulence,” which isn’t connected to any visual clues such as storms or clouds. Unlike regular turbulence, it hits suddenly and is hard to avoid.

            Singapore Airlines has previously said its flight encountered sudden turbulence. A spokesperson said Sunday that its investigations are ongoing. An earlier CNN analysis of satellite data found the flight entered an area where thunderstorms were developing, which can produce turbulence.

<li><strong>Increased inventory</strong>: The market has seen a 16% increase in inventory, giving buyers more options and negotiating power.</li>
<li><strong>Price drops</strong>: The South, particularly Florida, is experiencing a surge in price cuts, with the median existing home price dropping by 12% in the past year.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth effect</strong>: High-end buyers, boosted by recent stock market gains, are less concerned about high mortgage rates and are more likely to make a purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Advice for sellers</strong>: According to Robert Reffkin, CEO of Compass, sellers need to price their homes competitively to attract buyers, as price drops may lead to a longer sales cycle and reduced sales price.</li>

    <div><p>The U.S. housing market is now tilting in favor of buyers, who are pushing back against the high home prices that sellers are demanding, according to <a href="https://fortune.com/company/compass/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/compass/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Compass</a> cofounder and CEO Robert Reffkin.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>He told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/22/compass-ceo-robert-reffkin-on-housing-market-we-are-now-seeing-more-sellers-than-buyers.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/22/compass-ceo-robert-reffkin-on-housing-market-we-are-now-seeing-more-sellers-than-buyers.html" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/22/compass-ceo-robert-reffkin-on-housing-market-we-are-now-seeing-more-sellers-than-buyers.html" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">CNBC on Wednesday</a> that 30% of the inventory on the market has seen a price drop, which is more than anytime in last 10 years. Meanwhile, the market has seen 16% more inventory.</p>



<p>“It is a different environment. We are now seeing more sellers than buyers,” he said.</p>



<p>Reffkin said there have been more price cuts in the South, which had seen steep increases earlier as Americans left more expensive states during the pandemic.</p>



<p>Florida’s housing market has also been hit by a spike in home insurances costs, which have soared 40% year over year and are weighing on asking prices, he explained.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>“Sellers bringing their homes on the market during this period need to be aware of how buyers are pushing back,” Reffkin said. “If your home is well priced in this environment, it will sell quickly. But if it’s not, it will sit on the market. Then you’re going to have to have a price drop. Then buyers will see they get a price drop. The sharks come out, and it will hurt you even more.”</p>



<p>Buyers at the high end of the housing market have also been bolstered by recent stock market gains, he told CNBC.</p><p data-cy="instreamAd"></p>



<p>While the surge in mortgage rates earlier this year combined with high home prices to further erode affordability, that’s less of a concern for buyers enjoying the wealth effect from their investments.</p>



<p>“You don’t need lower mortgage rates if your stock portfolio is at an all-time high,” Reffkin said.</p>



<p>His comments follow a report released earlier this month that showed <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/16/housing-market-outlook-texas-and-florida-are-now-buyers-markets-heres-why-it-could-be-time-to-move-to-the-south/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/16/housing-market-outlook-texas-and-florida-are-now-buyers-markets-heres-why-it-could-be-time-to-move-to-the-south/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/16/housing-market-outlook-texas-and-florida-are-now-buyers-markets-heres-why-it-could-be-time-to-move-to-the-south/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Texas and Florida</a> dominated the best places for buyers in <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/market-heat-index-april-2024-34052/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.zillow.com/research/market-heat-index-april-2024-34052/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Zillow’s new market heat index</a>, which takes into account the share of homes that have an accepted offer from a buyer within 21 days or fewer, the share of homes that have a price cut, and engagement with active listings on the website and app</p>



<p>“Would-be buyers who witnessed intense competition in sunny Texas and Florida markets earlier on in the pandemic aren’t seeing such a frenzy now,” according to <a href="https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Zillow</a>.</p>



<p>Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman has also sounded optimistic about the housing market in the latter half of 2024 after hitting “<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/23/housing-market-outlook-2024-top-real-estate-ceo-rock-bottom-improvement-high-home-prices-mortgage-rates-redfin/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/23/housing-market-outlook-2024-top-real-estate-ceo-rock-bottom-improvement-high-home-prices-mortgage-rates-redfin/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/05/23/housing-market-outlook-2024-top-real-estate-ceo-rock-bottom-improvement-high-home-prices-mortgage-rates-redfin/" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">rock bottom</a>” in the first quarter.</p>



<p>But that outlook depends on rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, he cautioned, warning that sales could slow or even decline without any.</p>



<p>For now, he’s not ready to “have a party here and drink a bunch of champagne,” Kelman said. “It’s just a little bit better, it’s a little bit better—and that’s worth noting.”</p></div><div class="sc-83cd12c6-0 gjLFAy article" data-cy="subscriptionPlea"><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. </p><a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" class="sc-65eb153f-0 gxOXYL">Sign up</a><p> for free.</p></div></div>

If you're unhappy the first time you use it, the discount wasn't really worthwhile. </li><li>Remaining sale time is a huge part of our vetting process. If a deal seems like it will only be around for a short while or will only be available for the remaining stock, we'll let you know upfront so you don't come back to the deal later only to be disappointed. </li></ul></div></div>
