<p>Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducted around 250 others in the Oct. 7 attack. Around half of those hostages have since been freed, most in swaps for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire in November. </p>

DePape gave no reaction as the judge read his sentence. A victim impact statement was read in court by Christine Pelosi, the couple's daughter. </p><p>"Today's sentence reflects David DaPape's lack of remorse and contrition for violently assaulting Mr. Pelosi," U.S. Attorney Ismail Ramsey said in a statement. "The court's sentence will ensure that DePape will not be able to use violence to pollute the political process." </p><p>Rep. Pelosi is in Washington, D.C. and did not attend the sentencing.

<ol>
<li><strong>Presidential debates between Biden and Trump are being organized by CNN and ABC News</strong>, which is unusual since the Commission on Presidential Debates typically organizes the events. The Commission has been criticized for excluding candidates who don't meet certain polling thresholds.</li>
<li><strong>The debates are expected to be among the least-watched general election contests ever</strong>, due to the lack of interest from the Commission and the fact that the rival campaigns skirted the Commission's rules to organize the debates directly with CNN and ABC News.</li>
<li><strong>The debates will be made available for simulcast on other networks</strong>, with CNN allowing free streaming on CNN.com and ABC allowing simulcasting on other networks and streaming services.</li>
<li><strong>A debate between Kamala Harris and Trump's running mate is expected to air on CBS</strong> this summer, separate from the Biden-Trump debates.</li>
<li><strong>Past debates have been well-watched</strong>, with over 73 million viewers for the first debate between Biden and Trump in 2020, but it's unclear if these debates will similarly draw a large audience due to the unconventional arrangement.</li>

Fox News said it was seeking a second undercard debate but the Biden campaign signaled it would reject that</p>
    

<p>Each of the two debates between Biden and Trump in 2020 were carried on at least 16 networks, according to the Nielsen company. The first was seen by 73.1 million viewers, the second by 63 million.</p>



<p>Debates prior to a party’s nominating process, which Trump skipped this year, are usually organized and broadcast by individual media organizations. The tradition has been different for those organized by the commission during general election campaigns, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, and member of a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/feature/democratizing-the-debates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">group of experts</a></span> Annenberg organized a decade ago that explored ways to increase viewership.</p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know about the 2024 Election Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020.

<p>“It’s the public’s debate,” Jamieson said.</p>
    
<p>It’s not certain how many other networks will carry the debates even with the opportunity. Only PBS has said that it would; other networks have yet to give a public commitment.</p>
    

<p>For CNN leaders, there was a great temptation to keep it for themselves. It would have likely been the most-watched event ever on a network that is struggling in ratings. CNN’s chief executive, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cnn-chairman-thompson-bbc-times-4e7844028f5ccb7170212fb67e86ddb4">Mark Thompson</a></span>, made a point in tying the debate to the brand on Wednesday when he announced the agreement to hold it during a sales presentation to advertisers in New York.</p><p>“When people have something important to say,” Thompson said, “they say it on CNN.”</p><p>CNN said Wednesday the debate would also air live on its international and Spanish-speaking networks, and stream on CNN Max and CNN.com.</p><p>The pool of people available to watch on CNN’s main television network is dwindling due to cord-cutting of cable and satellite services. CNN was available in 71% of American homes with television in May 2020; this month it’s just under 54%, Nielsen said.</p><p>Keeping the debate on CNN alone would have run up against stout criticism that it’s not the public-spirited thing to do, something ABC moved quickly to avoid.</p><p>Political polarization that has spread to the media would also likely cut into viewership if the event was not shared, Jamieson said. Would Fox News viewers, after years of hearing CNN criticized by some of their favorite politicians and media figures, turn to CNN for a debate or skip it entirely?</p>
    

<p>Some of those executives would have to swallow hard to carry another network’s personalities on their air, with the risk some of their regular viewers might like them and switch allegiances. Pressure to carry the debates for public service reasons would be intense, though.</p><p>Despite worries about how many people will watch, Jamieson said there’s some irony in that there’s a lot to like about the proposed ground rules for the event. So far, the plans are to hold them in television studios without an audience.</p><p>That’s something the Annenberg group had proposed a decade ago, saying an audience that reacts to what the candidates are saying is often a distraction, and that audience is usually packed with partisans on both sides.</p><p>If the two campaigns agree to rules where one candidate’s microphone would be shut off while his opponent answers a question, it would go a long way to solving what has been a more frequent problem recently with politicians interrupting and talking over an opponent, she said.</p><p>“If someone had told me that there was going to be some good news about political discourse this year, I would have told them they were delusional,” she said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>David Bauder writes about media for The Associated Press.

<li>Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito Jr. blamed his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, for an upside-down American flag flying at their home, a symbol of the "Stop the Steal" movement.</li>
<li>The flag was flown after President Biden's 2021 inauguration, and Justice Alito told The New York Times that his wife was responsible for the flag's placement.</li>
<li>At the time, the family was involved in a feud with neighbors over an anti-Trump sign that was displayed, which may have contributed to the decision to fly the upside-down flag.</li>
<li>Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ) also pointed to his wife for his own troubles, although the article does not specify what his wife's role was in his alleged misconduct.</li>
<li>The article notes that blaming one's spouse for trouble is a common political strategy, and both Justice Alito and Senator Menendez have employed this tactic to deflect criticism.</li>

            The chief medical examiner’s office on Thursday confirmed to CNN that Wolobah died of cardiopulmonary arrest after eating a food substance “with (a) high capsaicin concentration.” Capsaicin is the spicy, naturally occurring chemical in chili peppers.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>UAW defeat in Mercedes-Benz factories</strong>: Workers at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama voted against allowing the United Automobile Workers (UAW) to represent them, a huge setback for the union's efforts to organize workers in the South.</li>
<li><strong>Republican opposition</strong>: Alabama Governor Kay Ivey and other Republican leaders claimed that a pro-union vote would harm the state's economy and investment in the auto industry.</li>
<li><strong>Nationally significant vote</strong>: The vote is significant as it tests the UAW's ability to build on recent victories and make gains in a state where officials have been hostile to organized labor.</li>
<li><strong>UAW's larger goals</strong>: The union aims to organize every automobile factory in the US, expanding its membership to include employees of companies like Toyota and Tesla.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Hyundai and Honda</strong>: The UAW's setback may also hinder its efforts to organize workers at Hyundai and Honda factories in Alabama, making it harder for the union to quickly gain ground in the state.</li>
