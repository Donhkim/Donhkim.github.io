The Justice Department, facing a defendant who had already served substantial jail time, was able to resolve — without trial — a case that raised thorny legal issues and that might never have reached a jury at all given the plodding pace of the extradition process. Assange, for his part, signaled a begrudging contentment with the resolution, saying in court that though he believed the Espionage Act contradicted the First Amendment, he accepted the consequences of soliciting classified information from sources for publication.</p>
    
<p>Assange arrived at court in a dark suit, with a tie loosened around the collar, after flying from Britain on a charter plane accompanied by members of his legal team and Australian officials, including the top Australian diplomat in the U.K.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth="">

<p>Inside the courthouse, he answered basic questions from U.S. District Judge Ramona Manglona, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, and appeared to listen intently. As a condition of his plea, he will be required to destroy information provided to WikiLeaks. The secret-spilling website, which Assange founded in 2006, said in its own statement that it was grateful for “all who stood by us, fought for us, and remained utterly committed in the fight for his freedom.”</p><p>Assange appeared upbeat and relaxed during the hearing, listening intently and at times cracking jokes with the judge. While signing his plea agreement, he made a joke about the 9-hour time difference between the U.K. and Saipan. At another point, when the judge asked him whether he was satisfied with the plea conditions, Assange responded: “It might depend on the outcome,” sparking some laughter in the courtroom.</p><p>“So far, so good,” the judge responded.</p><p>The plea deal, disclosed Monday night in a sparsely detailed Justice Department letter, represents the latest — and presumably final — chapter in a court fight involving the eccentric Australian computer expert who has been celebrated by supporters as a transparency crusader but lambasted by national security hawks who insist that his disdain for government secrecy put lives at risks and strayed far beyond the bounds of traditional journalism duties.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

<p>The guilty plea resolves a criminal case brought by the Trump administration Justice Department in connection with the receipt and publication of war logs and diplomatic cables that detailed U.S. military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan. Prosecutors alleged that he conspired with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to obtain the records and published them without regard to American national security, including by releasing the names of human sources who provided information to U.S. forces.</p><p>But his activities drew an outpouring of support from press freedom advocates, who heralded his role in bringing to light military conduct that might otherwise have been concealed from view. Among the files published by WikiLeaks was a video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters journalists.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trump attempted to hide documents from his lawyers</strong>: instead of complying with a May 2022 subpoena, Trump allegedly hid dozens of classified documents from his own lawyers, and federal agents eventually seized 102 classified documents after executing a search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago estate in August 2022.</p>

Trump has denied all charges and denounced the probe as a political witch hunt.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Defense lawyers have repeatedly argued that the notes from Trump's lawyer are protected by attorney-client privilege, but a federal judge in Washington D.C. last year determined that notes could be used as evidence after prosecutors demonstrated that Trump <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/sources-special-counsel-claims-trump-deliberately-misled-attorneys/story?id=98024191" target="_blank">deliberately misled his attorneys</a> in furtherance of a crime, piercing attorney-client privileges invoked by two of his lawyers.</p><h3 class="vPZug oPAle xcLAU bunQU uhXXI PjNjV lNbol LBPRq">'I don't want anybody looking through my boxes'</h3><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Corcoran made multiple audio recordings to memorialize his interactions with the former president, including meeting with Trump on May 23, 2022 to discuss his response to a subpoena for any classified documents stored at Mar-a-Lago.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">During an approximately one-and-a-half-hour meeting with both Trump and attorney Jennifer Little, Trump brought a box to their first meeting to demonstrate its contents, showing the attorneys his newspaper clippings, Post-it notes, and photos, and other materials.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"I don't want anybody looking, I don't want anybody looking through my boxes, I really don't, I don't want you looking through my boxes," Trump said, according to a portion of the notes included in the indictment against Trump. "Look I just don't want anybody going through these things."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Corcoran wrote that he attempted to focus on Trump's response to the subpoena, though the former president frequently returned to the topic that he was being targeted by political opponents.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"He repeated many times that he felt he was really being targeted," Corcoran noted.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"Look, you know, I have ten different actions against me. They are trying to get me. They're going after me. These people are ruthless," Trump remarked while boasting about his own administration. "I've done all these great things for the country. I improved the economy, I lowered taxes, I did this, I did that, built the wall."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Corcoran recalled that he tried to steer the conversation back to the boxes and warned the former president about the legal consequences of not complying with the subpoena.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"Well what if we, what happens if we just don't respond at all or don't play ball with them?" Trump asked, according to a portion of the notes included in the indictment.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"Well, there's a prospect that they could go to a judge and get a search warrant and that they could arrive here and get a search warrant," Corcoran responded.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">According to Corcoran, Trump repeatedly asked during their meeting if it would be "better if we just told them we don't have anything here."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">During an interview with Smith's team, Little largely corroborated Corcoran's recollection of the meeting, telling investigators that she "very clearly" warned Trump about the seriousness of the subpoena and told him "it's going to be a crime" if he failed to comply but swore otherwise.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">After speaking about the subpoena for more than an hour, Trump concluded the meeting to attend a series of interviews before reconvening with the attorneys in the afternoon. According to Corcoran, Trump suggested that the attorneys -- who he noted were both single -- "take a walk along the beach" and that "maybe ... sparks will fly."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">But while waiting poolside at Mar-a-Lago for their next meeting with Trump, Corcoran said Little warned -- based on her conversation with two other Trump attorneys -- that if they pushed Trump to comply with the subpoena, "he's just going to go ballistic," Corcoran noted.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Little added that "there's no way he's going to agree to anything and that, that he was going to deny that there were any more boxes at all," according to Corcoran's notes.</p><h3 class="vPZug oPAle xcLAU bunQU uhXXI PjNjV lNbol LBPRq">'Isn't it better if there are no documents?'</h3><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Later in the afternoon on May 23, 2022, Corcoran and Little met with Trump in a small library at Mar-a-Lago, ditching their phones outside the room at the direction of the former president, according to Corcoran.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Sitting feet from Trump across a small table, Corcoran said Trump asked about the legal consequences for complying with the subpoena while cautioning that prosecutors "really wanted to get him anyway they could."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Trump blamed the investigation on his "political enemies" who wanted to "weaken him and get him not to run" for president." Trump said he was "just trying to understand what the best way" was to respond to the investigations and claimed that prosecutors would "keep opening up new fronts against him."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">According to Corcoran's notes, Trump expressed concerns that returning "additional documents" following the subpoena could become the "basis for criminal liability.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"He asked again, he said -- Well look, isn't it better if there are no documents?" Corcoran noted.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Corcoran added that during their meeting, Trump repeatedly recounted that a lawyer for Hillary Clinton "deleted all of her emails" so "she didn't get into any trouble."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"He was great, he did a great job," Trump told the lawyers, according to the notes.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Prosecutors allege that during the meetings with his attorneys, Trump attempted to test Corcoran's receptiveness to evading the subpoena, though the meeting concluded with the two setting a plan for Corcoran to return to Mar-a-Lago to search through the boxes for documents responsive to the subpoena.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"Look, so you're -- so if I'm hearing you right, what you want is to come back and have me or somebody go through and find some, get any classified documents if there are any. That, that, sounds like that's the plan you want, is it?" Trump said, repeating the plan multiple times, according to the notes.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"We will figure this out. Go through the documents, if we've got any classified stuff, get it to DOJ," Trump said, according to the notes.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Prosecutors allege that Corcoran's rebuff to Trump's suggestions resulted in the former president adopting a different plan -- deceiving his attorney by having his "trusted body man" and co-defendant Walt Nauta move the boxes from the storage room in Mar-a-Lago to prevent Corcoran from conducting a complete search.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In the days between the May 23 meeting with Trump and Corcoran's June 2 review of the boxes at Mar-a-Lago, prosecutors allege that Trump coordinated for Nauta to remove 64 boxes out of the storage room to Trump's personal residence, where Trump planned to "pick from them," according to text messages between Nauta and a Trump family member. By the time Corcoran returned to Mar-a-Lago to review the boxes, only about 30 of the 64 boxes moved by Nauta were returned for the search.</p><h3 class="vPZug oPAle xcLAU bunQU uhXXI PjNjV lNbol LBPRq">'Don't call me with any bad news'</h3><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Corcoran described the process of searching through the boxes in the cramped storage room during a humid June day as a "laborious" and unpleasant task, though Corcoran noted that contents of the boxes -- "thousands" of Post-it notes, magazines, emails with senators and heads of state, books, notebooks, and briefing materials -- offered a unique window into Trump's state of mind as president.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"If Robert Caro or some other presidential biographer had been in my position, they would have been absolutely in heaven," Corcoran said in his notes.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Corcoran also noted that the boxes included an odd variety of contents, including presidential memorabilia, Make America Great Again hats, gifts from foreign leaders, clothing -- including underwear and socks -- and toiletries like mouthwash, toothpaste, and razors. Some of the boxes were sealed with white duct tape and many included a typed note about the destination for the box, such as "W-H to M-A-L."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">According to Corcoran, Trump's description of the boxes' contents suggested they became "catch-all depositories for what he'd gone through day after day" when he reviewed materials in the White House residence.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"I had to read these things at night so that I could be ready, that's the only time I could read something, and I had to read them so I could be ready for calls or meetings the next day," Trump told Corcoran about how briefing memos, notes, and emails ended up in the boxes. "I just had boxes in the, in my bedroom, you know, a lot of boxes and I'd just, you know, read these things and then throw them in there."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">While Trump told Corcoran he instructed others to declassify any of the documents that entered his residence, the former president appeared to acknowledge in his conversation with Corcoran that simply bringing the documents into his residence did not result in declassifying the documents.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"I told people to declassify -- anything that comes into the residence should be declassified. And I told people. I told lawyers that. I don't know what was done, I don't know how they were marked. But that was my position," Trump said, according to Corcoran.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Corcoran's search of the room ultimately resulted in a half-inch stack of classified documents, which he sealed in a redweld envelope using duct tape.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"Did you find anything?" Trump asked Corcoran after he concluded his search. "Is it bad? Good?"</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">According to Corcoran, Trump asked Corcoran about how he planned to store the documents, particularly "anything really bad in there."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"He made a funny motion as though -- well okay why don't you take them with you to your hotel room and if there's anything really bad in there, like, you know, pluck it out. And that was the motion that he made. He didn't say that," Corcoran noted.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The following day, Corcoran coordinated for Jay Bratt, then the deputy chief of the Department of Justice's National Security Division, and FBI agents to visit Mar-a-Lago to take custody of the responsive documents.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Corcoran received a panicked call from Trump about the visit from federal officials on the morning of their visit, according to Corcoran's notes.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"Oh that's very bad. What, you know, what do they want? What are they trying to, why are they trying to get something on me again?" Trump said, according to the notes.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">While Corcoran emphasized that the meeting was a routine step that he coordinated, Trump still expressed concern that "this is very bad" and was particularly interested in Bratt's attendance at the meeting.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"Why is the top guy coming? It's very unusual, very unusual, you know?" Trump remarked, though Corcoran noted that Trump's tone about the meeting appeared to change over the day.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">According to Corcoran, Trump personally encouraged showing Bratt and the FBI agents the storage room where the documents were stored, over the advice of Corcoran. According to prosecutors, despite Corcoran's search resulting in return of 38 documents bearing classification markings, Trump still possessed 102 classified documents in Mar-a-Lago -- in part due to his effort to hide documents from Corcoran when he attempted to comply with the subpoena -- which would be discovered when federal agents returned to Mar-a-Lago two months later with a search warrant.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"I've got nothing to hide. I've got nothing to hide. If they ask. I want you to show them," Trump told Corcoran in June.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Later that day, Trump walked into the meeting where Corcoran handed over the classified documents to federal officials, personally shaking the hands of Bratt and the FBI agents.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"I'm glad you're here. I -- I appreciate what you're doing. If you need anything at all just ask Evan," Trump said, according to Corcoran.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">After Trump left the meeting, Corcoran escorted the federal officials to the storage room where Trump's boxes were stored, allowing them to look at the room but not touch any of the boxes.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Later that day, Corcoran noted that he received a phone call from Trump, who was onboard his plane en route to New Jersey for the summer.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN">"Well we're taking off. But look, Evan, don't call me with any bad news, okay? Don't call me with any bad news," Trump said, according to the notes.</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li><strong>Preparations underway at Camp David</strong>: President Biden is spending his fifth day at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, preparing for the upcoming debate against Donald Trump. The retreat has been transformed into a mock debate stage with lights and production equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Shaking off the rust</strong>: Biden's team is aware of the "rust factor" that can affect incumbent presidents in debates, and is working to help him regain his footing. This includes positioning him as a fighter who can counterpunch on the fly.</li>
<li><strong>Trump's lack of debating experience</strong>: Trump, the opponent, has no experience with primary debates and is known for his extemporaneous insults. This could make it difficult for him to adjust to the debate format.</li>
<li><strong>Strategies being planned</strong>: The Biden team is working to game out Trump's likely attacks and undermine his policies. They are also trying to keep the president focused on landing an argument and striking a character and policy stance.</li>
<li><strong>Aides summoned from Washington and Wilmington</strong>: The team has summoned at least 16 current and former aides from Washington and Wilmington to help with strategy sessions, which are taking place in a mock debate setting, complete with golf carts for transportation.</li>

Camp David has become the epicenter for an administration and campaign effort to help Mr. Biden shake off the rust that often comes with being an incumbent on the defense, and combat widespread voter concerns <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/03/us/politics/biden-age-trump-poll.html" title="">that he is too old</a> to be an effective president.</p><div class="css-1dv1kvn"><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Both candidates are out of practice as debaters. And Mr. Biden’s top advisers, including Ron Klain, who is <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/us/politics/ron-klain-biden-trump-debate.html" title="">managing the debate preparations</a>, are aware of the missteps incumbents have made in the past. In 2012, President Barack Obama flailed in his first re-election debate and <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/us/politics/a-serious-debate-prep-session-for-obama.html" title="">had to quickly reorient</a> for the second one.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">So they will be working to position Mr. Biden not only as a president in the midst of a re-election campaign, but also as a fighter who can counterpunch on the fly. Mr. Trump, an opponent who is adept at extemporaneous insults, skipped the primary debates that could have sharpened his skills.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">“The rust factor is real,” said David Axelrod, a former top strategist to Mr. Obama. “Neither of these guys is accustomed to having someone a few feet away, grilling them with no deference.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">According to people familiar with the planning at Camp David who were not authorized to speak publicly about it, the work days vary in length and are not rigidly structured. Mr. Biden and his <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/22/us/politics/klain-kaufman-biden-campaign-election.html" title="">most trusted advisers</a> work on what they think would be best to refine or practice in the moment.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">They are all trying to game out exactly which attacks Mr. Trump might launch at Mr. Biden, which policies of his Mr. Trump could try to undermine, and how they can best keep the president focused on landing an argument and striking a character and policy contrast with Mr. Trump.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Officials on Mr. Biden’s campaign believe that the debate will provide an opportunity to go on the offensive on issues like immigration and abortion access. In recent days, Mr. Biden has unveiled a program that <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/18/us/politics/biden-legal-protections-undocumented-spouses.html" title="">would create new pathways to citizenship</a> for people married to American citizens, while Mr. Trump has suggested that <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/22/us/politics/trump-migrant-fighters.html" title="">migrants form a league to fight one another.</a> And this week marks two years since Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion, was overturned by the Supreme Court.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Mr. Biden’s advisers say the setting itself will help highlight Mr. Trump’s weaknesses, and allow the president to combat the idea — <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/21/us/politics/biden-age-videos.html" title="">presented in a slew of misleading videos</a> — that he is bumbling in public. Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump will meet in a closed studio in Atlanta with no live audience. Each candidate’s microphone will be muted when it is not his turn to speak.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">But it will still be live television, broadcast on CNN with moderators who will be under pressure to fact-check both men in real time but who have downplayed any expectation that they will wade into rebuttal territory. David Chalian, CNN’s political director, <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/business/media/cnn-presidential-debate.html" title="">told The New York Times</a> over the weekend that the moderators would focus on “facilitating the debate between these candidates, not being a participant in that debate.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The Biden team will be doing everything it can to make sure there are no surprises.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Bob Bauer, Mr. Biden’s personal attorney, has played the role of Mr. Trump in mock debates at Camp David, just as he did in 2020.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">In his book, “The Unraveling,” Mr. Bauer said he studied hours of tapes of Mr. Trump as a businessman, candidate and president before the 2020 debates. He wrote that he did not try to portray a “Saturday Night Live” version of Mr. Trump, with makeup and costumes. Instead, he wrote, “I used as much of the language he did on the topics that would come up in a debate.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The actual Mr. Trump has engaged in something that resembles a more streamlined debate preparation process than in past years. He has sat for <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/us/politics/trump-participates-in-his-form-of-debate-prep-readying-to-face-biden.html" title="">policy discussions with allies</a>. But over the weekend, he said that he was relying on his experiences as a campaigner to guide him when he takes the stage across from Mr. Biden.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">“Well, this is really the best strategy right here,” Mr. Trump told Fox News ahead of a rally in Philadelphia over the weekend. “We have all these people out here, and they are screaming questions. I look forward to the debate.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">At the rally, he attacked Mr. Biden for going “to a log cabin to ‘study,’” <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/22/us/politics/trump-biden-supplements-debate.html" title="">suggested</a> Mr. Biden would be taking supplements to get “jacked up” before the debate, and said the president would spend most of his time at Camp David sleeping.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">But Mr. Axelrod said the length of Mr. Biden’s preparation was consistent with past presidents. He said Mr. Klain plans sparring and mock debates, which lead into a two- or three-day debate camp.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">“Trump has a different process, in that he doesn’t believe in process,” Mr. Axelrod said. “What Biden is doing is more customary.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Mr. Biden’s Camp David prep team includes Mr. Klain and Mike Donilon, who is the architect of the campaign’s theme that democracy is at stake if Mr. Trump wins. Steve Ricchetti, a counselor to the president who manages relationships on Capitol Hill, is also scheduled to be there, as is Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Jeffrey D. Zients, Mr. Biden’s chief of staff, is expected to be there, as are aides focused on communications strategy, including Anita Dunn and Ben LaBolt, the White House communications director.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Several Biden campaign aides, including Jen O’Malley Dillon, Cedric Richmond, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Quentin Fulks, Michael Tyler and Rob Flaherty, are also on the list of attendees.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Some are returning to the fold just long enough to help Mr. Biden prepare: Brian Deese, who left the administration as director of the National Economic Council in 2023, is expected to visit Camp David to help Mr. Biden refine his pitch that the American economy is recovering.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Several people said there will be a clear division between Mr. Biden’s inner circle and the diverse set of policy experts summoned to Camp David, some of whom are not expected to remain on site all week once the mock debates begin in earnest.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Annie Tomasini, Mr. Biden’s deputy chief of staff, is never far from his side. And Bruce Reed, a top policy aide to Mr. Biden, will be making a lot of the calls about which arguments need to be refined, according to people familiar with the planning.</p></div></div>

<p>(<a href="https://www.kron4.com/">KRON</a>) — Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao’s chief of communications has resigned from his position, <a href="https://www.kron4.com/">KRON4.com</a> has learned. Francis Zamora told KRON4 he has “resigned his position as Chief of Communication.”</p>



<p>“I thank my colleagues for their professionalism and dedication,” Zamora said. “It was an honor to serve the City of Oakland beside them.”</p>



<p>According to his LinkedIn profile, Zamora had been in the job for about nine months.</p>





<p>Zamora’s abrupt resignation comes one day after the mayor gave a fiery, at times emotional press conference in the wake of an FBI raid on her home last week. During the prepared remarks, after which she took no questions, Thao suggested the <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/where-is-sheng-thao-oakland-residents-call-for-mayor-to-resign/">raid was part of a coordinated, behind-the-scenes effort involving “rightwing forces,” the media, and organizers of a recall effort</a> currently being levied against her.</p>



<p>Within a few hours of the mayor’s remarks, <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/oakland-mayor-thaos-attorney-withdraws-as-counsel/">Thao’s attorney, Tony Brass, announced that he had withdrawn as her counsel</a>. The mayor’s office told KRON4 she had informed Brass on Saturday she would be changing attorneys. Brass disputes the mayor’s office’s account, calling it untrue.</p>



<p>KRON4 reached out to the mayor’s office regarding Zamora and a member of the mayor’s press team confirmed he had resigned his position. </p>





<p>“The office will be seeking his permanent replacement,” a spokesperson said. “There have been no other staffing changes.”</p>



<p>Mayor Thao issued her own statement on Zamora, saying: </p>



<p>“Francis was a valuable member of the team whose contributions are greatly valued and appreciated. I think him for his service and wish him well.”</p>

            That’s the question put to a Massachusetts jury on Tuesday in closing arguments of her <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/us/karen-read-trial-boston-cec/index.html">murder trial</a> in a case that has riveted the Bay State.
    </p>

            The case stems from the death of Boston Police Officer John O’Keefe, whose body was found bruised and battered in the snow on January 29, 2022, outside the home of a fellow Boston police officer in the suburb of Canton.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxumrv2200013b6keztv2nrf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Prosecutors have alleged Read and O’Keefe, who were dating, had gotten into an argument that night, and that she drunkenly drove a vehicle into him and fled the scene, leaving him to die in the cold.

            “What the constellation of the facts and the evidence ineluctably demonstrate here is that the defendant drove her vehicle in reverse at 24.2 miles per hour for 62.5 feet, struck Mr. O’Keefe, causing those catastrophic head injuries, leaving him incapacitated and freezing him to death,” prosecutor Adam Lally said in closing arguments Tuesday.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxun0px200073b6kaxiq8t4p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            In contrast, her defense has accused<em> </em>off-duty police inside that Canton home of fatally beating O’Keefe, dumping his body on the lawn and then conspiring through fabricated evidence and false testimony to frame Read.

            “Ladies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,” defense attorney Alan Jackson said. “You’ll surely say to yourself, ‘I don’t want to believe it, I don’t want to believe that could happen in our community,’ but sadly over these past eight weeks you’ve seen it right before your eyes.”

            The prosecution’s case also has been hampered by a series of missteps and unusual investigative practices. Most notably, a lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, admitted that he sent a series of sexist and offensive texts about Read in a private group chat, calling her a “whack job,” mocking her medical issues and commenting to coworkers that he had found “no nudes” while searching her phone for evidence, <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/karen-read-trial-live-updates-june-10-2024/61054104" target="_blank">CNN affiliate WCVB reported</a>.

            Proctor apologized for the “unprofessional” comments on the stand, but the vulgar texts have been sharply criticized in and out of court, including from the governor.

            At closing arguments, the prosecution condemned the texts as “unprofessional, indefensible, (and) inexcusable” but said they had no impact on the integrity of the investigation.

            The heart of the trial stems from what happened on one wintry evening in Canton over two years ago.

            On the night of January 28, 2022, Read and O’Keefe went out drinking at two bars with friends. Shortly after midnight, the couple climbed into Read’s SUV and drove to the home of O’Keefe’s colleague on Fairview Road for an after-party, court documents show.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxuikxv8000o3b6kvrbsojel@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The prosecution alleged that the couple got into an argument that led to O’Keefe getting out of the vehicle. A drunken Read then struck him with the vehicle and fled, leaving him to die in the snowy cold, prosecutors say.
    </p>

  


    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxuikxv8000p3b6kaznylu6c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            However, Read has said she dropped off O’Keefe at the house and then drove to his home because she wasn’t feeling well, according to court documents. The next morning, when she realized he was still not home, she drove in a snowstorm to look for him, and finally found his body in the front yard of the Canton house.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxuikxv8000q3b6k2nwripj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Read and her legal team have alleged O’Keefe was injured in a fight inside the house – including being mauled by the homeowners’ German shepherd, Chloe – and then tossed out in the snow. They argued that Read was framed for his death and alleged a vast cop conspiracy and a corrupt investigation.
    </p>

            Prosecutors have rejected that theory. Firefighters who responded to the scene that morning asked about his injuries, and Read told them, “I hit him, I hit him,” according to their testimony. In addition, Read’s vehicle had a broken taillight, and pieces of the taillight were found outside the Canton home, prosecutors said.

            “From all of those people within that house that evening, none of them at any point in time observed John O’Keefe come into that house,” Lally said in opening statements. “They saw the vehicle pull away and they just assumed that they (O’Keefe and Read) left and that no one was coming.”

            The prosecution has presented evidence that Read and O’Keefe had a volatile relationship. O’Keefe’s niece and nephew said they heard the couple yelling in arguments prior to his death, and an ATF agent testified about his romantic kiss and text messages with Read, according to <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/karen-read-murder-trial-canton-massachusetts-john-okeefe-daily-summary/60716733" target="_blank">WCVB</a>.

            The defense has sharply questioned witnesses about whether Read truly confessed to hitting him with her vehicle and have challenged investigators about the quality of their work. For example, investigators used red plastic cups to collect evidence from the scene, and surveillance video of Read’s vehicle was inexplicably flipped to a mirror image, WCVB reported.

            The court Tuesday ordered the state to rescind its contract with <a href="https://stisidorevirtualschool.org/" target="_blank">St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School</a> in a 6-2 decision with one recusal.

            “Under Oklahoma law, a charter school is a public school,” wrote Justice James R. Winchester for the court. “As such, a charter school must be nonsectarian. However, St. Isidore will evangelize the Catholic faith as part of its school curriculum while sponsored by the State.”

            A charter contract for St. Isidore was approved by a state board last year.

            The fight over the school exposed a fault line between two of the state’s top Republican politicians. Gov. Kevin Stitt strongly advocated for the school, saying when the contract was approved that it was “a win for religious liberty and education freedom in our state.”

            But the school’s charter status was strongly opposed by Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who filed the lawsuit against it and predicted the state could be forced to fund other types of religious education if St. Isidore succeeded.

            “The framers of the US Constitution and those who drafted Oklahoma’s Constitution clearly understood how best to protect religious freedom: by preventing the State from sponsoring any religion at all,” Drummond <a href="https://oklahoma.gov/oag/news/newsroom/2024/june/drummond-comments-on-state-supreme-court-ruling-against-taxpayer-funded-religious-public-charter-school.html" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> Tuesday. “Now Oklahomans can be assured that our tax dollars will not fund the teachings of Sharia Law or even Satanism.”

            The American Civil Liberties Union applauded the decision, saying, “Charter schools are public schools that must be secular and serve all students.

            Meanwhile, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City is “disappointed in today’s ruling as it disregards the needs of many families in Oklahoma who only desire a choice in their child’s education,” its senior director for education Lara Schuler said in <a href="https://files.ecatholic.com/20256/documents/2024/6/Statements%20on%20Oklahoma%20Supreme%20Court%20Ruling%20St.%20Isidore%20of%20Seville%20Catholic%20Virtual%20School%20-%20June%2025%202024-1.pdf?t=1719329368000" target="_blank">a written statement</a> Tuesday. “We will remain steadfast as we seek to right this wrong and to join Oklahoma’s great diversity of charter schools serving all families in the state.”

            “St. Isidore is considering its legal options but today’s decision to condone unconstitutional discrimination against religious educators and the children they serve is one that the school will continue to fight,” said John Meiser of the University of Notre Dame’s Religious Liberty Clinic, who assisted St. Isidore with its charter application to the state.

That took out an Xcel Energy substation, cutting power for hundreds until the company restored electricity late Monday night. The water's new path around the dam, however, relieved some pressure on the structure, and by Tuesday morning county officials said they believed the dam would hold.</p>

<p id="RSJ5R66MHNCY3JE6HBXF3XABWA">They also said a wall of water would not swamp Mankato if the structure fell. Because the dam isn't operating, it's not holding a glut of water in its reservoir that a failure would unleash. Thilges said the county believed in the event of a failure, areas 2 miles downstream would see water levels rise about 2 feet, and about 3 to 4 inches in Mankato.</p>

Sediment stuck above the dam would harm the river ecosystem, Gulliver said, since it includes agriculture pollution. That's one reason why dam removal is so expensive, he added.</p>

Dam operators can take actions such as installing floating barriers known as log booms upstream.</p>

<p id="HLAGEBKIDJATFLI6TZOAKFTJJM">Still, Baecher said the dam troubles might raise questions about county officials' planning if the flood was a "50-year storm" rather than, say, a once-in-a-thousand-years event.</p>

He didn't know the exact characterization for this week's event, which peaked Monday at 34,800 cubic feet per second.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Judge lifts gag order</strong>: Judge Juan Merchan agreed to roll back protections intended to shield witnesses and jurors in Donald Trump's hush money trial after Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts.</li>
<li><strong>Witnesses and jurors no longer protected</strong>: The lifted gag order means that Trump is now free to speak out against witnesses and jurors in the trial, although the judge expressed a "strong preference" to keep protections in place for jurors.</li>
<li><strong>Court staff and families still protected</strong>: Protections for court staff, district attorney's office staff, and their families will remain in place until after Trump's sentencing on July 11.</li>
<li><strong>Gag order intended to ensure trial integrity</strong>: The original gag order was intended to address concerns that Trump could compromise the trial's integrity by targeting judges, prosecutors, and their families with his attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Trump guilty of falsifying business records</strong>: A jury found Trump guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records connected with an election interference scheme that involved buying the silence of adult film star Stormy Daniels and her former attorney Michael Cohen.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Conservative cabinet minister admits to betting on election date</strong>: Scottish Secretary Alister Jack admitted to placing three bets on the date of the general election in the weeks before Rishi Sunak's surprise announcement.</li>
<li><strong>Jack's bets were successful</strong>: Jack placed a successful bet that the election date would fall between July and September, after losing two similar bets in March. He also placed a £20 bet at five to one, which would have netted him a return of £120.</li>
<li><strong>Jack claims he had no knowledge of election date</strong>: Jack said he had no knowledge of the date of the election until the day it was called, and he placed no bets in May. He is not under investigation by the Gambling Commission.</li>
<li><strong>Questionable timing of Jack's bets</strong>: Jack had been telling colleagues and journalists for at least a year that he thought a June or July election made the most strategic sense for his party, raising questions about whether his bets were simply a coincidence.</li>
<li><strong>Jack is standing down at the election</strong>: Jack is standing down at the election after seven years in Parliament, and his decision to block the Scottish government's gender self-ID reforms was seen as a significant moment in the demise of Nicola Sturgeon's period as Scotland's First Minister.</li>
