                                        <p>BANGKOK (AP) — A Singapore Airlines flight hit severe turbulence over the Indian Ocean and descended 6,000 feet (around 1,800 meters) in about three minutes, the carrier said Tuesday. A British man died and authorities said dozens of passengers were injured, some severely.</p><p>An airport official said the 73-year-old man may have had a heart attack, though that hasn’t been confirmed. His name wasn’t immediately released.</p><p>The Boeing 777 flight from London’s Heathrow airport to Singapore, with 211 passengers and 18 crew members aboard, was diverted and landed in stormy weather in Bangkok.</p><p>British passenger Andrew Davies told Sky News that the seatbelt sign was illuminated but crew members didn’t have time to take their seats.</p><p>“Every single cabin crew person I saw was injured in some way or another, maybe with a gash on their head,” Davies said. “One had a bad back, who was in obvious pain.”</p>
    

<p>Dzafran Azmir, a 28-year-old student on the flight, told ABC News: “Some people hit their heads on the baggage cabins overhead and dented it. They hit the places where lights and masks are and broke straight through it.”</p>



<p>Kittipong Kittikachorn, general manager of Suvarnabhumi Airport, told a news conference that the sudden descent occurred as passengers were being served food.</p><p>He said seven passengers were severely injured, and 23 passengers and nine crew members had moderate injuries. Sixteen with less serious injuries received hospital treatment and 14 were treated at the airport. He said the British man appeared to have had a heart attack but medical authorities would need to confirm that.</p>
    
<p>A later statement from Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital said 71 people had been treated there, including six who were severely injured. No explanation of the discrepancy was available.</p><p>Tracking data captured by FlightRadar24 and analyzed by The Associated Press show the Singapore Airlines flight SQ321 cruising at an altitude of 37,000 feet (11,300 meters).</p>
    

<p>At one point, the Boeing 777-300ER suddenly and sharply descended to 31,000 feet (9,400 meters) over about three minutes, according to the data. The aircraft then stayed at 31,000 feet (9,400 meters) for under 10 minutes before diverting and landing in Bangkok less than a half-hour later.</p><p>The sharp descent occurred as the flight was over the Andaman Sea, near Myanmar. The aircraft sent a “squawk code” of 7700 at that time, an international emergency signal.</p><p>Details of the weather weren’t immediately available.</p><p>Most people associate turbulence with heavy storms, but the most dangerous type is so-called clear air turbulence. Wind shear can occur in wispy cirrus clouds or even in clear air near thunderstorms, as differences in temperature and pressure create powerful currents of fast-moving air.</p><p>The problem of turbulence was highlighted in December, when a total of 41 people on two separate flights hit by turbulence in the United States were hurt or received medical treatment on two consecutive days.</p><p>According to a 2021 report by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, turbulence accounted for 37.6% of all accidents on larger commercial airlines between 2009 and 2018. The Federal Aviation Administration, another U.S. government agency, said after the December incidents that there were 146 serious injuries from turbulence from 2009 to 2021.</p>
    

<p>Boeing extended condolences to the family of the dead man and said it was in contact with Singapore Airlines “and stand ready to support them.” The wide-body Boeing 777 is a workhorse of the aviation industry, used mainly for long-haul flights by airlines around the world. The 777-300ER variant of the twin-engine, two-aisle plane is larger and can carry more passengers than earlier models.</p><p>Singapore Airlines, the city-state’s flag carrier, operates 22 of the aircraft as part of its fleet of more than 140 planes. The airline’s parent company is majority owned by Singapore’s Temasek government investment conglomerate and also operates the budget airline Scoot.</p><p>Thailand’s transport minister, Suriya Jungrungruangkit, said Singapore was dispatching another plane to transport those who could travel. It arrived in Bangkok on Tuesday night.</p>
    

<p>Singapore Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat in a Facebook post said his ministry and Singapore’s Foreign Ministry, as well as the country’s Civil Aviation Authority and Changi Airport officials along with airline staff, “are providing support to the affected passengers and their families.”</p><p>The ministry’s Transport Safety Investigation Bureau said it was in touch with its Thai counterpart and would deploy investigators to Bangkok.</p><p>Singapore Airlines said the nationalities of the passengers were 56 Australians, two Canadians, one German, three Indians, two Indonesians, one from Iceland, four from Ireland, one Israeli, 16 Malaysians, two from Myanmar, 23 from New Zealand, five Filipinos, 41 from Singapore, one South Korean, two Spaniards, 47 from the United Kingdom and four from the United States.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.</p>

            Putin, who is believed by the US to be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/25/politics/us-russia-iran-drones/index.html">receiving support</a> from Iran for his war in Ukraine, called the Iranian leader an “outstanding politician” and a “true friend of Russia.” Raisi made “an invaluable personal contribution” to the development of the countries’ relations, Putin’s statement released by the Kremlin said.

            The comments come as observers have pointed to a loose but growing coordination of interests between Iran, China, North Korea and Russia over their shared animosity toward a global system they see as dominated by the US and its values.

            Inside Iran, where many of the country’s restive youth population have grown tired of rule by conservative clerics, Raisi had a much more polarizing legacy.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has expressed his willingness to work with Congress to pass legislation that would penalize the International Criminal Court (ICC) after it issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.</li>
<li>The ICC's application for arrest warrants is a "profoundly wrongheaded decision" in Blinken's opinion, and he believes the US needs to take action against the court for its decision.</li>
<li>Blinken made his comments during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, where he was questioned by Ranking Member Sen. James Risch (R-ID) about the possibility of legislation to address the ICC's decision.</li>
<li>The ICC's decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant was seen as a provocative move by the Israeli government, which had previously indicated that it would not cooperate with the ICC.</li>
<li>The ICC's investigation and arrest warrants were also directed at senior Hamas officials, including its leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, in response to alleged war crimes and human rights abuses in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</li>

            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he wants to work with Congress on legislation to penalize the International Criminal Court after it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/20/middleeast/icc-israel-hamas-arrest-warrant-war-crimes-intl/index.html">applied for arrest warrants</a> for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.

            “Given the events of yesterday, I think we have to look at the appropriate steps to take to deal with again, what is a profoundly wrongheaded decision,” Blinken said at a State Department budget hearing with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

            Blinken’s comments were an early indication of the Biden administration’s openness to taking action against the Netherlands-based court for its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/20/middleeast/icc-israel-hamas-arrest-warrant-war-crimes-intl/index.html">application </a>for arrest warrants for the senior Israeli officials.

            Blinken was responding to questions by the ranking member of the committee, Republican Sen.

<ol>
<li>The Trump campaign deleted a video posted to former President Trump's Truth Social account that referenced a "unified Reich".</li>
<li>The video was a 30-second clip outlining a vision of the US under Mr. Trump's leadership, featuring stylized headlines, including one that used a term associated with Nazi Germany.</li>
<li>The video appeared on Mr. Trump's account on Monday and was deleted the next day.</li>
<li>According to a campaign spokeswoman, the video was not an official campaign video but was posted by a junior staff member, not Mr. Trump.</li>
<li>The use of the term "Reich" has sparked concerns about its Nazi connotations, with many interpreting it as a reference to the concept of a unified Germany under Adolf Hitler.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mount Fuji viewing spot blocked</strong>: The town of Fujikawaguchiko in Japan has installed a large black screen to block the view of Mount Fuji from a popular sidewalk spot to deter overcrowding and disruptions to the local community.</li>
<li><strong>Over-tourism concerns</strong>: The town has taken measures to address the issue of over-tourism, including the removal of a popular photo location, due to concerns over safety, littering, and disruption to the local community.</li>
<li><strong>New measures for Mount Fuji climbing</strong>: The local government has introduced a booking system for climbers to ease overcrowding, littering, and safety risks. Only 4,000 climbers will be allowed to enter the trail per day, and a fee will be charged.</li>
<li><strong>"Bullet climbing" measures</strong>: To prevent "bullet climbing" (rushing to the summit without adequate rest), climbing beyond the 5th station is restricted between 4 p.m. and 3 a.m. only for those with overnight stay reservations at huts along the trail.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental concerns</strong>: Mount Fuji is a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site, but it is also plagued by trash left behind by tourists, including plastic bottles, food, and even clothes.</li>

                                        <p>TOKYO (AP) — Sorry, the screen is now up — no more snapping cute photos of Mount Fuji from a popular sidewalk spot in the Japanese town of Fujikawaguchiko. </p><p>Known as a place that offers some of the best views of the iconic Japanese mountain, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/video/town-builds-screen-to-block-mount-fuji-view-as-japan-grapples-with-over-tourism-0000018f305ed5a8afefb3ffae9c0000">the town last month started erecting a large black screen</a></span> on a stretch of a street to block the view and deter tourists from overcrowding the place. </p><p>A particularly popular photo location was outside a Lawson convenience store, from where a photograph taken at a particular angle would make it seem as if Mt. Fuji was sitting atop the store roof.</p><p>The tourists, mostly foreigners, even dubbed the spot “Mt. Fuji Lawson.” </p><p>But the townspeople were unhappy — visitors would block the narrow sidewalk, take photos on the busy road or walk into neighbors’ properties in pursuit of their shot, officials said. </p><p>On Tuesday, construction of the 2.5 meter (8.2 feet) high black mesh net — stretching for 20 meters (66 feet) along the sidewalk — was completed.</p>
    

<p>Still, there are other places tourists can find their sweet photo spot. </p><p>The Yamanashi prefecture, also home to the Yoshida Trail — the most popular of the four routes to summit the 3,776-meter (12,300-feet-) high mountain — introduced <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/japan-mount-fuji-climbing-reservation-overtourism-6ab73fc69b37d35359f6abf1eaeda90e">a booking system ahead of this year’s Fuji climbing season</a></span> to ease overcrowding, littering and safety risks. </p>



<p>Under the new plan, only up to 4,000 climbers will be allowed to enter the trail per day for a hiking fee of 2,000 yen (about $18), with an option of donating an additional 1,000 yen (about $9) for conservation during the climbing season, which starts July 1 and runs until Sept. 10.</p>
    
<p>Only those with reservation for an overnight stay at huts along the trail are allowed to hike beyond the 5th of the 10 stations between 4 p.m. and 3 a.m., a measure to stop “bullet climbing,” or rushing to the summit without adequate rest, which officials say puts lives at risk. </p>
    

<p>Designated a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site in 2013, Mt. Fuji used to be a place of pilgrimage. </p><p>Today, it’s popular among hikers who climb the summit to watch the sunrise. But tons of trash left behind, including plastic bottles, food and even clothes, have become a major concern.</p><p>Over-tourism has also become a growing issue at other popular tourist destinations such as Kyoto and Kamakura.</p><p>Last year, Japan had more than 25 million visitors, and the figures in 2024 are expected to surpass nearly 32 million, a record from 2019, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization.</p>

<li>The trial of Karen Read, accused of murdering her boyfriend John O'Keefe, a Boston police officer, resumed with cross-examination of witness Jennifer McCabe, who had previously testified about her friend Kerry Roberts' phone conversation with police.</li>
<li>Defense attorney Alan Jackson questioned McCabe about her knowledge of the police interview with Kerry Roberts, who was with Read and McCabe when they discovered O'Keefe's body.</li>
<li>McCabe admitted to hearing some sounds while eating dinner with her family, but denied eavesdropping on the interview. She claimed that Roberts was "going on and on" about the investigation.</li>
<li>The prosecution alleges that Read hit and killed O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die outside a home in Canton, Massachusetts.</li>

I willingly turned over my phone," McCabe said. "After you deleted your phone call logs, correct?" Jackson followed up. "Absolutely not," McCabe responded. </p><p>On Friday, the jury was shown a group text message between the McCabes and the Alberts. In one text message, Jennifer's husband Matthew McCabe said to Chris Albert to "ask some questions" and then say "the guy [John] never went in the house." Matthew McCabe said it was a message about what to tell a media member who was asking questions.</p>

<p>During cross-examination Tuesday, Jennifer McCabe was asked if her husband was directing the group what to say. </p><p>"No. John never went in the house. It wasn't a story. It was the truth. And it is the truth," Jennifer McCabe said. </p><h2>"I'm an honest and truthful person"</h2><p>Jackson asked McCabe if Brian Albert, who was a Boston police officer at the time of O'Keefe's death but has since retired, gave her any advice on what to say if interviewed. She said no.</p><p>Shortly after O'Keefe's body was found, McCabe made phone calls to Brian and Nicole Albert that she said were not answered. They were later found in a deleted calls folder, though McCabe testified that she did not delete them.</p><p>Jackson asked if McCabe and Brian Albert ever discussed deleting calls. "Absolutely not, " McCabe said.</p><p>"Would you tell us if did?" Jackson asked.</p><p>"Yes. Because I'm an honest and truthful person," McCabe said. </p>

<h2>"I hit him, I hit him, I hit him"</h2><p>McCabe previously testified that when first responders arrived on Fairview Road, Read clearly repeated "I hit him, I hit him, I hit him."</p><p>Under cross-examination, Jackson asked McCabe about previous testimony, but noted that in prior grand jury testimony she used different versions of the phrase instead of directly saying "I hit him." </p><p>"I don't know if it's in this document but I can tell you with 100% clarity that she said 'I hit him, I hit him, I hit him,'" McCabe said while looking at a transcript from previous grand jury testimony. </p><p>"It's probably the most powerful part of your testimony ma'am," Jackson said. "And I will never forget it," McCabe responded, leading to an objection that was sustained by the judge. </p><p>"Would you agree it's the most powerful part of your testimony?" Jackson then asked, leading to McCabe responding yes.</p><p>Jackson asked if McCabe is "manufacturing" this part of her testimony "because you think it helps you out."</p><p>"Absolutely not," McCabe replied.</p>

<h2>What did Jennifer McCabe see?</h2><p>Jackson focused on McCabe's previous testimony that the early morning hours of January 29, 2022 while she was inside 34 Fairview Road, she saw Read's vehicle outside. McCabe said the SUV moved several times.</p><p>That night, McCabe texted O'Keefe to "pull behind me" after midnight, telling the couple to park in Brian Albert's driveway, and shortly after texted "Hello."</p><p>After pointing out that McCabe testified she had a clear view of Read's SUV when she looked out the window, Jackson said "I have a question Miss McCabe. Where was the body?" </p><p>"I have no idea. I'm assuming the body was on the front lawn," McCabe said, noting that she did not see it and never heard anything like an argument or screeching tires.</p><p>McCabe later said "I never saw a body. I wish I had." Jackson replied "That sounds a little rehearsed, Miss McCabe."</p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/21/0856b384-0a80-488a-91ef-73e678abe4a7/thumbnail/620x349/15b213c54bf85fb9ca4e9f92001f9d54/karen-read-trial-dedham-raw-20240521.jpg?v=dac66bdad19d0be8e87f46552b582682#" alt="karen-read-trial-dedham-raw-20240521.jpg " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/21/0856b384-0a80-488a-91ef-73e678abe4a7/thumbnail/620x349/15b213c54bf85fb9ca4e9f92001f9d54/karen-read-trial-dedham-raw-20240521.jpg?v=dac66bdad19d0be8e87f46552b582682 1x, https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/21/0856b384-0a80-488a-91ef-73e678abe4a7/thumbnail/1240x698/f764bf46e4e3b02522fbde673df6c67a/karen-read-trial-dedham-raw-20240521.jpg?v=dac66bdad19d0be8e87f46552b582682 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

              </figcaption></figure><h2>Tense cross-examination of Jennifer McCabe</h2><p>There were some tense moments at the start of Jackson's cross-examination as he showed video of McCabe talking to Read while they left the Waterfall Bar and Grille in Canton. That is where the group was drinking before O'Keefe's death.</p><p>"See this is the point where I get to ask the questions and you get to answer them," Jackson said after one of McCabe's answers.</p>

<p>At one point, Judge Beverly Cannone reminded McCabe and Jackson of the importance that they not speak over each other.</p><p>Jackson attempted to ask McCabe if she has spoken to Brian Albert's brother Chris and his wife since O'Keefe's death. She asked if she was referring to discussions they have had about the case.</p><p>"Yes, Miss McCabe I'm asking about this case," Jackson said.</p><p>"Of course I speak to them all the time about the vicious harassment we've all been receiving," McCabe responded.</p><p>McCabe's daughter Allie previously testified about harassment the family has received, <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-murder-trial-day-12/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">breaking down in tears</a></span> on the stand.</p><p>On Tuesday, McCabe said "the facts of the case are not spoken about as much as the vicious harassment" they have faced.</p><p>Several hours into the cross-examination, Jackson asked McCabe if Brian or Nicole Albert ever came out of 34 Fairview Road. McCabe said, "Correct. Neither did any neighbor."</p>

<p>"I know you'd like to keep editorializing after the fact. There's probably a time and a place for that. This isn't it. If you could answer my question, I'd ask you do that," Jackson said.</p><h2>Direct testimony by Jennifer McCabe</h2><p>McCabe first took the stand Friday as a prosecution witness. She is the sister of Brian Albert's wife, Nicole Albert.</p><p>She described O'Keefe as an "amazing guy" and said she and Read were friends as well.</p><p>After O'Keefe did not return home by the early morning of January 29, 2022, Read went out to search for him along with McCabe and Roberts.</p><h2>Jennifer McCabe's Google search</h2><p>A Google search is at the center of McCabe's testimony. She said that around 6 a.m. when O'Keefe's body was found, Read asked her to do an internet search.</p><p>"She grabbed my hands and she said, 'Google hypothermia, Google how long it takes to die in the cold,'" McCabe testified.  <br>According to search data, McCabe made a spelling error, resulting in the search "Hos long to die in cold."</p><p>Defense attorneys claim McCabe is a key part in an alleged plot to frame Read. They say the search actually took place hours before O'Keefe's body was found.</p>

<p>Jackson has not yet questioned McCabe about the search.</p><h2>Who is Karen Read?</h2><p>Karen Read is a 45-year-old woman from Massachusetts whose murder case has gained national attention.</p><p>Read is charged with and has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating under the influence of alcohol, and leaving the scene of personal injury and death. <br></p><h2>Karen Read trial schedule</h2><p>Read's trial is taking longer than expected after three weeks of testimony from nearly 40 witnesses - and experts say a long trial <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-murder-trial-jury-analysis-legal-experts/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">runs the risk</a></span> of losing the jury. </p><p>The court on Tuesday announced several days off in the next two weeks. Trial will not be in session on Thursday, May 23. After the Memorial Day holiday, court will be back for a full day on Tuesday but then the jury will get the rest of the week off. </p>

<li>The French government has declared a 12-day minimum state of emergency on the island, reinforcing security forces with 1,000 additional personnel to restore order and allow dialogue to resume.</li>
<li>Macron is expected to arrive in New Caledonia on Thursday morning, marking his first visit to the territory since the unrest began, and is likely to meet with local leaders and stakeholders to address the crisis.</li>

<p>The unrest erupted May 13 as the French legislature in Paris debated amending the French Constitution to make changes to New Caledonia voter lists. Opponents fear the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia and further marginalize Kanaks who once suffered from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination.</p>



<p>The violence is the most severe to shake New Caledonia since the 1980s, when France also imposed emergency measures on the island that became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III.</p>
    
<p>Paris last Wednesday <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/new-caledonia-france-pacific-unrest-46729a7c6922c0cd0e82eb3a78102c64">declared a 12-day minimum state of emergency</a></span> on the island and rushed in 1,000 reinforcements to bolster security forces that lost control of parts of the capital, Nouméa.</p><p>“Faced with the outbreak of violence, the priority is the return of order to allow dialogue to resume in New Caledonia,” Thevenot, the government spokeswoman, said. “We are clear: Much remains to be done before the return to normal. The government is fully mobilized.”</p>
    

<p>Leaving Tuesday night will, because of the distance and time difference, see Macron arrive Thursday morning in New Caledonia, his office said. It said he is expected to stay for one day.</p><p>Macron will meet with political, business, civic and youth leaders and aim to “renew the thread of dialogue” in search of “a comprehensive political agreement,” Prime Minister Gabriel Attal told parliament, where lawmakers stood for a moment of silence for the six people killed in the violence. </p><p>Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said he’ll join Macron, along with the ministers for defense and for France’s overseas territories. The visit will give Macron and his ministers a first-hand look at some of the destruction that turned parts of Nouméa into no-go zones, with buildings torched, shops pillaged and barricades erected both by pro-independence supporters, some armed, and people banding together to protect livelihoods and homes.</p><p>With police given emergency powers and a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew in effect, French authorities say security forces are starting to contain unrest. They announced another 22 arrests Tuesday for a total number near 300.</p>
    

<p>The violence in New Caledonia has led to fresh discussion about France’s colonial past. Macron’s efforts to address that have largely focused on Africa, where France had colonies and where local frustration in some countries has led to recent calls for French forces to get out.</p><p>A priority for French authorities in New Caledonia since the weekend has been <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/new-caledonia-asia-france-pacific-unrest-riots-6cb8c27ba7c9fb589cf306d393d4a5dd">clearing the highway to Nouméa’s international airport</a></span> of barricades and the burned hulks of vehicles, raising the prospect for stranded tourists of being able to leave.</p><p>Australia and New Zealand sent planes to New Caledonia on Tuesday to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/australia-new-zealand-new-caledonia-australia-8fb1ad85f675720ed77c03b718533bd2">begin bringing citizens home.</a></span> Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Australia received clearance from French authorities for two evacuation flights and would work on further ones.</p><p>Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs said 300 Australians were in New Caledonia. It did not immediately confirm whether the flights would evacuate other stranded foreign nationals, believed to number in the thousands.</p>
    

<p>New Zealand’s government announced an evacuation effort for about 50 citizens.</p><p>“New Zealanders in New Caledonia have faced a challenging few days — and bringing them home has been an urgent priority for the government,” Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said. “In cooperation with France and Australia, we are working on subsequent flights in coming days.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Leicester reported from Le Pecq, France, and Smith from Newcastle, Australia.</p>

<li><strong>Fed Governor Chris Waller believes interest rates should stay put</strong>: Waller, a member of the Federal Reserve, stated that he thinks interest rates should remain unchanged due to sticky inflation and the need for more evidence of cooling inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation progress is still slow</strong>: Waller gave the latest inflation data a "C+" grade, citing the modest easing in inflation rates. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.6% year over year in April, but Waller wants to see more sustained progress.</li>
<li><strong>Fed officials stress a "higher-for-longer" stance</strong>: Waller's comments join those of other Fed officials, including Fed Vice Chairs Philip Jefferson and Michael Barr, who have also indicated that interest rates should remain higher for longer to combat inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Fed Chair Jerome Powell wants to see more data</strong>: Powell has stated that the Fed needs more than a quarter's worth of data to make a judgment on whether inflation is steadily falling towards its 2% target.</li>
<li><strong>Rate cut unlikely in the near future</strong>: As a result of the Fed's cautious approach, it appears that the first rate cut will not occur until at least September, pending the release of more data showing sustained progress in cooling inflation.</li>

The Fed's goal is to get inflation down to 2%.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-0">Fed governor Christopher Waller.

Waller appears to want more, noting he would like to see “several” months of data.</p><p>That implies it will take more than three inflation reports for the Fed to feel confident about lowering rates from a 23-year high, putting the odds on a first rate cut in September at the earliest if the data supports such a move.</p></div></div>
