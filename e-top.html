Security quickly escorted him out, but Fuentes created political problems for Trump after attending a private lunch with the former president and the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/kanye-west">rapper formerly known as Kanye West</a></span> at Trump’s Florida estate in 2022.</p>
    

<p>The crowd was far smaller but also warmly receptive earlier, when Trump visited 180 Church, a modest brick building with “Black Americans for Trump” signs affixed. Derelict vehicles sat nearby, while rap music and barbecue smoke wafted from a pre-event gathering organized by the Black Conservative Federation group.</p>



<p>“It’s a very important area for us,” Trump told the church crowd. He also promised to return “some Sunday” for a sermon. </p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know about the 2024 Election Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020.

<p>Trump’s weekend schedule underscores the evolving political forces shaping the presidential election this fall as he tries to deny Democratic President <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a></span> a second term. </p>
    
<p>“He’s been the worst president for Black people,” Trump said at the church. He also argued that the Black community “is being hurt” by people in the country illegally, adding, “They’re invading your jobs.”</p>
    

<p>Few states may matter more in November than Michigan, which Biden carried by less than 3 percentage points four years ago. And few voting groups matter more to Democrats than African Americans, who made up the backbone of Biden’s political base in 2020. But now, less than five months before Election Day, Black voters are expressing modest signs of disappointment with the 81-year-old Democrat.</p><p>Michael Whatley, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, told Michigan Republicans at a dinner Friday that the state could not be more important. </p><p>“Let me be more blunt: If we don’t win Michigan, we’re not going to have Donald Trump in the White House,” Whatley said, adding, “We are going to determine the fate of the world in this election.”</p><p>Trump <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-bronx-rally-minority-voters-00fae754f78333111c508d6e740a3610">argues he can pull in more Black voters</a></span> due to his economic and border security message, and that <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-black-conservative-south-carolina-primary-aa1155c31bfc3b397a32b33eff04ada8">his felony indictments</a></span> make him more relatable. At the church on Saturday afternoon, he repeatedly vowed to “bring back the auto industry” while also noting, “The crime is most rampant right here and African American communities.” </p>
    

<p>Kimberly Taylor, who was invited on stage at the church by the Trump campaign, thanked Trump for “coming to the hood,” while pastor Lorenzo Sewell said Biden attended an NAACP dinner in the city “but never came to the hood.”</p><p>The pastor asked Trump how to “keep the Black dollar in the Black community” and the former president said that the Black community “needs to stop the crime.”</p><p>Democrats are offering a competing perspective.</p><p>“Donald Trump is so dangerous for Michigan and dangerous for America and dangerous for Black people,” said Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, who is African American. He called it “offensive” for Trump to address the Turning Point conference, which was taking place at the same convention center that was “the epicenter of their steal the election effort.” </p><p>Indeed, dozens of angry Trump loyalists chanting “Stop the count!” descended on the TCF Center, now named Huntington Place, the day after the 2020 presidential election as absentee ballots were being counted. Local media captured scenes of protesters outside and in the lobby. Police prevented them from entering the counting area.</p>
    

<p>The protests occurred after Trump had tweeted that “they are finding Biden votes all over” in several states, including Michigan. </p><p>The false notion that Biden benefited from widespread voter fraud has been widely debunked by voting officials in both parties, the court system and members of Trump’s former administration. Still, Trump continues to promote such misinformation, which echoed throughout the conservative convention over the weekend. </p><p>Speaking from the main stage, Turning Point founder and CEO Charlie Kirk falsely described the conference location as “the scene of a crime.” Trump also used his speech to personally salute Kirk. </p>
    

<p>Such extreme rhetoric does not appear to have hurt Trump’s standing with Black voters. </p><p>Among Black adults, Biden’s approval has dropped from 94% when he started his term in January 2021 to just 55%, according to an <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnorc.org/projects/2024-the-publics-priorities-and-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a></span> poll published in March.</p><p>About 8 in 10 Black voters have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, with roughly two-thirds saying they have a “very unfavorable” view of him, according to an <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnorc.org/projects/about-half-approve-of-trumps-conviction-in-the-hush-money-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP-NORC poll conducted in June</a></span>. </p><p>Trump won 8% of the Black vote in 2020, according to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/03/929478378/understanding-the-2020-electorate-ap-votecast-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP VoteCast</a></span>. And in what is expected to be a close election, even a modest shift could be consequential. </p><p>Omar Mitchell, a Detroit restaurant owner who participated in the church roundtable, said he supports Trump because “money was pumping” when he was president.</p><p>“In the old days, how we grew up was just because you’re Black means you’re a Democrat,” Mitchell said. “That’s out the door nowadays.”</p><p>Elsewhere, thousands of conservative activists, most of them young and white, were eagerly awaiting Trump’s keynote address Saturday night.</p><p>Turning Point has emerged as a force in GOP politics in the Trump era, particularly among his “Make America Great Again” movement, despite the ADL’s warning that the group “continues to attract racists.”</p><p>“Numerous individuals associated with the group have made bigoted statements about the Black community, the LGBTQ community and other groups,” the ADL, an international anti-hate group, wrote in a background memo. “While TPUSA (Turning Point USA) leaders say they reject white supremacist ideology, known white nationalists have attended their events.” </p><p>Turning Point spokesperson Andrew Kolvet dismissed the ADL’s characterization as “smears and lies.” He added that Turning Point has been blocking Fuentes from attending its events for “years.” </p><p>“The ADL is a scourge on America, which sows poison and division. They’ve completely lost the plot,” Kolvet said, describing the ADL’s criticism as “a badge of honor.” </p><p>Turning Point, long popular among Trump’s MAGA fringe, is now a central player in mainstream Republican politics. The group’s weekend speaking program featured a long list of established Republican politicians and former Trump counselor Steve Bannon, who is set <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/steve-bannon-contempt-jan-6-committee-prison-2da50bcf2f8ff8f3e01ef4bf2b1b845e">to report to prison</a></span> by July 1 to begin serving a four-month sentence for defying a U.S. House subpoena.</p><p>In his remarks Friday night, Vivek Ramaswamy, who has emerged as a fierce Trump ally since unsuccessfully challenging Trump for the GOP presidential nomination, called on conservatives to reject what he said was the Democrats’ embrace of diversity.</p><p>“I am sick and tired of celebrating our diversity,” Ramaswamy charged. “It means nothing unless there is something greater that unites us.” </p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Will Weissert and Linley Sanders in Washington contributed to this report.</p>

Biden has criticized the ICC's <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/icc-arrest-warrants-sought-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-yahya-sinwar/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">application for arrest warrants</a></span> of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant.</p><p>Several days after, the Biden campaign sent out a fundraising text from Clooney. </p><p>"I'm not exaggerating when I say that this election is the fight of our lives," the text blast from Clooney reads. "It's a choice between those who want to pull America back to the past, and those who want to move America into the future." </p>

<li><strong>Rejection of Putin's ceasefire terms</strong>: The leaders of Italy and Germany, Giorgia Meloni and Olaf Scholz, respectively, have rejected Vladimir Putin's ceasefire proposal, which would require Ukraine to withdraw from the regions it occupies.</li>
<li><strong>Ukraine's refusal to compromise</strong>: Ukraine's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, stated that there would be "no compromise on independence, sovereignty, or territorial integrity," rejecting Putin's proposal.</li>
<li><strong>Global support for Ukraine</strong>: The Summit on Peace in Ukraine has gathered over 90 countries and global institutions, with a draft declaration reaffirming Ukraine's territorial integrity and rejecting any nuclear threats against the country.</li>
<li><strong>Criticism of Putin's proposal</strong>: Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called Putin's proposal "propaganda," while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz labeled it a "dictatorial peace." British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak accused Putin of "spinning a phoney narrative" and said that countries helping Russia with weapon supplies are "on the wrong side of history."</li>
<li><strong>Ukraine's goals for the summit</strong>: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, stated that Ukraine wants to "give diplomacy a chance" and show that "joint efforts" can stop wars, highlighting the importance of global unity in resolving the conflict.</li>

            This judgment could be viewed as a partial victory for Jones, who fought the liquidation proposal – but so too did some families, whose attorneys said they’ll benefit more from the bankruptcy plan’s dismissal by going after Jones’ assets immediately – rather than waiting for a prolonged bankruptcy procedure to play out.

            Jones founded Infowars, an influential conspiracy empire, in the late 1990s. Over the years, Jones has used the media company to poison the public discourse with lies and conspiracy theories, and he also enriched himself, making millions of dollars in the process.

            Since founding Infowars in the late 1990s, Jones has pushed several conspiracy theories, including the lie that the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, mass school shooting was a so-called “false flag” operation staged by the government and that the grieving family members of 20 child victims were “actors.” Jones makes money on those conspiracy theories by hawking high-priced dietary supplements to his audience.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>An Arkansas prosecutor has determined that an ATF agent was justified in fatally shooting Bryan Malinowski, the executive director of the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport in Little Rock, Arkansas, during a raid at his home in March.</li>
<li>Malinowski was shot when he fired at ATF agents who were executing a warrant at his home. He died days later. The raid was part of an investigation into Malinowski's activities as a gun collector and reseller.</li>
<li>The prosecutor, Will Jones, concluded that the ATF agent who fired at Malinowski had a "reasonable belief" that deadly force was necessary to defend himself and another agent, who was injured in the raid.</li>
<li>The ATF's investigation into the shooting was conducted by the Arkansas State Police, and the agency has referred the matter to its internal review board.</li>
<li>The Malinowski family has criticized the ATF's tactics in the raid, calling them "completely unnecessary" and complaining about a lack of information from the agency. The family's attorney has also questioned the timing of the raid, noting that the ATF agents only waited 28 seconds after knocking on the door before beginning to ram it down.</li>

Someone inside the house fired gunshots at the agents and they returned fire, striking the shooter. Later the shooter was identified as Malinowski. </p>    
  <p>An affidavit released after the shooting said Malinowski bought over 150 guns between May 2021 and February 2024 and that he resold many without a dealer's license.</p><p>In his letter, Jones said the agents had properly identified themselves with police running lights and sirens outdoors before they entered and announced their presence at the front door. He wrote the ATF agents had shields and wore shirts that had ATF Police printed on the right side and bulletproof vests with ATF Police printed on the front. Jones wrote that during the raid one of the agents saw another agent fall to the ground, heard a gunshot and saw Malinowski holding a gun.</p>

<p>"Given the totality of the circumstances, Agent 2 had a reasonable belief that deadly force was necessary to defend himself and Agent 1," Jones wrote. "Therefore, the use of deadly force by Agent 2 was in accordance with Arkansas law and was justified."</p><p>ATF spokesperson Kristina Mastropasqua called the state's investigation into the shooting "prompt, professional and independent" and said it's now under internal review by the agency.</p><p>The Malinowski family has called the ATF's tactics in the raid "completely unnecessary" and has complained about a lack of details from the ATF. An attorney for Malinowski's family has said he was a gun collector and wasn't aware he was under investigation for his reselling firearms at gun shows.</p><p>Bud Cummins, the family's attorney, on Friday said questions about the raid were "far from over" despite Jones' decision. Cummins noted that, according to Jones' letter, ATF agents only waited 28 seconds after knocking on the Malinowski's door before they began to ram it.</p>

<p>"How long is it reasonable to wait for someone to answer their front door at 6:00 am in response to unexplained loud pounding in a 3000 square foot fully insulated home? Let's  pray  the  answer  isn't  28  seconds.  The  Fourth  Amendment  means  more  than that to every single one of us," Cummins said in a statement. </p><p>His death prompted criticism from some Republican lawmakers in Arkansas who have called for more information from the ATF, and the chair of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee in April asked the ATF to provide the panel documents and information about the raid.</p>

            In December 2022, a United Airlines flight departing a different Hawaiian airport also dove toward the ocean in bad weather, coming 748 feet from disaster, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB concluded the pilots miscommunicated about the settings of the airplane’s flaps. The NTSB has not yet said whether it will investigate this latest incident.

<li><strong>Judge orders release or re-trial</strong>: A Missouri judge has ordered Sandra Hemme to be released or re-tried within the next 30 days, after more than 40 years in prison for a murder she was convicted of in 1980.</li>
<li><strong>New evidence of innocence</strong>: The judge found the evidence of Hemme's innocence to be "clear and convincing", citing inconsistencies in police interviews and concerns over her mental state at the time of the investigation.</li>
<li><strong>New leads implicate police officer</strong>: Hemme's legal team claims that evidence points to a Saint Joseph Police Department (SJPD) officer, Michael Holman, as the likely killer, citing his use of Patricia Jeschke's credit card, hidden earrings found in his apartment, and a truck spotted near the crime scene.</li>
<li><strong>Conflicting police interviews</strong>: Hemme's legal team argues that she was a psychiatric patient at the time of the murder and was questioned by detectives eight times over two weeks, during which her story changed with each interview. They claim she was heavily medicated and unable to hold her head up during questioning.</li>
<li><strong>Release and re-entry</strong>: If the order is fulfilled, Hemme is expected to be released from prison and may be reunited with her family, with her attorney stating she is "very happy and grateful" for the decision.</li>

<ol>
<li>Eight Israeli soldiers were killed in an explosion in southern Gaza, the deadliest attack on Israeli forces in months.</li>
<li>The attack comes amid rising tensions over ultra-Orthodox exemptions from military service, which have sparked outrage among many Israelis. The religious exemption issue has been a contentious issue in Israeli politics, with the Supreme Court having ordered an end to government subsidies for exempted ultra-Orthodox men in January.</li>
<li>The attack is likely to fuel calls for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, where hundreds of soldiers have died in recent conflicts. The Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has been criticized for not doing enough to address the issue of ultra-Orthodox exemptions.</li>
<li>The government's coalition includes powerful ultra-Orthodox parties that have been longtime partners of Netanyahu. If these parties leave the government, the country would be forced into new elections, which could spell the end of Netanyahu's leadership amid his poor poll ratings.</li>
<li>Anti-government protests have been ongoing in Tel Aviv for months, with many demonstrators demanding the immediate return of hostages and Netanyahu's resignation. The protests highlight the growing unrest and discontent among the Israeli public over issues related to military service and government policy.</li>

<p>Israel launched its campaign after Hamas and other militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage.

                                        <p>OBBÜRGEN, Switzerland (AP) — Dozens of world leaders converged on a Swiss resort Saturday to discuss how to bring peace to war-ravaged Ukraine, though any hopes of a real breakthrough were muted by the absence of Russia.</p><p>More than two years into the war, the combatants <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">remain as far apart</a></span> as they’ve ever been, with Kyiv sticking to its demands that Russia leave all Ukrainian territory it has seized and Moscow pressing on with its grinding offensive that has already taken large swaths of eastern and southern Ukraine.</p><p>Despite Russia’s absence from the conference <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/switzerland-ukraine-summit-peace-putin-russia-8fa3299cbffb7054ebb1f6201dcdd3bc">at the Bürgenstock resort</a></span> overlooking Lake Lucerne, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that one measure of the two-day event’s success was “bringing back to the world the idea that joint efforts can stop war and establish a just peace.”</p><p>Attendees faced a tricky balancing act, with many chastising Russia for breaking international law while hedging their positions to leave the door open for Moscow to join future peace talks that might bring about an end to the conflict one day.</p>
    

<p>“Here, there are representatives from Latin America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, the Pacific, North America and religious leaders,” Zelenskyy said. “Now, there is no Russia here. Why? Because if Russia was interested in peace, there would be no war.”</p>



<p>“We must decide together what a just peace means for the world and how it can be achieved in a truly lasting way,” he said. “At the first peace summit, we must determine how to achieve a just peace, so that at the second, we can already settle on a real end to the war.”</p>
    
<p>About half of the roughly 100 delegations were led by heads of state and government. Analysts said turnout would be a key indicator about how much pull Ukraine and its staunch Western backers have with the broader international community.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday sought to cast a shadow over the Swiss-Ukrainian initiative for the conference. Some countries such as India, Turkey and Saudi Arabia that have retained ties, at times lucrative, with Moscow — unlike Western powers that have sanctioned Russia over the war — were also on hand.</p>
    

<p>Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, told the conference that credible peace talks will need Russia’s participation and require “difficult compromise.”</p><p>Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, acknowledged the mistrust between Russia and Ukraine, saying “each side regards the other party’s steps (in floating proposals) as an extension of broader war effort.” </p><p>“Excellencies, I must also note that this summit could have been more results-oriented if the other party to the conflict — Russia — was present in the room,” he added. </p><p>Entering the venue, President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania, a NATO member country that has been one of the most stalwart supporters of fellow former Soviet republic Ukraine, said Russian troops must leave Ukraine, and that Moscow must be held accountable for crimes there and pay reparations for the war damage. </p>
    

<p>“Right now it seems unrealistic, but I think we have to stay united, and if international society will push the Russian Federation, everything is possible,” he told The Associated Press. “I think the situation is very clear: Ukraine has to seek territorial integrity.”</p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-ukraine-peace-summit-switzerland-biden-41cb00bba18a80ca88abf9e5b378110a">U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris</a></span>, representing the United States while President Joe Biden attended a fundraiser in California, reiterated <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-ukraine-peace-summit-switzerland-biden-41cb00bba18a80ca88abf9e5b378110a">America’s full backing</a></span> for Ukraine and announced <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/verlooking%20Lake%20Lucerne">$1.5 billion in new U.S. assistance</a></span> for an array of projects such as energy infrastructure and civilian security. </p><p>China, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-sanctions-china-defense-g7-ukraine-01aa2fcfab22a5e37c51a134e9f65c57">which backs Russia</a></span>, joined scores of countries that sat out the event.

<p>The standoff over Ukraine is steeped in security for Europe — it is the continent’s deadliest conflict since World War II — and big-power geopolitics. </p><p>U.S. intelligence officials say China has increased sales of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology to Russia that Moscow is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry to fuel its war effort.</p><p>“What is clear is that China is not here, and I presume they’re not here because Putin asked them not to come and they obliged Putin,” said Biden’s top foreign policy advisor, Jake Sullivan. “And I think that says something about where China stands with respect to Russia’s war in Ukraine. I think countries should take notice of that.”</p><p>Harris and Sullivan both acknowledged that not all participants were on the same page about an eventual peace settlement.</p>
    

<p>Russian troops who control nearly a quarter of Ukraine <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-offensive-aid-16e276766b7100485fe97b674700ac6c">have made territorial gains</a></span> in recent months. When talk of the Swiss-hosted peace summit began last summer, Ukrainian forces had recently regained large tracts of territory, notably near the southern city of Kherson and the northern city of Kharkiv.</p><p>The conference centers on three agenda items — seen as the least controversial bits of a 10-point peace “formula” laid out by Zelenskyy: Nuclear safety, including at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power plant; possible prisoner of war exchanges; and global food security.

<p>The plane was carrying American and French diplomatic couriers in June 1940 when it was downed just days before Moscow annexed the Baltic states. All nine people on board the plane were killed including the two-member Finnish crew and the seven passengers — an American diplomat, two French, two Germans, a Swede and a dual Estonian-Finnish national.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 4 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 4 of 4</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>A diving and salvage team in Estonia said this week it located well-preserved parts and debris from the Junkers Ju 52 plane operated by Finnish airline Aero, which is now Finnair. It was found off the tiny island of Keri near Estonia’s capital, Tallinn, at a depth of 70 metres (230 feet).</p>
<p>“Basically, we started from scratch. We took a whole different approach to the search,” said Kaido Peremees, spokesperson for the Estonian diving and underwater survey company Tuukritoode OU, explained the group’s success in finding the plane’s remains.</p>
<p>The downing of the civilian plane, named Kaleva, en route from Tallinn to Helsinki happened on June 14, 1940 — just three months after Finland signed a peace treaty with Moscow following the 1939-40 Winter War.</p>
<p>The news about the fate of the plane met disbelief and anger by authorities in Helsinki who were informed it was shot down by two Soviet DB-3 bombers 10 minutes after taking off from Tallinn’s Ulemiste airport.</p>
<p>“It was unique that a passenger plane was shot down during peacetime on a normal scheduled flight,” said Finnish aviation historian Carl-Fredrik Geust, who has investigated Kaleva’s case since the 1980s.</p>
<p>Finland officially kept silent for years about the details of the aircraft’s destruction, saying publicly only a “mysterious crash” had taken place over the Baltic Sea, because it did not want to provoke Moscow.</p>
<p>Though well documented by books, research and television documentaries, the 84-year-old mystery has intrigued Finns. The case is an essential part of the Nordic country’s complex World War II history and sheds light into its troubled ties with Moscow.</p>
<p>But perhaps more importantly, the downing of the plane happened at a critical time just days before Josef Stalin’s Soviet Union was preparing to annex the three Baltic states, sealing the fate of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania for the next half-century before they eventually regained independence in 1991.</p>

<h2 id="soviet-submarine">Retrieval by Soviet submarine</h2>
<p>The USSR occupied Estonia on June 17, 1940, and Kaleva’s doomed journey was the last flight out of Tallinn, though the Soviets had already started enforcing a tight transport embargo around the Estonian capital.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>American diplomat Henry W Antheil Jr, 27, was on board the plane when it went down. He was on a rushed government mission evacuating sensitive diplomatic pouches from US missions in Tallinn and Riga, Latvia, as it became clear Moscow was preparing to swallow the small Baltic nations.</p>
<p>Kaleva was carrying 227kg (500 pounds) of diplomatic post, including Antheil’s pouches and material from two French diplomatic couriers — identified as Paul Longuet and Frederic Marty.</p>
<p>Estonian fishermen and the lighthouse operator on Keri told Finnish media decades after the downing of the plane that a Soviet submarine surfaced close to Kaleva’s crash site and retrieved floating debris, including document pouches that had been collected by fishermen from the site.</p>
<p>This has led to conspiracy theories regarding the contents of the pouches and Moscow’s decision to shoot down the plane. It still remains unclear why precisely the Soviet Union decided to down a civilian Finnish passenger plane during peacetime.</p>
<p>“Lots of speculation on the plane’s cargo has been heard over the years,” Geust said. “What was the plane transporting? Many suggest Moscow wanted to prevent sensitive material and documents from exiting Estonia.”</p>
<p>But he said it could have simply been “a mistake” by the Soviet bomber pilots.</p>
<p>Various attempts to find Kaleva have been recorded since Estonia regained independence more than three decades ago. However, none of them have been successful.</p>
<p>“The wreckage is in pieces and the seabed is quite challenging with rock formations, valleys and hills. It’s very easy to miss” small parts and debris from the aircraft, Peremees said. “Techniques have, of course, evolved a lot over the time. As always, you can have good technology, but be out of luck.”</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>New video taken by underwater robots from Peremees’ company showed clear images of the three-engine Junkers’ landing gear, one of the motors and parts of the wings.</p>
<p>Jaakko Schildt, chief operations officer of Finnair, described Kaleva’s downing as “a tragic and profoundly sad event for the young airline”.</p>
<p>“Finding the wreckage of Kaleva in a way brings closure to this, even though it does not bring back the lives of our customers and crew that were lost,” Schildt said. “The interest towards locating Kaleva in the Baltic Sea speaks of the importance this tragic event has in the aviation history of our region.”</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>US regulators are investigating</strong> a SWA Boeing 737 Max 8 that experienced a potentially dangerous movement known as a Dutch roll, where the plane rocked side to side while in flight.</li>
<li><strong>Boeing titanium issue</strong>: Boeing reported that it had learned of potentially falsified documents used to certify titanium in its planes, which has sparked concerns about the safety of the planes.</li>
<li><strong>Industry-wide issue</strong>: Boeing said the titanium issue involved shipments from a limited set of suppliers, and that tests so far indicate the correct alloy was used, despite the false documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Removal of affected parts</strong>: Boeing said it will remove any affected parts from its planes before delivery and has already done so for some planes in service, and that the in-service fleet can continue to fly safely.</li>
<li><strong>Global coordination</strong>: Canadian transportation safety officials are working with foreign regulators to determine a co-ordinated approach to the titanium issue and have warned that they will not hesitate to take action if necessary.</li>
