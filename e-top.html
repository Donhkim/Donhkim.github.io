  <p>"It's astonishing to see a forecast for a major hurricane in June anywhere in the Atlantic, let alone this far east in the deep tropics. #Beryl organizing in a hurry over the warmest waters ever recorded for late June," Florida-based hurricane expert Michael Lowry posted on social media.</p><p>Beryl is the second named storm in what is predicted to be a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricanes-busy-season-warm-water-la-nina-0fe7c4cb0367e8b56ac63ff663839df0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">busy hurricane season</a>, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. Last week, Tropical Storm Alberto <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tropical-storm-alberto-several-deaths-texas-mexico/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">brought</a></span> torrential flooding to portions of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico.

<p>According to CBS News weather producer David Parkinson, Beryl is the farthest east a hurricane has formed in June, and one of only two to do so east of the Caribbean, with the other instance occurring in 1933.</p><p>Parkinson expects Beryl to remain south of Jamaica, and forecasts that any U.S. impacts are still at least eight days away. </p><p>Beryl's center is forecast to pass about 26 miles south of Barbados, said Sabu Best, director of the island's meteorological service's director.</p><p>On Saturday, Beryl was located about 720 miles east-southeast of Barbados, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph. It was moving west at 22 mph.</p>

<p>"Rapid strengthening is now forecast," the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.</p><p>Atmospheric science researcher Tomer Burg noted that Beryl was just a tropical depression with 35 mph winds on Friday.</p><p>"This means that according to preliminary data, Beryl already met rapid intensification criteria before even becoming a hurricane," he wrote on X.</p><p>Warm waters are fueling Beryl, with ocean heat content in the deep Atlantic the highest on record for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, University of Miami tropical meteorology researcher.</p><p>Beryl also is the strongest June tropical storm on record that far east in the tropical Atlantic, according to Klotzbach.</p><p>"We need to be ready," Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a public address late Friday. "You and I know when these things happen, it is better to plan for the worst and pray for the best."</p><p>She noted that thousands of people are in Barbados for the Twenty20 World Cup cricket final, with India beating South Africa on Saturday in the capital of Bridgetown. It is considered cricket's biggest event.</p>

<p>Some fans, like Shashank Musku, a 33-year-old physician who lives in Pittsburgh, were rushing to change their flights to leave before the storm.</p><p>Musku has never experienced a hurricane: "I don't plan on being in one, either."</p><p>He and his wife, who were rooting for India, found out about Beryl thanks to a taxi driver who mentioned the storm.</p><p>Meanwhile, St. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said in a public address Saturday that shelters will open Sunday evening as he urged people to prepare. He ordered officials to refuel government vehicles, and asked grocery stores and gas stations to stay open later before the storm.</p><p>"There will be such a rush …if you keep limited hours," he said as he apologized ahead of time for government interruptions on radio stations with storm updates. "Cricket lovers have to bear with us that we'll have to give information ... this is life and death."</p><p>Beryl is the second named storm in what is predicted to be a busy hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. Earlier this month, Tropical Storm Alberto came ashore in northeast Mexico with heavy rains that resulted in four deaths.</p><p>Lowry noted that only five named storms on record have formed in the tropical Atlantic east of the Caribbean. Of those, only one hurricane of record has formed east of the Caribbean in June.</p>

<p>Mark Spence, manager of a hostel in Barbados, said in a phone interview that he was calm about the approaching storm.</p><p>"It's the season. You can get a storm any time," he said. "I'm always prepared. I always have enough food in my house."</p><p>Beryl is expected to drop up to six inches of rain in Barbados and nearby islands, and a high surf warning of waves up to 13 feet was in effect. A storm surge of up to seven feet is also forecast.</p><p>The storm is approaching the southeast Caribbean just days after the twin-island nation of Trinidad and Tobago reported major flooding in the capital, Port-of-Spain, as a result of an unrelated weather event.</p><p>Meanwhile, a no-name storm earlier this June dumped more than 20 inches of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.</p><p>According to the National Hurricane Center, the season's first hurricane usually forms in early to mid-August, which makes Beryl unusual for reaching hurricane strength.

Biden’s meandering answers and struggles to respond to Trump prompted The New York Times editorial board to declare Friday that he should exit the race and that staying in would be a “reckless gamble.”</p>
    

<p>Biden and his wife, Jill, attended an afternoon campaign event in East Hampton, New York, the Long Island beach town where the real estate firm Zillow prices the median home at $1.9 million.

<p>The couple then went to a second event in East Hampton at the home of investor Barry Rosenstein, whose wife, Lizanne, said the president was “a role model for what it is to get knocked down over and over and over again and get up.”</p>

<ol>
<li>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has appealed for more long-range weapons and air defenses after a Russian missile attack killed 7 people, including 2 children, and injured 31 others in the town of Vilniansk, near Zaporizhzhia.</li>
<li>The Russian attack also killed at least 11 civilians and injured 37 others in missile attacks across Ukraine on Saturday, according to Reuters.</li>
<li>Zelensky emphasized the need for Ukraine to "overcome" the Russian strikes, citing the importance of destroying Russian missile launchers, striking with real long-range capability, and increasing the number of modern air defense systems.</li>
<li>Western allies have already supplied Ukraine with long-range weapons, including Scalp missiles from France, Storm Shadow from the UK, and ATACMS from the US, as well as US-made Patriot air defense systems.</li>
<li>Despite receiving support from Western allies, Ukraine has continued to experience losses of life and territorial gains by Russia due to delays in receiving air defense systems and long-range missiles, which Zelensky has attributed to shortages of ammunition and air defense missiles.</li>

<li>A 36-year-old woman in North Carolina has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and child abuse in connection with the death of her 8-year-old daughter, who was found unresponsive in a hot car.</li>
<li>The girl was left in the car by her mother, who said she went to work and forgot to take her daughter with her. The mother told police she had kept the air running in the car, but the child may have turned it off because she was cold.</li>
<li>The child was found in critical condition and was transported to a hospital, where she later died from a heat-related medical emergency. The mother was charged after the child's death.</li>
<li>The mother is being held in jail on a $250,000 bond and has been appointed a public defender. Her next scheduled court hearing is on July 17.</li>
<li>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommends leaving cars locked when no one is inside and never leaving a child alone in a car to prevent hot car deaths. This is not the first incident of a child dying in a hot car in the United States; since 1998, there have been nearly 1,000 such deaths.</li>

The child's mother was charged with involuntary manslaughter and child abuse by willful act causing serious injury.</p><p>The 36-year-old woman is being held in the Mecklenburg County Jail on a $250,000 bond, jail records show.</p><p>The woman told police she left her daughter in the car while she went to work, according to an arrest affidavit.

That's when she discovered the child lying on the backseat floorboard unresponsive.</p><p>Using a hammer, police said the woman busted the back window to reach her daughter. She then drove to the hospital but stopped at a nearby business to get help, authorities said.

Several wonder why more officers have not been charged for waiting to go into the classroom, where some victims lay dying or begging for assistance, to help bring a quicker end to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/uvalde-school-shooting">one of the worst school shootings</a></span> in U.S. history.</p><p>Former Uvalde schools police Chief Pete Arredondo and former Officer Adrian Gonzales were indicted on June 26 by a Uvalde County grand jury on multiple counts of child endangerment and abandonment over their actions and failure to immediately confront the shooter. They were among the first of nearly 400 federal, state and local officers who converged on the school that day.</p>
    

<p>“I want every single person who was in the hallway charged for failure to protect the most innocent,” said Velma Duran, whose sister Irma Garcia was one of the teachers killed. “My sister put her body in front of those children to protect them, something they could have done. They had the means and the tools to do it. My sister had her body.”</p>



<p>Uvalde County District Attorney Christina Mitchell has not said if any other officers will be charged or if the grand jury’s work is done.</p>
    
<p>Here are some things to know about the criminal investigation into the police response:</p><h2>The Shooting</h2><p>The gunman stormed into the school on May 24, 2022 and killed his victims in two classrooms. </p><p>More than 370 officers responded but waited more than 70 minutes to confront the shooter, even as he could be heard firing an AR-15-style rifle. </p>
    

<p>Terrified students inside the classrooms called 911 as agonized parents begged for intervention by officers, some of whom could hear shots being fired while they stood in a hallway. A tactical team of officers eventually went into the classroom and killed the shooter.</p><p>Scathing <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/shootings-texas-education-violence-school-31aa135678f8118ed96d893ea77cf8ea">state</a></span> and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/uvalde-school-shooting-justice-department-report-police-16b59efa5c5015d685d917c3f0f26256">federal</a></span> investigative reports on the police response have catalogued “cascading failures” in training, communication, leadership and technology problems.</p><h2>The Charges</h2><p>The <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24781964-arredondo-indictment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indictment against Arredondo</a></span>, who was the on-site commander at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/uvalde-school-shooting">the shooting</a></span>, accused the chief of delaying the police response despite hearing shots fired and being notified that injured children were in the classrooms and a teacher had been shot. </p><p>Arredondo called for a SWAT team, ordered the initial responding officers to leave the building and attempted to negotiate with the 18-year-old gunman, the indictment said. The grand jury said it considered his actions criminal negligence. </p><p>Gonzales was accused of abandoning his training and not confronting the shooter, even after hearing gunshots as he stood in a hallway. </p><p>All the charges are state jail felonies that carry up to two years in jail if convicted.</p>
    

<p>Arredondo said in a 2022 interview with the Texas Tribune that he tried to “eliminate any threats, and protect the students and staff.” Gonzalez’s lawyer on Friday called the charges “unprecedented in the state of Texas” and said the officer believes he did not break any laws or school district policy.</p><p>The first U.S. law enforcement officer ever tried for allegedly failing to act during an on-campus shooting was a campus sheriff’s deputy in Florida who didn’t go into the classroom building and confront the perpetrator of the 2018 Parkland massacre. The deputy, who was fired, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/deputy-scot-peterson-parkland-school-shooting-8f012afbc525f77fbb9f9015a65593ca">was acquitted</a></span> of felony neglect last year. A lawsuit by the victims’ families and survivors is pending.</p><h2>The Lawsuits</h2><p>The families are pursing accountability from authorities in other state and federal courts. Several have filed multiple civil lawsuits.</p><p>Two days before the two-year anniversary of the shooting, the families of 19 victims filed a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/uvalde-mass-shooting-robb-elementary-38351326b48d7eb9d020b42f24b53cfe">$500 million lawsuit</a></span> against nearly 100 state police officers who were part of the botched response. The lawsuit accuses the troopers of not following their active shooter training and not confronting the shooter. The highest ranking Department of Public Safety official named as a defendant is South Texas Regional Director Victor Escalon.</p>
    

<p>The same families also reached a $2 million settlement with the city under which city leaders promised higher standards for hiring and training local police.</p><p>On May 24, a group of families <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/uvalde-shooting-elementary-anniversary-texas-a20e7fefa9d66058a8ff6611fa808df8">sued Meta Platforms</a></span>, which owns Instagram, and the maker of the video game Call of Duty over claims the companies bear responsibility for the weapons used by the teenage gunman. </p><p>They also filed another lawsuit against gun maker Daniel Defense, which made the AR-style rifle used by the gunman.</p>

The party came out on top in the <a class="internal-link" href="/en/eu-elections-2024/t-68049956">European Parliament elections</a> in early June, with almost twice as many votes as the centrist Renaissance party headed by President Emmanuel Macron — a crushing loss that prompted Macron to call the<a class="internal-link" href="/en/eu-elections-2024-france-macron/a-69325868"> snap legislative elections</a>.</p>

<p>If the latest polls prove true, what would this shift in power mean for Macron's ability to govern in Paris? DW answers the most pressing questions below.</p>

<h2>Who will Macron appoint as prime minister?</h2>

<p>The French constitution, adopted in 1958, holds no restrictions on the president when it come to selecting and appointing the prime minister. However, he must take into account the majority in parliament.</p>

<p>If the prime minister does not have parliamentary support, then the National Assembly — the more powerful of France's two houses of parliament — would hold a vote of no confidence. The government would then have to submit its resignation to the president.</p>

<p>If the National Rally wins a majority of seats in the National Assembly, <a class="internal-link" href="/en/emmanuel-macron/t-38774225">Macron</a> would have to offer 28-year-old party leader Jordan Bardella the post of prime minister.</p>

<p>Macron has no alternative, said political scientist Hans Stark from the Sorbonne University in Paris. "Macron is so weakened. He doesn't have much room for maneuver," he told DW.</p>

<p>Bardella has named an absolute majority of parliamentary seats as a condition for assuming government responsibility, because without it he would be unable to implement his political program.</p>

<p>Should Bardella be appointed prime minister, <a class="internal-link" href="/en/france/t-19065412">France</a> would enter into what it calls a "cohabitation" for the fourth time in its modern history.</p>

<h2>How does cohabitation work?</h2>

<p>When the president and prime minister come from different political camps, executive power in France is divided. Each much then work together for the good of the country in a so-called "cohabitation."</p>

<p>The first such arrangement was formed in 1986 under Socialist President Francois Mitterrand. After losing parliamentary elections, Mitterrand appointed the conservative Gaullist Jacques Chirac as prime minister, followed by his party colleague Edouard Balladur in 1993.</p>

<p>From 1997 to 2002, Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin governed under President Chirac.</p>

<figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"><figcaption class="img-caption">Jospin (left) and Chirac (right) shared power from 1997 to 2002<small class="copyright">Image: Thomas Koehler/photothek/picture alliance</small></figcaption></figure>

<p>Dividing power between two different political parties predictably leads to friction and complicated decision-making processes.</p>

<p>The constitution does not explicitly provide for cohabitation, so the success of governing via this arrangement hinges on how well the prime minister and president work together.</p>

<h2>How powerful can a cohabitation government be?</h2>

<p>In France, the president typically handles national security and foreign policy, while the prime minister takes care of domestic affairs.</p>

<p>But under a cohabitation, presidential functions are temporarily transferred to the prime minister. This means Macron would no longer be setting the broad policy lines, and would have to share the tasks of international relations with the government.</p>

<p>Speaking shortly before the first round of voting, National Rally parliamentary party leader <a class="internal-link" href="/en/marine-le-pen/t-18949724">Marine Le Pen</a> explained how her party viewed the division of power: "Commander-in-chief of the armed forces is an honorary title for the president, because the prime minister holds the reins."</p>

<p>A National Rally government would also have far-reaching room to maneuver on domestic policy, but these issues can also lead to power struggles between the president and prime minister, as the first cohabitation under Mitterrand proved in 1986.</p>

<p>On July 14, Mitterrand publicly disavowed his prime minister, announcing he would not sign Chirac's government decrees on the reprivatization of 65 nationalized banks, insurance companies and industrial enterprises.</p>

<p>And while no government decree can come into force without the president's signature, such a refusal can only delay such a project, not stop it.</p>

<h2>How well would Macron and Bardella work together?</h2>

<p>Macron has rejected parts of the National Rally's program, meaning the party could possibly try "to drive Macron into a corner until he finally resigns," Stark predicted.</p>

<p>However, a total blockade of the work of a National Rally government would also be unthinkable, which means Macron and Bardella would eventually have to cooperate.</p>

<figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"><figcaption class="img-caption">As National Rally party leader, Jordan Bardella is poised to take the role of prime minister — should the far right win the elections<small class="copyright">Image: Eliot Blondet/abaca/picture alliance</small></figcaption></figure>

<p>Macron would have to justify any rejection of his new government's plans, which could mean he would then call on the Constitutional Council more frequently to have laws checked for constitutional compatibility before they are publicly announced. Some National Rally projects could already fail this hurdle.</p>

<h2>What happens if the National Rally doesn't win a majority?</h2>

<p>Stark assumes Bardella will make good on his announcement, and the National Rally will refrain from taking over the government if the party falls short of an absolute majority.</p>

<p>If no other camp is able to form a majority, Paris would be in a stalemate. The president would not be able to simply dissolve parliament again, as the constitution has outlined a one-year waiting period.</p>

<p>In the parliament dissolved by Macron in early June, his coalition parties only had a relative majority — they held the most seats, but not more than half the votes cast. The government had therefore repeatedly invoked article 49.3 of the French constitution to ram through laws it saw as important.</p>

<figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"><figcaption class="img-caption">Will there be a clear majority in the next National Assembly?<small class="copyright">Image: Ludovic Marin/AFP/dpa/picture alliance</small></figcaption></figure>

<p>This article allows the government to pass a law without a vote in the National Assembly unless a motion of no confidence is passed within 24 hours.</p>

<p>But article 49.3 is highly controversial, and a new cohabitation government would likely be reluctant to use it.</p>

<h2>What would break a National Assembly deadlock?</h2>

<p>The various parties have so far held back on how they would react to a National Assembly without a majority.</p>

<p>Le Pen of the National Rally has previously said she would be in favor of an early presidential election, should the parliamentary elections end without a clear winner. But Macron could still not be forced to resign. He has a presidential mandate until 2027, and has said he will not step down until then. There is no clear scenario for such a deadlock, and much will depend on the political dynamics after the election.</p>

<p>In principle, the appointment of a non-partisan government of experts would also be a possibility. But there is no historical model for this option.</p>

<p>Macron could also activate article 16 of the French constitution, which gives the president extraordinary powers in crisis situations to ensure the continuity of the state. He could then enact laws and issue decrees without parliamentary approval. However, France expert Hans Stark doesn't believe article 16 is a real option for the president.</p>

<p>"I don't see how he could keep this up for three years until the next presidential election," said Stark. "That would basically mean that we would be in permanent crisis mode."</p>

<p><strong>Returning capital to shareholders</strong> Nvidia has already returned capital to shareholders, including a recent announcement in August.

<p>Ben Reitzes, a managing director and head of technology research at Melius Research, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/26/expect-nvidia-to-deliver-more-cash-to-shareholders-says-melius-ben-reitzes.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/26/expect-nvidia-to-deliver-more-cash-to-shareholders-says-melius-ben-reitzes.html" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/26/expect-nvidia-to-deliver-more-cash-to-shareholders-says-melius-ben-reitzes.html" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">told CNBC on Wednesday</a> that Jensen Huang’s Nvidia has mastered a “full stack” approach with its hardware and software, giving it a key advantage in AI.</p>



<p>“What they did is they built a computing language and an ecosystem that allows you to monetize AI, and obviously they’re killing it,” he said. </p>



<p>Reitzes has a price target of $160 on Nvidia stock, implying a 30% gain from Friday’s closing price. Despite an <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/25/nvidia-jensen-huang-shares-market-cap-value-shareholder-meeting/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/25/nvidia-jensen-huang-shares-market-cap-value-shareholder-meeting/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/06/25/nvidia-jensen-huang-shares-market-cap-value-shareholder-meeting/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">ongoing selloff</a> that began earlier this month, shares have soared 150% so far this year after more than tripling in 2023. Among the Magnificent 7 stocks that he covers, Nvidia has the most upside ahead, he added.</p>



<p>Another big advantage Nvidia has over rivals is its annual cadence of innovating new products, Reitzes said. That means developers and customers will know where Nvidia is headed and can a budget for upgrades accordingly. </p><p></p>



<p>“And they’re running 150 miles an hour while everyone else is running 100. It’s going to be hard to catch these guys,” he said.</p>



<p>Given Nvidia’s edge in the booming AI space, Melius Research projects the company will generate $270 billion in cash over the next three years, potentially setting the stage for huge shareholder returns. </p>



<p>Management may not be eager to tout the possibility of stock buybacks as those are often associated with older companies, Reitzes said. But in his view, it’s obvious.</p>



<p>“No one’s talking about it, and when you do the model we do, it’s a cash gusher,” he said. “And there’s nothing they can do. This government’s not going to let them buy anything big. They can’t invest that much in R&amp;D. It’s just not possible. So we gotta get it as shareholders.” </p>



<p>To be sure, Nvidia has been returning capital to shareholders. In August, it announced a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidias-frankfurt-shares-surge-stellar-results-seen-keeping-ai-rally-alive-2023-08-24/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidias-frankfurt-shares-surge-stellar-results-seen-keeping-ai-rally-alive-2023-08-24/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidias-frankfurt-shares-surge-stellar-results-seen-keeping-ai-rally-alive-2023-08-24/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">$25 billion repurchase program</a>. And last month, Nvidia boosted its quarterly cash dividend by 150% from $0.04 per share to $0.10, equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis.</p><p></p>



<p>Nvidia declined to comment about the possibility of more stock buybacks.</p>



<p>For his part, Reitzes was quick to point out that any future buybacks wouldn’t imply that Nvidia has stopped growing. “It’s not an insult to buy back stocks if you have nothing else to do.”</p>



<p>Nvidia’s recent financials show that its ability to generate cash is accelerating. In the <a href="https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2024/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2024/" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2024/" class="sc-80b85506-0 pUpMT">fiscal year</a> that ended in January, Nvidia’s net cash provided by operating activities soared to $28.1 billion from $5.6 billion in the prior year.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>
