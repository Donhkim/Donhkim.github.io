    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Definition of a heat wave</strong>: A heat wave is a prolonged period of abnormally hot weather, typically lasting several days or even weeks, with temperatures significantly above the average high temperature for a given region.</li>
<li><strong>Causes of heat waves</strong>: Heat waves occur when a high-pressure system develops over a region, leading to a lack of cloud cover and precipitation, and causing temperatures to rise. This can happen when there is a prolonged period of temperature inversions, where warm air is trapped near the surface, leading to the formation of a "heat dome".</li>
<li><strong>Health risks associated with heat waves</strong>: Heat waves can have serious health consequences, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and people with pre-existing medical conditions. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures can lead to heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.</li>
<li><strong>Precautions to take during a heat wave</strong>: To stay safe during a heat wave, it is recommended to drink plenty of water, stay in air-conditioned spaces, avoid strenuous outdoor activities, and take breaks in shaded areas. Schools and businesses may also need to take precautions, such as adjusting schedules or closing temporarily.</li>
<li><strong>Signs of heat-related illnesses</strong>: It is important to recognize the signs of heat-related illnesses, which include dizziness, headache, nausea, and confusion. If you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, it is essential to seek medical attention immediately to prevent serious complications or even death.</li>

                                        <p>KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Rescuers searched the rubble of Ukraine’s biggest children’s hospital on Tuesday for more dead and wounded, a day after authorities say a Russian missile <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-attack-33aecd50cf252ff6184c0c14f90588b5">leveled a wing of the Kyiv facility</a></span> during a massive daytime barrage that killed at least 42 people throughout the country.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the social platform X that 64 people were hospitalized in the capital, in addition to 28 in Kryvyi Rih and six in Dnipro — both cities in central Ukraine. </p><p>It was Russia’s heaviest bombardment of Kyiv in almost four months and one of the deadliest of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">the war</a></span>, hitting seven of the capital’s 10 districts, according to Ukrainian officials. The strike on the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital, which interrupted open-heart surgery and forced young cancer patients to take their treatments outdoors, drew international condemnation.</p>
    

<p>The 10-story hospital, Ukraine’s largest medical facility for children, was caring for 627 patients at the time of the attack, according to the country’s health minister.</p><p>“The building where we conducted dialysis for children with kidney failure or acute intoxication is ruined entirely,” the hospital’s director general, Volodymyr Zhovnir, told reporters, estimating the overall damage at $2.5 million.</p>



<p>Danielle Bell, the head of a United Nations team tracking human rights violations in Ukraine, said at least two people were killed at the hospital and about 50 were injured, including seven children. There would have been a lot more casualties if patients hadn’t been taken to a bunker when air raid sirens first sounded, she added.</p>
    
<p>Zhovnir said one of the two people killed at the hospital was a female doctor who had taken children to the shelter before going back to check whether anyone had been left behind.</p><p>Pediatric surgeon Oleh Holubchenko told The Associated Press he was operating on a baby with congenital face defects and that he and his team decided to continue despite the blast of air sirens. “We couldn’t stop halfway through,” he said. </p>
    

<p>The missile strike’s shock wave sent him hurtling across the operating theater. Shrapnel caused him minor injuries and pierced the infant’s ventilator. The baby, still with an open wound, had to be transported to another Kyiv hospital, where they finished the surgery.</p><p>Authorities were working to restore the hospital’s power and water supply as Kyiv city administrators declared Tuesday an official day of mourning. Entertainment events were prohibited and flags were lowered in the capital.</p><p>U.N. Security Council members confronted Russia over the hospital strike, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-strike-hospital-security-council-20ce0a8e1f69b8040f47522ca039bd52">condemning Moscow</a></span> during an emergency meeting Tuesday chaired by the Russian ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia. </p><p>Russia denied responsibility, insisting it doesn’t attack civilian targets in Ukraine despite abundant evidence to the contrary, including AP reporting. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov pointed to a Russian Defense Ministry statement that blamed the hospital strike on a Ukrainian air defense missile.</p><p>Nebenzia repeated that position during the Security Council meeting, saying: “If this had been a Russian strike, there would have been nothing left of the building,”</p>
    

<p>Bell, the head of the U.N. team, dismissed the Russian argument. She said an assessment of video footage and findings on site indicated the hospital “took a direct hit, rather than receiving damage due to an intercepted weapons system.”</p><p>The hospital likely was struck by a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile, Bell said.

<p>Russia used a large number of various types of missiles Monday that, arriving together, made it hard for Ukrainian air defenses to intercept them, he said.</p><p>“They have been experimenting with different kinds of rockets since 2023 to find the perfect combination to break through our air defense algorithms,” Kovalenko told the AP.</p><p>Russian forces have also programmed missiles to maneuver mid-air, according to Kovalenko, who added that during Monday’s attack, a missile first appeared to be heading farther west before it swerved back to strike Kyiv.</p><p>The bodies of three more people were found Tuesday under the rubble of a residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv, officials said, bringing the death toll in the single building to 10.</p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Colorado State University's latest outlook</strong>: The university's tropical meteorology project team has issued a new outlook for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, forecasting 25 storms, 12 of which will become hurricanes, and 6 of which will reach Category 3 status or stronger.</li>
<li><strong>Increased activity</strong>: The outlook is 2 named storms and 1 hurricane more active than previously expected, with an increase of 20 Accumulated Cyclone Energy units, from 210 to 230.</li>
<li><strong>Above-average season</strong>: The forecast is well above the 30-year average tally for both hurricanes and storms, and significantly higher than the 2023 season, which saw 20 storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 Category 3-plus hurricanes.</li>
<li><strong>Early-season activity</strong>: The formation of Hurricane Beryl early in the season could be a sign that the deep tropics are ready to produce storms earlier than usual, and its unusual longevity and intensity could be a harbinger of a more active season.</li>
<li><strong>Season ahead of schedule</strong>: With Beryl (first hurricane) and Chris (third named storm) already in the record books, the season is now weeks ahead of schedule, with many more storms expected to form in the coming weeks and months.</li>

Storms in the deep tropics tend to develop during the heart of hurricane season (August to October), so Beryl's formation and rapid intensification east of the Lesser Antilles could be a signal that this part of the Atlantic is ready much earlier than usual. </p><p class="">S​econd, as <a href="https://twitter.com/philklotzbach" target="_blank" rel="" class="">CSU meteorologist Phil Klotzbach</a> notes, Beryl lasted for a very long time and was quite potent: "Hurricane Beryl was an extremely impressive hurricane, generating the most ACE of any individual hurricane activity prior to 1 August on record."</p><p class="">Seasons with storms of this caliber were all above-average and had an average of 10 hurricanes, according to Klotzbach. </p><p class=""><strong class="">S​eason well ahead of schedule already: </strong>With Beryl (first hurricane) and Chris (third named storm) already in the record books, we're now weeks ahead of schedule. The average third tropical storm typically forms on August 3, followed by the fourth tropical storm on August 15. The first hurricane typically forms on August 11, followed by the second hurricane on August 26.  </p><p class="">T​he two main drivers of an active season remain the same, both with increasing confidence: </p><p class=""><strong class="">1. T​he Atlantic's record warmth:</strong> Much of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and tropical Atlantic remain much warmer than average as we head through the summer. If other factors are equal, the deeper and warmer ocean water is, the stronger a hurricane can become.</p><p class="">S​ea surface temperatures remain at record levels across the basin, <a href="https://twitter.com/BMcNoldy/status/1809205990837178580" target="_blank" rel="" class="">according to Brian McNoldy</a>. </p><p class="">T​his absurd warmth in the deep tropics helped lead Beryl to become such an early Cabo Verde storm and the earliest Category 5 on record in the Caribbean. </p><div><p class="">T​hese warm waters are the primary driver for the higher-end seasonal outlooks. </p></div><p class=""><strong class="">2. La Niña expected by the peak of this season:</strong> N​OAA's Climate Prediction Center is <a href="https://iri.columbia.edu/our-expertise/climate/forecasts/enso/current/?enso_tab=enso-quicklook" target="_blank" rel="" class="">forecasting</a> neutral conditions in the equatorial eastern Pacific to cool and become La Niña by the heart of this hurricane season, with a greater than 70% chance of developing.</p><p class="">This matters because it's one of the strongest influences on hurricane season activity.</p><p class="">I​n general, La Niña Atlantic hurricane seasons have less wind shear that can otherwise rip storms apart, and rising, unstable air that is more conducive for thunderstorms, the building blocks of tropical storms and hurricanes.</p><p class="">S​o this means instead of El Niño acting as a gentle brake on hurricane season, La Niña could instead step on the gas pedal.</p><div><div><figure id="int-image-wxn4" class="InternalImage--imageWrapper--3ICk-"><figcaption><div class="InternalImage--figcaption--3jgly"><p class="InternalImage--imgControls--D4b-G"></p><p class="InternalImage--description--1-m9p">Typical impacts of La Niña on both the Eastern Pacific and Atlantic hurricane seasons.</p><span class="InternalImage--credit--i4ior">(NOAA/Climate.gov)</span></div></figcaption></figure></div></div><p class=""><strong class="">W​e could "run out of names"</strong>: This outlook of 25 storms implies we could exhaust the 2024 list of hurricane names.</p><p class="">A​ committee of the World Meteorological Organization maintains lists of names for tropical cyclones around the world. Each year, there's a list of 21 Atlantic Basin names that repeat every six years, unless one or more of them is so deadly and/or destructive that its name is <a href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/retired-atlantic-hurricane-names" rel="" target="_blank" class="">retired</a>. </p><p class="">S​o if we use up all names through William this year, <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/aboutnames_pronounce_atlc_alt.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" class="">a supplemental names list</a> will be tapped, beginning with Adria.</p><p class="">O​nly two other Atlantic hurricane seasons in which names have been used have pushed beyond 21 storms. </p><p class="">In 2005 (28 storms) and 2020 (30), an alternate list of Greek alphabet letters was used for additional storms beyond the 21st storm. But use of the Greek alphabet was retired in 2021 due to confusion among Greek letters that sound similar (such as Zeta, Eta, Theta), especially if they were active at the same time.</p><p class="">W​e've already used the first three names on the list. </p><p class=""><strong class="">M​ORE ON WEATHER.COM:</strong></p><p class=""><strong class="">-​ </strong><a href="https://weather.com/safety/hurricane/news/2024-06-27-hurricane-season-july-climatology" rel="" target="_blank" class=""><strong class="">Things To Expect From Hurricane Season In July</strong></a></p><p class=""><strong class="">-​ </strong><a href="https://weather.com/news/weather/news/2024-03-01-what-is-la-nina" rel="" target="_blank" class=""><strong class="">What Is La Niña?</strong></a></p><p class=""><strong class="">-​ </strong><a href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2024-03-06-hurricane-season-el-nino-to-la-nina" rel="" target="_blank" class=""><strong class="">From Strong El Niño To La Niña: How Past Seasons Have Turned Out</strong></a></p><p class=""><strong class="">-​ </strong><a href="https://www.weather.com/safety/hurricane/news/2024-05-31-hurricane-forecast-path-cone-facts-myths" rel="" target="_blank" class=""><strong class="">What The Cone of Uncertainty Means, And What It Doesn't</strong></a></p>

"We need to ensure that we are holding every single individual accountable for the pain and trauma and the torment that they have caused in this city."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Hundreds of other shootings also occurred over the holiday weekend across the U.S., according to gun-control group Moms Demand Action and the Gun Violence Archive.

Fox added that following the Fourth of July, the second-most violent day is July 5 because "some of the July Fourth parties spill over past midnight into July 5."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Experts and officials have also noted that gun violence continues to erupt during celebratory events and holidays across the U.S. Over the Father's Day weekend, USA TODAY previously reported that at least 73 people were killed and 308 were injured in shootings.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">According to Moms Demand Action, there were nearly 300 shootings nationally during Memorial Day weekend and at least 248 shootings over the Easter weekend.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><em>Contributing: N'dea Yancey-Bragg, USA TODAY</em></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"></p><p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"></p></div></div>

Clemishire said Morris told her to come see him in his room before bed, and she was the type of girl who listened to instructions from trusted adults.</p><p>But 25 years later, when Clemishire hired an attorney and threatened to sue Morris, accusing him of repeatedly molesting her as a child, a lawyer representing Morris responded by blaming Clemishire for what happened to her, according to 2007 correspondence obtained by NBC News.</p><p>“It was your client,” wrote lawyer J. Shelby Sharpe, referring to Clemishire at age 12, “who initiated inappropriate behavior by coming into my client’s bedroom and getting in bed with him, which my client should not have allowed to happen.”</p><p><strong><em>For more on this story, watch NBC’s “Nightly News with Lester Holt” tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT.</em></strong></p><p>The Feb. 6, 2007, letter was one in a series of exchanges that year between Sharpe and <span class="caas-xray-inline-tooltip wafer-tooltip has-tooltip-click has-wafer-click wafer-tooltip-done wafer-loader-success" data-wf-template-id="caas-xray-inline-wafer-tooltip-template-with-close-f18a9ea4-60eb-3531-978c-03cf31eec674" data-wf-local-storage-key="xray-inline-tooltip" data-wf-tooltip-text="Get info without &lt;br/&gt; leaving the page." data-wf-tooltip-position="bottom" data-wf-reset-every="90"><span class="caas-xray-inline caas-xray-entity caas-xray-pill rapid-nonanchor-lt" data-entity-id="Gentner_Drummond" data-ylk="cid:Gentner_Drummond;pos:1;elmt:wiki;sec:pill-inline-entity;elm:pill-inline-text;itc:1;cat:OfficeHolder;" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="dialog"><a href="https://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Gentner%20Drummond" data-i13n="cid:Gentner_Drummond;pos:1;elmt:wiki;sec:pill-inline-entity;elm:pill-inline-text;itc:1;cat:OfficeHolder;" tabindex="-1" data-ylk="slk:Gentner Drummond;cid:Gentner_Drummond;pos:1;elmt:wiki;sec:pill-inline-entity;elm:pill-inline-text;itc:1;cat:OfficeHolder;" class="link " data-rapid_p="13">Gentner Drummond</a></span></span>, a lawyer who represented Clemishire at the time.

He denied knowing at the time that Clemishire had been a child when Morris began engaging in sexual behavior with her.

Swicegood said that before Clemishire went public with her story last month, “the current Elders did not have all the facts.”</p><p>While the internal review is underway, four Gateway officials have agreed to take leaves of absence from the board of elders, <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://gatewaypeople.com/statement-to-the-congregation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the church announced last month;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="21">the church announced last month</a>.

(Courtesy Cindy Clemishire)</figcaption></p></figure><p>Clemishire said she struggled for years with “profound confusion” over what Morris did, believing for nearly two decades that she was to blame. She said Morris molested her more than 100 times over 4½ years. After the first encounter on Christmas in 1982, Clemishire said, “it just progressed to a lot of kissing and touching and inserting fingers into my body.” She said Morris pressured her to have intercourse, but she refused. Morris has acknowledged “kissing and petting” and argued that the number of incidents was a fraction of what Clemishire alleges.</p><p>Clemishire said that in the mid-2000s, after years of counseling and after having watched a television interview about grooming and sex abuse, she realized what happened to her was a crime.</p><p>She <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/robert-morris-gateway-church-sex-abuse-emails-rcna158349" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:began writing to Morris;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="23">began writing to Morris</a> at his Gateway Church email address in 2005, asking that he compensate her for the trauma she says he inflicted. In 2007, she hired Drummond to make a formal demand, according to documents provided to NBC News by Boz Tchividjian, the lawyer she hired last month.</p><p>On Jan. 30, 2007, Drummond wrote to Sharpe on behalf of Clemishire, using her legal name at the time, Cindy Clemishire McCaleb. Drummond detailed the sexual abuse Clemishire says she suffered from 1982 to 1987 and how Morris “led her to believe that they were having a special relationship that had to remain secret.”</p><p>“Morris convinced Ms. McCaleb that she was responsible for what he did to her,” Drummond wrote, “and he convinced her that she was the offender.”</p><p>Drummond attached a draft of a lawsuit he said Clemishire planned to file if Morris failed to respond within 15 days.</p><p>Sharpe responded a week later, on Feb. 6, 2007, with his letter casting Clemishire as the one who initiated sexual contact with Morris.</p><p>Sharpe also claimed in the letter that Clemishire “acted inappropriately with two other men who stayed in her home between 1982 and 1987,” when she was between the ages of 12 and 17. And Sharpe wrote that Clemishire had “confessed her conduct” to Glenda Faulkner, a woman who attended Shady Grove Church near Fort Worth, Texas, in the 1980s, when Morris was a pastor there.</p><p>Faulkner, now Glenda Faulkner-Woodliff — a licensed counselor who later attended Gateway — did not respond to messages requesting comment.</p><p>In an interview, Clemishire disputed Sharpe’s characterizations. She said two other men touched her inappropriately at her home when she was a child, but she said she did not initiate those interactions. In one instance, Clemishire said, it was Morris who instructed her, when she was 13, to go into a bedroom at her childhood home where another traveling evangelist was staying. Once she was inside, she said, the man, whom she declined to name, began to kiss her but eventually pulled away and told her she was too young.</p><p>In another instance, in 1986, Clemishire said, another man who was staying with her family climbed on top of her while she was sleeping on a sofa bed next to his 3-year-old daughter. She believed he planned to rape her, but she said the man suddenly got off of her.</p><p>“I really think God intervened,” Clemishire said. “God made him feel like someone was walking by, and he just rolled off of me and left.”</p><p>It was that incident, Clemishire said, that eventually led her to confide in Faulkner-Woodliff, also a family friend. Faulkner-Woodliff asked whether anyone else had ever touched her that way, Clemishire said. Clemishire then reluctantly explained what Morris had done to her, she said. Afterward, Clemishire said, Faulkner-Woodliff insisted that she tell her parents.</p><p>That’s how, in March 1987, her father learned that Morris had been sexually abusing her, Clemishire said. She said her father was enraged and contacted Olen Griffing, the senior pastor at Shady Grove Church, to demand that Morris step out of ministry.</p><p>Clemishire remembers getting a call from Morris’ wife, Debbie, a few days later.</p><p>Debbie told her, “I forgive you,” she said.</p><p>“I’ll never forget that,” Clemishire said. “They wanted me to believe that I — me, the child — was responsible for what happened. And they’ve never stopped trying to make me believe that.”</p><p>Griffing, now in his 80s, later served as a pastor and elder under Morris at Gateway Church. He did not respond to messages.</p><p>Clemishire’s older sister was living with her family in 1987 and corroborated Clemishire’s account of conversations that took place that year among her sister, her parents, Faulkner-Woodliff, Griffing and the Morris family.</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-3">Gateway Church in Southlake, Texas on July 2, 2024. (Nitashia Johnson for NBC News)</figcaption></p></figure><p>In the years since then, Morris has repeatedly told a sanitized and, at times, distorted version of the story. He has spoken often from the pulpit of struggling with sexual immorality and having to step out of ministry in 1987. But in public tellings, he says sinful pride was the reason, omitting mention of his years of sexual contact with a child.</p><p>In a sermon at Gateway <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://youtu.be/qaFPdCRlTzI?si=8EoAEkysIVRiQ0sv&amp;t=1610" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:on June 10, 2017;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="25">on June 10, 2017</a>, in a message titled “The Principle of Honesty,” Morris described going through a “restoration process” about seven years into his marriage — which would have been in 1987. Morris said God told him he needed to confess “everything that I’ve ever done” to two people: Griffing, the former Shady Grove senior pastor, and his wife, Debbie.</p><p>He said he told Debbie, “I need to tell you who you really married.”</p><p>The confession took several hours, Morris said in the 2017 sermon, but he did not mention specific sins from the pulpit.</p><p>“I’ll never forget what she said,” Morris said, setting up a line that drew laughter from the Gateway congregation. “She said, ‘Robert, I knew you were bad when I married you.

<li>The Fed holds interest rates steady at 23-year high, projecting just one rate cut this year, as inflation remains a key concern for policymakers.</li>

The most recent inflation readings, however, have shown some modest further progress, and more good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent," Powell said in remarks prepared for testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.</p><p>The Fed chief is on Capitol Hill for the first of two days of his semi-annual monetary policy testimony. He is slated to appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.</p> <p><a href="https://foxbusiness.com/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-june-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>FED HOLDS RATES STEADY AT 23-YEAR HIGH, PROJECTS JUST ONE CUT THIS YEAR</u></strong></a></p> <div class="inline image-ct"> <div class="caption"><p><span>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing in Washington, DC on Tuesday, March 7, 2023.</span><span> (Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images)</span></p></div></div><p>Powell also said officials are trying to balance the risks between cutting interest rates too soon, which risks setting off inflation again, or waiting too long to cut rates, which could weigh on the economy and possibly <a href="https://foxbusiness.com/category/recession" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>trigger a recession</u></a>.</p><p>"In light of the progress made both in lowering inflation and in cooling the labor market over the past two years, elevated inflation is not the only risk we face," he said. "Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment."</p><p><a href="https://foxbusiness.com/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-may-2024" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Officials voted</u></a> at their most recent meeting in May to hold interest rates steady at a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level since 2001. Although policymakers left the door open to rate cuts later this year in their post-meeting statement, they also stressed the need for "greater confidence" that inflation is coming down before easing policy.</p><p><a href="https://foxbusiness.com/economy/why-cant-you-find-house-sale" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>WHY CAN'T YOU FIND A HOUSE FOR SALE?</u></strong></a></p><p>Since then, there has been some evidence that inflation is starting to ease again. The <a href="https://foxbusiness.com/economy/inflation-measures-closely-watched-fed-rises-2-6-may" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May personal consumption expenditures index</a> showed that inflation had cooled to 2.6%, from a high of 7.1%. At the same time, core prices – which are more closely watched by the Fed because they strip out volatile measurements like food and energy – also climbed 2.6%, the slowest annual rate since March 2021. </p><div class="inline image-ct"> <div class="caption"><p><span>The Marriner S.

Higher rates helped push the average rate on 30-year mortgages above 8% for the first time in decades. Borrowing costs for everything from home equity lines of credit, auto loans and credit cards have also spiked.</p><p>Powell also faced questions over the state of the U.S. housing market, which has seen prices surge amid an ongoing inventory shortage. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio and the chair of the Senate Banking Committee, suggested that the Fed is playing a role in the housing crisis by holding interest rates at a 23-year high, which in turn is keeping mortgage rates elevated. </p><p>"For housing supply, the best thing that we can do is get inflation under control so that rates can come back down," Powell said. "Policies to increase housing supply are really not so much in the hands of the Fed, they’re in the hands of legislatures, state and federal."</p></div> </div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Potential correction in the market</strong>: Piper Sandler analysts are warning investors about a potential correction in the market, citing deteriorating market breadth and narrowing leadership.</li>
<li><strong>Weakening market dynamics</strong>: The firm points to a weakening market, with fewer stocks participating in the rally and investors focusing on a limited group of high-performing companies, which undermines the sustainability of the current upswing.</li>
<li><strong>Technical indicators suggest correction</strong>: Piper Sandler's technical indicators, including its "40-week Technique indicator", show a low number of stocks trending positively, suggesting weaker market internals and a potential correction.</li>
<li><strong>Fed rate cut may not prevent correction</strong>: While a recent jobs report may lead to a Fed rate cut, Piper Sandler believes other factors are concerning, including a potential decline in mid-cap and small-cap stocks, and a "deeper pullback/correction in the coming months".</li>
<li><strong>Investors advised to be cautious</strong>: Piper Sandler advises investors to be cautious, prioritizing vigilance over complacency, as the current market dynamics suggest a correction is likely, and the S&amp;P 500 is overdue for a 10% correction towards its long-term uptrend.</li>

They argue that this undermines the sustainability of the current upswing.</p><p>However, it goes against a separate note from the firm this week that said its analysts believe Wall Street will remain bullish until unemployment reaches 4.5% and they remain constructive. Even so, they flagged that most market downturns occur from either higher rates or unemployment.</p><p>Nevertheless, Piper Sandler said its technical indicators also point towards a correction. Piper Sandler's "40-week Technique indicator" shows a low number of stocks trending positively, suggesting weaker market internals.</p><p>While the recent jobs report might lead to a Fed rate cut, Piper Sandler says other factors are concerning.</p><p>"The MID and RTY are below their 50-day MAs and poised for a leg lower toward their respective 200-day MAs," the firm states, indicating a potential decline in mid-cap and small-cap stocks.</p><p>Despite maintaining its year-end target, Piper Sandler expects a "deeper pullback/correction in the coming months." They believe the S&amp;P 500 is overdue for a 10% correction towards its long-term uptrend. In conclusion, Piper Sandler advises investors to be cautious.
