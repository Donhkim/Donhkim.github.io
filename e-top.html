            Biden and Trump are set to make history on June 27 in the first presidential debate between an incumbent and a former president.

Most of the international community only recognizes the sovereignty of the Greek part of Cyprus, and that was the nation Nasrallah’s threats were directed at.

<ol>
<li>Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao is facing a recall election in November, which was forced by a petition with nearly twice the required number of signatures.</li>
<li>The recall petition was submitted by "Oakland United to Recall Sheng Thao" (OUST) and accuses Thao of mishandling crime and the police department in Oakland.</li>
<li>The petition alleges that Thao has "blood on her hands" due to rising crime and instances of people being robbed or victims of grand theft auto.</li>
<li>Thao has been criticized for allegedly dismantling the Oakland Police Department and increasing homelessness in the city.</li>
<li>If successful, the recall would be a major upset for Thao, who has been a prominent figure in Oakland politics.</li>

It had maximum sustained winds of 30 miles per hour, down from earlier Thursday when the maximum sustained winds were 50 miles per hour. The storm is moving west at about 24 miles per hour. </p>

<p>Immediately after it moved ashore in Tampico, there was initial disappointment at the meager amount of rain that fell. Showers had been sporadic through the early morning with the sun even breaking through at times.</p><p>"We had hoped that it would come because water is so needed here, but at far as I can tell it went somewhere else," said Tampico resident Marta Alicia Hernández.</p><p>But inland heavy rain was causing damage in the neighboring states of Nuevo Leon and Veracruz.</p><p>There, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.</p>

<p>Water also washed out a segment of a major highway connecting Monterrey and Saltillo.</p><p>Nuevo Leon Gov. Samuel García wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.</p><p>To the south in the state of Veracruz, 24 families were left homeless in the state capital of Xalapa after days of heavy rain collapsed a retaining wall onto three buildings.</p><p>At dawn, residents heard a deafening sound and the floor began to move.</p><p>"I thought it was an earthquake," said Pedro Luna Sánchez, who had owned an apartment in one of the buildings for 26 years. "I looked out the window and saw my neighbor calling for help. I looked more closely and saw the wall was on top of the buildings."</p><p>All residents were able to escape safely.</p><p>Alberto had spurred tropical storm warnings covering most of the western Gulf of Mexico's coastline from Texas to Veracruz. The storm made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph.</p>

<p>Schools were closed across Tamaulipas state where Alberto came ashore and would be through Friday. Shelters were prepared across the state to receive residents trying to escape high water.</p><p>The U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. Areas along the Texas coast saw some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.</p><p>The mayor of Corpus Christi, Texas, planned to request a disaster declaration after parts of the city were drenched with up to 6 inches of rain on Wednesday, a spokeswoman said. Residents reported water and wind damage, and canals were damaged on the north side of Padre Island, Brianna Sandoval said Thursday.</p><p>Two people were rescued from vehicles that stalled over flooded roads, and a downed powerline rerouted highway traffic for part of the morning. The city remained under a flood warning.</p><p>Bert Dagnon, who closed his Salt Water Gift Shop in Galveston on Wednesday out of an abundance of caution, said it didn't rain as much as predicted and there was little impact in the area aside from flooding in low-lying areas.</p><p>"I suspect everybody will pick up, mop up and move on," he said Thursday, adding that he'd already had customers as skies turned partly sunny at the beach.</p><p>In Surfside Beach, a Texas city on a barrier island, storm surge early Thursday left behind some damaged roads and lots of debris, but "very little damage" to the mostly elevated structures, Mayor Gregg Bisso said.</p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/20/aea84a2e-a17f-4614-a733-b61aa3995252/thumbnail/620x413/e8bd41e56e99b17787b1bd37bfdc3a57/gettyimages-2158336525.jpg?v=cb1f2643a8816828741cfb3a3fb2d931#" alt="First Named Tropical Storm Of The Season, Alberto Brings Coastal Flooding To Gulf Coast In Texas " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/20/aea84a2e-a17f-4614-a733-b61aa3995252/thumbnail/620x413/e8bd41e56e99b17787b1bd37bfdc3a57/gettyimages-2158336525.jpg?v=cb1f2643a8816828741cfb3a3fb2d931 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/20/aea84a2e-a17f-4614-a733-b61aa3995252/thumbnail/1240x826/a81fc49457ac1206cd8819c292e23163/gettyimages-2158336525.jpg?v=cb1f2643a8816828741cfb3a3fb2d931 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E"></span>

<ol>
<li>A family of four, Han An and his three children, Simon, Christian, and Hannah, are being hailed as heroes after intervening to stop an attempted sexual assault at a neighboring business in Katy, Texas.</li>
<li>The An family was at their studio, Yong-In Tae Kwon Do, when they heard screams coming from the Cricket store next door. They entered the store and found a 20-year-old man, Alex Robinson, on top of a young female employee.</li>
<li>Han An, who has trained in martial arts, used his skills to subdue Robinson and hold him in place until the Harris County Sheriff's Office arrived 10 minutes later and took him into custody.</li>
<li>Robinson is being charged with attempted sexual assault and for assaulting Han An.</li>
<li>The An family does not consider themselves heroes, but rather people who did what was right in the moment. They emphasized that anyone would have done the same in their situation.</li>

            Allegations that three boys gang-raped a 12-year-old Jewish girl in northern France have triggered an outcry over surging antisemitism in the country, a key issue in the looming French <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/france-macron-gamble-far-right-vote-intl-cmd/index.html">parliamentary elections</a> this month.

            Politicians from all sides have weighed in on the alleged attack, with French President Emmanual Macron condemning a “scourge of antisemitism” that he said is festering in French schools, and far-right leaders placing blame on the left for failing to take anti-semitism seriously enough.

            The Nanterre prosecutor’s office announced Wednesday that it has launched an inquiry into the alleged “aggravated rape” of a minor, after receiving “reports from a 12-year-old girl” of the incident on June 15.
    </p>

            Whether the girl was targeted for her religion is part of the probe, with two of the boys now being investigated for aggravated gang rape of a minor, group violence against a minor for reasons of religion, death threats and insult for reasons of religion, according to the prosecutor’s statement.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxnn6qm500063b6jj04p0gj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The third boy has been placed under “assisted witness” status in relation to the alleged rape, the prosecutor added.

            The alleged attack took place as the girl tried to return home after meeting a friend. Two boys approached her and attempted to block her path outside her house. After a third boy arrived, the group began to physically attack the girl, hurling antisemitic insults at her, BFMTV reported, citing police sources.
    </p>

            The girl received several death threats and one of the boys called her a “dirty Jew,” according to the account reported by BFMTV.

            Antisemitic incidents have increased by 284% in France between 2022 and 2023, according to data from the French interior ministry. In 2023, antisemitic acts constituted 60% of all anti-religious acts, compared to 26% in 2022, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told the French Senate earlier this year.

            The incident has sparked an intense political debate on what politicians have described as a spiraling antisemitism problem in France linked to Israel’s war in Gaza.
    </p>

            On Wednesday, Jordan Bardella, the far-right firebrand hoping to score big wins for his National Rally party in the upcoming elections, pledged to tackle antisemitism if elected in three weeks’ time. “Since October 7, an atmosphere of anti-Semitism has spread and developed in an extremely worrying manner in our country, which we must combat,” Bardella told reporters.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxnn6qm5000e3b6jlckcc249@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Bardella’s party colleague and far-right juggernaut, Marine Le Pen said in a post on X that the attack revolted members of her party, highlighting the uptick in antisemitic incidents across the country.
    </p>



    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxnn6qm5000f3b6jrybnxp0p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Le Pen said the recent surge in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war reveals a worrying “stigmatization” of Jewish people which “everyone should be fully aware of” when hitting the ballot boxes on June 30 and July 7.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxnn6qm5000g3b6ju03thouv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal meanwhile described the incident as a “despicable” and took direct aim at his left-wing political opponent, Jean-Luc Melenchon, whom he accused of previously downplaying the severity of antisemitism in France by describing it as a “residual” issue.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxnn6qm5000h3b6j5ajhk3oz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Politicians in France have a “responsibility” to ensure that antisemitic rhetoric does not become “trivialized,” Attal said in an interview with TF1 Info Wednesday, warning that if trivialized it can lead young people in particular to “the worst.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxnn6qm5000i3b6jjyulw2y5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Melenchon for his part said he was “horrified by this rape,” saying in a social media post that “it put under a concerning spotlight the conditioning of criminal male behavior from a young age, and antisemitic racism.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxnn6qm5000j3b6je6a42gsl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Voter anger over the issue appeared clear on Wednesday, as demonstrators gathered outside Paris’s city hall on, according to reporting from BFMTV.
    </p>

            Protesters carried placards with slogans such as “Raped at 12 because she was Jewish,” and “Anti-Semitism is not residual,” and listened to speeches from Jewish rights activists in attendance.
    </p>

            “All light must be shed on the circumstances of this crime, including its anti-Semitic nature, if this is confirmed,” the main Jewish interest group in France, the Conseil représentatif des institutions juives de France (CRIF) said.

The airfield, 30 miles northeast of central London, is the city’s third-busiest airport and is often used by government officials and visiting world leaders, including President Biden.</p><p>Swift is doing three shows at London’s Wembley Stadium from Friday through Sunday as part of her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"The Eras Tour."</a> On Tuesday, she performed in Cardiff, Wales. </p><p>"While people are starving, the elite and the rich fly thousands and thousands of feet in the air above us all," Macdonald says in the video. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dark-money-fund-poured-millions-dollars-eco-activist-groups-blocking-highways-destroying-famous-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DARK MONEY POURED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO ECO ACTIVIST GROUPS BLOCKING HIGHWAYS, DESTROYING FAMOUS ART</strong></a></p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Taylor Swift performs on stage during her "Eras Tour" at Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, on Tuesday.</span> <span>(Shirlaine Forrest/TAS24/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)</span></p></div></div></div><p>"Billionaires are not untouchable," she says as the video cuts to an image of the duo hugging while sitting on the concrete in front of one of the jets.</p><p>Macdonald said in a statement that the rich are accruing wealth to the detriment of everyone else, which is "destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending ‘cruel summer.’"</p><p>"Cruel Summer" is the name of one of Swift's hit songs from 2019.</p><p>The incident came the day after other Just Stop Oil demonstrators targeted and vandalized the ancient Stonehenge monument in southern England as part of a wider protest against fossil fuels.

Nunes in recent weeks has written letters to Congress and other regulators to pursue claims of an illegal form of short selling.</p> <p>The warrants could be exercised adding up to $247 million to Trump Media’s balance sheet, but also adding millions of shares to the pool of stock available for trading, a Tuesday filing shows. Historically, a portion of investors that exercise the warrants will in turn sell the shares they generate which in turn creates selling pressure.</p><p id="section_news" class="moreFrom darkBg"></p> <p>The warrants fell 32% to $14 a piece in late trading after closing at the lowest level since early May. Also known as sweeteners, they’re a common part of special purpose acquisition company deals and are designed to reward investors, while diluting the value of ordinary shareholders’ stakes through the issuance of millions of extra shares. </p> <p>The former president is Trump Media’s largest stakeholder, with nearly 115 million shares worth nearly $3 billion on paper. However, he and other insiders are restricted from selling stock until September due to a lock-up provision. That restriction could be moved up if the company’s board waives or pulls forward the expiration of the terms.</p> <p><a class="manualbacklink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/trump-medias-stock-price-plummets-as-sec-charges-auditor-of-massive-fraud-imposes-lifetime-ban-101714751536152.html">Trump Media</a>, which owns Truth Social, has been volatile since going public earlier this year with the stock soaring as high as $79.38 in the days after its debut before sinking as low as $22.55 in the weeks after.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> </div> <p> </p>   <p class="relatedStoryCricket"></p> <p class="pollShow mb20"></p>   <div class="breadcrumbs" next-page-hide=""> <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com" class="breadcrumbclick" data-vars-event-label="Home_clicked" data-vars-event-action="/" data-vars-event-cta="News">News</a> <span>/</span> <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news" class="breadcrumbclick" data-vars-event-label="World News_clicked" data-vars-event-action="/world-news" data-vars-event-cta="World News">World News</a> <span>/</span> <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news" class="breadcrumbclick" data-vars-event-label="US News_clicked" data-vars-event-action="/world-news/us-news" data-vars-event-cta="US News">US News</a> <span>/</span><p> Trump Media stock sinks near all-time low as SEC declaration may dilute existing holders </p></div> </div> </div>
