<ol>
<li>Agent Brian Higgins, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agent, testified in the murder trial of Karen Read, who is accused of killing her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe, in 2022.</li>
<li>Higgins read out "flirty" text messages exchanged between himself and Read, which the defense alleges may be evidence of a cover-up involving law enforcement.</li>
<li>The defense has suggested that Higgins, along with two other men, may be an alternate suspect in O'Keefe's death, and has previously shown surveillance video of Higgins and one of the other men, Brian Albert, play-fighting in a bar before the after-party.</li>
<li>Read is accused of hitting and killing O'Keefe with her SUV and leaving him to die in the snow outside a Canton home. The defense claims she is being framed and there is a cover-up involving law enforcement.</li>
<li>Higgins was at the after-party at the 34 Fairview Road home, which was owned by Brian Albert, and the defense has suggested that Higgins may have played a role in O'Keefe's death.</li>

<p>Albert testified that the two were just "fooling around."</p><p>In a new discovery notice filed this week, the prosecution said five pages of Higgins's medical records have been provided to the defense.</p><p>When asked outside Norfolk Superior Court on Wednesday what to expect during Higgins' cross-examination, Jackson answered with just one word: "Fireworks."</p><h2>What was Brian Higgins' relationship with John O'Keefe and Karen Read?</h2><p>Higgins testified that he knew O'Keefe for about a year and would see him at the Hillside Pub in Canton. He says he also went to O'Keefe's house to catch the end of a New England Patriots game. Higgins said that more often than not, O'Keefe was with Read.</p>

"I considered her a friend as well."</p><p>Higgins said at the Waterfall that night, he texted Read something like "ummm, well" and told the jury, "to be honest with you, it was a flirty text."</p><p>Higgins said after leaving the Waterfall, he never saw Read or O'Keefe again that night. He also said he believed he was the first to leave the after-party at 34 Fairview. He said he stopped at the Canton Police Department to move police vehicles out of the way of plows and ended up at home in West Roxbury at about 2 a.m. </p><p>Higgins testified Brian Albert called him at about 6:30 a.m. to say that O'Keefe had been found on the front lawn. </p><p>"It didn't make sense to me," Higgins said. "I couldn't do the math in my head, because I knew John O'Keefe and the defendant, they never - they never showed up. It didn't make sense."</p><h2>Texts between Brian Higgins and Karen Read</h2><p>The prosecution had Higgins read several texts between himself and Karen Read in January 2022, before O'Keefe's death.</p><p>In one of the texts, Read tells Higgins "you're hot."</p>

<p>"Are you serious or messing with me?" Higgins replies.</p><p>"No I'm serious," Read says.</p><p>Higgins then said that after watching a Patriots game at O'Keefe's house on a Saturday night in January, Read "planted a kiss" on him. </p><p>"Not like a friend," Higgins testified. </p><p>In another series of messages, Read texts Higgins "Come over to my house."</p><p>Read told Higgins she never wanted kids and texted about how O'Keefe taking care of his niece and nephew were complicating their relationship. </p><p>In one message, Higgins told Read he assumed she was happy with her situation.</p>

<p>"I was. But things have deteriorated," she replied. </p><p>Read also texted Higgins that O'Keefe had shown her video of her interacting with Higgins.</p><p>"He's like 'Christ, are you guys hooking up??'" Read's message says.</p><p>After that, Higgins said Read came to his house for a face-to-face conversation to determine "what is this all about."</p><p>"I'm not proud of these text messages, it is what it is, I take responsibility for them. But John was a friend at the same time ... If they were at the end of their relationship, they were at the end of their relationship. But I wasn't going to have somebody utilize me and weaponize me against someone that I liked. It was just a weird experience."</p><p>The last message shown in court between the two was Read texting Higgins, "John died."</p><figure class="embed embed--type-video embed--type-content_video is-video embed--float-left embed--size-medium ">

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>CNN correspondent Kristen Holmes was surprised by the massive support former President Trump received at a rally in the Bronx, which exceeded her expectations.</li>
<li>The rally drew an estimated 25,000 supporters, far more than the initial 3,500 expected attendees, and included local residents from the Bronx, not just Trump loyalists from other areas.</li>
<li>Voters at the rally were mixed, with some saying Trump doesn't belong in the Bronx, while others, including some who had supported Joe Biden in 2020, were unhappy with the state of the economy and looking for alternatives in Trump.</li>
<li>Trump's speech praised the history of New York City, but lamented that it was "now a city in decline," referencing homeless encampments across the city.</li>
<li>The rally, held at Crotona Park in the Bronx, was a significant event, with attendees waiting hours outside the event to get in, even after the event had begun.</li>

				<p>Thursday's decision clears the way for graduate student workers at UC Santa Cruz to continue their four-day-old strike over what they say was the unfair treatment of student protesters in pro-Palestine encampments at other UC campuses. UCSC officials said they planned to resume in-person instruction on Tuesday.</p>
	</div>
	
<p>A state labor board Thursday rejected the University of California’s request for an injunction against its graduate student union to order it to stop striking. The decision opens the door to a widening job action, with two other UC campuses set to begin striking next week.





</p><p>United Auto Workers 4811, which represents 48,000 graduate student workers at the UC’s 10 campuses and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, authorized a strike last week over what they say is the school’s unfair treatment of pro-Palestine protesters at several campuses.




	</p>
	


<p>Using the stand-up model, the union’s leadership first called on UC Santa Cruz members to <a href="https://lookout.co/uc-santa-cruz-grad-workers-prepare-to-be-first-among-ucs-to-strike-starting-monday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strike starting this past Monday</a>.





</p><p>On Tuesday, UC officials filed their request with the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) for an injunction to end the strike. After UAW 4811 filed its response Wednesday to the UC’s request, the board deliberated and announced its decision to reject the UC’s request Thursday evening.

<p>Board counsel J. Felix De La Torre wrote in a letter to both the UC and the union that PERB “presently declines to pursue an injunction.”





</p><p>He wrote that the university “has not established that injunctive relief is ‘just and proper,'” adding that “the board, however, shall leave open UC’s request in the event it learns of evidence or facts to support a finding that injunctive relief is just and proper.”





</p><p>The labor board is a state agency that oversees collective bargaining laws and contracts involving public-sector workers, including employees of California’s public schools, colleges and universities and employees of the State of California. While the board is not a court, it does carry out courtlike proceedings to investigate and issue decisions on charges of unfair labor practices.

</p>





<p>De La Torre told Lookout that the board rarely releases detailed explanations for how it comes to decisions on requests like this. PERB decisions in circumstances like this are often just a few sentences long.





</p><p>“I know it’s frustrating,” he said. “Because people often don’t understand the basis for the decision.”

<p>UCSC union unit chair Rebecca Gross told Lookout Thursday that UAW 4811 expected the board to reject the UC’s request for injunctive relief. She said the students intend to continue their strike.

<p>“We’re relieved, but also, this is in line with how we’ve been thinking about this, and of our plan to go ahead with standing up on strike,” Gross said.





</p><p>In a statement, Rachel Zaentz, spokesperson for the UC Office of the President, didn’t address the board’s decision to reject the injunction request but noted that the labor board issued a complaint against the union saying the job action violated a no-strike clause in the student workers’ contracts.





</p><p>“We are pleased that PERB has issued a complaint against UAW for engaging in a strike that is contrary to the no-strike clauses in their collective bargaining agreements and without providing adequate notice to the University,” she wrote via email. “We are eager to see a quick and just resolution to this matter.”

<p>The board scheduled an informal settlement hearing over the complaint for Friday at 10 a.m.





</p><p>The board’s rejection of the UC’s request to end the strike comes as the five-day-old job action by graduate student workers, which <a href="https://lookout.co/uc-santa-cruz-student-workers-launch-strike-over-treatment-of-pro-palestine-protesters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began Monday at UC Santa Cruz</a>, is set to extend to two other UC campuses.





</p><p>Student workers at UCLA and UC Davis are preparing to join the picket lines starting Tuesday. The two campuses have a combined total of than 12,000 graduate students who are members of the union, according to Gross.

<p>UCSC union officials have estimated that 1,500 of the school’s more than 2,200 graduate students have joined the strike, causing some professors to cancel sessions and UCSC to move <a href="https://lookout.co/uc-santa-cruz-graduate-student-worker-strike-moves-majority-classes-remote-for-rest-of-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all classes to remote instruction this week</a>. On Thursday evening, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2024/05/in-person-instruction.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UCSC officials said</a> they planned to resume in-person instruction on Tuesday.





</p><p>UAW 4811 contends that its week-old strike was legal because the students’ grievances are related to how the university handled protecting the safety and free speech rights of UC students and employees during pro-Palestine protests and encampments while at their workplace, or on UC property.





</p><p>In their request to the labor board for an injunction, UC officials argued that the strike was illegal because the union’s allegations of unfair labor practices are based on trying to get the university to agree to “politically motivated demands” rather than workplace-related issues.





</p><p>In order to get the injunction approved, De La Torre said the UC had to prove two things. First, university administrators had to show that UAW 4811 violated the law. Then it had to show there would be “irreparable” harm done because of the strike.

<p>In an interview before the board released its decision, De La Torre noted that the UC would likely have a heavy lift to have its request granted. “It’s extraordinary in the sense that they’re asking us to take action against the party where there hasn’t been an official finding of wrongdoing,” he said. “So this is why it’s such a high standard.”

Addressing the crowd was Cyril Ramaphosa, president of South Africa and the A.N.C., Africa’s oldest liberation movement, which was at the forefront in the battle against apartheid and has governed the country since the first fully democratic elections in 1994, when Nelson Mandela was elected president. Ramaphosa was at Mandela’s side in those years, serving as a chief negotiator to end apartheid and later as a top A.N.C. official. But the tone he struck at the kickoff event, which was also the A.N.C.’s annual birthday celebration, was one of anger and even, perhaps, political desperation. </p></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Speaking to thousands of loyalists, he took direct aim at what he wanted everyone to believe was the biggest threat to the country. “Anti-transformation forces,” he said, were “working very hard to undermine the gains of our freedom that we’ve made over three decades.” The A.N.C.’s opponents were “real snakes,” he went on, who were intent on sabotaging the party and taking the country back to the days of apartheid. </p><p class="css-zry96z" aria-live="polite" role="note"><a class="css-1081t4c" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=8WXW7">Subscribe to The Times</a> to read as many articles as you like.</p></div></div></div>

The company first <a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-make-record-breaking-investment-indiana-manufacturing" target="_blank">announced </a>its plans to build new Indiana sites in 2022. </p><p>The plant will specifically increase Eli Lilly’s capacity to manufacture the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro, called tirzepatide. The company refers to those treatments as incretin drugs, which mimic certain gut hormones to suppress a person’s appetite and regulate blood sugar. </p><p>“This multi-site campus will make our latest medicines, including Zepbound and Mounjaro, support pipeline growth and leverage the latest technology and automation for maximum efficiency, safety and quality control,” Ricks said in a statement.</p><p>Eli Lilly said 900 employees, including engineers, scientists, operating personnel and lab technicians, will staff the site when it is fully operational.</p><p class="lazyload-placeholder"></p><p>The company has spent more than $18 billion to build, expand and purchase manufacturing plants in the U.S. and Europe since 2020.</p><p>Eli Lilly has several manufacturing sites either “ramping up or under construction,” Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi told investors during an earnings call last month. That includes the Lebanon plant and another Indiana site, two locations in North Carolina, one in Ireland, one in Germany and a seventh site the company recently acquired from Nexus Pharmaceuticals. </p><p>Investors cheered Eli Lilly after the company hiked its full-year revenue outlook by $2 billion, in part due to confidence about increased production of Zepbound, Mounjaro and other incretin drugs for the rest of the year.</p><p>“Now that we’re four months into the year, we have greater visibility into that, into these nodes of capacity and feel more confident,” Ashkenazi said during the call.</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Don’t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO</h2></div></div></div></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>
