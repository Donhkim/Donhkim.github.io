            Experts say a more moderate face in the presidency could facilitate dialogue between Iran and Western states. Domestically, Pezeshkian may also introduce some social changes, which he emphasized during his electoral campaign, though experts caution that such moves are far from guaranteed.

            Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, said it’s unlikely that Pezeshkian’s election would immediately translate into policy changes. “But Pezeshkian has made it clear that he will try to work through and within the system in order to perhaps accommodate a less repressive environment.”

            The reformist did not guarantee that he could make those changes, Vakil said, adding that this demonstrates the limits of presidential powers in Iran. “But it may add a bit more room for maneuver on social freedoms,” she noted.

            Former Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, a key ally of Pezeshkian and a reformist who oversaw a comparatively warm period of international relations nearly a decade ago, has been mooted as a potential candidate to reoccupy his old post under the new president.

            Zarif was Iran’s top diplomat when the regime struck a deal with the US and world powers to limit Tehran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief (a deal that has since all but collapsed).

            “With Mr. Pezeshkian, the sanctions will likely be lifted, and that’s very good for people,” Hossein Imani, a Tehran resident, said. “I have a positive feeling (about Pezeshkian) for now, with the condition that he fulfils the promises he has made.”

            Ahead of the elections, however, Supreme Leader Khamenei condemned those seeking improved relations with the West. And Pezeshkian has publicly stated that he would defer to Khamenei on matters of foreign policy, so Zarif’s appointment is far from assured.

    <p>Here are five key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Presidential Immunity</strong>: The US Supreme Court has granted presidential immunity to Donald Trump for official acts, which is seen as benefiting him in his upcoming trial related to the January 6th Capitol riot.</li>
<li><strong>Calls for Impeachment</strong>: Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has vowed to file articles of impeachment when Congress returns next week, although this is considered a long shot. She has also accused the Supreme Court of being "consumed by a corruption crisis beyond its control".</li>
<li><strong>Constitutional Amendment</strong>: Rep. Joe Morelle has announced plans to introduce a constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court's decision and ensure that no president is above the law. This is also seen as a long shot.</li>
<li><strong>Accountability Calls</strong>: Senate Democrats have been seeking to enforce more accountability on the court, specifically calling on Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito to recuse themselves in January 6th-related cases.</li>
<li><strong>Ruling Delays Trial</strong>: The Supreme Court's ruling has sent the case back to the trial court to sort out which charges can stand, effectively delaying the potential trial of Donald Trump. The court has decided that Trump is entitled to some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts related to the 2020 election.</li>

<p>Texas officials warned the state’s entire coastline to brace for possible flooding, heavy rain and wind as they wait for a more defined path of the storm. The hurricane center has issued hurricane and storm surge watches for the Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande north to San Luis Pass, less than 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Houston.</p>



<p>Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is traveling in Taiwan, issued a pre-emptive disaster declaration for 40 counties.</p>
    
<p>Some Texas coastal cities called for voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas prone to flooding, banned beach camping and urged tourists traveling on the July 4 holiday weekend to move recreational vehicles from coastal parks. </p><p>Mitch Thames, a spokesman for Matagorda County, said Saturday that officials issued a voluntary evacuation request for the coastal areas of the county about 100 miles (160 kilometers) southwest of Houston to inform the large number of visitors in the area for the holiday weekend.</p>
    

<p>“You always plan for the worst and hope for the best. I certainly don’t want to ruin the holiday weekend for our visitors. But at the same time, our No. 1 goal is the health and safety of all our visitors and of course our residents. I’m not so much worried about our residents. Those folks that live down there, they’re used to this, they get it,” Thames said.</p><p>In Corpus Christi, officials asked visitors to cut their trips short and return home early if possible. Officials asked residents to secure their homes by boarding up windows if necessary and using sandbags to guard against possible flooding.</p><p>“We’re taking the storm very serious and we’re asking the community to take the storm very serious as well,” Corpus Christi Fire Chief Brandon Wade said during a Friday evening news conference.</p><p>Traffic has been nonstop for the past three days at an Ace Hardware in Corpus Christi as customers buy up tarps, rope, duct tape, sandbags and generators, employee Elizabeth Landry said Saturday. </p>
    

<p>“They’re just worried about the wind, the rain,” she said. “They’re wanting to prepare just in case.”</p><p>Officials in Corpus Christi announced that the city had distributed 10,000 sandbags in less than two hours Friday, exhausting its supply.</p><p>On Saturday, Beryl was about 415 miles (670 kilometers) southeast of Corpus Christi and had top sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center. It was moving west-northwest at 12 mph (19 kph). </p><p>Before hitting Mexico and moving into the Gulf, Beryl had already spread <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-beryl-caribbean-jamaica-cayman-islands-774803fc70e187ea96e7df10f84d8a50">destruction in Jamaica</a></span>, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Barbados this week. Three people have been reported dead in Grenada, three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, three in Venezuela and two in Jamaica, officials said.</p><p>Mexican authorities had moved some tourists and residents out of low-lying areas around the Yucatan Peninsula before landfall, but tens of thousands remained to tough out the strong winds and storm surge. Much of the area around Tulum is just a few yards (meters) above sea level. </p>
    

<p>The city was plunged into darkness when the storm knocked out power as it came ashore. Screeching winds set off car alarms across the town. Wind and rain continued to whip the seaside city and surrounding areas Friday morning. Army brigades roved the streets of the tourist city, clearing fallen trees and power lines.

  <p>The apparent compromise could deliver the first pause in fighting since November and set the stage for further talks on ending the devastating nine months of fighting. But all sides cautioned that a deal is still not guaranteed.</p><p>The two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations, told the Associated Press that Washington's phased deal would first include a "full and complete" six-week cease-fire that would see the release of a number of hostages, including women, older people and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. During the 42 days, Israeli forces would withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza and allow the return of displaced people to their homes in northern Gaza, the officials said.</p>

<p>In line with previous proposals, the deal would see around 600 trucks of humanitarian aid entering Gaza daily — including 50 fuel trucks — with half of them bound for the hard-hit northern of the enclave, the two officials said. Following Israel's assault on the southernmost city of Rafah, aid supplies entering Gaza have been reduced to a trickle.</p><p>Israel launched the war in Gaza after Hamas' October attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. Israel says Hamas is still holding about 120 hostages — about a third of them now thought to be dead.</p><p>Since then, the Israeli air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The offensive has caused widespread devastation and a humanitarian crisis that has left hundreds of thousands of people on the brink of famine, according to international officials.</p><p>Months of on-again off-again cease-fire talks have stumbled over Hamas' demand that any deal include a complete end to the war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has offered to pause the fighting but not end it until Israel reaches its goals of destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities and returning all hostages held by the militant group.</p><p>Netanyahu's office did not respond to requests for comment, and there was no immediate comment from Washington.</p><figure class="embed embed--type-video embed--type-content_video is-video embed--float-left embed--size-medium ">

I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.”</p><p></p><p>The 922-page plan outlines <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-conservatives-trump-heritage-857eb794e505f1c6710eb03fd5b58981">a dramatic expansion</a></span> of presidential power and a plan to fire as many as 50,000 government workers to replace them with Trump loyalists. President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign has worked to draw more attention to the agenda, particularly as Biden tries to keep fellow Democrats on board after his disastrous debate. </p>
    

<p></p><p>“He’s trying to hide his connections to his allies’ extreme Project 2025 agenda,” Biden said of Trump in a statement released by his campaign Saturday. “The only problem? It was written for him, by those closest to him. Project 2025 should scare every single American. “</p>



<p></p><p>Trump has <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-policies-agenda-election-2024-second-term-d656d8f08629a8da14a65c4075545e0f">outlined his own plans</a></span> to remake the government if he wins a second term, including staging the largest deportation operation in U.S. history and imposing tariffs on potentially all imports.

Dave Brat of Virginia hosted the show for Bannon, who is serving a four-month prison term.</p>
    
<p></p><p>“We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,” Roberts said. </p>
    

<p></p><p>Those comments were widely circulated online and assailed by Biden’s campaign, which accused Trump and his allies of “dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America.”</p><p></p><p>Project 2025 should scare every single American. It would give Trump limitless power over our daily lives and let him use the presidency to enact ‘revenge’ on his enemies, ban abortion nationwide and punish women who have an abortion, and gut the checks and balances that make America the greatest democracy in the world. It’s extreme and dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Some of the people involved in Project 2025 are former senior administration officials. The project’s director is Paul Dans, who served as chief of staff at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management under Trump. Trump’s campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt was featured in one of Project 2025’s videos.</p><p></p><p>John McEntee, a former director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office in the Trump administration, is a senior adviser. McEntee told the conservative news site The Daily Wire earlier this year that Project 2025’s team would integrate a lot of its work with the campaign after the summer when Trump would announce his transition team.</p><p></p><p>Trump’s comments on Project 2025 come before the Republican Party’s meetings this coming week to begin to draft its party platform.</p>
    

<p></p><p>Project 2025 has been preparing its own 180-day agenda for the next administration that it plans to share privately, rather than as part of its public-facing book of priorities for a Republican president. A key Trump ally, Russ Vought, who contributed to Project 2025 and is drafting this final pillar, is also on the Republican National Committee’s platform writing committee.</p><p></p><p>Project 2025 said in a statement it not tied to a specific candidate or campaign.</p><p></p><p>“We are a coalition of more than 110 conservative groups advocating policy and personnel recommendations for the next conservative president,” it said. “But it is ultimately up to that president, who we believe will be President Trump, to decide which recommendations to implement.”</p><p></p><p>A Biden campaign spokesperson said Project 2025 staff members are also leading the Republican policy platform. “Project 2025 is the extreme policy and personnel playbook for Trump’s second term that should scare the hell out of the American people,” said Ammar Moussa.</p><p></p><p>On Thursday, as the country celebrated Independence Day and Biden prepared for his television interview after his halting debate performance, the president’s campaign posted on X a shot from the dystopian TV drama “The Handmaid’s Tale” showing a group of women in the show’s red dresses and white hats standing in formation by a reflecting pool with a cross at the far end where the Washington Monument should be. The story revolves around women who are stripped of their identities and forced to give birth to children for other couples in a totalitarian regime.</p><p></p><p>“Fourth of July under Trump’s Project 2025,” the post said.</p><p></p><h2>___</h2><p></p><p>Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in New York and Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report.</p>

<li>Jordan Bardella, a 28-year-old French politician, is running for prime minister and is calling out the multiculturalism of the suburb of Saint-Denis, north of Paris, as an example of what is wrong with modern France.</li>
<li>Bardella grew up in a low-income housing project in Saint-Denis and says that he experienced what it was like to become a foreigner in his own country, citing the "Islamization" of his neighborhood.</li>
<li>Bardella also claims to have experienced insecurity, drug trafficking, and search-and-frisk operations in his neighborhood, which he views as a result of the multiculturalism in Saint-Denis.</li>
<li>Bardella's views are controversial and have been widely criticized as being anti-Muslim and xenophobic.</li>
<li>The article notes that Saint-Denis is a multicultural area with a strong Middle Eastern and North African influence, and that it is not unusual to hear foreign languages being spoken on the streets.</li>

His words suggest he separates immigrants into two camps: desirable ones, like those of his own predominantly Italian family, who assimilate, learn French and love their adopted nation; and those — particularly from Islamic countries — he views as rejecting French values, language and culture.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FEIN7HJWTFDPJNM6CY5BZ2E5V4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">The Bardella who appears at campaign rallies and poses for selfies with adoring fans is the product of media trainers and party mentors who fashioned him as the smiling, besuited subordinate of Le Pen — a political figure he came to know<i> </i>as he dated young women in her orbit.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2HFWRJWKHREFRMLLZ5ZCGPNJMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Le Monde assessed that he had an “ideal son-in-law profile.” For National Rally, he is an ideal spokesman: a TikTok-friendly, postmodern politician passionate about his party’s issues who can talk firsthand about the ills of immigrant-dominated neighborhoods. At the same time, he is young enough not to bear the taint of open racism that defined the party in the past.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CRJCU6TSDJDWBMUZFC7FOJ2APY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">But several people who know him — including a childhood friend and a former political mentor — say that image does not tell the whole Bardella story.

Jean-Louis Beaucarnot, a lineage expert considered the “Pope of Genealogy” in France, said his research showed that of Bardella’s eight great-grandparents, six were Italian, one was French and one — a paternal great-grandfather — was Algerian.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CD3TVYUNXBBZNBCG5M2V3O2URU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">For a leader and party that promote degrees of Frenchness, his background could seemingly pose a hurdle.

It was co-founded in 1972 by Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marine Le Pen, who was repeatedly convicted of hate speech and of dismissing the Holocaust as a “detail” of history.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WISTXAXA5ZHDXKQOVGG44FGVQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Bardella has said that he does not think the elder Le Pen was antisemitic, retorting to an interviewer last year that questions about the party’s past are “about a time I never knew.”</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PPPJ2NSYBRGRJNBBSNQEULKCWM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Bardella joined the National Rally — then known as the National Front — in 2012 at age 16. By then, Marine Le Pen had taken over as party president. But within the movement, her father remained an idolized figure known to young militants like Bardella as “Papi” — grandfather.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NHIWNTI5KREVTKZYDUFQCSJFDY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Pierre-Stéphane Fort, who wrote a book on Bardella, quotes a photographer who took a photo of an 18-year-old Bardella with Jean-Marine Le Pen in December 2013, a time when the elder Le Pen’s polemics were well known. The photo was taken at an event in which young party activists patiently lined up in the Paris cold for two hours for the chance of a Le Pen memento.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FJZD3G24QRGL5FCEJ3T7R3ZARI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">“You have to remember that for all the young militants, Jean-Marie Le Pen was an icon,” the photographer, Anthony Micallef, recalled in the book. “He embodied the FN, they’d all seen him on TV, they’d grown up with him. In fact, they all affectionately called him “papi” (grandpa). Often, these were young people lacking family reference points; they found in the FN a substitute family, they felt they belonged to something.”</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HMPGL3GFTBBERITNDUMM2IR3VQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">In his book, Fort also claims that Bardella kept a secret Twitter (now X) account that spewed racist, homophobic content.

Florian Philippot, a former National Rally vice president and now head of a rival nationalist party called the Patriots, recalls a meet-and-greet “in a corridor somewhere at party headquarters” in Paris in 2013. But Philippot saw a spark in the clean-cut and earnest Bardella — who had a face the camera loved — and opted to promote his career.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ND2BXRFAORDU7NARHEN5425CNM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Bardella would receive professional media training. But Philippot also coached him, scheduling him for a first TV interview on a late-night news show. Philippot remembers calling the young man and offering him a detailed critique. The upshot: Smile more, sharpen your points. Bardella gratefully absorbed the advice and promised to do better.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4YXUQMNYBNCIZAXYAS3VOY2SAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">So much so that by 2016, Philippot hand-selected Bardella to serve as the head of a party collective to rally backers in the suburbs under the slogan “Muslims maybe, but French first.”</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XKGHLSKXQNGADDUC6OL3P3NRT4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">At the same time, Bardella was growing closer to Le Pen, a woman he honored on election night last weekend by wearing a “marine blue” suit during a public address. Philippot recalls Bardella dating the daughter of Frédéric Chatillon, a longtime Le Pen adviser who was president of a now-disbanded far-right youth group known for spewing xenophobic and racist vitriol. Later, Bardella began dating Le Pen’s niece.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2UVBHYQESBF3DO6OP5ILHXT4YI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Philippot said he began to sour on Bardella, especially as he saw him shed his support for France leaving the European Union — a change backed by Le Pen to broaden her party’s appeal. Philippot saw the shift as a betrayal of French nationalist roots.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RIOWAQNEP5BOTAZD5EM7OHXAJ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">“He was very sovereigntist, but that only lasted for a while,” Philippot said. “And then I quickly realized that he was a chameleon. He was a good politician, but he didn’t have many convictions.”</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3O263PULBBEYVE5ABEMPPKR75Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">By 2019, Bardella had “arrived” — elected as a member of the European Parliament at age 23. He became interim president of National Rally during <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/24/french-election-2022-results/?itid=lk_inline_manual_40" target="_blank">Le Pen’s failed presidential run</a> in 2022, and he received the title permanently after a party ballot in which he won 85 percent of the vote.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VVQCACPISFBYLP4EV5EBPDJQYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Now he could be prime minister. This week, more than 200 centrist and left-wing candidates in three-way races with National Rally pulled out of Sunday’s runoff, hoping to consolidate support against the far right. Yet keeping it out of government might also allow the far right to thrive in opposition, giving Le Pen momentum in the 2027 presidential race. Should she win, she is likely to name her young protégé as prime minister herself.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GRGHKMFB4BAL3PJ4HCGFXVJ2PQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Bardella would prefer not to wait.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZD3ZJKBJIJGCLAARHNDIJLW5SE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">“The time is now to put at the head of our country leaders who understand you, who respect you and love you as much as they love France,” Bardella said Sunday night in a Parisian venue that bills itself as a throwback to the 1930s. “Victory is possible, and change is within our grasp.”</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LYD5WGETOBGW7AWFPRZ4Q62I64" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"><i>Virgile Demoustier and Elie Petit contributed to this report.</i></p></div></div></div>

                                        <p>CHICAGO (AP) — Part of the experience of a NASCAR race is hearing the engine roar, the rumble of each car’s approach and the zip when it whizzes past at more than 150 mph.</p><p>NASCAR unveiled its first electric racecar Saturday in downtown Chicago, but it doesn’t thunder when the grand marshal says “drivers, start your engines.”</p><p>It hums. </p><p>The top motorsports series in North America partnered with Chevrolet, Ford, Toyota and electrification company ABB to demonstrate a high-performance electric vehicle and gauge fan interest in electric racing. </p><p>They want to represent electric vehicles, and more broadly electrification, in racing as cool, fun and accessible, said Riley Nelson, NASCAR’s head of sustainability. </p><p>The Associated Press got a first look at the $1.5 million prototype. The only person who has driven it so far is semi-retired NASCAR driver David Ragan. The plan is to put the car on the Chicago street course for some fast laps on Sunday morning.</p>
    

<p>Ragan said the sound and smell were unlike anything he has experienced since first hitting the racetrack at age 11. He could hear squealing tires. He could smell the brakes. In gasoline-powered cars, the engine’s sound and smell and heat from the exhaust overpower everything else. But after hundreds of laps, this time Ragan’s ears weren’t ringing. It was really wild, he said.</p>



<p>Unlike typical sports coupes, the new car is actually a crossover utility vehicle. A huge wing on the back makes it aerodynamic enough to be a racecar. </p>
    
<p>It accelerates almost twice as fast as top gas-powered racecars and can stop almost immediately. But its lap time at Martinsville Speedway in Virginia was two-tenths of a second slower because it takes the corners slower due to being heavier. Ragan said it may go even faster; he wasn’t pushing the one-of-a-kind vehicle to its limits. Risk-taking is for racing, not testing, he said.</p>
    

<p>Eric Warren, who heads global motorsports competition for General Motors, said market research showed more than half of avid NASCAR fans surveyed would be more interested in purchasing an electric vehicle if they were exposed to it through racing. A main message is taking care with energy and optimizing it, he said. </p><p>“We’re committed to electric vehicles,” Warren said. “Racing gives a great platform to discuss a lot of those concepts and educate fans. It’s a laboratory for us to try some new technologies and learn as we educate.”</p><p>Burning gas pollutes the air and produces carbon dioxide, which warms the atmosphere and leads to more extreme weather. Burning one gallon produces about 19 pounds of carbon dioxide, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Racing events consume thousands of gallons in a weekend.</p><p>The event would certainly be quieter with more electric cars, though many fans love the roar of engines when the green flag drops.</p><p>A group of kids, including the children of ABB employees, pulled the cover off the car as part of the unveiling before Saturday’s NASCAR Xfinity Series stop. Dean Radejewski, 16, of Chicago, stopped to check out the car as he made his way through the area near Buckingham Fountain.</p>
    

<p>“I think it’s pretty cool that they’re stepping into the newer age, where all the stuff’s going electric,” Radejewski said. “I feel like it’s going to be maybe a bit more reliable, maybe a bit safer, too, since less fuel to light on fire.”</p><p>Radejewski also was intrigued by the possibility of a NASCAR EV series.</p><p>“It would be more racing to watch,” he said. “So even better.”</p><p>If NASCAR pursues electric racing, John Probst, NASCAR senior vice president and chief racing development officer said he thinks they could reinvent the fan experience. One option could be a DJ. </p><p>“It’s our goal to entertain our fans,” he said. “If our fans tell us this is what they want to see, we know how to create a racing series around pretty much anything.”</p><p>NASCAR is not the first motorsports organization to get into electric car racing. Formula E is an all-electric racing series that started a decade ago. But its fan base is far smaller than NASCAR’s. </p>
    

<p>The new car is part of a broader sustainability plan by NASCAR. ABB is now NASCAR’s official electrification partner. It will help NASCAR bring in more electricity from renewable sources. </p><p>NASCAR also owns 15 tracks around the U.S., many along major thoroughfares. ABB plans to install its electric-vehicle charging stations at those tracks and connect them to the grid. They will be compatible with regular electric cars and available for anyone to use, not just racegoers. </p><p>By 2028, NASCAR says it will introduce sustainable racing fuel, recycle at all events and use 100% renewable electricity at facilities and tracks it owns. By 2035, it aims to cut operating emissions to “net zero.” </p><p>That’s why the number 35 appears on the black, white and red car, along with ABB. The auto body is made from plant-based materials, a flax-based composite by the Swiss company Bcomp, rather than the typical carbon fiber composite. </p>
    

<p>NASCAR is also exploring racing with cars that run on hydrogen.

Formula 1 plans to use sustainable fuel in all cars starting in 2026 as part of new engine regulations. </p><p>Ford Performance, on its own, built eight cutting-edge electric demonstration vehicles in four years. </p><p>“Fans want to have some connection or relationship to the racecar,” said Mark Rushbrook, global director of Ford Performance Motorsports. “As more and more customers are buying all-electric vehicles, there will be, we believe, a growing number of people that want to watch full electric racing.”</p><p>U.S. electric vehicle sales overall rose 7% during the first half of the year, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/auto-sales-prices-second-quarter-1b2b789a695b6265475ad804bf8be069">according to preliminary tallies Tuesday</a></span> by Motorintelligence.com. EVs accounted for 7.6% of the U.S. new vehicle market, about the same as it was for all of last year. </p><p>ABB Executive Vice President Michael Plaster hopes kids who see the new car at NASCAR events will ask questions about moving toward a future that runs on clean electricity, and may one day want to work on electrical products and solutions. ABB is investing billions to grow its U.S. business.</p><p>“As far as getting interest and attention, and having the forum to talk about this whole energy transition, I can’t think of a better way to do it,” Plaster said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>McDermott reported from Providence, R.I.
