                                        <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A helicopter carrying <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ebrahim-raisi">Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi</a></span>, the country’s foreign minister and other officials apparently crashed in the mountainous northwest reaches of Iran on Sunday, sparking a massive rescue operation in a fog-shrouded forest as the public was urged to pray. </p><p>The likely crash came as <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-president-raisi-helicopter-a02630b6dca3cac455cacd16690b710f">Iran under Raisi</a></span> and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei launched an unprecedented drone-and-missile attack on Israel last month and has enriched uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels. </p><p>Iran has also faced years of mass protests against its Shiite theocracy over an ailing economy and women’s rights — making the moment that much more sensitive for Tehran and the future of the country as the Israel-Hamas war inflames the wider Middle East. </p><p>Raisi was traveling in Iran’s East Azerbaijan province. State TV said what it called a “hard landing” happened near Jolfa, a city on the border with the nation of Azerbaijan, some 600 kilometers (375 miles) northwest of the Iranian capital, Tehran. Later, state TV put it farther east near the village of Uzi, but details remained contradictory. </p>




    

<p>Traveling with Raisi were Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, the governor of Iran’s East Azerbaijan province and other officials and bodyguards, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. One local government official used the word “crash,” but others referred to either a “hard landing” or an “incident.” </p>
    
<p>Neither IRNA nor state TV offered any information on Raisi’s condition in the hours afterward. However, hard-liners urged the public to pray for him. State TV aired images of hundreds of the faithful, some with their hands outstretched, praying at Imam Reza Shrine in the city of Mashhad, one of Shiite Islam’s holiest sites, as well as in Qom and other locations across the country. State television’s main channel aired the prayers nonstop.</p>
    

<p>“The esteemed president and company were on their way back aboard some helicopters and one of the helicopters was forced to make a hard landing due to the bad weather and fog,” Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi said in comments aired on state TV. “Various rescue teams are on their way to the region but because of the poor weather and fogginess it might take time for them to reach the helicopter.”</p><p> IRNA called the area a “forest” and the region is known to be mountainous as well. State TV aired images of SUVs racing through a wooded area and said they were being hampered by poor weather conditions, including heavy rain and wind. Rescuers could be seen walking in the fog and mist.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

    <div><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">Former President Donald J. Trump, accepting the endorsement of the National Rifle Association on Saturday, cast himself as a powerful ally for gun owners and gun businesses, contending that under President Biden the right to bear arms was “under siege.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">“If the Biden regime gets four more years, they are coming for your guns,” Mr. Trump said in Dallas, where he headlined the N.R.A.’s annual meeting.</p><div class="css-1dv1kvn"><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">Mr. Trump addressed the group as he is on trial in Manhattan on criminal charges that he <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/04/nyregion/trump-indictment-annotated.html" title="">falsified business records</a> related to a hush-money payment to a porn star. Onstage in Dallas, he contended that he knew “better than anybody” what it was like to have rights taken away.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">“In my second term, we will roll back every Biden attack on the Second Amendment,” he said to loud applause. He also repeated his promise to fire the head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on the first day of his administration if elected.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">The annual gun rights gathering appeared far more muted than the <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/28/us/politics/nra-convention-guns.html" title="">last time Mr. Trump attended it,</a> in 2022, in Houston, just days after the mass shooting of 19 children and two adults at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. Greg Abbott, the state’s governor, and John Cornyn, its senior senator, did not attend that year’s convention, citing other commitments. Several marquee musical performers pulled their participation out of respect, they said, for the victims and their families.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">The N.R.A., the nation’s most prominent gun rights group and once a potent political force, has found itself in a hobbled state. In recent years, it has shed members and been besieged by <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/us/nra-lawsuit-wayne-lapierre-chris-cox.html" title="">setbacks, defections and internal strife</a>.

He largely used his remarks to blast President Biden’s policies, which he argued had led to “open borders, gun control, riots on our college campuses and the gutting of our constitutional rights.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">“Donald Trump is the antidote to Joe Biden,” Mr. Abbott said, urging N.R.A. members to help the former president’s election efforts. “No president has fought harder to protect your Second Amendment rights.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">Outside Dallas City Hall, dozens of people had rallied earlier in the day to call for stricter gun laws. Gun safety groups hung up T-shirts with the names of people killed by gun violence in Dallas County. Participants pointed to polls that showed a majority of the public supported many of the safety measures they were asking for, including enhanced background safety checks.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">“They don’t care that you’re scared to go to church, that you might get shot,” Ana-Maria Ramos, a Texas state representative, told those gathered, denouncing state and federal lawmakers blocking stronger gun safety laws.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">Sitting in a lawn chair at City Hall Plaza, Jill Brown, 66, a retired school nurse, said she was worried about the long-term psychological impact of mass shootings and active shooter drills on students.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">According to The Associated Press, <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://apnews.com/article/mass-killings-list-united-states-2024-796844f3291e1c9031013a14268a8e78" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">217 people died in 42 mass shootings</a> in the United States last year, one of the deadliest years on record. On May 6, 2023, a gunman killed <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/05/06/allen-shooting-outlet-mall/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eight people</a> at the Allen Premium Outlets, north of Dallas.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">On Saturday, the Trump campaign named a white couple from St. Louis who <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/us/mark-patricia-mccloskey-st-louis-couple-protesters.html" title="">pleaded guilty</a> after pointing guns at Black protesters as they marched past their home in 2020 — and later <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/us/politics/mark-patricia-mccloskey-pardon.html" title="">received a pardon</a> from Missouri’s Republican governor — to a Gun Owners for Trump coalition.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">At the N.R.A.’s meeting, Mr. Trump, whose campaign <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/election/2024/article/donald-trump-campaign-fundraising-texas-19363488.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fund-raising</a> has lagged in Texas, urged gun owners to head to the polls to help deliver him the election. He also warned not to waste their time on Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent presidential candidate, whom he called “radical left,” adding, “Don’t think about it. Don’t waste your vote.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">Mr. Trump also pledged to reverse Biden administration policies, including measures to regulate firearms.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">“It’s a disgrace what’s going on, but with me in the White House, the radical gun-grabbers will run straight into a very, very powerful brick wall,” he said.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">Mr. Trump, who has called himself “the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House,” has an uneven history on the issue.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">Addressing thousands of N.R.A. members at a February outdoor show in Pennsylvania, he pledged that “<a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-no-one-will-lay-a-finger-on-your-firearms-if-he-wins-/7482066.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no one will lay a finger on your firearms”</a> if he returned to the White House. He also claimed that he “did nothing” to curb guns during his time in office.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">But as president, Mr. Trump at times pledged support for stronger gun laws, and his administration rolled out one of the most significant measures to curb gun violence in recent decades — a rule banning <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/04/us/bump-stock-las-vegas-gun.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">bump stocks</a>, the attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire in sustained, rapid bursts. The lawfulness of the ban, which came after a mass shooting left 60 people dead at a Las Vegas music festival in 2017, is <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/us/politics/supreme-court-bump-stocks-ban.html" title="">now being decided by the Supreme Court</a>. The Biden administration has asked the justices to uphold it.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">In the wake of another mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., in 2018, which left 17 people dead, Mr. Trump claimed that he would be <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-donald-trump-ap-top-news-politics-shootings-e20fd2b277274a9b9658b50e459629b4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“very strong on background checks</a>,” but he eventually reversed course.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">In a statement on Mr. Trump’s remarks at the N.R.A. convention, Vice President Kamala Harris, who is leading the first-ever federal office on gun violence prevention, promoted the Biden administration’s achievements on gun safety legislation. She pointed to the signing of major legislation limiting access to firearms and increased investments in the nation’s mental health system, measures <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/25/us/politics/gun-control-bill-biden.html" title="">that ended nearly 30 years</a> of stalemate in Congress over how to address gun violence.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-feblkd evys1bk0">She also criticized Mr. Trump for saying, “We have to get over it” after a shooting in Iowa this year that killed a sixth grader. Mr. Trump “is catering to the gun lobby and threatening to make the crisis worse if re-elected,” Ms. Harris said.</p></div></div>

    <div><section class="content__body"><p>Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the highest-ranking Republican woman in the House, rebuked President Biden and praised former President Trump over U.S. military support for Israel in an address to its parliament on Sunday.  </p><p>"There is no excuse for an American president to block aid to Israel — aid that was duly passed by the Congress, or to ease sanctions on Iran, paying a $6 billion ransom to the world's leading state sponsor of terror, or to dither and hide while our friends fight for their lives," The New York congresswoman and House GOP conference chairwoman said.</p><p>Earlier this month, acknowledging the U.S. had paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, Mr. Biden said that the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-weapons-white-house-shipments/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">U.S. would not provide Israel</a></span> with weapons for an offensive in Rafah, and he acknowledged that Israel has used powerful American-made weapons in <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/israel-gaza-conflict/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">deadly attacks in Gaza</a></span>. He suggested the U.S. would further curtail weapons shipments if Israel broadened its ground offensive to include civilian population centers in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.</p>    
  <p>However, Mr. Biden also said that the U.S. would continue to provide defensive military aid to Israel, and the White House has said that the U.S. would ensure that Israel would receive the full amount pledged in a recently signed supplemental funding package that includes about $14 billion for Israel's defense. And last week, the Biden administration informed Congress that it intends to transfer $1 billion in weapons to Israel.</p><p>White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement on Sunday that there "has been no better friend to Israel than President Biden."</p>

<p>"He was the first American president to visit Israel during war time — in the aftermath of the horrific October 7th terrorist attacks — and the first president to order the U.S. military to defend Israel from a foreign nation's attack. As he has demonstrated, President Biden's support for Israel's security is 'ironclad,'" Bates said. </p><p>Recalling a letter from George Washington wrote to Jews in Newport, Rhode Island, Stefanik said Americans are "firmly behind Israel and the Jewish people."</p><p>Stefanik noted that "for years, I have been a leading proponent and partner to President Trump in his historic support for Israeli independence and security." She's a close ally of Trump and was among the first to endorse his 2024 presidential bid. Sources have told CBS News that Trump views her as a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-potential-vp-picks/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">potential running mate</a></span>.</p><p>In <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/antisemitism-campus-harvard-pennsylvania-mit-presidents-testify-congress/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">congressional hearings</a></span> late last year, Stefanik pressed the presidents of Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania on antisemitism on their campuses.

<ol>
<li>An attempted coup was thwarted in the Democratic Republic of Congo's capital, Kinshasa, resulting in the deaths of three people, including two police officers and one of the attackers.</li>
<li>The attempt on Vital Kamerhe, a federal legislator and candidate for speaker of the National Assembly, was foiled by his guards, who stopped the armed men at Kamerhe's residence.</li>
<li>According to the Congolese military, the perpetrators were mostly foreigners or Congolese citizens based abroad, and some held US and Canadian passports.</li>
<li>The military said the attack was "nipped in the bud" and the situation is under control, with the perpetrators arrested, including some with ties to self-exiled opposition leader Christian Malanga.</li>
<li>The attack has raised concerns about how the perpetrators were able to enter the highly protected area and attack a high-profile government member, sparking questions about the security failures.</li>

<p>The armed men attacked the Kinshasa residence of Vital Kamerhe, a federal legislator and a candidate for speaker of the National Assembly of DR Congo, but were stopped by his guards, Kamerhe’s spokesman Michel Moto Muhima said on social media.</p>
<p>“The Honorable Vital Kamerhe and his family are safe and sound,” the spokesman wrote on X.</p>
<p>A DR Congo military spokesman said in a televised address that the perpetrators of the failed takeover had been arrested.</p>
<p>Brigadier General Sylvain Ekenge told reporters the attempted coup was “nipped in the bud by Congolese defence and security forces [and] the situation is under control”.</p>
<p>The army said the group of people behind the attempted coup were mostly foreigners or Congolese citizens based abroad, Al Jazeera’s Alain Uaykani reported. Uaykani added that the army also said some of the suspects held US and Canadian passports.</p>
<p>“There is no link between these people and the local army or members of security forces in Kinshasa,” Uaykani said.</p>
<p>Still, he added, the attack raised concerns among the local population on how the perpetrators succeeded in entering a highly protected place and attacked a high-profile member of the government.</p>
<p>Local media first identified the armed men as Congolese soldiers, but then reported they were linked to self-exiled opposition leader Christian Malanga, who appeared in a live-streamed video surrounded by several people in military uniform.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>“Felix, you’re out. We are coming for you,” Malanga said, referring to President Felix Tshisekedi.</p>
<p>Footage, seemingly from the area, showed military trucks and heavily armed men parading deserted streets in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<p>The incident came amid a crisis gripping <a href="/news/2023/12/31/felix-tshisekedi-re-elected-dr-congo-president-election-commission-says">Tshisekedi’s governing party</a> over an election for the parliament’s leadership which was supposed to be held on Saturday but was postponed.</p>
<p>On Friday, Tshisekedi met with parliamentarians and leaders of the Sacred Union of the Nation ruling coalition in an attempt to resolve the crisis amid his party which dominates the national assembly.</p>
<p>He said he would not “hesitate to dissolve the National Assembly and send everyone to new elections if these bad practices persist”.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi was re-elected as president in December in a chaotic vote amid calls for a revote from the opposition over what they said was a lack of transparency, following past trends of disputed elections in the central African country.</p>
<p>The embassy of the United States in DR Congo issued a security alert, urging caution after “reports of gunfire”.</p>
