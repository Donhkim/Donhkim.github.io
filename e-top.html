But that doesn’t mean that those perceptions are right or match what voters will see on stage.”</p><h2>The debate marks a series of firsts</h2><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Trump and Biden haven’t been on the same stage or even spoken <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/debate-joe-biden-donald-trump-nbc-final-ea9fa49aa1ccf238d3004eb39ed9d8db">since their last debate</a></span> weeks before the 2020 presidential election.

    </h1>
    
    
    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports tonight’s Biden-Trump presidential debate has enormous stakes.</p>
    
</div><p></p><p>The timing follows moves by both candidates to respond to nationwide trends toward early voting by shifting forward the political calendar. It remains to be seen whether the advanced schedule will dampen the effects of any missteps or crystallize them in the public’s mind.</p>
    

<p></p><p>“You have two men that have not debated in four years,” said Phillippe Reines, a Democratic political consultant who helped former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton prepare for debates with Trump in 2016.</p><p></p><p>Biden and Trump, he said, “don’t like each other, haven’t seen each other, (are) pretty rusty heading into the biggest night of their lives. That about sums up what’s at stake on Thursday.”</p>
    

    
<p></p><p></p><h2>Both sides recognize the stakes</h2><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The debate falls days after <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-abortion-reproductive-rights-election-harris-trump-roe-1f7c48bc4a9c1c44bb802dce0eb5b159">the second anniversary</a></span> of the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, ending a federally guaranteed right to abortion and pushing reproductive rights into the center of politics ever since.</p><p></p><p>The faceoff also occurs just after the Biden White House took <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-asylum-ban-halt-border-mexico-1905e3565b2da1cffb8f38a778c07118">executive action to restrict asylum claims</a></span> at the U.S.-Mexico border in an effort to lower the number of migrants entering the country. Trump has made illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign.</p>
    

<p></p><p>The wars in Ukraine and Gaza loom over the race, as do the candidates’ sharply differing views about America’s role in the world and its alliances. Differences on inflation, tax policy and government investment to build infrastructure and fight climate change will provide further contrasts.</p><p></p><p>Also in the political background: The Supreme Court is on the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-immunity-capitol-attack-acebc079bdaa6257bfd70a90a71a2ca0">brink of announcing its decision</a></span> on whether Trump is legally immune for his alleged role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. That’s weeks after Trump was convicted in New York of taking part in a hush money scheme that prosecutors alleged was intended to unlawfully influence the 2016 election. </p><p></p><p>Biden spent the week leading up to the debate secluded at Camp David with senior White House and campaign aides as well as a coterie of longtime advisers and allies. A mock stage was built at the compound to simulate the studio where the debate will be held, and Biden’s personal attorney, Bob Bauer, was reprising his role as Trump in practice sessions. </p>
    

<p></p><p>Aides say the work reflects Biden’s understanding that he can’t afford a flat showing. They insist the sometimes stodgy orator would rise to the occasion. </p><p></p><p>“You know this president,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre Thursday. “He likes to fight.” </p><p></p><p>Trump, meanwhile, has continued his more unstructured debate prep with two days of meetings at his Florida estate, phoning allies and supporters, and road-testing attacks in social media postings and in interviews with conservative-leaning outlets. The unorganized style that is a hallmark of the former president’s often-rambling rally speeches could present a challenge in the regimented, tightly timed debate format.</p><p></p><p>Trump and his aides have spent months chronicling what they argue are signs of Biden’s diminished stamina. In recent days, they’ve started to predict Biden will be stronger on Thursday, aiming to raise expectations for the incumbent.</p><h2>The candidates have Georgia on their mind</h2><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Atlanta, the debate’s host city, offers symbolic and practical meaning for the campaign, but each side believes that what happens there will resonate far and wide. </p><p></p><p>In 2020, Biden <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-georgia-elections-bb997641ca36805c0f53f406a3529d87">secured Georgia’s 16 electoral votes</a></span> with a margin of less than 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast.

Trump called in Friday to a gathering at Rocky’s Barbershop in the Buckhead community to talk about his matchup with Biden and question whether CNN moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash would treat him fairly.</p><p></p><p>Heading out of the debate, both Biden and Trump will travel to states they hope to swing their way this fall. Trump is heading to Virginia, a onetime battleground that has shifted toward Democrats in recent years.</p><p></p><p>Biden is set to jet off to North Carolina, where he is expected to hold the largest-yet rally of his campaign in a state Trump narrowly carried in 2020. </p><p></p><h2>___</h2><p></p><p>Miller, Superville and Weissert reported from Washington and Price from New York.

<li>The Supreme Court has ruled that members of the Sackler family, who own Purdue Pharma, cannot be shielded from lawsuits over their role in the opioid crisis through a bankruptcy settlement.</li>
<li>The court's 5-4 decision was written by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch and was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Amy Coney Barrett, and Ketanji Brown Jackson.</li>
<li>The Sackler family had sought to use the bankruptcy code to shield themselves from lawsuits, but the court held that the code does not authorize a liability shield for third parties in bankruptcy agreements.</li>
<li>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh dissented from the majority opinion, calling the decision "wrong on the law" and "devastating" for opioid victims and their families.</li>
<li>The ruling allows lawsuits against the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma to proceed, potentially resulting in significant financial penalties and compensation for individuals and families affected by the opioid crisis.</li>

<li><strong>Kelsie Norris-De La Cruz was turned away from a Texas hospital with a life-threatening pregnancy complication</strong>: In February, Norris-De La Cruz, a 25-year-old college senior, was refused an abortion at a Texas hospital due to a highly dangerous ectopic pregnancy.</li>

<li><strong>EMTALA could have protected women in Texas and other states with restrictive abortion laws</strong>: By invoking EMTALA, women in states with restrictive abortion laws, like Texas, may be able to access the medical care they need, even if local laws prohibit or restrict abortion.</li>

<li>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plan to reduce air pollution that crosses state lines, dealing a setback to the Biden administration's efforts to address environmental issues.</li>
<li>The "good neighbor" plan, which was intended to reduce ozone pollution in Eastern states, requires factories and power plants in Western and Midwestern states to cut their emissions.</li>
<li>The blocked plan aimed to address ozone pollution that causes smog, asthma, lung disease, and premature death, and to improve air quality in Eastern states.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court's decision is the latest in a series of recent rulings that have chipped away at the EPA's authority to address climate change and water pollution.</li>
<li>The ruling marks another obstacle for the Biden administration in its efforts to protect the environment, as it faces ongoing challenges from conservative judges and policymakers who are skeptical of government regulations on environmental issues.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Iran's nuclear capabilities have upgraded</strong>: Iran has made significant technological advancements in its nuclear program, making it closer than ever to producing several nuclear weapons. Specifically, it has dramatically increased the speed at which it can produce nuclear fuel at a facility that is virtually impervious to attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Iran's rhetoric</strong>: Some members of Iran's ruling elite are no longer insisting that the country's nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes. Instead, they are publicly embracing the logic of possessing nuclear weapons, citing the need for a stronger deterrent following recent missile exchanges with Israel.</li>
<li><strong>Iran's role as a "threshold" nuclear state</strong>: The upgrade in Iran's nuclear capabilities means that it has cemented its role as a "threshold" nuclear state, i.e., it has nearly all the elements needed to produce nuclear weapons but is not quite there yet.</li>
<li><strong>Timing of the developments</strong>: The news comes as the world is distracted by other conflicts, such as those in Gaza and Ukraine. The situation has likely gone unnoticed by many international observers, allowing Iran to quietly make significant progress in its nuclear program.</li>
<li><strong>Implications of Iran's nuclear capabilities</strong>: The developments raise concerns about the potential for Iran to become a nuclear-armed state, which could have significant regional and global implications.</li>

“this attempt to destroy democracy” for at least three weeks before security forces seized control of the historic Plaza Murillo in La Paz at about 2.30pm on Wednesday and forced their way into the government palace known as the Palacio Quemado.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Before retreating from the scene in a bulletproof vehicle and being taken into custody late on Wednesday, Zúñiga had told reporters his aim was to establish “a true democracy”.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">In his television interview, Del Castillo claimed that on Tuesday night, the eve of the alleged revolt, Arce and Zúñiga had met in the presence of another senior minister and that the president had informed the army chief he was being relieved of his duties because his conduct “was not in line with the political constitution”.</p><figure id="9309c530-4071-449e-9d32-902805c0cfa3" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="

class="dcr-iy9ec7">“No problem … I’m a soldier of this homeland … and will carry out whatever orders you give me,” Zúñiga supposedly replied.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Del Castillo claimed the two men then embraced, adding: “Nobody could have imagined that the next day … our country would see a failed coup attempt.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Wednesday’s brief and still poorly explained mutiny, which lasted only about three hours and reportedly saw 12 people injured, was the latest convulsion to grip a notoriously volatile nation that has <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/the-fall-of-evo-morales" data-link-name="in body link">witnessed 190 revolutions and coups</a> since it gained independence in 1825.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Adding to the confusion were comments made by Zúñiga in the moments before he was detained, in which the ex-army chief appeared to accuse Arce of staging a sham coup in order to boost his flagging popularity. “The president told me the situation was fucked and that he needed something to boost his popularity,” Zúñiga said, without providing evidence.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Bolivia, a landlocked country of about 12.5m citizens, is enduring a punishing economic crisis with gas exports plummeting and social unrest on the rise. To make matters worse, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/04/bolivia-president-luis-arce-evo-morales" data-link-name="in body link">bitter power struggle</a> is playing out between Arce and Evo Morales, the former president who helped elect him in 2020. Both men have said they plan to seek the presidency in next year’s election for their party, the Movimiento al Socialismo (Mas).</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">On Thursday, some Morales allies and opposition figures used social media to promote conspiracy theories about Arce being responsible for the supposedly bogus military rebellion. Alejandro Reyes, an opposition congressman from the Comunidad Ciudadana coalition, demanded a parliamentary inquiry into claims that Arce had himself orchestrated an “autogolpe” (self-coup). “There are indications and declarations that indicate the involvement of the government,” Reyes said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">María Nela Prada, the minister for the presidency, rejected such claims. “This absolutely false … these are things that I find utterly inconceivable,” she said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Deisy Choque, a Mas lawmaker, hailed president Arce – a UK-educated former finance minister – as a hero. “He will never be seen as a coward or a traitor – he stood up to the coup attempt and democracy triumphed,” Choque said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">As the war of words intensified, armed police, their faces covered with balaclavas, guarded the wrought iron gates of the 19th-century neoclassical palace where much of the previous day’s drama had unfolded. Inside, two women could be seen sweeping up shattered glass from the floor where Arce had been filmed confronting Zúñiga, telling him: “I am your captain … withdraw all of your troops right now, general.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The apparent coup attempt in Bolivia was the subject of almost universal condemnation from across the political spectrum in Latin America, with conservative governments in Ecuador, Uruguay and Paraguay speaking out, as well as leftwing ones in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">But there were some hints of approval from segments of the region’s burgeoning far right. Bia Kicis, a prominent Brazilian congresswoman who is close to the ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, reacted to reports of the insurrection by tweeting: “Thank God!” Bolsonaro’s former environment minister Ricardo Salles appeared to suggest he thought the Bolivian putschists had “<em>cojones</em>” (balls).</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The Argentine newspaper La Nación <a href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/primera-reaccion-del-gobierno-de-milei-al-levantamiento-militar-en-bolivia-la-democracia-no-se-nid26062024/" data-link-name="in body link">noted</a> how it had taken the administration of Javier Milei, its far-right libertarian leader, six hours to condemn the failed coup.</p></div></div>
