    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>President Joe Biden plans to unveil a presidential proclamation to restrict migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border</strong>, with the aim of neutralizing immigration as a political issue ahead of the November elections.</li>
<li><strong>The proclamation would bar migrants from being granted asylum when the southern border is deemed overwhelmed</strong>, a move that comes after a collapse of a bipartisan border security deal in Congress that was rejected by most Republican lawmakers.</li>
<li><strong>Biden claims he was forced to take unilateral action after Republican lawmakers refused to work with him on immigration reform</strong>, citing his desire for lasting action via legislation.</li>
<li><strong>The new policy would take effect when the number of border encounters surpasses 2,500 per day at the U.S.-Mexico border</strong>, a threshold that has already been exceeded, according to senior administration officials.</li>
<li><strong>The move has been met with criticism from former President Donald Trump, who accused Biden of surrendering the U.S. border and said the order is "all for show" ahead of their June 27 presidential debate.</strong></li>

The Democratic president had contemplated unilateral action for months after the collapse of a bipartisan border security deal in Congress that <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-ukraine-aid-border-security-386dcc54b29a5491f8bd87b727a284f8">most Republican lawmakers rejected</a></span> at the behest of former President Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee.</p><p>Biden said he preferred more lasting action via legislation but “Republicans have left me no choice.” Instead, he said he was acting on his own to “gain control of the border” while also insisting that “I believe immigration has always been the lifeblood of America.”</p>
    

<p>Trump “told the Republicans ... that he didn’t want to fix the issue, he wanted to use it to attack me,” Biden said. “It was a cynical, extremely cynical, political move and a complete disservice to the American people who are looking for us not to weaponize the border but to fix it.” </p>



<p>Trump, on the other hand, used his social media account to assail Biden again over immigration, saying the Democrat had “totally surrendered our Southern Border” and his order was “all for show” ahead of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/2024-election-presidential-debates-biden-trump-6b1d1dbb2ed61c7637041b23662d7da8">their June 27 presidential debate</a></span>. </p>
    
<p>The order will go into effect when the number of border encounters between ports of entry hits 2,500 per day, according to senior administration officials. That means Biden’s order should go into effect immediately, because the daily averages are higher now. Average daily arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico were last below 2,500 in January 2021, the month Biden took office. The last time the border encounters dipped to 1,500 a day was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
    

<p>The restrictions would be in effect until two weeks after the daily encounter numbers are at or below 1,500 per day between ports of entry, under a seven-day average. Those figures were <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-immigration-executive-order-asylum-border-7cd0b0f28e298036ad1fc6b0c78961e1">first reported by The Associated Press</a></span> on Monday.</p><div class="AudioEnhancement" data-separate-event="audioModule" data-separate-value="AP AUDIO: Biden says he’s restricting asylum to help ‘gain control’ of the border" data-module="" data-gtm-region="AP AUDIO: Biden says he’s restricting asylum to help ‘gain control’ of the border" data-align-center="" data-module-number="3" data-main-module-number="3">

        AP AUDIO: Biden says he’s restricting asylum to help ‘gain control’ of the border
    </h1>
    
    
    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports President Biden has announced plans for a significant and immediate restriction on migrants trying to claim asylum at the southern border.</p>
    
</div><p>Homeland Security said increased enforcement with Mexico since high-level bilateral meetings in late December has lowered illegal crossings but is “likely to be less effective over time,” creating a need for more action. “Smuggling networks are adaptable, responding to changes put in place,” the department said in a federal rule published Tuesday.</p><p>The department predicts that arrests for illegal crossings may climb to a daily average as high as 6,700 from July through September.</p><p>Once this order is in effect, migrants who arrive at the border but do not express fear of returning to their home countries will be subject to immediate removal from the United States, within a matter of days or even hours. Those migrants could face punishments that could include a five-year bar from reentering the U.S. or even criminal prosecution.</p>
    

<p>Meanwhile, anyone who expresses that fear or an intention to seek asylum will be screened by a U.S. asylum officer but at a higher standard than currently used. If they pass the screening, they can pursue more limited forms of humanitarian protection, including the U.N. Convention Against Torture.</p><p>“We’re troubled to see this administration raise the bar on asylum seekers who are coming to our southern border and exercising a legal right,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge. “Certainly no one wants to see migrants who may be coming to seek a better life or for economic opportunity game the asylum system, but we see in our clients and in other immigrants people who are fleeing the most dire of circumstances at a time of unprecedented global migration and believe that the U.S. is still a beacon of hope and refuge.”</p><p>At the border Tuesday, there were no visible signs of immediate impact.</p><p>Iselande Peralta, a Haitian mother staying at a migrant shelter in Reynosa, Mexico, with her 3-year-old son, said the U.S. was within its rights to enforce new restrictions. She has been trying for 10 months to get an appointment through U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s online app, called CBP One. Peralta, 26, wouldn’t consider crossing illegally and considers CBP One her best option.</p>
    

<p>“Even if I was crazy, I wouldn’t cross the river. How would I do that with a child as young as him? I’m willing to wait,” she said.</p><p>Biden’s directive is coming when the number of migrants encountered at the border have been on a consistent decline since December, but senior administration officials say the numbers are still too high and could spike in better weather, as is typical.</p><p>Yet many questions and complications remain about how Biden’s directive would be implemented.</p>
    

<p>For instance, the administration already has <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-migration-center-venezuela-cuba-haiti-nicaragua-65b84bb008083e33295d5c738d5b8218">an agreement with Mexico</a></span> in which Mexico agrees to accept up to 30,000 citizens a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela once they are denied entry from the U.S., and senior administration officials say that will continue under this order. But it is unclear what happens to nationals of other countries who are denied under Biden’s directive.</p><p>Four senior administration officials, who insisted on anonymity to describe the effort to reporters, acknowledged that Biden’s goal of deporting migrants quickly is complicated by insufficient funding from Congress to do so. The administration also faces certain legal constraints when it comes to detaining migrant families, and the administration said it would continue to abide by those obligations.</p><p>The legal authority being invoked by Biden comes under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows a president to limit entries for certain migrants if their entry is deemed “detrimental” to the national interest. Senior officials expressed confidence that they would be able to implement Biden’s order, despite threats from prominent legal groups to file lawsuits over the directive.</p><p>“We intend to sue,” Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who successfully argued similar legal challenges when Trump was president. “A ban on asylum is illegal, just as it was when Trump unsuccessfully tried it.”</p><p>The senior administration officials insisted that Biden’s proposal differs dramatically from <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-politics-virus-outbreak-immigration-immigration-policy-1f8c91e31fba158126f8e91c1453b13f">that of Trump</a></span>, who leaned on the same provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that Biden is using, including Trump’s 2017 directive to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/3a20abe305bd4c989116f82bf535393b">bar citizens of Muslim-majority nations</a></span> and his efforts in 2018 to clamp down on asylum.</p><p>Biden’s order outlines several groups of migrants who would be exempted due to humanitarian reasons, including victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those with severe medical emergencies.</p><p>The directive would also exempt migrants who make appointments with border officials at ports of entry using the CBP One app. About 1,450 appointments are made a day using the app, which launched last year to allow migrants to make asylum claims. </p><p>Immigration advocates worry that Biden’s plan would only increase an already monthslong backlog of migrants waiting for an appointment through the app, especially when immigration authorities do not have an accompanying surge of funding.</p><p>It could also be difficult for border officials to quickly remove migrants when many agents are already tasked with helping in shelters and other humanitarian tasks, said Jennie Murray, the president of the National Immigration Forum.</p><p>“Customs and Border Protection cannot keep up with apprehensions as it is right now because they don’t have enough personnel so it would cause more disorder,” she said.</p><p>Republicans dismissed Biden’s order as nothing more than a “political stunt” meant to show toughened immigration enforcement ahead of the election.</p><p>“He tried to convince us all for all this time that there was no way he could possibly fix the mess,” GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a news conference. “Remember that he engineered it.”</p><p>In a call organized by Trump’s campaign, Stephen Miller, a senior adviser in Trump’s White House who orchestrated his most polarizing immigration policies, and Tom Homan, former acting director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Trump administration, said Biden’s order essentially would allow 2,500 people into the country a day and legalize the illegal entry into the U.S.</p><p>“The only reason they’re doing this is because of the election,” Homan said. “They’ve had three and a half years to take action and done nothing.”</p><p>Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said legislation would have been more effective, but “Republican intransigence has forced the president’s hand.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Will Weissert in Washington, Michelle L. Price in New York and Valerie Gonzalez in Reynosa, Mexico, contributed to this report. </p>

Lowell said that Hallie Biden, who had at times a contentious relationship with Hunter Biden, selected the pouch herself when she discarded the weapon. Lowell said the pouch was never fingerprinted and its origins and handling were never investigated.</p><h2>Witness testimony</h2><p>After Jensen took the stand, the government submitted a paper copy of Hunter Biden's memoir, "Beautiful Things," into evidence, and played excerpts from the audio book. The excerpts were about Memorial Day weekend 2016, when he visited the Burisma board with his daughter Naomi, and also detailed his relapse into crack/cocaine use, which then led to a longer span of use and apparently ended in the spring of 2018. </p><p>In her testimony in the afternoon, Jensen authenticated the text messages recovered from Hunter Biden's devices that were obtained through a search warrant and showed exchanges about drugs. </p><p>She also reviewed bank records that apparently show large cash withdrawals in the months before the gun purchase, with a focus on a $5,000 bank withdrawal the same day. Prosecutors also cross-referenced texts and cash withdrawal dates with excerpts from Hunter Biden's memoir about the timeline of his drug use. </p><p>In addition to Jensen, the prosecution is expected to call Hunter Biden's ex-wife Kathleen Buhle; a woman Hunter Biden was romantically involved with from 2017-2018; his brother Beau Biden's widow, <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hallie-biden-hunter-biden-gun-charges-beau-biden-widow/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hallie Biden</a></span>, with whom he was romantically involved, and five other witnesses, including FBI and DEA agents.</p>

<h2>Jury selection</h2><p>Twelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in Monday, 10 women and six men, on the first day of the trial. </p><p>During the jury selection process, all but one of the potential jurors knew of the case due to news reports, and many said they had an immediate connection to someone struggling with drug or alcohol abuse.</p><p>By 11:45 a.m. on Monday, a dozen potential jurors out of 30 were excused for cause, including scheduling conflicts and political views. One person asserted gun ownership was a "God-given right," while another said her opinion of the Bidens was "not a good one." </p><p>The defense struck another potential juror — who said he is a Fox News viewer — a former Wilmington police officer and then worked with Jill Biden at the college where she taught. He also said he'd met President Biden at multiple events and donated to a challenger to Beau Biden in his race to be Delaware attorney general. The potential juror also told the judge he believes prosecutors file cases for political reasons, mentioning <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-charges-conviction-guilty-verdict/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">the criminal case against former President Donald Trump</a></span> in New York and, when asked if "political prosecutions" ever target Democrats, he offered an emphatic "no" in response. </p><p>Other potential jurors also answered "yes" when the judge asked "are some Department of Justice and law enforcement probes politically motivated?" Several cited Trump's New York case. </p><p>Before the trial began, Hunter Biden suffered a couple of setbacks: <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ded.82797/gov.uscourts.ded.82797.207.0.pdf*link=*7B*22role*22:*22standard*22,*22href*22:*22https:/*storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ded.82797/gov.uscourts.ded.82797.207.0.pdf*22,*22affiliate*22:*22*22,*22target*22:*22_blank*22,*22absolute*22:*22*22,*22linkText*22:*22Norieka*20declined*22*7D__;IyUlJSUlJSUlLyUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSU!!CxwJSw!IjvsGnkaIKtAud4iUoyhZiDTH3EpKB5la6l4KxzeqsNJW4kIUA-c1evXBR_khXGnojUSrQ7jP5fw8FOdcHzD1o_7oy1Fd1FLZXs%24" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Norieka declined</a> to allow his lawyers to admit into evidence a second version of the firearms purchase form he filled out to buy the gun, and she granted the government's motion to exclude one of the defense's expert witnesses, Dr. Elie Aoun, who was to testify on the nature of Hunter Biden's drug abuse and whether he understood himself to be an addict.</p><h2>What are the federal gun charges against Hunter Biden?</h2><p>In the three-count indictment, the president's son is charged with making false statements on a federal gun form about his drug use, certifying he was not a user of or addicted to any controlled substance during a period when prosecutors allege he was addicted to crack cocaine.

<ol>
<li><strong>BJP loses national majority</strong>: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi lost its national majority in the recent elections, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape.</li>
<li><strong>BJP not enough to win majority</strong>: The BJP emerged as the single-largest party in the Lok Sabha, but fell short of the necessary majority to win a majority on its own, despite being projected to win around 240 seats.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition India alliance wins more seats than expected</strong>: The opposition India alliance, led by the Congress party, won more than 200 seats, significantly higher than exit polls had predicted.</li>
<li><strong>Coalition politics to play a key role</strong>: The BJP will need to form a coalition government with allies to reach the majority mark of 272 seats, highlighting the importance of coalition politics in Indian politics.</li>
<li><strong>Modi's party still likely to form government</strong>: Despite not winning a majority, the BJP with its allies is likely to form the next government, but will need to negotiate with coalition partners to secure the necessary support.</li>

<p>The BJP emerged, comfortably, as the country’s <a href="/news/2024/6/4/india-election-live-results-by-the-numbers">single-largest party</a> in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India’s parliament. But with most votes counted after India’s six-week-long election on Tuesday, the BJP was well short of its <a href="/news/2024/6/3/india-election-results-winners-and-losers-of-all-past-lok-sabha-votes">performances</a> from 2014 and 2019.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 4 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 4</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 4 of 4</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>Unlike both those elections, when the BJP won clear majorities on its own in a house of 543 seats, it was poised to end up with 240 seats this time around. The halfway mark is 272 seats.</p>
<p>By contrast, the opposition <a href="/news/2023/7/26/india-what-you-need-to-know-about-indias-opposition-alliance">INDIA alliance</a>, led by the Congress party, was projected to win more than 200 seats, significantly higher than exit polls had predicted. Released on June 1 after the final phase of India’s election cycle, the exit polls had suggested that the BJP would outdo its 2019 tally of 303 seats.</p>
<p>Modi and his party are still likely to be able to form India’s next government — but will be dependent on a clutch of allies whose support they will need to cross the 272-seat mark. The BJP with its allies, in a coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), was projected to win around 282 seats.</p>
<p>“India will likely have an NDA government, where the BJP does not have a majority on their own, and coalition politics will come into real play,” said Sandeep Shastri, the national coordinator of the Lokniti Network, a research programme at the New Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS).</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, Modi claimed, in his first comments after the results were declared, victory for his NDA coalition. “We will form the next government,” he said, speaking to thousands of supporters gathered at the BJP’s party headquarters in New Delhi.</p>

<p></p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>Yet analysts said that the electoral verdict raised questions about the BJP’s strategy. As India’s long-drawn-out election campaign played out, Modi, India’s charismatic and polarising prime minister, had increasingly turned to fearmongering over an alleged plot by the opposition to hand over the nation’s resources to Muslims, at the cost of its majority Hindus. Meanwhile, the opposition had tried to corner Modi on his government’s economic track record: While the country is the world’s fastest-growing major economy, voters told pollsters ahead of the election that high inflation and <a href="/news/2024/4/30/country-is-doing-well-why-jobless-young-indians-are-still-backing-modi">unemployment</a> were key concerns for them.</p>
<p>The BJP’s campaign slogan, “Abki baar, 400 paar (This time, more than 400)”, set a target of <a href="/news/2024/4/17/will-modi-win-400-seats-in-indias-election-the-south-holds-the-answer">400 seats</a> for its alliance, and 370 seats for the BJP itself.</p>
<p>That pitch carried a “tone of overconfidence”, said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a Modi biographer, at a time when many in the Indian public were dealing with the lived realities of soaring prices, joblessness and income inequality so wide that it is now worse than during British colonial rule. The result was the “sleepwalking of the BJP into a disaster”, said Asim Ali, a political analyst and columnist.</p>
<p>“Today, Modi has lost his face. He is not that ‘undefeated person’ and his invincible aura is not there anymore,” said Ali.</p>
<h2 id="forming-the-next-government">Forming the next government</h2>
<p>In some ways, the election verdict carries echoes of 2004, when another incumbent BJP government under then-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was widely expected to win a landslide mandate by <a href="/news/2024/6/1/indias-exit-polls-predict-a-big-majority-for-modis-bjp-led-alliance">exit polls</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, the Congress marginally edged the BJP in wins, and formed the government with its allies.</p>
<p>But 2024 is not 2004. Despite the setbacks, the BJP is still by far the largest party in parliament, and in position to form the next government along with its NDA allies. Congress, the largest opposition party, is on course to win around 100 seats, less than half of the tally the BJP is expected to end up with when all votes are counted.</p>
<p>Still, two regional parties will now hold the key to the office of the prime minister of India: Janata Dal-United, led by Nitish Kumar in the state of Bihar; and the Telugu Desam Party, led by Chandrababu Naidu in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. The TDP won 16 seats and the JD(U) 12. Both the parties have also previously been in alliance with the Congress party.</p>
<p>While the BJP has made noticeable inroads in southern India — especially <a href="/news/2024/4/22/why-kerala-isnt-buying-modi-claim-of-double-digit-bjp-win-in-india-polls">Kerala</a>, where it won its first-ever Lok Sabha seat — its overall numbers were hit by major losses in the central Hindi-speaking states, which it had swept in the last election.</p>
<p>In Uttar Pradesh, India’s biggest state and a key determinant of who rules nationally, the Hindu-nationalist party lost in the Faizabad parliamentary district, home to the controversial <a href="/news/2024/1/22/indias-modi-opens-ram-temple-built-on-site-of-demolished-mosque-in-ayodhya">Ram Temple</a>, built upon the ruins of the 16th-century <a href="/news/2024/1/22/babri-mosque-to-ram-temple-a-timeline-from-1528-to-2024">Babri Masjid</a>. Modi had consecrated the temple in January.</p>
<p>The consecration of the Ram Temple, overseen by Modi, was at the forefront of the BJP’s campaign to mobilise the Hindu voters. The party also lost the key seat of <a href="/news/2024/5/18/indias-biggest-election-prize-can-the-gandhi-family-survive-modi-2">Amethi</a>, where federal minister Smriti Irani is staring at defeat. Irani had pulled off a spectacular win over Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the Gandhi family, by 55,000 votes in 2019. This year, Gandhi contested from neighbouring Rae Bareli constituency and won the seat by a margin more than twice the size by which Modi won his seat, Varanasi, also in Uttar Pradesh.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>Overall, the BJP won just 33 seats out of Uttar Pradesh’s 80, a significant drop from the 62 it won in 2019 and its tally of 71 from 2014. The regional Samajwadi Party, a part of the opposition INDIA alliance, won 37 seats, while the Congress won six others.</p>
<p>The BJP also suffered losses in Maharashtra, India’s second-most politically critical state. With most votes counted, the INDIA alliance was ahead in 30 of the state’s 48 seats. Only Uttar Pradesh has more seats — 80. In 2019, the BJP alone had won 23 seats in Maharashtra, with its allies winning another 18.</p>
<p>Along with Maharashtra, three other states that have been epicentres of India’s agrarian crisis, with major farm protests, also saw losses for the BJP compared to 2019: Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab. The BJP rules the states of Haryana and Rajasthan.</p>
<h2 id="congress-celebrations">Congress celebrations</h2>
<p>As soon as the initial trends trickled in Tuesday morning, Congress supporters thronged the party headquarters in <a href="/news/2024/5/24/the-battle-for-delhi-will-modis-bjp-pass-its-bellwether-election-test">New Delhi</a>. Supporters were seen sporting white T-shirts with photos of Rahul Gandhi on the back, as they waved the party flags, their eyes glued to giant screens broadcasting results live.</p>
<p>“Now, at least Indian people will have a voice to raise against the cruel BJP, who ruled us for the last 10 years. More seats mean we have a good say and a strong opposition,” said Suresh Verma, a Congress supporter.</p>
<p>That changed composition of India’s next parliament might also affect how laws are passed. Critics have accused the BJP government of ramming laws through parliament without discussions and debate.</p>
<p>That won’t be easy anymore, said Shastri. “It is going to be a much tougher ride in the parliament, very clearly, for the BJP,” he said.</p>
<p>Beyond parliament, analysts said a weakened mandate could impact the functioning of India’s other democratic institutions, which critics have accused the BJP of appropriating for partisan politics.</p>
<p>“Under brute majority, institutions have collapsed in India under the BJP. The power system was very centralised at the top, and India needs these kinds of coalition-based governments for its democracy to survive,” Ali said.</p>
<h2 id="what-next-for-the-bjp">What next for the BJP?</h2>
<p>Once the immediate dust settles over these results, the BJP will introspect and the dominant duo of Modi and Amit Shah, India’s home minister who is widely seen as the prime minister’s deputy, will face tougher questions. “There will be questions on imagining Modi as a leader of the alliance, where he would have to listen to non-BJP leaders much more,” said Shastri of the CSDS.</p>
<p>Ali, the political analyst, also noted that “the BJP failed to read the ground”, and a set of yes men around Modi potentially blindsided his party. “It is like the king was only told the tales that he wanted to hear,” he said. “It’s really important for the BJP that there is a feedback mechanism and decentralisation of the power.”</p>
<p>Over the past decade under a majority BJP government under Modi, India has slid on several democratic indices amid accusations of a crackdown on dissent, political opposition, and media. Modi did not address any press conferences in the last decade as a prime minister.</p>
<p>With coalition partners to keep a check on the BJP, there “will be breathing space for the Indian civil society and the government’s critics”, said Mukhopadhyay, the biographer.</p>
<p>To many <a href="/news/2024/5/25/four-anti-muslim-claims-dominating-indias-election-cycle-whats-the-truth">Indian Muslims</a>, the outcome also means relief.</p>
<p>Watching the results from his shanty in northeastern New Delhi, Akbar Khan, a 33-year-old waste picker, said he was delighted. While all of Delhi’s seats are currently being led by the BJP in trends, Khan said that “the people came out on streets and have fought this election against the [incumbent] government”.</p>
<p>Khan, who also works with waste picker communities in states like Bihar and Jharkhand, said, “The economically backward castes and classes are hugely upset with Modi, and his divisive politics have not borne any fruits in their kitchen.”</p>
<p>As a Muslim, Khan said, he was upset by Modi’s Islamophobic remarks during the re-election campaign, where he equated the community with “infiltrators” and described them as people “who have more children”.</p>
<p>“Indians needed to vote against this hate from Modi and the BJP,” he said.</p>

MDMA is known as an entactogen, a class of psychoactive drugs that produce experiences of emotional communion, relatedness and emotional openness. It’s currently classified as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, and changing this status would be a marked shift.

            The FDA has final say on whether the treatment is formally approved. The agency often follows recommendations from its independent advisory committees but does not have to do so.

            About 5% of adults in the United States – about 13 million people – experience PTSD in any given year, according <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/common/common_adults.asp" target="_blank">estimates</a> from the National Center for PTSD. But current treatment options – including antidepressants and some specialized forms of cognitive behavioral therapy – are limited in their scope and effectiveness, with few alternatives available to help those don’t respond well to them.

            At Tuesday’s meeting, Lykos Therapeutics presented positive data from two late-stage clinical trials that used MDMA in combination with therapy to treat PTSD. Many of the FDA advisory committee members applauded the exploration of this line of treatment and lauded the potential it holds, but several shortcomings – notably regarding bias in efficacy data and missing information about safety – raised critical doubts.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwzjgljc00073b6kwb70pvsm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            About 200 people participated in the Lykos trials, with a treatment program that involved three eight-hour sessions where participants took MDMA in the presence of two therapists. The MDMA sessions were spaced about a month apart, along with additional therapy sessions.

            “Participants appear to experience rapid, clinically meaningful, durable improvement in their PTSD symptoms,” the FDA wrote in a briefing <a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/updated-meeting-time-and-public-participation-information-june-4-2024-meeting-psychopharmacologic" target="_blank">document</a> about the studies.

            But the agency also noted that “several factors make these data challenging to interpret and complicate the benefit-risk assessment for this application,” posing key questions for the members of the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee<strong> </strong>to consider.
    </p>

            The studies were designed to be double-blind, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received the MDMA treatment and who didn’t. This type of study is considered the gold standard because it helps reduce bias in results by minimizing the effects of external factors. But MDMA’s hallucinogenic effects have “profound alterations” on a person’s state of being, and the vast majority of participants knew which group they were in simply by the nature of their experience.

            The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that conducts independent reviews of treatments, tests and procedures, also cited “substantial concerns about the validity of the results” of the Lykos trials in a <a href="https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PTSD_Draft-Report_For-Publication_03262024.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> published in March. Those concerns centered around bias, both from the unblinding of the trial and from other influences on patient perspectives.

            Reports from illicit use of MDMA suggest that it may pose risks to both heart and liver health. The phase III clinical trials<strong> </strong>showed “significant increases in both blood pressure and pulse” among participants, the FDA said, but certain related assessments were incomplete. And liver health was assessed only in small groups from earlier phases of the clinical trials.

            “I absolutely agree that we need new and better treatments for PTSD, especially in the somatic treatment space. However, I also note that premature introduction of a treatment can actually stifle development and stifle implementation and lead to premature adoption of treatments that are either not completely known to be safe not fully effective or not being used at their optimal efficacy,” said Dr. Paul Holtzheimer, deputy director for research at the National Center for PTSD.

            As a member of the advisory committee, he voted against the treatment. “I think this is a really exciting treatment. I’m really encouraged by the results to date, but I feel that both from an efficacy and a safety standpoint it is still premature.”

            His confidence in the risk-benefit analysis was low, he said; psychotherapy is an integral component of this treatment program, and it could be “the greatest strength of the treatment” but “also its greatest liability” – and it’s not within the FDA’s scope to regulate, he said. And specific guardrails the FDA outlined to be put in place with approval of the treatment to protect patient safety were incomplete.

            The questions are all familiar to Lykos, and the company has had conversations with the FDA throughout its research, CEO Amy Emerson told CNN before the meeting. ﻿The advisory committee meeting is the “next big milestone” in the process and an opportunity to gather even more information, she said.

            “There’s just such an urgent patient need for new treatment options, and we really use that as our guiding light as we develop MDMA-assisted therapy,” she said. “All along, we’ve been really committed to safety, and that will always be top of mind.”

            There is growing interest and support to explore the use of psychedelics as therapeutics. Along with MDMA, drugs like ketamine and psilocybin mushrooms are being studied in clinical trials to treat a variety of mental health disorders.

            “Depression, PTSD, eating disorders – they’re all different. You can’t just lump these together and say, ‘Psychedelics are good for this,’” Emerson said. “You need to study it, you need to look at the safety and efficacy profiles of each, and we have to be careful to not treat these things as panaceas or like a magic bullet.”

            “There’s a recognition that psychedelics are probably uniquely susceptible to the blurring of the boundaries between strictly applied medical treatments that are provided by experienced clinicians under very well-monitored circumstances versus recreational use, so there’s a great interest in trying to get this as right as possible,” said Dr. Jon Alpert, chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s research council and chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

            Also, the trials have excluded people who may be most vulnerable to substantial side effects of MDMA, such as adolescents and those with coinciding conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and it’s important to continue gathering data to understand how the treatment works in these populations, he said.

            In addition to potentially setting a precedent in mental health treatment, the particular treatment program that Lykos has studied is “labor-intensive,” Yehuda said.

                                        <p>PHOENIX (AP) — The Republican-controlled Arizona Legislature gave final approval Tuesday to a proposal asking voters to make it a state crime for noncitizens to enter the state through Mexico at any location other than a port of entry, sending the measure to the Nov. 5 ballot. </p><p>The vote came as President Joe Biden unveiled plans Tuesday to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-asylum-migration-immigration-mexico-border-dec5f83b468b5795479bf1f5e49799d5">restrict the number of migrants seeking asylum</a></span> at the U.S.-Mexico border, saying “This action will help to gain control of our border, restore order to the process.”</p><p>Arizona’s proposal, approved on a 31-29 vote by the state House, would allow state and local police to arrest people crossing the border without authorization. It would also give state judges the power to order people convicted of the offense to return to their countries of origin.</p><p>The proposal bypasses Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, who had <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/arizona-border-bill-hobbs-veto-67830241558eb25d931da176cc3066bc">vetoed a similar measure</a></span> in early March and has <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/arizona-immigration-border-local-police-arrest-ballot-a4371bcf6d11e9b7839016bea03edbea">denounced the effort</a></span> to bring the issue to voters.</p>
    

<p>Hobbs spoke out against the bill’s approval, saying, “Extremists in the Legislature have chosen to prioritize their political agendas over finding real solutions.”</p>



<p>She said the legislation “will hurt Arizona businesses, send jobs out of state, make it more difficult for law enforcement to do their jobs, and bust the state’s budget. It will not secure our border.”</p><p>House Republicans closed access to the upper gallery of the chamber before the session started Tuesday, citing concerns about security and possible disruptions. The move immediately drew the criticism of Democrats, who demanded that the gallery be reopened.</p>
    
<p>House representatives voted along party lines, with all Republicans voting in favor of the proposal and all Democrats voting against it.</p><p>Supporters of the bill said it was necessary to ensure security along the state’s southern border, and that Arizona voters should be given the opportunity to decide the issue themselves. </p>
    

<p>“When the federal government fails, the state has to step in,” said state Rep. Timothy Dunn, a Republican who grew up in Yuma, Arizona, near the border with Mexico. </p><p>Opponents called the legislation unconstitutional and said it would lead to racial profiling and create several millions of dollars in additional policing costs that Arizona cities, counties and state can ill afford. </p><p>State Rep. Analise Ortiz, a Democrat whose family has lived in the United States for generations, said that under the law, “My brown skin could allow a police officer to pull me over on suspicions in the state where I was born.”</p><p>The measure will go before voters in a state expected to play a crucial role in determining which party controls the White House and the U.S. Senate — likely razor-close races in Arizona. Republicans hope it will focus attention on the border, which they accuse Biden of mishandling, and dilute the political benefits Democrats seek from an anticipated abortion-rights initiative.</p><p>Disorder on the border is a top motivator for many Republican voters who former President Donald Trump hopes will vote in big numbers. Immigration also concerns highly educated suburban voters who abandoned the GOP under Trump and helped power the Democrats’ rise in Arizona.</p>
    

<p>The proposal is similar to a Texas law that has been put on hold by a federal appeals court while it’s being challenged.</p><p>While federal law already prohibits the unauthorized entry of migrants into the U.S., proponents of the measure say it’s needed because the federal government hasn’t done enough to stop people from crossing illegally over Arizona’s vast, porous border with Mexico. They also said some people who enter Arizona without authorization commit identity theft and take advantage of public benefits.</p><p>Opponents say the proposal would saddle the state with new costs from law enforcement agencies without experience with immigration law, as well as hurt Arizona’s reputation in the business world.</p><p>Supports say the measure focuses only on the state’s border region and — unlike Arizona’s landmark 2010 immigration law — doesn’t target people statewide. Opponents point out the proposal doesn’t contain geographical limitations for enforcement.</p>
    

<p>The ballot proposal contains other provisions that aren’t included in the Texas measure and aren’t directly related to immigration. Those include making it a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison for selling fentanyl that leads to a person’s death, and a requirement that some government agencies use a federal database to verify a noncitizen’s eligibility for benefits.</p><p>Warning about potential legal costs, opponents pointed to Arizona’s 2005 immigrant smuggling ban used by then-Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio to carry out 20 large-scale traffic patrols that targeted immigrants. That led to a 2013 racial profiling verdict and taxpayer-funded legal and compliance costs that now total $265 million and are <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/arizona-immigration-arpaio-racial-profiling-costs-6c7278de323fa7f4586cdadfa899388d">expected to reach $314 million</a></span> by July 2025.</p>
    

<p>Under the current proposal, a first-time conviction of the border-crossing provision would be a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail. State judges could order people to return to their countries of origin after completing a term of incarceration, although the courts would have the power to dismiss cases if those who were arrested agreed to return home.</p><p>The measure would require the state corrections department to take into custody people charged or convicted under it, if local or county law enforcement agencies don’t have space to house them.</p><p>The proposal includes exceptions for people granted lawful presence status or asylum by the federal government.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Republican lawmakers in Arizona have tried to criminalize migration.</p><p>When passing its 2010 immigration bill, the Arizona Legislature considered expanding the state’s trespassing law to criminalize the presence of immigrants and impose criminal penalties. But the trespassing language was removed and replaced with a requirement that officers, while enforcing other laws, question people’s immigration status if they were believed to be in the country illegally.</p><p>The questioning requirement was ultimately upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court despite the racial profiling concerns of critics, but courts barred enforcement of other sections of the law.</p><p>———</p><p>Associated Press writer Jonathan J. Cooper contributed reporting.</p>

<li>The Attorney General, Merrick Garland, appeared before the GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee to answer questions on the politicization of the Department of Justice.</li>
<li>However, the hearing quickly turned into a rhetorical diatribe against Garland, with Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz leading the charge and focusing on the recent conviction of former President Donald Trump.</li>
<li>Gaetz questioned Garland about the involvement of Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over Trump's trial, and his daughter's potential financial ties to Democratic-aligned firms.</li>
<li>Garland declined to comment on the matter, citing it was a case in another jurisdiction, which prompted a strong reaction from Gaetz and other Republican lawmakers.</li>
<li>The hearing highlighted the partisan divide in Washington, with Democrats defending Garland and Republicans accusing him of politicizing the Department of Justice to target their political opponents.</li>

In reality, it was largely an opportunity for Republicans to vent their frustrations at Garland, while displaying their own loyalties to Trump.</p><p id="article-im-prompt"></p><p>But the panel seemed largely focused on last week’s events in New York. Trump was found guilty verdict on 34 felony counts of falsifying business record to cover up payments to porn star Stormy Daniels to hush up her story of an affair in the run-up to the 2016 election. The case was brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who is not an employee of the Justice Department as he is a locally elected official.</p><p>Gaetz, who attended Trump’s trial along with other rightwing Republicans, pressed Garland to comment on whether it was acceptable for a judge to have a family member benefit financially from media attention surrounding a criminal trial. </p><p>Though he did not name hush money trial judge Juan Merchan by name, Gaetz’s question clearly referred to allegations that the judge’s daughter works for a digital firm aligned with Democrats. </p><p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 eRUBrT"></p><div class="sc-482ou5-2 dRcHrE image align-none"><figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 kvknr"><figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 clnLaM dJOfXu">Matt Gaetz is seen at Tuesday’s hearing of the House Judiciary Committee as Attorney General Merrick Garland appears before the panel<span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 bnGycS"> (Middle East Images/AFP via Getty)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Garland responded only to say it was “very clear” that Gaetz was asking him to comment on a case in another juridiction which the US attorney general declined to do. </p><p>Garland’s response prompted a “tirade” from Gaetz, as ranking Democratic member Jerry Nadler later characterized it. </p><p>“I’m saddened by it because, like you, I’ve given my life to the law!” Gaetz yelled at Garland. “I care deeply about the law.”</p><p>Garland had used his opening remarks at the hearing to condemn <a href="/topic/donald-trump">Trump</a> and members of the <a href="/topic/gop">GOP</a> for spreading falsehoods about the <a href="/topic/justice-department">Justice Department</a> and baseless accusations that President <a href="/topic/joe-biden">Joe Biden </a><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-trump-conviction-court-comments-b2554740.html">was behind</a> the<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-guilty-verdict-hush-money-trial-b2551318.html"> prosecution of Trump </a>in <a href="/topic/new-york">New York</a>.</p><p>“That <a href="/topic/conspiracy-theory">conspiracy theory</a> is an attack on the judicial process itself,” Garland said.</p><p>The ex-president is separately facing three other impending criminal trials, two related to his efforts to change the results of the 2020 election and block Joe Biden from becoming president, and one related to his allegedly illegal retention of classified materials including documents and files related to the US’s military capabilities. He has professed his innocence in all cases.</p><p>Jim Jordan, the committee’s chairman, used his time to focus on two of those cases, both brought by a special counsel appointed by Garland to lead the prosecutions of Trump at the federal level. Jordan berated special counsel Jack Smith, a career prosecutor with the DoJ, and used his question time to badger Garland over whether Smith “asked him” for the job, and why he did not nominate a former attorney general instead to manage “the most high-profile investigation ever”.</p><p>Garland responded that he thought Smith to be roundly qualified and stated that he would not have considered any political appointees, such as an AG or deputy AG, for the post. He refused to answer whether Smith was his first choice.</p><p>"I appointed somebody who is not a political appointee, somebody who was an independent nonpartisan with a record of career experience as a prosecutor that seemed to me the perfect resume for [doing] that kind of [work],” said the attorney general.</p><p class="sc-461c9u-0 fFRBxI"> </p><p>Republicans on Capito Hill have for months voiced objections to the multiple prosecutions of Trump, who in essence has been campaigning for re-election since the day he left the White House in 2021 and has demanded such public shows of loyalty. Some, like Speaker Mike Johnson, have even appeared in the gallery as his Manhattan trial proceeded through May. They have largely ignored or explained away the former president’s own vows to utilise the Justice Department to go after members of Joe Biden’s family, or the president himself, in a hypothetical second Trump term.</p><p>The ex-president’s repeated threats to jail his political opponents are nothing new. What’s new are the plans being drawn up by conservative organisations like the Heritage Foundatoin for what has been described as a massive erosion of the political independence of the Justice Department and attorney general under a Trump second term.</p><p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 eRUBrT"></p><p>Along with going after his political enemies, Trump has in recent weeks vowed to issue pardons for convicted and charged participants in the January 6 riot, the 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters aimed at halting or reversing the certification of the 2020 presidential election, seemingly at Trump’s urging.</p><p>At a recent appearance in Washington DC at the Libertarian Party’s national convention, he also promised to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the convicted founder of the Silk Road dark web marketplace which served as a major hub for drug sales and other ilicit activity.</p></div></div>

<li><strong>Most Expensive Cow Ever Sold</strong>: Viatina-19 FIV Mara Movéis is the most expensive cow ever sold at auction, with a price tag of $4 million, three times more than the previous record holder.</li>
<li><strong>Breed Development</strong>: The cow's impressive size and strength are the result of years of breeding efforts to raise meatier cows. Her owners extracted eggs and semen from champion animals to create embryos, which were implanted in surrogate cows to produce the next generation of superior cattle.</li>
<li><strong>Brazil's Economic Ambitions</strong>: The cattle industry is a significant source of Brazilian economic development and a key sector for the country's export aspirations. The government aims to conquer new markets and promote the consumption of Brazilian beef worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Climate Change Concerns</strong>: Despite the economic importance of the cattle industry, climate scientists argue that consumers should reduce their beef consumption to combat greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation in the Amazon region.</li>
<li><strong>The Cow's Significance</strong>: Viatina-19 is seen as a symbol of Brazil's cattle ambitions and a representation of the country's efforts to raise higher-quality cattle. Her owners believe she will help feed the world and prove the effectiveness of their breeding program.</li>

    <div><section class="content__body"><p>Brazil has hundreds of millions of cows, but one in particular is extraordinary.</p><p>Worth $4 million, Viatina-19 FIV Mara Movéis is the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com.br/world-records/70813-most-expensive-cow-sold-at-auction" rel="nofollow noopener">most expensive cow ever sold at auction</a>, according to Guinness World Records. That's three times more than the last recordholder's price.

  <p>Climate scientists agree that people need to consume <a href="https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/the-protein-problem/beef-regenerative-cattle-ranching/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener">less beef</a>, the largest agricultural source of greenhouse gasses and a driver of Amazon deforestation. But the cattle industry is a major source of Brazilian economic development and the government is striving to conquer new export markets. The world's top beef exporter wants everyone, everywhere to eat its beef.</p><p>The embodiment of Brazil's cattle ambitions is Viatina-19, the product of years of efforts to raise meatier cows. Prizewinners are sold at high-stakes auctions — so high that wealthy ranchers share ownership. They extract the eggs and semen from champion animals, create embryos and implant them in surrogate cows that they hope will produce the next magnificent specimens. </p><figure class="embed embed--type-video embed--type-content_video is-video embed--float-none embed--size-medium ">

And at the end of the line, going to feed the whole world," one of her owners, Ney Pereira, said after arriving by helicopter to his farm in Minas Gerais state. "I think Viatina will provide that."</p>

    </p>
<p>The snow-white cow's eye-popping price stems from how quickly she put on vast amounts of muscle, from her fertility and — crucially — how often she has passed those characteristics to her offspring, said Lorrany Martins, a veterinarian who is Pereira's daughter and right hand. Breeders also value posture, hoof solidity, docility, maternal ability and beauty. Those eager to level up their livestock's genetics pay around $250,000 for an opportunity to collect Viatina-19's egg cells.</p><p>"She is the closest to perfection that has been attained so far," Martins said. "She's a complete cow, has all the characteristics that all the proprietors are looking for."</p><p>In Brazil, 80% of the cows are Zebus, a subspecies originating in India with a distinctive hump and dewlap, or folds of draping neck skin. Viatina-19 belongs to the Nelore breed, which is raised for meat, not milk, and makes up most of Brazil's stock.</p><p>The city of Uberaba, where Viatina-19 lives, holds an annual gathering called ExpoZebu that bills itself as the world's biggest Zebu fair. Held several weeks ago, it was a far cry from the Brazil that's imagined abroad. The dress code was boots, baseball caps and blue jeans. Evening concerts drew 10,000 spectators belting out their favorite country songs. But the main attraction was the daily cattle shows where cows compete for prizes that boost an animal's auction price.</p>

<p>The most prestigious auction is called Elo de Raça, held April 28. As the first cow entered the paddock, speakers blared Queen's "We Are the Champions." But that cow was a mere appetizer before this year's starlet, Donna, and three of her clones; the final sale price put her total value at 15.5 million reais ($3 million.) </p><p>A commodities boom in the 2000s turbocharged Brazilian agriculture, especially with a rising China buying soy and beef. Today, agriculture's influence extends to Brazil's Congress and the national consciousness. And Brazil, along with the U.S., is at the forefront of cattle genetics.</p><figure class="embed embed--type-video embed--type-content_video is-video embed--float-none embed--size-medium ">

It's the world's largest beef cattle population, and that's problematic; huge swaths of Amazon rainforest have been slashed to create pasture, releasing carbon stored in trees. And cows belch methane that's far worse for the climate. </p><p>Genetic improvements that reduce cows' slaughtering age are helpful but limited ways to reduce warming. Simpler, more effective measures include planting better grass for grazing and regularly moving cattle from pasture to pasture, said Beto Veríssimo, an agronomist and the co-founder of an environmental nonprofit called Imazon.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has been working to open new markets. Last month, he met Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan, home to the premium, marbled Wagyu beef; he urged his counterpart to taste Brazilian meat and become a believer.</p><p>"Please," he said, addressing his vice president at the event, "take Prime Minister Fumio to eat steak at the best restaurant in Sao Paulo so that, the following week, he starts importing our beef." </p><h2>Clones coming soon</h2><p>Down the highway from the Elo de Raça auction is the laboratory of the company Geneal Animal Genetics and Biotechnology. In a small pen behind it, a cloned calf recently lay in the sunshine, still too unsure of its newborn legs to stand. Another born by cesarean section 20 minutes earlier pressed backward against a stall's rear wall, unsettled by this strange new world. Clones of Viatina-19 are due in a few months, said Geneal's commercial director, Paulo Cerantola.</p>

<p>Some ranchers wouldn't want a big herd of her clones. High-maintenance cows like Viatina-19 aren't profitable on a large, commercial scale because they couldn't meet their energy needs from grass alone, said P.J. Budler, international business manager for Trans Ova Genetics, an Iowa-based company focused on improving the bovine gene pool. </p><p>"For the environment and the resources that it would take to run a cow like (Viatina-19), she fits the mold ideally, but she's not the answer for all cattle everywhere," Budler said.</p><p>Viatina-19's owner, Pereira, said she gets special treatment to boost egg cell production, but would thrive were she put to pasture — where almost all his elite cattle feed. </p><p>Meanwhile, Viatina-19 is pregnant for the first time, and Pereira's eyeing expansion; her egg cells have sold to Bolivian buyers and he wants to export to the United Arab Emirates, India and the U.S.</p><p>His veterinarian daughter, Martins, is looking even farther ahead.</p><p>"I hope she is the basis for an even better animal in the future, decades from now," she said. </p>

    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Hong Kong remains quiet with a heavy police presence on this, the 35th Tiananmen anniversary.</p>
    
</div>
    

<p>The economy boomed in the ensuing decades, turning a once impoverished country into the world’s second largest economy, but societal controls have been tightened since party leader Xi Jinping came to power in 2012.</p>



<p>Across China, the anniversary remains a taboo subject that is heavily censored. Any mention on social media is quickly erased.</p><p>Life appeared as normal in Beijing on Tuesday, with tourists lining the streets leading to gates to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, the former imperial palace across from it. The closest subway exit was closed, as was a viewing point atop Tiananmen Gate, according to a visitor registration website.</p>
    
<p>“As to the political disturbance that occurred in the late 1980s, the Chinese government has long had a clear conclusion,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said without elaborating. Asked about Western government statements on the anniversary, she added, “We are firmly opposed to anyone using this as a pretext to attack and smear China and interfere in China’s internal affairs.”</p>
    

<p>Tiananmen Mothers, a group formed by families of the victims, made an online appeal to the Chinese government to publish the names and total number of those who died, grant compensation to the victims and their relatives and pursue legal accountability for those responsible.</p><p>“The June 4 tragedy is a historical tragedy that the Chinese government must face and explain to its people, and some people in the government at that time should be held legally responsible for the indiscriminate killing of innocents,” the group said in a letter signed by 114 family members and published on its website, which is blocked in China.</p><p>Tiananmen memorials were also scrubbed out in Hong Kong — for years the only place in China where they could take place. A carnival organized by pro-Beijing groups was held Tuesday in a park that for decades was the site of a huge candlelight vigil marking the anniversary.</p><p>Police officers were out in force.</p><p>A woman who wore a T-shirt with the numbers 8964 in Roman numerals was taken away by police, and an elderly man was detained after holding up two handwritten posters. One read: “Remember 89! Mourn 64!” Hong Kong media said that activist Alexandra Wong, popularly known as “Grandma Wong,” was also removed after she chanted slogans.</p>
    

<p>An AP journalist saw another woman taken away after being searched.</p><p>“It’s different from the past,” said Hong Kong resident Keith Law. “Many people seem to act as if there’s nothing happening, including myself.”</p><p>After darkness fell, one person who lit a candle and two others who turned on their smartphone lights were quickly cordoned off by police and questioned outside the park. They were eventually released.</p><p>“My heart hasn’t died yet,” said one, former vigil-goer Edward Yeung.</p><p>Police said late Tuesday that they arrested four people aged between 23 and 69. Among them was a 68-year-old woman detained on suspicion of sedition under the city’s new national security law. Police said she had chanted slogans in public.</p><p>Two others were accused of assaulting police officers and disorderly conduct in a public place. The remaining suspect was arrested for alleged common assault. Police didn’t identify them.</p>
    

<p>Authorities also said five other people suspected of “breaching public peace” were taken for further investigation, but all were later released. </p><p>Rows of electronic candles lit up the dozens of windows of the American consulate, and the British consulate posted an image on the social media platform X of a hand holding up a smartphone with its light on and the Roman numerals “VIIV,” a reference to June 4. Hong Kong is a former British colony.</p><p>Some Hong Kong residents remembered the event privately, running 6.4 kilometers (4 miles) on Monday or sharing Tiananmen-related content on social media.</p><p>Hong Kong leader John Lee did not answer directly when asked Tuesday whether residents could still publicly mourn the crackdown. </p>
    

<p>“The threat to national security is real,” Lee said. </p><p>Commemorative events have <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/tiananmen-crackdown-1989-35th-anniversary-overseas-commemoration-0154eafea41ddcbc957a37b2df3811e1">grown overseas</a></span> in response to the silencing of voices in Hong Kong. </p><p>More than 100 people, including U.S. lawmakers and former students leaders of the Tiananmen movement, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/tiananmen-square-anniversary-china-washington-human-rights-269c79cd000728cdd720cd7b59211cb5">gathered in Washington</a></span> to light candles at the foot of a replica of the “Goddess of Democracy,” a statue of a woman holding a torch that was erected on the square during the 1989 protest.</p><p>“What has happened in China under the circumstances in the past 35 years has not been positive in terms of global democracy, in terms of human rights, in terms of promoting democratic freedoms,” said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a former House speaker and a longtime supporter of China’s pro-democracy movement.</p><p>In London, about 300 people outside the Chinese Embassy remembered the dead by turning on the flashlights of their mobile phones in place of candles. Some protesters read out a long list of names of those who died in the crackdown, while others chanted “Free China” and “Free Hong Kong.”</p><p>In Taiwan, a self-governing democratic island that China claims as its territory, people laid flowers and put electronic candles on the numbers 8964 — representing June 4, 1989 — on a banner spread on the ground in Taipei, the capital. </p><p>“As long as other places can still protest, we must continue to protest,” resident Leo Chiang said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Leung reported from Hong Kong.

We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">OpenAI defended its practices in a statement, saying that it had avenues such as a tipline to report issues at the company and that it did not release new technology until there were appropriate safeguards. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Google</a> did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“We’re proud of our track record providing the most capable and safest AI systems and believe in our scientific approach to addressing risk. We agree that rigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology and we’ll continue to engage with governments, civil society and other communities around the world,” an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/openai" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">OpenAI</a> spokesperson said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Concern over the potential harms of artificial intelligence have existed for decades, but the AI boom of recent years has intensified those fears and left regulators scrambling to catch up with technological advancements. While AI companies have publicly stated their commitment to safely developing the technology, researchers and employees have warned about a lack of oversight as AI tools exacerbate existing social harms or create entirely new ones.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The letter from current and former AI company employees, which was first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/technology/openai-culture-whistleblowers.html?" data-link-name="in body link">reported by the New York Times</a>, calls for increased protections for workers at advanced AI companies who decide to voice safety concerns. It asks for a commitment to four principles around transparency and accountability, including a provision that companies will not force employees to sign any non-disparagement agreements that prohibit airing risk-related AI issues and a mechanism for employees to anonymously share concerns with board members.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“So long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public,” the letter states. “Yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues.”</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Companies such as OpenAI have also pursued aggressive tactics to prevent employees from speaking freely about their work, with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/17/24158478/openai-departures-sam-altman-employees-chatgpt-release" data-link-name="in body link">Vox reporting last week</a> that OpenAI made employees who leave the company sign extremely restrictive non-disparagement and non-disclosure documents or lose all their vested equity. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, apologized following the report, saying that he would change off-boarding procedures.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The letter comes after two top OpenAI employees, co-founder Ilya Sutskever and key safety researcher Jan Leike, resigned from the company last month. After his departure, Leike alleged that OpenAI had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/18/openai-putting-shiny-products-above-safety-says-departing-researcher" data-link-name="in body link">abandoned a culture of safety</a> in favor of “shiny products”.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The open letter on Tuesday echoed some of Leike’s statement, saying that companies did not display any obligation to be transparent about their operations.</p></div></div>
