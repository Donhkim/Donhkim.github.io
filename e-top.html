<li><strong>Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion</strong>: Roberts argued that a former president is entitled to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his constitutional authority, but not for unofficial acts.</li>
<li><strong>The ruling has been criticized as undermining democratic principles</strong>: Dissenting judges argued that the decision sets a "dangerous precedent" by suggesting that no person, including a former president, is above the law.</li>
<li><strong>The ruling is seen as a significant escalation of the Supreme Court's role in the 2024 presidential election</strong>: The court has now twice intervened in cases related to Trump's actions following the 2020 election, highlighting the justices' increased influence in the upcoming election.</li>

President Joe Biden said the justices set “a dangerous precedent (that) undermines the rule of this nation.”</p>



<p>The ruling reflected a muscular view of presidential power, and left dissenting judges to criticize it as undermining a core democratic principle that no person is above the law.</p>
    

<p>The court’s decision highlighted how the justices have been thrust into an impactful role in the November presidential election. Earlier, they had <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-insurrection-election-colorado-51e79c0f03013034c8a042cb278b6446">rejected efforts to bar him from the ballot</a></span> because of his actions following the 2020 election. The court last week also limited an obstruction charge faced by Trump and used against hundreds of his supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The split among the justices also in many ways mirrored the political divide in the country.</p>
    
<p>“Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of presidential power entitles a former president to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court. “And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.”</p>
    

<p>The chief justice insisted that the president “is not above the law.” But in a fiery dissent for the court’s three liberals, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-immunity-trump-president-jan-6-2350bee785c85282a97af9485b94b982">Justice Sonia Sotomayor</a></span> wrote, “In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law.”</p><p>Reading from her opinion in the courtroom, Sotomayor said, “Because our Constitution does not shield a former president from answering for criminal and treasonous acts, I dissent.” Sotomayor said the decision “makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of government, that no man is above the law.”</p><p>The protection afforded presidents by the court, she said, “is just as bad as it sounds, and it is baseless.”</p>
    
<p>Trump posted in all capital letters on his social media network shortly after the decision was released: “BIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY. PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!”</p><p>Biden, in evening remarks from the White House, cited accepted restraints on presidential power all the way back to George Washington and bemoaned that “for all practical purposes, today’s decision almost certainly means that there are virtually no limits on what a president can do.”</p><p>Smith’s office declined to comment on the ruling.</p>
    

<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer denounced the ruling as “a disgraceful decision,” made with the help of the three justices that Trump appointed.</p><p>“It undermines SCOTUS’s credibility and suggests political influence trumps all in our courts today,” the New York Democrat said on X.</p><p>The justices knocked out one aspect of the indictment. The opinion found Trump is “absolutely immune” from prosecution for alleged conduct involving discussions with the Justice Department.</p><p>Trump is also “at least presumptively immune” from allegations that he tried to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to reject certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s electoral vote win on Jan. 6, 2021. Prosecutors can try to make the case that Trump’s pressure on Pence still can be part of the case against him, Roberts wrote.</p><p>The court directed a fact-finding analysis on one of the more striking allegations in the indictment -- that Trump participated in a scheme to enlist fake electors in battleground states won by Biden who would falsely assert that Trump had won. Both sides had dramatically different interpretations as to whether that effort could be construed as official, and the conservative justices said determining which side is correct would require additional analysis at the trial court level.</p>
    

<p>Roberts’ opinion further restricted prosecutors by prohibiting them from using any official acts as evidence in trying to prove a president’s unofficial actions violated the law. One example not relevant to this case but which came up in arguments was the hypothetical payment of a bribe in return for an ambassadorial appointment.</p><p>Under Monday’s decision, a former president could be prosecuted for accepting a bribe, but prosecutors could not mention the official act, the appointment, in their case.</p>
    

<p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the rest of Roberts’ opinion, parted company on this point. “The Constitution does not require blinding juries to the circumstances surrounding conduct for which Presidents can be held liable,” Barrett wrote. </p><p>She also described as unnecessary the analysis of the fake electors claim. “I see no plausible argument for barring prosecution of that alleged conduct,” Barrett wrote.</p><p>The work of figuring out how to proceed will fall to U.S. District Judge <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-indictment-judge-tanya-chutkan-capitol-riot-9ba5c18d315697d759521425ea203012">Tanya Chutkan</a></span>, who would preside over Trump’s trial.</p><p>Trump still could face a trial, said Notre Dame law professor Derek Muller. “But the fact remains that it is almost impossible to happen before the election.”</p><p>David Becker, an election law expert and the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research, called the breadth of immunity granted to Trump “incredibly broad” and “deeply disturbing.”</p><p>“Almost anything that a president does with the executive branch is characterized as an official act,” he said on a call with reporters following the ruling. He said that “for any unscrupulous individual holding the seat of the Oval Office who might lose an election, the way I read this opinion is it could be a roadmap for them seeking to stay in power.”</p><p>The ruling was the last of the term, and it came more than two months after the court heard arguments, far slower than in other epic high court cases involving the presidency, including <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/john-dean-richard-nixon-government-and-politics-crime-c7a7b99cca7c685cfc239f5e08b53378">the Watergate tapes case</a></span>. </p><p>The Republican former president has denied doing anything wrong and has said this prosecution and three others are politically motivated to try to keep him from returning to the White House. </p><p>In May, Trump became the first former president to be <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0">convicted of a felony</a></span>, in a New York court.

The Washington case focuses on Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election after he lost to Biden. The case in Florida revolves around the mishandling of classified documents. A separate case, in Georgia, also turns on Trump’s actions after his defeat in 2020.</p><p>If Trump’s Washington trial does not take place before the 2024 election and he is not given another four years in the White House, he presumably would stand trial soon thereafter. </p><p>But if he wins, he could appoint an attorney general who would seek the dismissal of this case and the other federal prosecution he faces. He could also attempt to pardon himself if he reclaims the White House. He could not pardon himself for the conviction in state court in New York.</p><p>The Supreme Court that heard the case included three justices appointed by Trump — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett — and two justices who opted not to step aside after questions were raised about their impartiality.</p><p>Thomas’ wife, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-fraud-mark-meadows-c734294e2810f1240ea7ed1cbf675760">Ginni</a></span>, attended the rally near the White House where Trump spoke on Jan. 6, 2021, though she did not go the Capitol when <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-confirm-joe-biden-78104aea082995bbd7412a6e6cd13818">a mob of Trump supporters</a></span> attacked it soon after.

            Beryl’s arrival marks an exceptionally early start to the Atlantic hurricane season.

The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/13/weather/el-nino-la-nina-summer-forecast-climate/index.html">abnormally warm ocean waters</a> that facilitated Beryl’s alarming strengthening are a clear indicator that this hurricane season will be far from normal in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution.

            Beryl is the earliest major hurricane – defined as one that is Category 3 or higher – in the Atlantic in 58 years. The storm’s rapid intensification is very atypical this early into hurricane season, according to National Hurricane Center Director Mike Brennan. It’s rare for tropical systems to form in the central Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles in June, particularly strong ones, as only a handful of tropical systems have done so, <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes/#map=3.76/10.35/-48.52&amp;search=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" target="_blank">according to NOAA records</a>.

            The storm isn’t just early for this season. It is now the Atlantic Ocean’s third-earliest major hurricane. The earliest was Hurricane Alma on June 8, 1966, followed by Hurricane Audrey, which reached major hurricane status on June 27, 1957.

<li>There are concerns within the Democratic party about President Joe Biden's ability to run a successful re-election campaign, particularly after his recent debate performance.</li>
<li>If Biden were to step down or be replaced, it could create a logistical nightmare and potentially set off an internal party fight among Democrats.</li>
<li>Several Democrats have expressed concerns about Biden's age (81) and whether he is the right candidate to face off against former President Donald Trump in the upcoming election.</li>
<li>Defeating Trump is a key consideration for many Democrats, with some arguing that the party needs a strong candidate to win in November.</li>
<li>There are various ways Biden could be replaced on the ticket, including a vice presidential swap or a new candidate altogether, but this is considered unlikely at this point in the election cycle.</li>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court">The Supreme Court</a></span> on Monday kept on hold efforts by Texas and Florida to limit how Facebook, TikTok, X, YouTube and other <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/media">social media platforms</a></span> regulate content posted by their users in a ruling that strongly defended the platforms’ free speech rights.</p><p>Writing for the court, Justice Elena Kagan said the platforms, like newspapers, deserve protection from governments’ intrusion in determining what to include or exclude from their space. “The principle does not change because the curated compilation has gone from the physical to the virtual world,” Kagan wrote in an opinion signed by five justices. All nine justices agreed on the overall outcome.</p><p>The justices <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24785405-moody-v-netchoice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned the cases to lower courts</a></span> for further review in broad challenges from trade associations for the companies.</p><p>While the details vary, both laws aimed to address long-standing conservative complaints that the social media companies were liberal-leaning and censored users based on their viewpoints, especially on the political right. The cases are among several this term in which the justices are wrestling with standards for free speech in the digital age.</p>




    

<p>The Florida and Texas laws were signed by Republican governors in the months following decisions by Facebook and Twitter, now X, to cut then-President Donald Trump off over his posts related to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege">the Jan. 6, 2021, attack</a></span> on the U.S. Capitol by <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-confirm-joe-biden-78104aea082995bbd7412a6e6cd13818">his supporters</a></span>.</p>
    
<p>Trade associations representing the companies sued in federal court, claiming that the laws violated the platforms’ speech rights. One federal appeals court struck down Florida’s statute, while another upheld the Texas law. But <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-technology-texas-amy-coney-barrett-da10a0389ea3a89e507e8ddf969bff6a">both were on hold</a></span> pending the outcome at the Supreme Court.</p><p>While the cases are complicated, said First Amendment expert and Notre Dame Law School professor Richard W. Garnett, the justices were clear on two things:</p>
    
<p>“First, the First Amendment protects what we choose to say, but also what we choose not to say, support, or endorse. That is, the freedom of speech includes editorial judgment. This is true whether the speaker is a lone individual or a large media company,” he said. “Second, the government is not permitted to regulate speakers simply to produce what the government thinks would be a better, or more diverse, marketplace of ideas. What’s on offer in that marketplace is, in the end, up to us.”</p>
    

<p>In a statement when he signed the Florida measure into law, Gov. Ron DeSantis said it would be “protection against the Silicon Valley elites.” </p><p>When Gov. Greg Abbott signed the Texas law, he said it was needed to protect free speech in what he termed the new public square. Social media platforms “are a place for healthy public debate where information should be able to flow freely — but there is a dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas,” Abbott said. “That is wrong, and we will not allow it in Texas.”</p><p>But much has changed since then. Elon Musk purchased Twitter and, besides changing its name, eliminated teams focused on content moderation, welcomed back many users previously banned for hate speech and used the site to spread conspiracy theories. </p>
    

<p>President Joe Biden’s administration sided with the challengers, though it cautioned the court to seek a narrow ruling that maintained governments’ ability to impose regulations to ensure competition, preserve data privacy and protect consumer interests. Lawyers for Trump filed a brief in the Florida case that had urged the Supreme Court to uphold the state law.</p><p>Free speech advocates hailed the ruling as a victory.</p><p>“The court’s recognition that the government cannot control social media in an effort to impose its own vision of what online speech should look like is crucial to protecting all of our right to speak our minds and access information on the internet,” said Vera Eidelman, staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “The court’s recognition that the government cannot control social media in an effort to impose its own vision of what online speech should look like is crucial to protecting all of our right to speak our minds and access information on the internet.”</p>
    

<p>Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the nonprofit media advocacy group Free Press said that while the decision “rests on procedural grounds, Justice Kagan’s comprehensive opinion for the Court explains in very clear terms why the Florida and Texas laws will have a tough time ever passing First Amendment muster. That’s a very good thing.”</p><p>But it’s a “bumpy win,” noted Gus Hurwitz, academic director of the Center for Technology, Innovation &amp; Competition at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. He said the justices were “clearly frustrated” that the case came to them as a facial challenge — where the plaintiff argues that the law is unconstitutional — vacating both cases and sending them back to be “more fully developed.” </p>
    

<p>“Five of the justices sign on to the direct statement that ‘Texas does not like the way those platforms are selecting and moderating content, and wants them to create a different expressive product, communicating different values and priorities. But under the First Amendment, that is a preference Texas may not impose,” Hurwitz said. “It is hard to see how this doesn’t dictate the ultimate resolution of the case, and clearly foreshadows a rocky road ahead for these statutes if Texas and Florida continue to press forward with them.”</p><p>The cases are among several the justices have grappled with over the past year involving social media platforms, including one decided last week in which the court threw out a lawsuit from <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-social-media-biden-administration-453b6ae8794548f960c4ebf72a534aff">Louisiana, Missouri</a></span> and other parties accusing federal officials of pressuring social media companies to silence conservative points of view.</p><p>During arguments in February, the justices seemed inclined to prevent the laws from taking effect. Several justices suggested then that they viewed the platforms as akin to newspapers that have broad free-speech protections, rather than like telephone companies, known as common carriers, that are susceptible to broader regulation.</p><p>But two justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, appeared more ready to embrace the states’ arguments. Thomas raised the idea that the companies are seeking constitutional protection for “censoring other speech.” Alito also equated the platforms’ content moderation to censorship.</p><p>The justices also worried about too broad a ruling that might affect businesses that are not the primary targets of the laws, including e-commerce sites like Uber and Etsy and email and messaging services. </p><h2>___</h2><p>AP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay contributed to this story. </p><p>Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court">https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court</a></span>.</p>

<p>Le Pen, trailed by the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition with about 29 percent and President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Ensemble alliance with about 20.5 percent, called on the French citizens to vote for her party during the second round.</p>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<p>Despite his defeat, Macron welcomed the high turnout of 65.8 percent, and reiterated his call to stand up to the far right in the second round.</p>
<p>“Faced with National Rally, the time has come for a great union, clearly democratic and republican for the second round,” the president stressed in an official statement.</p>
<p>Jean-Luc Melenchon, the leader of the centre left, said the president suffered a “hard and indisputable defeat” and was to blame for the shock decision to dissolve parliament, but stopping the far right was the priority.</p>
<p>“Not one more vote for the RN, not one more seat for the RN,” he emphasised.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<h2 id="chaos-and-failure">‘Chaos and failure’</h2>
<p>The RN breakthrough was welcomed on the hard right of European politics.</p>
<p>Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, expressed “optimism” following the first-round result.</p>
<p>Orban’s comments came as Hungary took over the European Union’s rotating presidency amid widespread concerns over what critics see as the country’s authoritarian, Russia-friendly government.</p>
<p>“Things cannot go on like this in Brussels, things have to change. That is why the Belgian prime minister fell, that is why the French government fell,” Orban told Hungarian television channel M1 in an interview Monday night.</p>
<p>“The first source of our optimism is that people want change. But the bureaucrats in Brussels think otherwise, they do not want change,” he said. “But that adds to our optimism because it makes the fact that change is needed even more obvious.”</p>
<p>Fellow right-winger, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, claimed that attempts to “demonise” hard right voters were failing.</p>
<p class="p1">“The constant attempt to demonise and corner people who don’t vote for the left… is a trick that fewer and fewer people fall for,” Meloni told the Adnkronos news agency.</p>
<p class="p1">In the United Kingdom, Opposition and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said RN’s advance in France was proof the left must show “only progressives have answers” to problems in the UK and across Europe. The UK general election takes place on Thursday.</p>
<p>“We have to make that progressive call. But we have to, in making that, understand why it is, certainly in the United Kingdom after 14 years of chaos and failure, that people do feel disaffected with politics, return politics to service, and continue to make that argument that politics is a force for good,” he said.</p>

<p>Israel’s diaspora minister Amichai Chikli said he was “impressed” by the positions adopted by Le Pen, adding that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was also seemingly “of the same opinion”.</p>
<p>Chikli told Kan public broadcaster on Monday that it would be “excellent for Israel” <a href="/features/2024/6/14/france-far-right-election">if Le Pen became president in France</a> – the next elections for the top job are in 2027 – given her “firm stance” against Hamas, the International Criminal Court, and anti-Semitism. Most Jewish leaders in France itself are against Le Pen and the RN.</p>
<p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, meanwhile, issued a warning about the far right.</p>
<p>“They love Putin, money and power without control. And they are already in power or are reaching for it in the East or West of Europe,” he wrote in a post online.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>“They are joining ranks in the European Parliament. In Poland, we reversed this fatal tide at the very last moment. Let’s not waste it,” he added.</p>
<p>Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his cabinet appeared to be respecting an unofficial ban on commenting on foreign elections.</p>
<p>But Michael Roth, a member of Scholz’s Social Democrats, said blamed the party for not better supporting Macron.</p>
<p>“We don’t show enough consideration to the political debates and problems of other countries,” he added, noting that the alternative to Macron “is indeed no longer [former French President Nicolas] Sarkozy but rather a hard-right nationalist like Marine Le Pen”.</p>
<p>Spain’s socialist leader, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, also saw a warning in the far-right win in France.</p>
<p>“The advance of the far right in France isn’t unconnected with what’s happening in other parts of the world – including in Spain – where we’re seeing how, directly or indirectly … the far right is advancing institutionally and in the opinion polls,” he said in an interview with the Cadena Ser radio network.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, French and European markets had a favourable reaction to the result of the election on Monday.</p>
<p>French stocks and the euro rallied, with the CAC 40 index, which represents 40 of the biggest companies listed in Paris, rising 2.7 percent at the open before cooling slightly.</p>
<p>The euro, which had taken a hit after <a href="/news/2024/6/9/frances-macron-calls-for-snap-elections-after-far-right-surge-in-eu-vote">Macron’s surprise announcement</a> on back of the European Parliament elections in early June, reached its strongest level against the United States dollar in more than two weeks.</p>
<p>European stocks traded higher as well, with Europe’s STOXX 600 index rebounding from losses last week, partly driven by the boost to the CAC 40 index.</p>

</div><p>Abu Selmia’s release triggered an uproar across Israel’s political spectrum. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office called it “a grave mistake.” Government ministers and opposition leaders expressed outrage and insisted Abu Selmia played a role in Hamas’ alleged use of the hospital — although Israeli security services rarely unilaterally free prisoners if they have a suspicion of militant links. </p><h2>Khan Younis evacuation</h2>
    
<p>Monday’s evacuation order covered the eastern half of Khan Younis and a large swath of the Gaza Strip’s southeast corner. Earlier in the day, the army said a barrage of rockets out of Gaza was fired from Khan Younis.</p><p>As night fell, streams of civilians trudged on foot beside a steady flow of vehicles as people began making their way out of the evacuation zone. A woman dragged a rolling suitcase with a little girl riding on top. Others carried a few crucial belongings — mattresses, clothing, plastic buckets for washing, an electric fan. Trucks were piled high with possessions and furniture.</p>

<p>More fighting in the Khan Younis area could further hamper Palestinians’ access to much-needed potable water. Included in the evacuation zone is a water line that Israel installed following criticism over its cutoff of water to the strip early in the war.</p><p>Also in the zone is the area surrounding the Kerem Shalom crossing, the major aid crossing to southern Gaza, and an aid route inside the territory that Israel has said it would safeguard.</p><p>Most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have fled their homes, with many displaced multiple times. Israeli restrictions, fighting and the breakdown of public order have hindered the delivery of humanitarian aid, fueling widespread hunger and sparking fears of famine.</p><p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the new evacuation order “just shows yet again that no place is safe in Gaza” for Palestinian civilians. “It’s another stop in this deadly circular movement that the population in Gaza has to undergo on a regular basis,” he said in a statement calling for a cease-fire.</p>
    

<h2>Shifa Hospital director’s release</h2><p>The decision to release Abu Selmia and 54 other Palestinian detainees back into Gaza appeared to be meant to free up space in overcrowded detention centers. Since the start of the war, Israeli forces have detained thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Many are being held without charge or trial in what is known as administrative detention.</p><p>“Our detainees have been subjected to all kinds of torture behind bars,” Abu Selmia told a news conference. “There was almost daily torture.”</p><p>He said guards used batons to beat detainees and terrorized them with dogs. He said some detainees had limbs amputated because of poor medical care. He said a beating caused his head to bleed and guards broke his finger.</p>
    

<p>The allegations could not be independently confirmed but matched other accounts of Palestinians who have been held in Israeli custody. There was no immediate response from the prison service, which has denied similar accusations.</p><p>Israeli forces raided <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-palestinians-war-hamas-militants-civilians-casualites-8469bbcb566446d78f368bf2a1b49d88">Shifa Hospital</a></span> in November, alleging that Hamas had created an elaborate command and control center inside. Abu Selmia and other staff denied the allegations and accused Israel of recklessly endangering thousands of patients and displaced people sheltering there. Abu Selmia was detained on Nov. 22.</p><p>After its first raid on Shifa Hospital, the military uncovered a tunnel beneath it leading to two empty rooms, as well as evidence that militants had brought wounded hostages to the facility. But <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-shifa-hospitals-a017ba154c816c8d565393917dadd9ee">the evidence fell short</a></span> of showing an extensive base as claimed. Israel has since raided other Gaza hospitals on similar allegations, forcing them to shut down or dramatically reduce services. </p><p>Amid the uproar over Abu Selmia’s release, the various Israeli state organs responsible for detentions scrambled to shift blame.</p><p>Netanyahu’s office said Abu Selmia “belongs in prison” and that the prime minister had ordered a thorough review into how the release happened. It said the decision was made “without the knowledge of the political echelon or the heads of the organizations.”</p><p>Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel’s far-right national security minister who controls the country’s police and prison service, blamed the Defense Ministry.</p><p>Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s office said prisoner releases are the responsibility of the prison service and the Shin Bet internal security agency. The prison service said the decision was made by the Shin Bet and the army, and released a document ordering his release that was signed by an army reserve general.</p><p>The Shin Bet said Abu Selmia had passed a risk assessment, “compared to other detainees.” It said the government had decided against its advice to release detainees determined to be less of a threat to free up space.</p><p>Israel launched its offensive after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people across southern Israel and took another 250 hostage. In its campaign, Israel has killed at least 37,900 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or fighters.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Magdy reported from Cairo and Frankel from Jerusalem.

<li>The UK general election campaign is nearing its end, with just three days to go until polling day.</li>
<li>The main parties, particularly the Conservative and Labour parties, are focusing on their core messages to appeal to key voters.</li>
<li>The parties are not introducing new policies, but rather repeating their core messages to influence voters' decisions.</li>
<li>The Conservative Party's message is likely to focus on stability, with Rishi Sunak claiming he will still be Prime Minister by the end of the week.</li>
<li>The election campaign has narrowed down to a few key areas, with the parties sticking to their well-established talking points and not introducing new policies or surprises.</li>

Instead it narrows as the parties - especially the two main parties - hone in on the core messages they hope will appeal to the crucial slices of the British public they need to win.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">If you hear Rishi Sunak or Sir Keir Starmer say something today, expect to hear them say it tomorrow and on Wednesday too. This is not a time for variation but for repetition.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">So what are those messages? Well, Mr Sunak believes he will still be prime minister by the end of the week. At least that’s what he told Laura Kuenssberg yesterday.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Look at the Conservative campaign as it enters the home stretch, though, and it is undeniably crouched in a defensive posture.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It is hard to believe that when Prime Minister Sunak walked into the Downing Street rain 40 days ago to announce this general election that he anticipated spending the final three days of the campaign warning of a Labour victory so large that Sir Keir might wield "unchecked" power.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Whatever they say publicly, the way the Conservatives are approaching this week shows that they believe the dire opinion polling is plausible at the very least.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Campaigning in the Midlands today Mr Sunak is warning that, whatever Nigel Farage claims, Reform UK cannot hope to be the true opposition because they "just won’t win enough votes to oppose Labour". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He is expected to say: "Just imagine that - hundreds and hundreds of Labour MPs opposed by just one, two, three, four, five elected [Reform] MPs."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Note that this argument takes as a given that there will be hundreds and hundreds of Labour MPs.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">That assumption speaks to the complicated multidirectional fight the Conservatives face at the moment: trying to stop voters heading to Labour but also using different arguments to stop other former Conservatives heading to Reform and, in other parts of the country, the Liberal Democrats.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The candidate controversies of recent days as well as Mr Farage’s claim that the west "provoked" the war in Ukraine have at least given the Conservatives something they struggled to find earlier in the campaign - a way to attack Reform UK. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Some Conservative candidates wish they had done so earlier.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">That is the public conversation taking place in the Conservative Party with three days to go. Then there is another conversation, which ranges from the semi-public to the private. What next? </p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/06/30/a-rushed-tory-leadership-contest-would-not-be-in-the-intere/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">In The Telegraph today</a>, Jesse Norman, a former minister standing for re-election, has written an 813-word article about the election. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Not the general election, which in his first line he appears to concede to Labour, but the Conservative leadership election he assumes would follow.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Norman moots the possibility that the role of Conservative Party members should be reduced, and that the leadership election should not be rushed. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Some of Mr Norman’s colleagues are less focused on the process but on the candidates - though that question would be shaped by who is left remaining in parliament on 5 July.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dKljgB"><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">What of Labour?</h2></p><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In one respect Labour's task is more straightforward. In England at least, it is fighting only in one direction - seeking to win over former Conservative voters. (Although there are some very quiet jitters about possible areas of Reform strength in some Labour seats, especially in South Yorkshire).</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In Labour’s campaign they are relieved and pleased that they have made it through the entire campaign with essentially one consistent one-word message: Change.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Note that in the final days the message is being adapted, though, to warn voters that if they want change “you have to vote for it”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">That betrays more than a flicker of concern that some potential Labour voters may see the result as a foregone conclusion and as a result stay at home or vote for another party. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The overwhelming approach is bullish though. For that just look at the fact that Sir Keir kicked off his campaigning today in Hitchin - a part of Hertfordshire which last had a Labour MP six years before Mr Sunak was born.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"></p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 cgtasL"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-13b8515c-1 bbjeKz"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0bf4/live/3bee0e80-37b5-11ef-868f-ed1b021482e9.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0bf4/live/3bee0e80-37b5-11ef-868f-ed1b021482e9.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0bf4/live/3bee0e80-37b5-11ef-868f-ed1b021482e9.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0bf4/live/3bee0e80-37b5-11ef-868f-ed1b021482e9.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0bf4/live/3bee0e80-37b5-11ef-868f-ed1b021482e9.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0bf4/live/3bee0e80-37b5-11ef-868f-ed1b021482e9.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0bf4/live/3bee0e80-37b5-11ef-868f-ed1b021482e9.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0bf4/live/3bee0e80-37b5-11ef-868f-ed1b021482e9.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Reuters Sir Keir Starmer speaking to journalists on a campaign visit in Little Horwood, Buckinghamshire" class="sc-13b8515c-0 hbOWRP"><span class="sc-13b8515c-2 iuvLSH">Reuters</span></div></div></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Labour has its own semi-public, semi-private conversation bubbling away too. Publicly it is still claiming, as Jon Ashworth did this morning, that the Conservatives could win the general election.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Privately, Labour circles are abuzz with conversations about preparations for government.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">This has been the fiefdom of Sue Gray, the chief-of-staff who Sir Keir controversially poached last year from a lifetime in the civil service. After 14 years in opposition, few senior members of the Labour Party, be they MPs or officials, have any experience of being in government - a key reason why Sir Keir hired Ms Gray.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Interestingly, should Labour win Ms Gray appears likely to be joined in Downing Street by Morgan McSweeney, who has run the party’s election campaign.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In that event, expect a potential Labour government to quickly claim that what they have uncovered on the government books is worse than they had expected - an argument the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/PJTheEconomist/status/1805523929982812462" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">pre-emptively questioned.</a></p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Labour strategists believe that David Cameron went a long way to securing the Conservatives’ 2015 election victory in the days after he became prime minister in 2010 - when he used the trappings of office to mount a concerted assault on Labour’s record. Expect the same again.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Of course, Labour may not get there. Only postal votes have so far been cast. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But make no mistake - from the way the two main parties are campaigning in these final days, they both believe this is the most plausible scenario.</p></div></article></div>

            Spirit AeroSystems makes major parts of several Boeing models, including the fuselages for the 737 Max. The parts are then shipped to Boeing’s factories for assembly. The company also makes parts for Boeing’s rival Airbus, although Boeing is Spirit’s largest customer.

            Boeing had sought to get more money from rival Airbus for its part of Spirit, said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace industry consultant. Airbus’ business with Spirit accounted for $1.1 billion, 19% of its revenue in 2023, according to company filings, while $3.9 billion, or 64% came from business with Boeing. But Spirit was unwilling to contribute to the deal that Boeing was desperate to complete.

            Spirit has had its own series of quality control issues in recent years, and Boeing had agreed to pay the company more money to try to improve Spirit’s quality and reliability issues, which had damaged Boeing’s output and reputation.

            Those payments are an indication of Boeing’s motivation for a deal for Spirit. It can’t return to profitability itself, or fix its own quality issues needed to assure regulators, airlines and the flying public about the safety of its aircraft, unless problems at Spirit are also fixed. And it’s going to cost Boeing money to fix those problems, whether it is the largest customer, or the owner, of those operations.

            Boeing said last week two different groups of employees were charged with doing work to the door plug, which is a part that is used in place of an emergency exit door. The first group of employees removed the door plug to address problems with rivets that were made by Spirit AeroSystems. But the Boeing staff <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/business/boeing-cause-alaska-air-door-plug/index.html">didn’t generate the paperwork</a> indicating they had removed the door plug, along with the four bolts necessary to hold it in place, in order to do that work. So the second group of employees replaced it, unaware the bolts were missing.

            Spirit has been involved in other safety problems for Boeing. In 2023 it used a “non-standard manufacturing process” when joining parts of the fuselages of 737 Max jets, leading Boeing to halt deliveries of the planes. Earlier this year, a Spirit employee notified Boeing that two holes may not have been drilled exactly to Boeing’s requirements, which required Boeing to rework about 50 planes that had not yet been delivered.
