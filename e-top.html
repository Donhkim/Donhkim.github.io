<ol>
<li><strong>Coordinated attacks</strong>: Six police officers, a national guard member, and a priest were killed in what appear to be coordinated attacks on a synagogue, an Orthodox church, and a police post in Dagestan, Russia.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple locations</strong>: The attacks took place in the cities of Derbent and Makhachkala, with the synagogue and church targeted in Derbent and a police post attacked in Makhachkala, around 125km apart.</li>
<li><strong>Casualties and damage</strong>: Twelve people were wounded, and the synagogue in Derbent was set on fire, with smoke rising from the church. Shots were fired at a second synagogue in Makhachkala, but there were no worshippers present.</li>
<li><strong>Attackers identified</strong>: Four of the attackers were shot dead in a subsequent shoot-out, and law enforcement agencies believe they were members of an "international terrorist organisation".</li>
<li><strong>Context</strong>: Dagestan has a history of separatist violence, and while violence had decreased in recent years, the region remains a flashpoint. The Israeli foreign ministry also condemned the attacks, expressing concern for the safety of Jewish communities in Russia.</li>

<p>Twelve people were wounded in the attacks, which took place in the cities of Derbent and Makhachkala on Sunday evening.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 3 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>Both the synagogue and the church are located in Derbent, which is home to ancient Jewish community in the mainly-Muslim North Caucasus region. The police post attack took place in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, approximately 125km (78 miles) away.</p>
<p>The synagogue in Derbent was set on fire as a result of the attack, local officials told the Reuters news agency, while eyewitnesses also reported that smoke was rising from the church.</p>
<p>Four of the attackers have been shot dead in a subsequent shoot-out, according to Russian news agencies quoting the local interior ministry. The Russian news agency TASS reported that the attackers were members of “an international terrorist organisation”, according to law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>The attackers in Derbent had earlier been seen fleeing in a car.</p>
<p>“Tonight in Derbent and Makhachkala, unknown people made attempts to destablise the public situation,” said the Head of the Republic of Dagestan, Sergei Melikov. “Dagestan police officers stood in their way. According to preliminary information, there are casualties among them. All services are acting in accordance with the instruction … The identities of the attackers are being established.”</p>
<p>The Israeli foreign ministry said the synagogue in Derbent had been burned to the ground and shots had been fired at a second synagogue in Makhachkala. The statement said it was believed there were no worshippers in the synagogue at the time.</p>
<p>Daniel Hawkins, reporting for Al Jazeera from Moscow, said that Dagestan has previously seen separatist violence in the 1990s and early 2000s, Hawkins noted.</p>
<p>“Violence there, as the years have gone on, has died down,” Hawkins said, explaining that the region never saw the kind of conflict that engulfed the neighbouring Russian republic of Chechnya, which saw Russian forces and separatists fight two brutal wars during the same period.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>“This sort of attack that’s coordinated and has targeted civilian religious infrastructure is very unusual and will no doubt be shocking to Russians across the country,” Hawkins said.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Definition of a heat wave</strong>: A heat wave is a prolonged period of abnormally hot weather, typically defined as a period of at least 2-3 days with temperatures above the average temperature of the region.</li>
<li><strong>Causes of heat waves</strong>: Heat waves are caused by a combination of factors, including high-pressure systems, temperature inversions, and climate change. They can occur anywhere in the world, but are more common in regions near the equator.</li>
<li><strong>Health risks associated with heat waves</strong>: Prolonged exposure to extreme heat can lead to serious health problems, including heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and even death. Vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and people with pre-existing medical conditions are at greater risk.</li>
<li><strong>Precautions to take during a heat wave</strong>: To stay safe during a heat wave, individuals can take precautions such as staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water, staying indoors during the hottest part of the day, and seeking shade or air-conditioned spaces. People should also check on vulnerable neighbors and loved ones to ensure their safety.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of climate change awareness</strong>: Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and duration of heat waves, making it essential to take steps to mitigate its effects. Individuals can contribute by reducing their carbon footprint, conserving energy, and supporting policies that address climate change.</li>

In New York, Mayor Eric Adams said city cooling centers were open Sunday and that some schools across the city have opened their doors as well.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Heat is the deadliest weather we have in New York City," Adams warned on social media. "If you don’t have an (air conditioning), don't sit at home in the heat − it can be deadly."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Arlington County, a suburb of Washington, declared a heat advisory Sunday with a warning that the heat index could reach 107 degrees. The actual temperature at Reagan National Airport reached 99, breaking the previous record for the date of 98 reached twice − in 1988 and 1874.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser extended the city's heat emergency and urged residents without air conditioning to seek relief in air conditioned buildings and the city's cooling centers. The city was bracing for the hottest day since Aug. 15, 2016, and could approach the all-time June record of 104 degrees, AccuWeather said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Bowser warned that extreme heat can have impacts on a person’s mental health, including increased irritability, aggression, depression, drug and alcohol use and even suicide. Some psychiatric medications can affect body temperature regulation, increasing the risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Stick to your treatment regimen and talk with your doctor about any concerns," Bowser said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A modicum of relief was in sight.

            Saudi Arabia said Sunday that more than 1,300 people died on this year’s Hajj pilgrimage – with “numerous cases” due to heat stress and “unauthorized” trips accounting for more than four out of five of the fatalities.
    </p>

            “The health system addressed numerous cases of heat stress this year, with some individuals still under care. Regrettably, the number of mortalities reached 1,301,” the Saudi government said in a statement as it released its first official figures.

            The statement said 83% of those who died were “unauthorized to perform Hajj” and “walked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort.” There were “several elderly and chronically ill individuals” among the deceased, it said, adding that the families of all the dead had now been identified.

            Extreme heat has been named as a main factor behind the hundreds of deaths and injuries reported this year during the Hajj. Mecca, the holy city that is central for Hajj pilgrims, saw temperatures soar to a record-setting 125 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday. Various authorities have also said the problems have been compounded by the number of unofficial pilgrimages.

            Saudi Arabia requires each pilgrim to acquire one of the 1.8 million available licenses to legally access Mecca. These licenses can cost several thousand US dollars. Unlicensed pilgrims typically don’t travel in organized tour buses with air conditioning or easy access to water and food supplies.

            The Saudi government also appeared to suggest the unauthorized nature of many of the trips had been a factor in how long it had taken to issue an official death toll as this had complicated the identification process.

            The report, which was reviewed by cabinet, said some operators had not issued correct visas, so holders could not enter the holy city of Mecca and were instead forced to enter “through desert paths on foot.” It also accused some companies of failing to provide proper accommodation, leaving tourists exposed to the heat.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>High-stakes debate</strong>: The debate between President Biden and former President Trump is seen as the highest-stakes moment of their rematch, with significant implications for the presidential election.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunity to reframe narrative</strong>: The debate presents an opportunity for both candidates to reframe the narrative about their presidency. For Biden, it's a chance to remind voters of Trump's "chaos" and "criminal convictions", while Trump sees it as an opportunity to argue that America has become "more expensive, weaker and more dangerous" under Biden.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of mistakes</strong>: The debate also poses risks for both candidates, given their advanced age (Biden is 82 and Trump is 76) and the unpredictability of the event. A notable mistake or gaffe could have lasting consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Mutual hatred</strong>: The debate is expected to be a contentious event, with a high level of animosity between the two candidates. This has the potential to lead to personal and potentially damaging exchanges.</li>
<li><strong>Unpredictability</strong>: The debate is less predictable than a traditional election-year debate, given the personal animosity and high stakes involved. The outcome is difficult to predict, and the debate could have significant implications for the election campaign.</li>

<p>Video posted on social media showed at least one person lying in the parking lot, while another captured multiple gunshots ringing out. Images from reporters on the scene showed a slew of bullet holes in the store’s window, and spent shell casings strewn throughout the parking lot. Local and state agencies could be seen responding, with at least one medical helicopter landing nearby.</p>
    
        
    
<p>The dead were identified as Shirley Taylor, 62; Callie Weems, 23; Roy Sturgis, 50; and Ellen Shrum, 81. They were all civilians, according to the statement. </p>
    
<p>The wounded range in age from 20 to 65, police said. Four were still hospitalized, including a woman who was in critical condition. </p><p>The wounded agents were identified as Fordyce Police Officer James Johnson, 31, who was released from a hospital Saturday evening; and Stuttgart Police Officer John Hudson, 24, whose injuries were said to be minor. </p><p>Police identified the suspect is Travis Eugene Posey, 44, of New Edinburg, and said he will be charged with four counts of capital murder. </p>
    

<p>“He was treated for non-life-threatening injuries after exchanging gunfire with law enforcement,” police said in the statement. Posey was released to police custody and taken to the Ouachita County Detention Center.</p><p>Authorities have not released a motive. A media briefing to update the public about the shooting was slated for 2 p.m. Sunday. </p><p>As of Friday, a state police spokesperson did not know if Posey had an attorney, and there was no immediate response to a phone message left with the agency’s public information office Saturday night. The Ouachita County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Posey was being held at the detention center, but said the office had no information about who might be representing him. An inmate record had yet to be posted online. </p><p>Roderick Rogers, a member of the city council, said he called the sheriff when employees at his restaurant nearby notified him of the shooting. When he got there, he saw people running for cover in every direction, even one running to the hospital nearby.</p><p>“People were just jumping into cars to get to safety,” Rogers said Friday.</p>

It blamed the US for the attack and said that the intercepted missile had been armed with a cluster munition warhead that exploded over the beach.</p><p>“Responsibility for the deliberate missile attack on civilians in Sevastopol lies primarily with Washington, which supplied these weapons to Ukraine, as well as the Kyiv regime,” it said. “Such actions will not go unanswered.”</p><figure class="caas-figure"><p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"><figcaption class="caption-collapse" data-id="m-1">A video still appears to show injured people</figcaption></p></figure><p>Vladimir Putin has not commented but Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said the Russian president had been informed of the attack and was in “constant contact” with his senior military, emergency and health care staff.</p><p>Many Russian tourists have shrugged off the dangers of Ukrainian missile attacks to take advantage of discounted package holidays to Crimea, famed across Russia for its golden beaches, clear water and blue skies.</p><p>At the time of the attack, the popular beaches outside Sevastopol, the biggest city in Crimea, were crowded at the start of the holiday season with families and children.</p><h2>‘I had eight wounded’</h2><p>Irina Frolova was swimming in the pool of a nearby hotel when she heard the Russian air defence systems hit the Ukrainian missile, followed by screams from the beach.</p><p>She said she rushed her children to their hotel room and then ran down to help.</p><p>“I went to the beach because I’m a medic,” she told the Izvestia newspaper. “There were a lot of wounded people there and by the time I arrived, they had already been taken off the beach to the parking lot. I had eight wounded people.”</p><p>Ms Frolova then described how a woman died in front of her. “There were mostly shrapnel wounds, a woman was hit in the neck by a double shrapnel. She died,” she said.</p><h2>Concerns in Washington</h2><p>Ukraine frequently targets Sevastopol, the main base for Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, but it usually fires its missiles at night and not in the middle of the day.</p><p>Russia’s Ministry of Defence said that the missile attack on Sunday had occurred just after midday. Ukraine has not commented but the strike will reignite concerns in Washington about relaxing rules it has laid out to Ukraine over how it uses US-made kit to hit Russia.</p><p>Ukraine wants to be given more freedom to strike targets deeper in Russia but Washington is concerned this will escalate the war.</p><p>Washington considers Crimea, annexed by the Kremlin in 2014, to be part of Ukraine and allows Ukrainian commanders to strike it with US-made missiles.</p><figure class="caas-figure"></figure><p><a href="https://secure.telegraph.co.uk/customer/subscribe/3months/?WT.mc_id=tmg_yahoo_subsoffers_-Yahoo&amp;utm_source=tmgoff&amp;utm_medium=tmg_yahoo&amp;utm_content=subsoffers_&amp;utm_campaign=tmg_yahoo_subsoffers_-Yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

<p>China and the European Union will consult on the latter's investigation into Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) after preliminary tariffs are announced.</p>
<p>On June 22, China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao was invited to hold a video talk with Valdis Dombrovskis, executive vice president of the European Commission.</p>

<p>The two sides agreed to initiate consultations on the EU's anti-subsidy investigation case against China's EVs, according to a brief statement on China's Ministry of Commerce <a href="http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/article/xwfb/xwbldhd/202406/20240603518157.shtml">website</a>.</p>
<p>On June 12, the European Commission pre-disclosed the <a href="https://cnevpost.com/2024/06/12/eu-to-impose-additional-tariffs-on-chinese-evs/">level of provisional anti-subsidy duties</a> to be imposed on imports of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from China.</p>
<p>If discussions with the Chinese authorities do not lead to an effective solution, these provisional anti-subsidy duties will be introduced from July 4, according to the European Commission's statement at the time.</p>
<p>The final measures should be implemented within four months of the imposition of the provisional duties, according to the European Commission's statement.</p>
<p>Following the release of the EU's statement, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce said that China is highly concerned and strongly dissatisfied, and that China's industry is deeply disappointed and resolutely opposed to this.</p>
<p>China urges the EU to immediately correct its wrong practices and properly handle economic and trade frictions through dialog and consultation, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The EU originally imposed a 10 percent tariff on BEVs imported from China, and in the newly announced provisional tariffs, different car companies face different rates.</p>
<p><a href="https://cnevpost.com/byd/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="">BYD</a>, Geely and SAIC, which were sampled and cooperated with the investigation, will be subject to additional tariffs of 17.4 percent, 20 percent and 38.1 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Other Chinese BEV producers that cooperated in the investigation but have not been sampled will pay a weighted average duty of 21 percent, with <a href="https://cnevpost.com/nio/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="">Nio</a> (NYSE: NIO) and <a href="https://cnevpost.com/xpeng/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="">Xpeng</a> (NYSE: XPEV) falling into this category.</p>
<p>All other BEV producers in China which did not cooperate in the investigation would be subject to 38.1 percent residual duty.</p>
