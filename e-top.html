    <div><section class="content__body"><p>Hunter Biden's defense team called Naomi Biden, his daughter with ex-wife Kathleen Buehl, to testify Friday at his trial on charges related to his <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hunter-biden-trial-gun-charges/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">October 2018 purchase of a firearm</a></span>. Much of the questioning focused on a trip Hunter Biden took to New York to exchange cars with his daughter, who had borrowed his truck for a few days during the window of time in October that Hunter Biden was in possession of the firearm.</p><p>Over the weekend or on Monday morning, Hunter Biden's lawyers will reveal whether he'll take the stand in his own defense. President Biden's brother, James "Jimmy" Biden was expected to testify Friday, but the court adjourned earlier than expected. If Hunter Biden testifies, prosecutors indicated they may call an additional witness. </p><h2><strong>Naomi Biden testifies</strong></h2><p>Hunter Biden's lawyers asked Naomi Biden about her interactions with her father in August and October 2018. Naomi Biden, who is also a lawyer, testified about seeing her father in Los Angeles in August 2018, after not having seen him for an extended period of time. She said she and her boyfriend Peter Neal, who is now her <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bidens-granddaughter-naomi-ties-knot-in-white-house-wedding/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">husband</a></span>, drove from Wyoming to see her father while he was in rehab for drug addiction. They met at the end of August in a coffee shop with his sober coach for lunch. </p>    
  <p>"He seemed like the clearest that I had seen him since my uncle died," she said. "I told him that I was so proud of him and I was so proud to introduce Peter to him." </p><p>She later described an interaction with him in mid-October 2018 in New York, when they exchanged Hunter Biden's truck for the Cadillac that belonged to her grandfather, Joe Biden, who was then the former vice president. <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hallie-biden-hunter-biden-gun-charges-beau-biden-widow/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Hallie Biden</a></span>, who was romantically involved with Hunter Biden at the time, testified that <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hallie-biden-hunter-biden-federal-gun-trial-testimony/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">she found the gun in his truck</a></span> and discarded it on Oct. 23 — 11 days after he bought it. The messages exchanged between Naomi Biden and her father related to the car exchange in New York took place over three days, between Oct. 17-19, during the period when he had the gun in his possession.</p>

    </p>
<p>Naomi Biden and Neal had borrowed Hunter Biden's truck to help Neal move his belongings from Washington, D.C., so that he could join her in New York. Naomi Biden said the truck was in "good condition," with no drug paraphernalia, and her father seemed great at that time. </p><p>But under cross examination by prosecutor Leo Wise, Naomi Biden conceded, "Yes, I knew that he was struggling with addiction," but said he never used illegal drugs in front of her. "After my Uncle (Beau Biden) died, things got bad." She acknowledged that she had never observed what her father looked like when he was using drugs. </p><p>Naomi Biden began speaking more and more softly as the cross examination continued, but she maintained her composure, even when she was asked to review her text messages with her father from Oct. 18, 2018. Wise focused on this visit to try to establish that Hunter Biden was still an addict and the drug paraphernalia later found in the truck belonged to him.</p><p>There were text messages coming from Hunter Biden late at night, and their schedules made it difficult for the two to meet, in part, Naomi Biden said later, because she had a law internship in Brooklyn. Wise read one text from Naomi Biden that said in part, "I just want to hang out with you." Hunter Biden allegedly replied with an apology for being unreachable. "I'm sorry, I have been so unreachable, it's not fair to you," he wrote at about 10:30 p.m. on the evening of Oct. 18.</p>

    </p>
<p>Wise pressed her on whether she knew that at that time her father was meeting someone named Frankie (an alleged drug dealer) that night at his hotel and had given him access to his Wells Fargo account. She repeatedly replied, "No." </p><p>During these exchanges, at times Hunter Biden leaned forward on the defense table, his eyes on his daughter with his hand covering his mouth. The mood in the Biden family section where the first lady and other members of the Biden family were seated was notably tense during Naomi Biden's testimony. </p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/07/12e32546-ee54-4299-b9bd-0d279c64bcff/thumbnail/620x349/081ae04b891b830033a03f3343654d08/pxl-20240607-1849117202.jpg?v=94cbb61397dbf7eca3740fa55510ba88#" alt="pxl-20240607-1849117202.jpg " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/07/12e32546-ee54-4299-b9bd-0d279c64bcff/thumbnail/620x349/081ae04b891b830033a03f3343654d08/pxl-20240607-1849117202.jpg?v=94cbb61397dbf7eca3740fa55510ba88 1x, https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/07/12e32546-ee54-4299-b9bd-0d279c64bcff/thumbnail/1240x698/65905deacb445d9e9213ee84ba10096f/pxl-20240607-1849117202.jpg?v=94cbb61397dbf7eca3740fa55510ba88 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

              </figcaption></figure><p>When Naomi Biden was excused, she hugged her father and they exchanged a kiss on the cheek before she walked out. Once court adjourned for lunch, Hunter Biden reached for Jill Biden as he exited, taking her hand. She was walking slowly, letting go as he moved ahead. </p><p>Before Naomi Biden's testimony, Jason Turner, a former employee of StarQuest Shooters, and Ron Palmieri, the owner of the gun store, were the defense's first two witnesses. Turner testified about the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hunter-biden-federal-gun-trial-opening-statements/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">gun sale</a></span> and background check for Hunter Biden's gun purchase, and he acknowledged that he had added the supplemental ID information; it was shown in a court exhibit. Palmieri testified that he had approved the passport used as ID for the purchase and never interacted with Hunter Biden during the sale.</p><p>The prosecution's last two witnesses Friday morning were a chemist for the FBI and a DEA agent. </p><p>Dr. Jason Brewer testified that he identified a "minimal amount" of cocaine from his analysis of the white residual powder on the leather pouch that was recovered with the gun. He said he wasn't authorized to test for fingerprints or the residue origins. During cross examination by David Kolansky, the defense pointed to the timing of the forensic analysis — five years after its initial recovery by law enforcement.</p><p>DEA supervisory agent Joshua Romig decoded some of the language in Hunter Biden's 2018-2019 text messages, in which he referenced "baby powder," "soft stuff" and "party favor." Romig said all of these terms referenced some form of cocaine. </p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'>
    </p>
<p>He testified on the origins, transport and distribution of cocaine and analyzed some of the drug paraphernalia, scales and measurements depicted in photos in Biden's text messages. During cross examination, Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, again focused on timing, noting that texts and images referenced by the prosecution were exchanged before and after the October purchase of the firearm. Romig noted the exception of one October text in which Hunter Biden explicitly mentioned he was smoking crack cocaine.</p><h2>What are the charges against Hunter Biden?</h2><p>Hunter Biden is charged with three felonies stemming from his purchase of a revolver in October 2018. Two of the charges are related to accusations that he made false statements on a federal gun form about his drug use, certifying he was not a user of or addicted to any controlled substance during a period when prosecutors allege he was addicted to crack cocaine. </p><p>The other charge is for allegedly owning the gun unlawfully, possessing the gun for 11 days before Hallie Biden found and discarded the weapon. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges. </p><p>Hallie Biden, who is also the widow of Beau Biden, Hunter Biden's brother, testified Thursday that she "panicked" when she found the gun, saying it was "stupid" but she was worried one of the children would find it. </p><p>She told the court she discovered it when she was clearing out his car, which she often searched for drugs and alcohol. Prosecutors introduced parking lot surveillance footage that showed her driving into a grocery store parking lot and tossing the gun into a dumpster, followed by another clip showing her returning to the store to search for the gun.</p><p>While Hunter Biden's history of drug addiction is well known — he wrote about it in his memoir, "Beautiful Things" — Lowell has sought to raise questions about whether he knowingly omitted the information from the disclosure form. In his opening statement, Lowell said that many addicts are in "denial" about their drug use, and he also argued that Hunter Biden did not consider himself to be an addict when he purchased the gun.</p><p>Prosecutors showed texts Thursday between Hunter Biden and Hallie Biden from Oct. 2018 — when he allegedly bought the gun — where Hunter Biden said he was "buying," as well as another in which she said her son was sitting near a "stem," or crack pipe, in her house. </p>

    </p>
<p>Hallie Biden also told the court that Hunter Biden introduced her to crack cocaine during the time they were romantically involved. </p><p>"It was a terrible experience that I went through and I'm embarrassed and ashamed, and I regret that period of my life," she said. </p><p>ABC News' David Muir asked President Biden in an interview on Thursday if he would <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-would-not-pardon-son-hunter-if-convicted-gun-trial/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">rule out pardoning his son</a></span> if he is convicted. Mr. Biden responded, "Yes." </p>

        AP AUDIO: Biden apologizes to Zelenskyy for monthslong congressional holdup to weapons that let Russia gain
    </h1>
    
    
    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports President Biden has said sorry to Ukraine’s president for months-long delay in getting military aid to his fighters.</p>
    
</div>
    

<p>The apology — and Zelenskyy’s plea for rock-solid support akin to the allied coalition in WWII — served as a reminder that for all of Biden’s talk of an unflagging U.S commitment to Ukraine, recalcitrance among congressional Republicans and an isolationist strain in American politics have exposed its fragility. And, although unremarked upon, the specter of Donald Trump’s candidacy loomed over the discussion, as the Republican former president and the presumptive nominee has spoken positively of Russian President Vladimir Putin and sparked Ukrainian concerns that he would call for it to cede territory to end the conflict.</p>



<p>Zelenskyy pressed for all Americans to support his country’s defense against Russia’s invasion, and he thanked lawmakers for eventually coming together to approve the weapons package, which has allowed Ukraine to stem Russian advances in recent weeks. </p>
    
<p>“It’s very important that in this unity, United States of America, all American people stay with Ukraine like it was during World War II,” Zelenskyy said. “How the United States helped to save human lives, to save Europe. And we count on your continuing support in standing with us shoulder to shoulder.”</p>
    

<p>The United States is by far Kyiv’s biggest supplier of wartime support, and Ukraine is trying to fend off an intense <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kharkiv-attacks-5023c3e67af30fc95b954a6f044112dc">Russian offensive</a></span> in eastern areas of the country. The push is focused on the Ukrainian border regions of Kharkiv and Donetsk, but Ukrainian officials say it could spread as Russia’s bigger army seeks to make its advantage tell.</p><p>During their meeting, Zelenskyy shared a “very frank assessment” with Biden about conditions on the ground and the pressure that Ukraine continues to face from Russia, especially in the Donbas region, according to John Kirby, the White House’s national security spokesman. But because of the recent infusion of U.S. aid, the Ukrainians have been able to “thwart Russian advances,” particularly around Kharkiv.</p>
    

<p>“The Russians really have kind of stalled out up there, basically,” Kirby said. “Their advance on Kharkiv is all but over because they ran into the first line of defenses of the Ukrainian armed forces and basically stopped, if not pulled back some units.”</p><p>The offensive is seeking to exploit Kyiv’s shortages of ammunition and troops along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line. </p><p>The slow pace of delivery of pledged Western weaponry has long frustrated Zelenskyy, as has Biden’s hesitation over supplying more hardware for fear of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin. That has caused tension in their relationship.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

Russia says it is defending itself against a menacing eastward expansion of the NATO military alliance.</p><p>In a 20-minute speech Friday at the National Assembly, the lower house of the French parliament, Zelenskyy drew a parallel with the sacrifices made during World War II and his country’s current fight.</p><p>“This battle is a crossroads,” Zelenskyy said. “A moment where we can now write history the way we need it. Or we can become victims of history as it suits … our enemy.”</p><p>Zelenskyy, who spoke in Ukrainian, was frequently interrupted by lawmakers’ applause and cheers.

<li><strong>Temporary restraining order granted</strong>: A Superior Court judge has granted a temporary restraining order to the University of California, halting the illegal systemwide strike by UAW-represented employees across campuses.</li>

<li><strong>UAW disagrees</strong>: The United Automobile Workers (UAW) union has not commented on the strike being illegal, and the strike's expansion to six campuses has been met with support from faculty and students.</li>

    <div><div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A Superior Court judge today (June 7) granted a temporary restraining order to the University of California, temporarily halting the illegal systemwide strike by UAW-represented employees across campuses.  </p>

<p>The action comes after UC filed a lawsuit and requested injunctive relief Tuesday against UAW for breach of contract. UC and UAW have collective bargaining agreements that each have no-strike clauses. UAW-represented UC employees began striking on May 20 at UC Santa Cruz and the strike has expanded to six of the 10 systemwide campuses.  </p>

<p>"We are extremely grateful for a pause in this strike so our students can complete their academic studies. The strike would have caused irreversible setbacks to students' academic achievements and may have stalled critical research projects in the final quarter," said Melissa Matella, associate vice president for Systemwide Labor Relations.  </p>

<p>"From the beginning, we have stated this strike was illegal and a violation of our contracts' mutually agreed upon no-strike clauses,” Matella added. “We respect the advocacy and progressive action towards issues that matter to our community and our community's right to engage in lawful free speech activities — activities that continue to occur across the system. However, UAW's strike is unrelated to employment terms, violates the parties' agreements, and runs contrary to established labor principles." </p>

<p>While this is an important victory critical to support student success, the University will continue to pursue its legal claims in state court and PERB to protect labor peace across the system. </p>

                                        <p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A jury convicted five Minnesota residents and acquitted two others on Friday for their roles in <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-food-fraud-bribe-bag-cash-juror-4a3986447efb45dfc7eff2070c2e296f">a scheme to steal more than $40 million</a></span> from a program that was supposed to feed children during the coronavirus pandemic. The case received widespread attention after someone tried to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash.</p><p>That juror was dismissed before deliberations began, and a second juror who was told about it also was dismissed. An FBI investigation of the attempted bribe continues, with no arrests announced.</p><p>After the verdicts were read, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson called the attempted bribe “an attack on our criminal justice system” and told reporters that authorities would investigate with all of their resources. He made no other comment on that issue, and expressed satisfaction at the convictions in the fraud case.</p>
    

<p>“They lied and they fraudulently claimed to be feeding millions of meals to children in Minnesota during COVID. The defendants took advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to defraud the state of Minnesota and to steal tens of millions of dollars,” Thompson said. “This conduct was not just criminal, it was depraved and brazen.”</p>



<p>Defense attorneys argued at trial that their clients provided real meals to real people. </p><p>The seven people were the first of 70 to stand trial in what federal prosecutors have called one of the nation’s largest COVID-19-related frauds, exploiting rules that were kept lax so that the economy wouldn’t crash during the pandemic. More than $250 million in federal funds was taken in the Minnesota scheme overall, with only about $50 million of it recovered, authorities said. </p>
    
<p>The food aid came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and was administered by the state, which funneled the meal money through nonprofit organizations and other partners. As rules were eased to speed support to the needy, the defendants allegedly produced invoices for meals never served, ran shell companies, laundered money, indulged in <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/arrests-minneapolis-2d48601c7f4d1c8cdda29a48a6670f4c">passport fraud</a></span> and accepted kickbacks.</p>
    

<p>Federal prosecutors said just a fraction of the money the defendants received through the Feeding our Future nonprofit went to feed low-income kids, while <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/sports-health-travel-education-70d77fb2757d0b6fbc2012bf2c534a34">the rest was spent on luxury cars, jewelry, travel and property</a></span>. </p><p>The defendants in this trial faced a mix of multiple counts including conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering and federal programs bribery. Each defendant was charged based on their alleged role, and each had their own attorney. In the end, the jurors delivered a split verdict.</p><p>Abdiaziz Shafii Farah, Mohamed Jama Ismail, Abdimajid Mohamed Nur, Mukhtar Mohamed Shariff and Hayat Mohamed Nur were found guilty on most of the counts against them. Prosecutors have described Abdiaziz Farah as a ringleader of the seven and faced the most counts; he was convicted on 23 of 24 counts against him.</p><p>Said Shafii Farah and Abdiwahab Maalim Aftin were acquitted on all counts they faced. Aftin was charged with three counts, the least of all seven defendants. </p>
    

<p>Andrew Garvis, an attorney for Aftin, said afterward that the case was complex.</p><p>“The government had a lot of evidence, and the jury took their time in consideration,” Garvis said. “That’s what we want in the system, so we appreciate it.”</p><p>Steven Schleicher, Said Farah’s attorney, said his client is grateful to have been acquitted. </p><p>Attorneys for Abdimajid Nur, Hayat Nur, Abdiaziz Farah and Ismail did not immediately respond to phone messages seeking comment. Frederick Goetz, an attorney for Shariff, declined to comment. </p><p>The common thread in the defense arguments was that investigators failed to dig deep enough to see they served real meals to real kids. </p><p>Sentencing hearings will be scheduled at a later date.</p><p>An <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://pronto.associatedpress.com/hieves%20plundering%20billions%20of%20dollars%20in%20federal%20COVID-19%20relief%20aid%20intended%20to%20combat%20the%20worst%20pandemic%20in%20a%20century%20and%20to%20stabilize%20an%20economy%20in%20free%20fall.%20%20An%20Associated%20Press%20analysis%20found%20that%20fraudsters%20potentially%20stole%20more%20than%20$280%20billion%20in%20COVID-19%20relief%20funding;%20another%20$123%20billion%20was%20wasted%20or%20misspent.%20Combined,%20the%20loss%20represents%2010%%20of%20the%20$4.2%20trillion%20the%20U.S.%20government%20has%20so%20far%20disbursed%20in%20COVID%20relief%20aid." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associated Press analysis published last June</a></span> documented how thieves across the country <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/pandemic-fraud-waste-billions-small-business-labor-f33cdb6d2a9f0dbee8716c349d82250a">plundered billions</a></span> in federal COVID-19 relief dollars.

Nearly 3,200 people have been charged and about $1.4 billion in stolen pandemic aid has been seized, according to the U.S. Justice Department.</p>
    

<p>After the juror reported the bribe attempt in the Minnesota case, the judge ordered all seven defendants to surrender their cellphones so that investigators could look for evidence. She also ordered all seven taken into custody, and sequestered the jury.</p><p>According to an FBI agent’s affidavit, a woman rang the doorbell at the home of “Juror #52” in the Minneapolis suburb of Spring Lake Park the night before the case went to the jury. A relative answered the door and was handed a gift bag with a curly ribbon and images of flowers and butterflies. The woman said it was a “present” for the juror.</p>
    

<p>“The woman told the relative to tell Juror #52 to say not guilty tomorrow and there would be more of that present tomorrow,” the agent wrote. “After the woman left, the relative looked in the gift bag and saw it contained a substantial amount of cash.”</p><p>The juror called police right after she got home and gave them the bag, which held stacks of $100, $50 and $20 bills totaling around $120,000. </p><p>The woman who left the bag knew the juror’s first name, the agent said. Names of the jurors have not been made public, but the list of people with access to it included prosecutors, defense lawyers — and the seven defendants.</p><p>“It is highly likely that someone with access to the juror’s personal information was conspiring with, at a minimum, the woman who delivered the $120,000 bribe,” the FBI agent wrote, noting that the alleged fraud conspiracy at the heart of the trial involved electronic communications, including text messages and emails.</p><p>Days later, while the remaining jurors were deliberating, FBI agents searched the home of Abdiaziz Shafii Farah, according to a neighbor who witnessed the search and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of safety concerns. The FBI confirmed agents were in the city where Farah lives, but did not elaborate. It was not clear if the search was connected to the bribery investigation.</p><p>Federal charges of bribery of a juror and influencing a juror carry a maximum potential penalty of 15 years in prison.</p><p>Eighteen other people pleaded guilty in the larger $250 million fraud scheme. Among those awaiting trial is <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/health-minnesota-covid-nutrition-cc55a566c806a29a7f2e64c762975a09">Aimee Bock, the founder</a></span> of Feeding our Future.

<p>While the history of D-Day is often told through the stories of the men who fought and died on the beaches, hundreds of thousands of military women worked behind the scenes in crucial non-combat roles such as <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/d-day-women-naval-code-breakers-secrets-revealed/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">codebreakers</a></span>, ship plotters, radar operators and cartographers. </p><p>The contributions of women like Lamb, radio operator Marie Scott and Pat Owtram, whose work helped crack previously <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/enigma-why-the-fight-to-break-nazi-encryption-still-matters/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">unbreakable Nazi codes</a></span>, have come into sharper focus as the number of living D-Day veterans dwindles.

The small booklet and some of Hamel’s other belongings were kept in a sewing box that relatives found on the family farm. When Le Bris opened the diary, her eyes fell immediately upon the D-Day entry and her grandmother’s understated account of the Allied troops’ landing.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In a sense, Hamel’s diary is a historical record, one young woman’s eyewitness version of events that would put Allied forces on the path to winning the war.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">For Le Bris, it is much more.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“It was,” she said, “my last gift from my grandmother.”</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/30/USAT/73912120007-famille-hamel-colleville-05-a.JPG?width=980&amp;height=749&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Louise Hamel, who lived in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, documented in her diary the opening moments of the D-Day invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Louise Hamel, who lived in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, documented in her diary the opening moments of the D-Day invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944." data-c-credit="Courtesy Stephanie Le Bris"></p></figure><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">'What is happening to you?'</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The fighting started early that morning.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">At 6:30 a.m., the first wave of Allied troops came ashore at Omaha Beach, not far from the farmhouse in the Normandy village of Colleville-sur-Mer, where Louise Hamel lived with her daughter and her husband, Félix, before he had gone off to fight for France.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">German bullets rained down and punched the waters of the English Channel as the soldiers jumped from their landing craft and waded to the shore. Still, they slogged through the waters, rifles in hand, and eventually reached the beach, where more enemy fire awaited them. At Pointe du Hoc to the west, rangers using rope ladders scaled the tall cliffs overlooking the blue waters below. From the top of the promontory, Germans watched their advance and pummeled them with heavy machine gun fire and hand grenades.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Hamel was home when the fighting broke out. She had been advised to stay away from the beach and, if possible, to leave the village altogether. As the combat intensified, the 24-year-old mother fled Colleville with her daughter and mother-in-law and headed for the safety of the French countryside.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">They would not return until noon the next day, June 7, after the village had been liberated.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/30/USAT/73912116007-felix-hamel-circa-1942.jpg?width=300&amp;height=413&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Félix Hamel, of Colleville-Sur-Mer, France, donated family farmland to help create the Normandy American Cemetery, the final resting place for more than 9,000 U.S. soldiers killed during World War II."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Félix Hamel, of Colleville-Sur-Mer, France, donated family farmland to help create the Normandy American Cemetery, the final resting place for more than 9,000 U.S. soldiers killed during World War II." data-c-credit="Courtesy Stephanie Le Bris"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Hundreds of miles away, Félix Hamel hungered for news of his family. Mobilized by the French Army in 1940, he had been arrested by the Germans a few days later and sent to Czechoslovakia. Given his agrarian background, the Germans put him to work on a farm.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><em>“My dearest, darling Lissette,”</em> he wrote to his wife in a letter dated Aug. 2, 1944. <em>“What is happening to you? Still no news from you. I have written everywhere, Belgian, American, English and French Red Cross. As of today still no news. … Seeing what’s happened there, I have to think positively. Me, my health is good. Hoping as always that I will soon receive a letter from you, receive from your Félix, a thousand tender kisses.”</em></p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Félix Hamel remained in captivity until the final weeks of the war.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Finally freed in May 1945, he returned to Colleville and his darling Lissette. One day he went to check on the family farmland, to see how it had fared during the war. At the top of hill, he saw not animals but coffins. The land had been turned into a morgue.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">A couple of years later, the French government approached him with a proposal: Would the family donate their land to create a permanent cemetery and memorial for the soldiers who had fought and died in France?</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">He said yes, of course.

Le Bris did some sleuthing and discovered that one of the women is her grandmother.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In 1999, the U.S. Army’s First Infantry Division, whose soldiers were among the first to storm Omaha Beach and faced some of the fiercest resistance, presented Hamel with their insignia, a shoulder patch with a red numeral “1” centered on a green shield. She treasured the gift and the sentiment it represented.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“She told my father, ‘When I die, I would like to have the insignia in my casket for my funeral,’” Le Bris said. “This period of her life was really, really important to her.”</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/04/USAT/73969839007-le-bris.jpg?width=300&amp;height=451&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Stéphanie Le Bris, an interpretative guide at the Normandy American Cemetery in France, discovered her grandmother's 1944 diary that documents the opening moments of the D-Day invasion of Normandy."><p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Stéphanie Le Bris, an interpretative guide at the Normandy American Cemetery in France, discovered her grandmother's 1944 diary that documents the opening moments of the D-Day invasion of Normandy." data-c-credit="American Battle Monuments Commission"></p></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Le Bris, who was 15 when her grandfather died, often accompanied her grandmother and other family members to the cemetery to pay their respects. “Every June 6, we went at 6:30 in the morning to see the reenactment on the sea,” she said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">On the 50th anniversary of D-Day, the family attended the World War II commemorations, then invited some of the veterans back to their home. “They slept at the farm,” Le Bris said. “I knew for (my grandmother) that it was really important to welcome them. It was a way to thank them for what they did.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Le Bris worked as a travel agent in Paris for six years but in 2007 landed a job as an interpretative guide at the cemetery, one of several overseas burial sites managed by the American Battle Monuments Commission. The Normandy cemetery and memorial receive more than 1 million visitors every year.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Le Bris gives tours in English and French, welcomes family members of fallen soldiers and helps them find their loved one’s burial plot among the thousands of white marble headstones shaped like crosses or Stars of David.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">She never talks about her own family history unless someone asks if her relatives were there on D-Day. Only then does she tell them the story of Louise and Félix and the many other French citizens who were part of the resistance.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/world/2019/06/05/most-memorable-images-d-day/1357685001/" data-t-l=":l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - Most memorable images from D-Day" data-g-r="nav_mo" data-g-tn="pgcss" data-g-mtn="pg1357685001" data-g-moh="hpgm" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" data-c-id="1357685001"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/28/USAT/73884330007-getty-images-875643776.jpg?crop=1198,675,x2,y98&amp;width=660&amp;height=372&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt=""><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="17"><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg__ca"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"></use></svg><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_expand"></use></svg></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="Most memorable images from D-Day" aria-label="In what remains the biggest amphibious assault in history, some 156,000 Allied personnel landed in France on June 6, 1944."></p></a><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Every day, and especially when I’m alone in the cemetery, I think about the courage of these people that were civilians and that were soldiers and what they did,” she said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Le Bris will be at the cemetery on Thursday for the D-Day commemorations.
