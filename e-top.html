    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>French President Emmanuel Macron has refused the resignation of Prime Minister and is asking him to remain temporarily in his position, amid a chaotic election result that has left the government in limbo.</li>
<li>The election results showed that voters split the legislature on the left, center, and far right, with no faction close to the majority needed to form a government, raising concerns about paralysis in the European Union's second-largest economy.</li>
<li>Macron had called an early election, hoping for a "moment of clarification", but the outcome has shown the opposite, less than three weeks before the Paris Olympics are set to start.</li>
<li>The French stock market fell initially after the election results, but quickly recovered, possibly due to markets relieved that the far right or leftist coalition did not win a outright victory.</li>
<li>The outcome of the election has left the government in disarray, with no clear path forward, and has raised concerns about the impact on the country's economy and international reputation during a critical period as host of the Paris Olympics.</li>

Macron, who named him just seven months ago, immediately asked him to stay on “to ensure the stability of the country.” Macron’s top political allies joined the meeting with Attal at the presidential palace, which ended after about 90 minutes. </p>

<p>On Sunday, Attal made clear that he disagreed with Macron’s decision to call the surprise election. The results of two rounds of voting left no obvious path to form a government for the leftist coalition that came in first, Macron’s centrist alliance or the far right.</p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024 The year will test even the most robust democracies.

<p>Newly elected and returning lawmakers on Monday gathered at the National Assembly to begin negotiations over a new government in earnest. Macron himself will leave midweek for a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nato-summit-trump-biden-europe-ukraine-e45273ef1bd408d72245f8f7fd1ec5c0">NATO summit in Washington</a></span>. </p>
    
<p>Talks over who should form a new government and who should lead the foreign, interior and finance ministries among others, are expected to be extremely difficult and lengthy given that political parties negotiating a deal have diametrically opposing policies and contempt for one another. </p>
    

<p>“We are in a situation that is totally unprecedented,” said Jean-Didier Berger, a newly elected lawmaker from the conservative Republicans party. </p><p>Aurélien Rousseau, a newly elected lawmaker from the New Popular Front and former minister in Macron’s government acknowledged disagreements within the leftist alliance over the government formation, but said the alliance could eventually reach an agreement. </p><p>“We need to build compromises, but we need to take time to discuss, to know what we agree on or disagree within the left,” Rousseau said. </p><p>Another New Popular Front lawmaker, Jérôme Guedj of the French Socialists party, said the leftist alliance won’t buckle under pressure to name its candidate for the next prime minister who could govern alongside Macron. </p><p>“This is a confusing moment (and) we’re not going to add anxiety, unnecessary division at a moment when we need to find the right path,” Guedj said. </p><p>Political deadlock could have far-ranging implications for <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine</a></span>, global diplomacy and Europe’s economic stability. Still, at least one leader said the result was a relief.</p>
    

<p>“In Paris enthusiasm, in Moscow disappointment, in Kyiv relief. Enough to be happy in Warsaw,” Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a former European Council president, posted on X late Sunday.</p><p>According to official results released early Monday, all three main blocs fell far short of the 289 seats needed to control the 577-seat National Assembly, the most powerful of France’s two legislative chambers. </p><p>The results showed just over 180 seats for the New Popular Front leftist coalition, which placed first, to beat Macron’s centrist alliance, with more than 160 seats. The far-right National Rally part of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/france-elections-le-pen-antisemitism-macron-5c4c8fa261b0fa2f2e35c14c072a60b4">Marine Le Pen</a></span> and its allies were restricted to third place, although their more than 140 seats were still way ahead of the party’s previous best showing of 89 seats in 2022.</p><p>Macron has three years remaining on his presidential term.</p><p>Rather than rallying behind Macron as he’d hoped, millions took the vote as an opportunity to vent anger about inflation, crime, immigration and other grievances, including his style of government.</p>
    

<p>The New Popular Front’s leaders immediately pushed Macron to give them the first chance to form a government and propose a prime minister. The faction pledges to roll back many of Macron’s headline reforms, embark on a costly program of public spending, and take a tougher line against <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-evacuation-safe-zone-43536b7dfe84aa3c39668c30032bdfcb">Israel because of the war with Hamas</a></span>. But it’s not clear, even among the left, who could lead the government without alienating crucial allies.</p><p>“We need someone who offers consensus,” said Olivier Faure, head of the Socialist Party, which joined the leftist coalition and was still sorting out how many seats it won on Monday. </p><p>Macron warns that the left’s economic program of many tens of billions of euros in public spending, partly financed by taxes on wealth and hikes for high earners, could be ruinous for France, already criticized by EU watchdogs for its debt.</p>
    

<p>A hung parliament is unknown territory for modern France, and many people reacted with a mix of relief and apprehension. </p><p>“What pollsters and the press were telling us made me very nervous so it’s a huge relief. Big expectations as well,” said Nadine Dupuis, a 60-year-old legal secretary in Paris. “What’s going to happen? How are they going to govern this country?” </p><p>The political agreement between the left and center to block the National Rally was largely successful. Many voters decided that keeping the far right from power was more important than anything else, backing its opponents in the runoff, even if they weren’t from the political camp they usually support.</p><p>“Disappointed, disappointed,” said far-right supporter Luc Doumont, 66. “Well, happy to see our progression, because for the past few years we’ve been doing better.”</p><p>Le Pen, who was expected to make a fourth run for the French presidency in 2027, said the elections laid the groundwork for “the victory of tomorrow.”</p><p>Racism and antisemitism marred the electoral campaign, along with <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/france-election-disinformation-russia-olympics-be18d688677240686df200096018f221">Russian disinformation campaigns</a></span>, and more than 50 candidates reported being physically attacked — highly unusual for France.</p><p>Unlike other countries in Europe that are more accustomed to coalition governments, France doesn’t have a tradition of lawmakers from rival political camps coming together to form a majority. France is also more centralized than many other European countries, with many more decisions made in Paris.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Barbara Surk in Nice, and John Leicester, Diane Jeantet and Nicolas Garriga in Paris, contributed to this report.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow AP’s global election coverage at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/elections">https://apnews.com/hub/global-elections</a></span></p>

One called it an "atrocious abomination".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The settlement must now be approved by a US judge.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">By pleading guilty, Boeing will avoid the spectacle of a criminal trial - something that victims' families have been pressing for.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The company has been in crisis over its safety record since two near-identical crashes involving 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019. It led to the global grounding of the plane for more than a year.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In 2021, prosecutors charged Boeing with one count of conspiracy to defraud regulators, alleging it had deceived the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about its MCAS flight control system, which was implicated in both crashes.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It agreed not to prosecute Boeing if the company paid a penalty and successfully completed a three-year period of increased monitoring and reporting.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But in January, shortly before that period was due to end, a door panel in a Boeing plane operated by Alaska Airlines blew out soon after take-off and forced the jet to land.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">No-one was injured during the incident but it intensified scrutiny over how much progress Boeing had made on improving its safety and quality record.   </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In May, the DoJ said it had found Boeing had violated the terms of the agreement, opening up the possibility of prosecution. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Boeing's decision to plead guilty is still a significant black mark for the firm because it means that the company - which is a prominent military contractor for the US government - now has a criminal record. It is also one of the world's two biggest manufacturers of commercial jets. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It is not immediately clear how the criminal record will affect the firm's contracting business. The government typically bars or suspends firms with records from participating in bids, but can grant waivers. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"></p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Paul Cassell, a lawyer representing some families of people killed on the 2018 and 2019 flights, said: "This sweetheart deal fails to recognise that because of Boeing’s conspiracy, 346 people died.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Through crafty lawyering between Boeing and DoJ, the deadly consequences of Boeing’s crime are being hidden."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He called on the judge assessing the deal to "reject this inappropriate plea and simply set the matter for a public trial, so that all the facts surrounding the case will be aired in a fair and open forum before a jury”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In a letter to the government in June, Mr Cassell had urged the DoJ to fine Boeing more than $24bn.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Zipporah Kuria who lost her father Joseph in one of the fatal crashes, said the plea was an "atrocious abomination".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Miscarriage of justice is a gross understatement in describing this," she said. "I hope that, God forbid, if this happens again the DoJ is reminded that it had the opportunity to do something meaningful and instead chose not to."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Ed Pierson, executive director of Foundation for Aviation Safety and a former senior manager at Boeing, said the plea was "seriously disappointing" and "a terrible deal for justice".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Instead of holding individuals accountable, they’re just basically giving them another get out of jail free card,” he said.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dOZXmm"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-13b8515c-1 bbjeKz"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bb69/live/09c7f3a0-3231-11ef-bc72-51b61c17135e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bb69/live/09c7f3a0-3231-11ef-bc72-51b61c17135e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bb69/live/09c7f3a0-3231-11ef-bc72-51b61c17135e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bb69/live/09c7f3a0-3231-11ef-bc72-51b61c17135e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bb69/live/09c7f3a0-3231-11ef-bc72-51b61c17135e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bb69/live/09c7f3a0-3231-11ef-bc72-51b61c17135e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bb69/live/09c7f3a0-3231-11ef-bc72-51b61c17135e.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bb69/live/09c7f3a0-3231-11ef-bc72-51b61c17135e.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Clariss Moore, whose daughter died on a Boeing plane, confronts Boeing boss Dave Calhoun at a hearing in Washington, DC in June" class="sc-13b8515c-0 hbOWRP"><span class="sc-13b8515c-2 iuvLSH">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Families of those killed in Boeing planes have pushed for prosecution</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The DoJ said the deal did not grant immunity to individuals and only addressed corporate actions that occurred before the 737 Max crashes.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A Boeing 737 Max plane operated by Indonesia's Lion Air crashed in late October 2018 shortly after take-off, killing all 189 people on board. Just months later, an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed, killing all 157 passengers and crew.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In the 2021 deal, Boeing also agreed to pay $2.5bn to resolve the matter, including a $243m criminal penalty and $500m to a victims' fund.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The deal outraged family members, who were not consulted on the terms and have called for the company to stand trial.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Senior staff at the DoJ recommended in favour of prosecution, CBS News, the BBC's US news partner reported in late June. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">At a hearing in June, Senator Richard Blumenthal said he believed there was "near overwhelming evidence" that prosecution should be pursued.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Lawyers for family members said the DoJ was worried it did not have a strong case against the firm.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mark Forkner, a former Boeing technical pilot who was the only person to face criminal charges arising from the incident, was acquitted by a jury in 2022. His lawyers had argued he was being used as a scapegoat. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mark Cohen, a professor emeritus at Vanderbilt University, who has studied corporate punishments, said prosecutors often prefer plea deals or deferred prosecution agreements, which allow them to avoid the risk of a trial and can give the government greater power over a company than a typical sentence. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Because it's easier to get than going to trial, it may ease the burden on the prosecutor but the prosecutor also may believe it's a better sanction [because] they may be able to impose requirements that aren't normally in sentencing guidelines," he said. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In this case, Boeing has agreed to invest $455m in "compliance and safety programs" and submit to oversight by an independent monitor for three years.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Cohen said there was little doubt that Boeing's status as a key government contractor played a role in determining how to proceed. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"They've got to think about the collateral consequences," he said. "You don't take these kinds of cases lightly."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The issues with MCAS were not Boeing's first brush with the law. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It has also paid millions in penalties to the Federal Aviation Administration since 2015 to resolve a series of claims of improper manufacturing and other issues.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The company also continues to face investigations and lawsuits sparked by the incident on the January Alaska Airlines flight. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Separately, the Federal Aviation Administration on Monday said it had ordered inspections of 2,600 737 planes to address reports that oxygen generators on the planes were shifting out of position. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The situation could lead oxygen masks to fail in the event that a plane lost pressure, the FAA said. </p></div></article></div>

In the years since, each side has suffered tens of thousands of casualties, and Russia has made only marginal progress toward illegally annexing four southeastern Ukrainian regions, in addition to Crimea, which it seized by force in 2014.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-bHCGeL-isStandardLayoutAd-true article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="cb db dn-ns" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-mobile"><div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-md mt-sm pt-sm pb-sm ad-mobile"><div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"><p class="dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md">Story continues below advertisement</p></div><p class="relative flex flex-column justify-center w-100"><wp-ad id="slug_mob_bigbox_8" class="chromatic-ignore" data-chromatic="ignore" data-slot="/701/wpni.world/europe" aria-hidden="true" data-renderbehavior="never" data-refresh="true" data-json='{"targeting":{"zeus_rendercount":"1","zeus_slot":"slug_mob_bigbox_8.init.dsk","kpi":"ctr","pos":"mob_bigbox_8","ctr":["zeus_mob_bigbox_8"],"wp_ad_refresh":"0","wp_refresh":"mob_bigbox_8_0","pwt":["mob_bigbox_8_mab_0"]}}'></wp-ad></p></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3IKC6MBZ3RHPNDL7OP3SXYZJHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">In Moscow on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was in favor of the diplomatic efforts.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VH6GWUGFYVE5XDBMPQDNN7PNLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">“President Vladimir Putin is a convinced supporter of the preferability of political and diplomatic efforts to find a solution to the Ukrainian conflict,” Peskov said.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VIXDK7Y4SZAZFG6D4GFFFGGNXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"><i>Shepherd reported from Taipei, Taiwan, and Shih from New Delhi.

<li>Fundraisers have been planned, and a plane with a decal featuring the running mate's name will be ready, but only Trump knows who it will be.</li>
<li>The announcement may not happen due to the Trump campaign's focus on Republican Party donors and the Democratic Party's current crisis, with President Joe Biden's dismal debate performance and doubts about his age.</li>
<li>Trump has several opportunities to announce his running mate this week, including two rallies planned in Florida and Pennsylvania.</li>

<p>Trump has two rallies planned. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.</p>
    
<p>Rubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator’s plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

        </div><p>On Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside of Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.</p>
    

<p>Also said to be on Trump’s short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.</p><p>Trump doesn’t need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, on-stage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the “The Apprentice” reality TV show.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly said he intends to unveil his pick just before or during the convention. But he has been coy about his choice. </p><p>Late last month, before the debate, Trump <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-says-knows-presidential-selection-will-rcna158457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told NBC News at a campaign stop in Philadelphia</a></span> that he’d already made a decision.</p><p>“In my mind, yeah,” he said.</p><p>But less than a week later, he told a local Virginia television station that his decision was still in flux.</p><p>“Well I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,” he said. “But we’ll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.”</p>
    

<h2>The front-runners say they don’t know yet</h2><p>“As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who could make a great President,” Trump adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement he has issued repeatedly. “But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.”</p><p>That includes the front-runners for the job.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

        </div><p>On CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, Rubio said he remained in the dark.</p><p>“Look, I’ve heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it,” he said. “Donald Trump has a decision to make. He’ll make it when he needs to make it. He’ll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.”</p><p>He also dismissed questions about whether he has discussed <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-vice-president-florida-rubio-donalds-constitution-da837d4dcbc49dcf4fb98f41015368c7">changing his residence from Florida</a></span> if he’s chosen as “presumptuous.” The Constitution bars the president and vice president from hailing from the same state.</p>
    

<p>“We’ll confront those issues when they come,” he said. “But we’re not there yet. But we will be soon, one way or the other.” </p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/rep-schiff-says-biden-s-comments-about-losing-to-trump-concerned-him-214352965799" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On NBC’s “Meet the Press,”</a></span> Vance, too, said he has not received news one way or the other: “I have not gotten the call.”</p><p>“But most importantly,” he went on, ”we’re just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is — he’s got a lot of good people he could choose from — it’s the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people. I think we have to bring that back to the White House, and I’m fighting to try to do that.”</p><h2>A top ally is still pushing for Tim Scott</h2><p>On CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a longtime Trump ally, continued to push for his fellow South Carolinian, Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate.</p>
    

<p>“I don’t think he’s decided,” he said, again making his case for Scott, who he said would be a particularly smart choice if Biden were to be replaced at the top of the ticket by Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to serve in the office. </p><p>If Harris is picked, Graham said, “This is a dramatically different race than it is right now today. I hope people are thinking about that on our side.”</p><p>Biden has insisted he won’t drop out and said only “ <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/president-joe-biden-campaign-wisconsin-abc-news-e4657f86f5e82b10a5fefb526bc49b08">the Lord Almighty</a></span> ” could get him to change his mind. </p><p>Graham commended Trump’s other choices at the same time. He called Burgum “solid as a rock” and said Vance “could be a good wingman,” but questioned whether the Republican firebrand — who was once a vocal Trump critic but is now one of his fiercest defenders in the Senate — could bring in new states. </p><p>Rubio, he noted, has the issue of his residency to contend with, but called him a “very articulate conservative” who could help Trump “enormously.” Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, also speaks Spanish.</p><p>“If I were President Trump, I would make sure I pick somebody that could add value in 2024. Expand the map,” Graham said. </p><p>___ Associated Press writers Steve Peoples and Michelle L. Price contributed to this report.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Biden takes credit for NATO spending increase</strong>: President Biden is taking credit for the fact that European allies and Canada have increased defense spending by hundreds of billions of dollars, warning that if elected, Donald Trump will "eviscerate NATO".</li>
<li><strong>Trump, not Biden, responsible for spending increase</strong>: However, the article claims that Trump is responsible for most of the spending increase, as it was during his presidency that allies began to meet their commitments to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense.</li>
<li><strong>NATO spending was low under Obama</strong>: Prior to Trump's presidency, only three NATO allies were meeting their commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defense, and spending by non-US members had dropped to an all-time low of 1.4% in 2015.</li>
<li><strong>German military was in poor condition</strong>: The article quotes a report that found that 60% of Germany's Eurofighter and Tornado fighter jets, 82% of its Sea Lynx helicopters, 61% of its main battle tanks, and all of its submarines or transport planes were unusable.</li>
<li><strong>Trump pressured NATO allies to increase spending</strong>: As president, Trump put pressure on Germany and other NATO allies to increase their defense spending, saying that the United States would no longer tolerate their failure to contribute adequately to their common defense. By the time he left office, allies were increasing their spending, with Germany increasing its defense budget by 15%.</li>

Far from eviscerating the Atlantic alliance, Trump left it militarily stronger than it has been at any time since the Cold War.

But that support plummets 20 points if the country under attack is not meeting its spending commitments. Americans don’t like free riders.

If allies value the Article 5 security guarantee — the core of the alliance — they will not put it at risk by refusing reasonable obligations. If they do, Trump might be tempted to walk away from the alliance altogether, just as he threatened to pull out of NAFTA if Canada and Mexico did not agree to restructure that agreement. Indeed, he is probably the only president who could credibly make such a threat — which means he is the only president who can get allies to agree to these necessary, binding changes.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-full-bleed" data-qa="article-body"><div class="cb db dn-ns numbered-listicle" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-mobile"><div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-md mt-sm pt-sm pb-sm ad-mobile"><div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"><p class="dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md">Story continues below advertisement</p></div><p class="relative flex flex-column justify-center w-100"><wp-ad id="slug_mob_bigbox_4" class="chromatic-ignore" data-chromatic="ignore" data-slot="/701/wpni.opinions/columns" aria-hidden="true" data-renderbehavior="never" data-refresh="true" data-json='{"targeting":{"zeus_rendercount":"1","zeus_slot":"slug_mob_bigbox_4.init.dsk","kpi":"ctr","pos":"mob_bigbox_4","ctr":["zeus_mob_bigbox_4"],"wp_ad_refresh":"0","wp_refresh":"mob_bigbox_4_0","pwt":["mob_bigbox_4_mab_0"]}}'></wp-ad></p></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M3VH7O5TCZDI3BKXCLIMU4QD6I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Trump has said that he <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-says-he-wont-quit-nato-if-europe-pays-its-way/" target="_blank">“100 percent”</a> wants to remain in the alliance, so long as the allies carry their weight.

Are Putin’s terms acceptable to you?” When pressed, Trump responded: “No, they’re not acceptable.” He’s right. But getting Putin to accept different terms will require Trump to follow through on his pledge to boost military aid to Kyiv — at least in the short term.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZHWF5QH2XJHAXLY3VS36Q5TNA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">The model can be Trump’s successful campaign to destroy the Islamic State.

He won it by removing the handcuffs Barack Obama had placed on our military and achieved a decisive victory.

And the only way to do <i>that</i> is to bring Ukraine into NATO with defensible borders. Putin knows he would lose a war with NATO, which is why he has invaded only non-NATO countries. Trump’s legacy thus depends on cementing any peace deal by making its lines inviolable. That requires that the boundaries be backed by NATO security guarantees.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I5TWFAXBWJDYLIB67B5LIT344I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">A Trump-brokered peace deal backed by NATO membership for Ukraine would benefit the U.S. economically.

Collectively, they are worth tens of trillions of dollars.” Putin wants those natural resources to go to Russia. But if Trump negotiates a lasting peace deal — and secures it by bringing Ukraine into NATO — he can get the United States preferential access to those resources.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IDW3C6DWDNFEBDXYLDSKLXDWAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">And Ukraine would be a better NATO ally than many current member states. It now has the most capable, battle-hardened, NATO-interoperable military in Europe. Unlike some allies, Ukraine will have no hesitation over meeting a NATO obligation to spend 3 percent of its GDP on defense. (It was already <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS?locations=UA" target="_blank">spending about 3.2 percent</a> before Russia’s full-scale invasion.)

Bringing Japan under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty would solve that problem. Australia has long fought beside the United States in wartime. NATO membership would formalize that commitment and extend it to all NATO allies. And it would mean that every NATO ally — not just the United States — is obligated to the collective defense of Pacific as well as Atlantic democracies.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EPGJ6KX3ZZCFHDIELY5SBGLXEA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">It would also foster greater Atlantic-Pacific military-industrial cooperation, increase the interoperability of our militaries and strengthen our deterrent with China — thus imposing a cost on Beijing for funding a proxy war against the West in Ukraine.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MYFIX7JOIRB7JNWJK2VZLINQLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">In addition, expanding NATO to the Pacific would finally bring Hawaii under the protection of Article 5 of the NATO treaty.

But many of the elements of this plan — such as higher defense spending and a willingness to use aggressive leverage on allies — would only be plausible coming from Trump. With these six steps, Trump could do more than get allies to spend more. He could remake an alliance forged in the last century and position it to meet the threats of a new one. Today, in the wake of Russia’s aggression, China’s belligerence and the growing cooperation between the world’s revanchist regimes, the time has come to strengthen NATO with new members, inviolable spending commitments and consequences for failing to meet them.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QDQGTVBMZZD4BM3FPQARP7YIEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">In short, it is time to make NATO great again.</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<li><strong>Ecowas' disappointment and response</strong>: Ecowas Commission President Omar Alieu Touray expressed "disappointment with the lack of progress" and promised to develop a forward-looking contingency plan to address the crisis. The bloc has also appointed Senegalese President Bassirou Diomaye Faye to mediate the crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Military leaders' decision</strong>: The military leaders of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger have "irrevocably" decided to turn their backs on Ecowas to form a confederation of their own states. The decision comes after a series of coups in the three countries.</li>
<li><strong>Regional implications</strong>: Ecowas fears that the breakaway union could disrupt the freedom of movement of people across the region and undermine efforts to combat regional insecurity, including intelligence sharing.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on international relations</strong>: The crisis has implications for international relations, with Germany announcing that its army will end operations in Niger at the end of next month, and France's role in the region under scrutiny due to the military leaders' criticism of French influence.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Record high temperatures</strong>: Global temperatures reached record highs for the 13th consecutive month in June, with an average temperature of 16.66C (62F), which is 0.67 degrees Celsius above the 30-year average.</li>
<li><strong>12th month above 1.5°C threshold</strong>: June also marked the 12th straight month that the world was more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the pre-industrial era, a threshold agreed upon in the 2015 Paris Agreement.</li>
<li>** warnings of catastrophic climate change**: Senior climate scientist Nicolas Julien described the 13 consecutive months of record high temperatures as "a stark warning" that the globe is getting closer to the 1.5-degree limit and that this could translate into more extreme climate events such as floods, storms, droughts, and heatwaves.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term averages matter</strong>: While the Paris Agreement's 1.5-degree threshold is measured in averages reached over decades, not single months or years, the records of the past 13 months "shattered by very substantial margins" still carry significance.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate action needed</strong>: The article suggests that the continued rise in global temperatures is a clear indication that immediate action is needed to address climate change and prevent catastrophic consequences, as agreed upon in the Paris Agreement.</li>

<p>It broke the record for the hottest June, set a year earlier, by 0.14 degrees Celsius. It was the third hottest month recorded by Copernicus since 1940, behind only last July and last August.</p>
<p>“This is more than a statistical oddity and it highlights a continuing shift in our climate,” Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo said in a statement.</p>
<p>Copernicus senior climate scientist Nicolas Julien said in an interview that it is “a stark warning” as it signals the globe is getting closer to the 1.5-degree limit most countries accepted as part of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement to prevent catastrophic climate change.</p>

<p>Records have been “shattered by very substantial margins over the past 13 months”, he said.</p>
<p>This, however, does not mean that the Paris accord has already failed because its 1.5-degree threshold is measured in averages reached over decades, not single months or years.</p>
<p>But Julien said it has already translated into more “extreme climate events”, including worsening floods, storms, droughts and heatwaves.</p>
<p>June’s heat hit hard in Southeast Europe, Turkey, eastern Canada, the western United States and Mexico, Brazil, northern Siberia, the Middle East, North Africa and western Antarctica, according to Copernicus.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>The European Union’s flagship Earth observation programme said June was also the 15th straight month that the world’s oceans, more than two-thirds of Earth’s surface, have broken heat records.</p>
<p>To arrive at its conclusions, Copernicus uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world to track climate metrics and analyses them with computer simulations.</p>
<p>Buontempo said the current record-breaking streak of extreme heat may end soon but new records are bound to be broken in the near future as the climate continues to warm.</p>
<p>“This is inevitable unless we stop adding greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and the oceans,” he said.</p>
