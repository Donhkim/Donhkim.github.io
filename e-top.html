<li>
<p>The jury in the trial of former President Donald Trump's hush money case has resumed deliberations after revisiting the judge's instructions and rehearing testimony from key witnesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The jury, which has been deliberating for about 4.5 hours without reaching a verdict, has asked to rehear testimony from a tabloid publisher and Trump's former lawyer and fixer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump is facing four criminal indictments and a civil lawsuit in the case, which stems from his alleged scheme to pay hush money to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to keep her from talking about their alleged affair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A guilty verdict against Trump would be a significant legal reckoning for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, while an acquittal would be a major win for him and embolden him on the campaign trail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The jury's deliberations are ongoing, and it is unclear how long they will last. A verdict must be unanimous, and if the jury cannot reach a consensus, the case could end in a mistrial.</p>

<p>In a memo Wednesday evening, Trump campaign senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles blasted the proceedings as a “kangaroo court” and argued the case would not matter in November.</p><p>“The bottom line is this case doesn’t have an impact on voters,” they wrote.</p>



<p>Trump, who on Wednesday appeared to be priming supporters for the possibility of a guilty verdict by saying “Mother Teresa couldn’t bear these charges,” struck a pessimistic tone again Thursday. </p>
    
<p>“It’s all rigged. The whole thing, the whole system is rigged,” he said. It’s the same language he used to try to inoculate himself against losses in the 2020 presidential election and Iowa’s 2016 GOP primary.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

That, prosecutors say, was the beginning of the catch-and-kill scheme at the heart of the case.</p>
    

<p>Jurors also reheard Pecker’s account of a phone call he said he received from Trump in which they discussed a rumor that another outlet had offered to buy former Playboy model Karen McDougal’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/karen-mcdougal">story that she had a yearlong affair</a></span> with Trump in the mid-2000s. Trump denies the affair.</p><p>Pecker testified that Trump told him, “Karen is a nice girl,” and asked, “What do you think I should do?” Pecker said he replied: “I think you should buy the story and take it off the market.” He added that Trump told him that he doesn’t buy stories because they always get out and that Cohen would be in touch.</p>
    

<p>The publisher said he came away from the conversation thinking Trump was aware of the specifics of McDougal’s claims. Pecker said he believed the story was true and would have been embarrassing to Trump and his campaign if it were made public.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of the National Rifle Association (NRA) in a First Amendment case, backing the organization's right to free speech and association.</li>
<li>The ruling means that the NRA may continue to pursue its lawsuit against a New York official who urged banks and insurance companies to cut ties with the organization following the 2018 Parkland, Florida school shooting.</li>
<li>Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the majority, emphasized that government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors.</li>
<li>The court's decision reinforces the First Amendment's protection of speech and association, stating that government officials cannot selectively use their power to punish or suppress speech.</li>
<li>The ruling has implications for advocacy groups and advocacy efforts more broadly, as it sets a precedent for the rights of organizations to engage in political speech and associational activities without government interference.</li>

            “Government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the most senior liberal, wrote for the court.

            The NRA claimed that Maria Vullo, the former superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, not only leaned on insurance companies to part ways with the gun lobby but threatened enforcement actions against those firms if they failed to comply.
    </p>

            At the center of the dispute was a meeting Vullo had with insurance market Lloyd’s of London in 2018 in which the NRA claims she offered to not prosecute other violations as long as the company helped with the campaign against gun groups. Vullo tried to wave off the significance of the meeting, arguing in part that the NRA’s allegations of what took place were not specific.

            Vullo, who served in Democratic former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration, said her enforcement targeted an insurance product that is illegal in New York: third-party policies sold through the NRA that cover personal injury and criminal defense costs following the use of a firearm. Critics dubbed the policies “murder insurance.”

            The decision will provide some clarity to government regulators — both liberal and conservative — about how far they may go to pressure private companies that do business with controversial advocacy groups.

            “This is a landmark victory for the NRA and all who care about our First Amendment freedom,” William A. Brewer III, a lawyer for the association, said in a statement. “The opinion confirms what the NRA has known all along: New York government officials abused the power of their office to silence a political enemy.”

            An attorney for Vullo said they were “disappointed by the court’s decision” but noted that a lower court that previously sided with her on a different legal basis may ultimately reaffirm that decision.

            “Ms. Vullo did not violate anyone’s First Amendment rights,” the attorney, Neal Katyal, said in a statement. “Ms. Vullo enforced the insurance law against admitted violations by insurance entities, and<em> </em>industry letters such as those issued by Ms. Vullo are routine and important tools regulators use to inform and advise the entities they oversee about risks.”

            While the NRA is more likely to be at the Supreme Court making Second Amendment arguments, it picked up unfamiliar allies with its First Amendment claim. The American Civil Liberties Union, which usually sits opposite the NRA in the debate over guns, agreed to represent the group before the Supreme Court.

            A US district court denied some of the NRA’s claims but allowed its First Amendment arguments to proceed against Vullo. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision, concluding that Vullo’s actions were not coercive. It also ruled that Vullo was entitled to qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that shields government officials from lawsuits in some circumstances.

            The NRA largely relied on a 1963 Supreme Court decision,<em> </em><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/372/58/" target="_blank"><em>Bantam Books v. Sullivan</em></a>, that dealt with a Rhode Island commission that had threatened to refer distributors to police if they sold books deemed to be obscene.

            In his brief response Thursday, Roberts wrote that a meeting with leaders “of only one party who have expressed an interest in matters currently pending before the court” only served to underscore his belief “that participating in such a meeting would be inadvisable.” (Republican leaders of the Judiciary Committee were copied on the meeting request and Roberts’ response.)

He said Ukraine should be “allowed” to use weapons supplied by the West against military sites on Russian territory - although strictly not on civilian targets.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">That pressure has been compounded by Russia's recent advances on the battlefield. Moscow has made significant gains in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region and in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. Ukraine’s losses were aggravated by partisan paralysis in Washington that has caused a long delay in providing missiles and artillery shells.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">While Mr Macron has for some time advocated for more direct intervention in the Ukraine war – other Western leaders also appear to be softening to the idea.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has remained cautious in public but a spokesman in Berlin said that "defensive action is not limited to one's own territory, but also includes the territory of the aggressor".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">UK Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron said earlier this month that it was up to Ukraine to decide how to use British weapons, while this week the Polish Deputy Defence Minister said that Ukrainians could use Polish weapons “as they see fit”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The debate over the issue is ongoing within the US administration, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken believed to be among those trying to convince President Biden to ease the restrictions.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Blinken became the first senior administration official to suggest the US could shift its position during a visit to Moldova on Wednesday, telling reporters Washington’s stance on the matter would "adapt and adjust" based on changing battlefield conditions.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“[Ukraine] has to make its own decisions about the best way to effectively defend itself.

<ol>
<li><strong>What is the Hurricane Season?</strong>: The hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean runs from June 1 to November 30, with the peak season being mid-August to late October.</li>
<li><strong>When are most hurricanes born?</strong>: According to NOAA, most hurricanes form between August 20 and October 31, with the majority of intense hurricanes occurring between mid-August and late September.</li>

            The state described him as a power-hungry and grandiose man who would stop at nothing for “what he considered his rightful destiny.” His defense lawyer portrayed Daybell as a religious man driven into an unfortunate relationship by a “beautiful, vivacious woman” who knew “how to get what she wants.”

            Prior, the defense attorney, said Daybell’s life began to change after he met Vallow Daybell, a “beautifully stunning woman” who “starts giving him a lot of attention” and eventually lured him into an “inappropriate” and “unfortunate” extramarital relationship.

            Vallow Daybell’s two children from a previous marriage were last seen on different days in September 2019. Tylee Ryan was a “normal, vibrant teenage girl” who loved her friends and her little brother JJ, who was on the autism spectrum and required special care, according to Wood.

            In late November 2019, relatives asked police in Rexburg, Idaho,<em> </em>to do a welfare check on JJ because they hadn’t talked to him recently.

            Prior, however, argued the state didn’t “come close” to having enough evidence to prove Daybell concealed the bodies of JJ or Tylee. “There’s been no indication of any evidence that this act took place on the night of the 22nd or 23rd, or whatever day it was,” Prior said.

that was used to defraud billions of dollars from the U.S. government and fund his lavish lifestyle, which included buying luxury cars and property around the world, the Department of Justice announced Wednesday.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">YunHe Wang, 35, was arrested on May 24 and charged with creating a massive network of hijacked computer devices, also known as a "botnet," that was used to conduct cyber attacks, fraud, child exploitation, bomb threats, and export violations, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/911-s5-botnet-dismantled-and-its-administrator-arrested-coordinated-international-operation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">the department alleged</a>. Wang administered the botnet, called "911 S5," through about 150 servers worldwide from 2014 to 2022, according to an indictment unsealed last week.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">About 76 of the servers were leased from online service providers based in the United States, the indictment said. The botnet infected over 19 million IP addresses in nearly 200 countries, including over 613,000 IP addresses located in the United States, according to prosecutors.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Justice Department announcement comes after Wang and his two co-conspirators, Jingping Liu and Yanni Zheng, were sanctioned by the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Department of Treasury</a> for their alleged involvement with the malicious botnet. The department also imposed sanctions on three luxury companies Wang owned or controlled.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Authorities also searched Wang's residences and seized assets valued at about $30 million as well as identifying other property valued at roughly an additional $30 million, prosecutors said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"The conduct alleged here reads like it’s ripped from a screenplay," Matthew Axelrod, assistant secretary for export control at the Department of Commerce, said in a statement Wednesday. "A scheme to sell access to millions of malware-infected computers worldwide, enabling criminals over the world to steal billions of dollars, transmit bomb threats, and exchange child exploitation materials — then using the scheme’s nearly $100 million in profits to buy luxury cars, watches, and real estate."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Department of Justice partnered with the FBI and international law enforcement agencies in Singapore, Thailand, and Germany to dismantle the botnet and arrest Wang. The case is the latest in the federal government's ongoing effort to <a href="/story/news/politics/2022/02/17/cybercrime-focus-justice-department-crackdown-global-hackers/6828688001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">thwart global cybercrime</a>, which has become increasingly widespread.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">These crimes can range from intellectual property theft to ransomware and can cost businesses billions of dollars in losses in addition to threatening critical sectors across the country, according to the Department of State. In recent years, federal authorities have expanded their international operations and country-to-country partnerships in order to better address cyber threats.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong class="gnt_ar_b_al">'Urgency and severity of cyberattacks':</strong><a href="/story/news/nation/2024/05/21/epa-cyberattacks-community-water-systems/73778706007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:12|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">EPA urges water utilities to protect nation's drinking water amid heightened cyberattacks</a></p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">911 S5 Botnet 'likely the world's largest botnet ever'</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement Wednesday that 911 S5 is "likely the world’s largest botnet ever." According to the indictment, Wang allegedly spread his malware through Virtual Private Network programs and pay-per-install services, which allowed him to manage and control the roughly 150 servers.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Paying customers were then given access to proxied IP addresses that were linked to the hacked devices, the indictment said. Cybercriminals used those addresses to hide their locations and "anonymously commit a wide array of offenses," the Department of Justice alleged.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"These offenses including financial crimes, stalking, transmitting bomb threats and threats of harm, illegal exportation of goods, and receiving and sending child exploitation materials," according to the department. "Since 2014, 911 S5 allegedly enabled cybercriminals to bypass financial fraud detection systems and steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Specifically, the botnet targeted COVID-19 pandemic relief programs and filed an estimated 560,529 fraudulent unemployment insurance claims, according to the indictment. Federal authorities confirmed that more than $5.9 billion was stolen as a result.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The indictment further alleged that Wang had amassed about $99 million — either in cryptocurrency or fiat currency — from his sales of the infected proxied IP addresses. He used the illicit proceeds to purchase luxury assets and property.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Wang bought property in the United States, St. Kitts and Nevis, China, Singapore, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates, according to the indictment. He also had dozens of other assets, such as luxury cars, watches, international bank accounts, and cryptocurrency wallets.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Wang was charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud, substantive computer fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He faces a maximum of 65 years in prison.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/2012/09/09/the-day-in-pictures/1410095/" data-t-l=":l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - The day in pictures" data-g-r="nav_mo" data-g-tn="pgcss" data-g-mtn="pg1410095" data-g-moh="hpgm" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" data-c-id="1410095"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/30/USAT/73901126007-xxx-usat-882035-215111.JPG?crop=4162,2341,x0,y0&amp;width=660&amp;height=372&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/30/USAT/73901126007-xxx-usat-882035-215111.JPG?crop=4162,2341,x0,y0&amp;width=1320&amp;height=744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt=""><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="66"><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg__ca"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"></use></svg><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_expand"></use></svg></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="The day in pictures" aria-label="A look at the day's best photographs from around the world."></p></a><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt">Cybercrime, COVID fraud in the U.S.</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Cybercrime is a "significant and growing threat" to the country's national and economic security, according to the State Department.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>President Biden's re-election campaign is criticizing MSNBC and CNN for not covering a "Black Voters for Biden-Harris" rally in Philadelphia, despite the historic trial of former President Trump being covered by the same networks.</li>
<li>At the rally, Biden promised to nominate progressives to the Supreme Court if he wins a second term, stating that "if you want to know what's at stake in this election, ask the 1,000 Black voters who came out today".</li>
<li>Biden campaign spokesperson TJ Ducklo criticized the networks for their coverage, stating that they "did not show" the rally and instead focused on the Trump trial, which only impacts one person, Trump.</li>
<li>Ducklo also criticized the networks for not showing the rally, asking "then they'll ask, why isn't your message getting out?"</li>
<li>The Biden campaign is highlighting the importance of Biden's message for Black voters, with Ducklo stating that the networks have a duty to make sure Americans know that if Trump regains power, he would take extreme measures such as expanding abortion bans and weaponizing the Department of Justice.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Israel has taken control of the Philadelphi corridor</strong>: Israel's military has gained control over the 9-mile-long buffer zone along the Gaza-Egypt border, in an area known as the Philadelphi corridor.</li>
<li><strong>Egypt has maintained a wall of silence</strong>: Egypt has chosen to remain silent on the issue, potentially to avoid escalating tensions with Israel and to keep public anger under control.</li>
<li><strong>Peace agreement breached</strong>: By taking control of the Philadelphi corridor, Israel has breached the 1979 peace agreement with Egypt, which allowed only limited military presence in the demilitarised zone along the Israel-Egypt border.</li>
<li><strong>Gaza-Egypt border under Israeli control</strong>: The takeover gives Israel operational control over the Gaza-Egypt border, potentially restricting the flow of people and goods between the two regions.</li>
<li><strong>Egypt's motivation</strong>: By keeping a low profile, Egypt is likely attempting to prevent widespread public outrage and maintain stability in the region, while also avoiding a direct confrontation with Israel.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>AI-powered propaganda</strong>: OpenAI, the company behind the ChatGPT AI model, has identified groups from Russia, China, Iran, and Israel using its technology to spread propaganda and influence political discourse worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>State-sponsored disinformation</strong>: The groups used OpenAI's tech to write posts, translate them into multiple languages, and automate social media posting, raising concerns about the ease of conducting covert propaganda campaigns ahead of the 2024 US presidential election.</li>
<li><strong>Scope and targeting</strong>: The groups targeted multiple audiences, including the US, UK, and other countries, using social media platforms to spread their messages. However, OpenAI notes that these efforts had limited success, with most social media accounts having few followers.</li>
<li><strong>Groups and their activities</strong>: The identified groups included a Russian propaganda operation, a Chinese state-sponsored group, an Israeli political campaign firm, and a previously unknown Russian group, dubbed "Bad Grammar."</li>
<li><strong>Impact and concerns</strong>: The discovery highlights the potential risks of AI-powered disinformation and the need for vigilant monitoring to prevent the misuse of AI technology in propaganda campaigns.</li>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>ANC below 50% of the vote</strong>: Partial results in South Africa's national election show the African National Congress (ANC) party, which has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994, well below 50% of the vote.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of losing majority</strong>: If the ANC fails to secure a majority, it may need to form a coalition to remain in government, a scenario that has never happened before in post-apartheid South Africa.</li>
<li><strong>Implications for President Ramaphosa</strong>: The ANC's lack of a majority would also mean that President Cyril Ramaphosa would need help from other parties to reelect him for a second term.</li>
<li><strong>Completion of counting</strong>: The final results are expected to take days, with the independent electoral commission aiming to deliver the results by Sunday, although they could come earlier.</li>
<li><strong>Significance of the election</strong>: The outcome of the election has significant implications for South Africa, with some analysts calling it a "massive change in South African politics" that could mark a new era for the country.</li>

<p>The ANC had the most votes by some way and was well ahead in the early results, as expected. But if it fails to secure a majority, it may have to form a coalition to remain in the government — something that has never happened before in post-apartheid South Africa. Without a majority, the ANC would also need help from other parties to reelect President Cyril Ramaphosa for a second term.</p>
    

<p>“I think we are seeing a massive change in South African politics,” Susan Booysen, a political analyst and professor emeritus at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said on national broadcaster SABC TV.</p>



<p>With around 27% of votes counted, it was still only an early picture after Wednesday’s election. The final results were expected to take days, with the independent electoral commission saying they would be delivered by Sunday, although they could come earlier.</p>
    
<p>South Africans were waiting with baited breath to see if their country, Africa’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/south-africa">most advanced economy</a></span>, was about to enter a new era. Some analysts said the incomplete results were already unprecedented with regards to how far <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-anc-decline-cf154312e3dc5c1b5ee615b82ba0c080">the long dominant ANC</a></span> was below the 50% mark at this stage in the counting.</p><p>The results that had been declared were from just over 6,000 of the more than 23,000 polling stations across the nine provinces that make up South Africa, and there was a long way to go in the counting. The partial results put the ANC at 43% of the vote.</p>
    

<p>The ANC’s worst performance in a national election is the 57.5% it won in the last one in 2019. A projection from a government agency and SABC, based on early vote returns, estimated that the ANC would end up with about 42% this time, a drop of more than 15%, which would be a stunning result in the context of South Africa.</p><p>The ANC would likely have to co-govern and find a coalition partner if the projections hold, taking South Africa into the unknown. The ANC said right up to Wednesday’s election that it was confident of retaining its majority and has given no indication over how it might form a coalition government.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

        </div><p>“Everybody was looking at the ANC (to receive) around 36% to 40%, and we are quite certain that we will surpass that,” Mokonyane said.</p><p>Nearly 28 million people out of South Africa’s population of 62 million were registered to vote.</p><p>South Africa may be the continent’s most advanced country, but it has struggled to solve a profuse inequality that has kept millions in poverty decades after the segregation of apartheid ended. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-poverty-anc-vote-c9ce37716f1e31cf305361c4469a58e9">That inequality and widespread poverty</a></span> disproportionately affects the Black majority that make up more than 80% of the country’s population. South Africa has one of the worst unemployment rates in the world at 32%.</p><p>Voters repeatedly referred to unemployment as well as other issues like ANC corruption scandals, problems with basic government services and high violent crime as their main grievances.</p>
    

<p>The ANC was faced with more opposition than ever in this vote. More than 50 political parties were registered to participate, the most in a national election, with many of them new. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-opposition-7993a72a56538198592235b6f957b750">Much of the opposition vote</a></span> was expected to be spread among an array of those other parties, though.</p><p>The early results put the Democratic Alliance at around 25% of the vote and the Economic Freedom Fighters party at around 8%. They are South Africa’s biggest opposition parties. The partial results also reflected the possible immediate impact of the new MK Party of former President Jacob Zuma, who turned against the ANC he once led. The MK Party had the fourth-biggest share of the early count in its first election and was becoming a significant factor in draining support from the ANC.</p>
    

<p>South Africans vote for parties and not directly for their president in national elections. Those parties then get seats in Parliament according to their share of the vote and lawmakers elect the president. The ANC has always had a clear parliamentary majority since 1994, so the president has always been from the ANC. </p><p>That process of electing a president wouldn’t be so simple if the ANC lost its majority.</p><p>The electoral commission predicted a high turnout and that was reflected in Wednesday’s scenes across the nation, as South Africans lined up into the night to make their choice. The long, snaking lines of voters in cities, towns and rural fields revived memories of the definitive election of 1994 that changed a country.</p><p>While polls officially closed at 9 p.m., voting continued for hours after that in many places as officials noted a late surge of ballots being cast in major cities like Johannesburg and Cape Town. The electoral commission said the last votes were cast at around 3 a.m. The rules say that anyone lining up at a voting station by the closing time must be allowed to vote.</p><p>The determination of South Africans standing out in the chilly winter weather into the middle of the night suggested millions had embraced how consequential this election might be.</p><p>“I would definitely argue that we are looking at a moment of change,” said Joleen Steyn-Kotze, chief research specialist on democracy at South Africa’s Human Sciences Research Council.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Gerald Imray reported from Cape Town.</p><h2>___</h2><p>AP Africa news: <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/africa">https://apnews.com/hub/africa</a></span></p>
