<p>Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison when he is sentenced by U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, though as a first-time offender he would not get anywhere near the maximum, and there’s no guarantee the judge would send him to prison. She did not set a sentencing date.</p><p>Defense attorney Abbe Lowell said they would “continue to vigorously pursue all the legal challenges available.” In a written statement, Hunter Biden said he was disappointed by the outcome but grateful for the support of family and friends.</p>
    
<p>The jury’s decision was read swiftly after the announcement that it reached a verdict. First lady Jill Biden sat through nearly every day of the trial but did not make it into the courtroom in time to hear the verdict. Hunter Biden walked out of the courthouse holding hands with the first lady and his wife before they got into got into waiting SUVs and drove off.</p>
    

<p>Joe Biden steered clear of the federal courtroom in Delaware where his son was tried and said little about the case, wary of appearing to interfere in a criminal matter brought by his own Justice Department. But allies of the Democrat have worried about the toll that the trial — and now the conviction — will take on the 81-year-old, who has long been concerned with his only living son’s health and sustained sobriety.</p><p>Hunter Biden’s conviction came just weeks after Trump was found guilty of 34 felony charges related to a hush money payment to a porn actor in the 2016 campaign. The cases are in no way the same, and Hunter Biden is a private citizen who is not running for office. But they have both argued they were victimized by the politics of the moment.</p><p>Trump, however, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-2024-campaign-trial-4629840240cb308c5eae335532ad17ed">has continued to falsely claim his verdict was “rigged,”</a></span> while Joe Biden has said he would accept the verdict involving his son and would not seek to pardon him.</p><p>In his statement Tuesday, the president said he and the first lady are proud of their son, who says he has been been sober since 2019, and will always be there for him with “love and support.”</p><p>Trump’s campaign called the verdict “nothing more than a distraction from the real crimes of the Biden Crime Family.” Trump and his allies have pressed unsubstantiated or debunked allegations that Joe Biden acted while vice president to advance his family members’ foreign business interests.</p>
    

<p>The verdict came down as the president prepared to give a speech at a conference hosted by the Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund in Washington. He did not mention his son as he spoke about his administration’s efforts to stop gun violence and the need to ban so-called assault weapons.</p><p>The president planned to spend Tuesday evening with family in Delaware before leaving Wednesday for the Group of Seven leaders conference in Italy.</p><p>Jurors found Hunter Biden guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.</p><p>The trial played out <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bd19a3f3cc613d2f85f6578c598e060e">in the president’s home state</a></span>, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-white-house-economy-amtrak-infrastructure-38150ad86f29daa330af26f491a8a491">Joe Biden spent 36 years</a></span> as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington, and his other son, Beau Biden, was the state attorney general before he died of cancer.</p>




    

<p>The proceedings put a spotlight on a dark time in Hunter Biden’s life, with deeply personal testimony from <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-trial-family-testimony-gun-charges-17e671d16f7b06b04b4e3b538f911d07">former romantic partners</a></span> and embarrassing evidence, including text messages and photos of Hunter Biden with drug paraphernalia or partially clothed. </p><p>In his closing argument on Monday, prosecutor Leo Wise acknowledged the evidence was “ugly.” But he told jurors it was also “absolutely necessary” to prove Hunter was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied when he checked “no” on the form that asked whether he was “an unlawful user of, or addicted to” drugs.</p>
    

<p>Before the case went to the jury, the prosecutor urged jurors to pay no mind to members of the president’s family sitting in the courtroom, telling them: “People sitting in the gallery are not evidence.” </p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is on a diplomatic trip to the Middle East, said Tuesday that in a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli leader “reaffirmed his commitment” to the current proposal to secure a ceasefire and hostage release, which is still awaiting an answer from Hamas.

            The deal is divided into three phases, according to Thomas-Greenfield.

            “The proof is in the pudding. We will see who are the ones who are interested to see this resolution to become a reality and those who are obstructing it and want to continue the war of genocide against our people,” he added.

            Ahead of the vote, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/blinken-middle-east-travel-ceasefire-deal/index.html">Blinken</a> told Netanyahu during their meeting in Jerusalem that the proposal would “unlock the possibility of calm along Israel’s northern border and further integration with countries in the region,” according to a State Department readout.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxa4lz4p00023b6j2o7fzij1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “The United States and other world leaders will stand behind” the proposal for a release of the hostages and an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, Blinken told Netanyahu.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clx9t62ua000q3b6hnqc83p75@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            After the resolution was adopted, Blinken spoke with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, where he “commended Israel’s readiness to conclude a deal and affirmed that the onus is on Hamas to accept,” according to a readout of their meeting.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clx9t62ua000r3b6hhziwnv6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Blinken arrived in Israel on Monday, following the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/09/middleeast/benny-gantz-resignation-post-war-plan-gaza-intl-latam/index.html">resignation of Benny Gantz</a> from the Israeli war cabinet on Sunday. Gantz’s departure delivered a blow to Netanyahu, who is coming under increasing pressure from Western allies and families of hostages to end the war and bring back the captives.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxa4gwvn00003b6j1kaahrcv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Gantz stressed to Blinken in their meeting the importance of “applying maximum pressure” on negotiators to secure Hamas’ agreement to the latest ceasefire plan and bring those being held in Gaza home, according to a statement from Gantz’s office. It added that Gantz said his party would support “any responsible arrangement” on the matter from outside the government.
    </p>

            There has been confusion about whose proposal this is, however. Biden has called it an “Israeli proposal,” but less than an hour after Biden announced the plan in May, Netanyahu said his country would not end the war until Hamas is defeated.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxa5sjr2000f3b6je0xlumfs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Biden has said Hamas has been degraded to a point where it can no longer carry out the type of attack, and that now “it’s time for this war to end.” The Israeli prime minister, however, is yet to publicly announce whether his country has accepted or rejected the US-drafted proposal.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clx9t62ua000s3b6h4rf5z433@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Eight months since the war began, Israel is yet to achieve its stated objectives as most of Hamas’ top leadership remains at large, while earlier this week, Israeli military officials estimated around 120 hostages remain captive, of which around 70 are thought to still be alive.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clx9t62ua000t3b6h7lnu6rmd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            More than 37,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.
    </p>

            CNN cannot verify the numbers provided by the ministry, which does not distinguish between casualties among fighters and civilians. It does not include in its figures the several thousand people thought to be missing, or those still under the rubble in Gaza since October 7.

<ol>
<li>Four US university tutors from Iowa's Cornell College were stabbed at a public park in Jilin, China, while visiting a local temple on Monday.</li>

<li>The suspect, identified as Cui, is in police custody, and the motive behind the attack is unclear. Authorities believe the incident was "an isolated incident".</li>
<li>The US government has expressed concern over the attack, with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan saying the US is "deeply concerned" and working to ensure the victims' needs are met.</li>

The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 37,000 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive since then.</p></div></article></div>

<li>
<p><strong>Southern Baptist Convention Meeting</strong>: Over 10,000 voting representatives, known as "messengers", have gathered for the two-day annual meeting in Indianapolis to discuss issues such as banning churches with women pastors and responding to sexual abuse within churches.</p>

<p><strong>Proposed Amendment</strong>: The amendment seeks to ban churches with women pastors, from lead to associate roles, in the Southern Baptist Convention's constitution. This measure has already received preliminary approval last year.</p>

<p><strong>Pro-Woman Demonstration</strong>: A small group of women, including the Rev. Meredith Stone, executive director of Baptist Women in Ministry, held a low-key demonstration outside the Indiana Convention Center to support women in ministry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connection to Sexual Abuse</strong>: Advocates such as Christa Brown, who has written a memoir on her experiences of sexual abuse in Southern Baptist churches, believe that restricting women's roles in ministry can lead to a culture of abuse and oppression.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>SBC Stance on Women's Roles</strong>: The Southern Baptist Convention's statement of faith reserves the office of pastor for men alone, and some interpret this to mean senior pastors, while the proposed amendment would also apply to women in associate roles. The SBC can't force its member churches to comply, but it can decide which churches are in or out of the denomination.</p>

                                        <p>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — More than 10,000 voting representatives gathered Tuesday for the opening of the Southern Baptist Convention’s two-day <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-southern-baptists-women-pastors-sexual-abuse-indianapolis-f16d01e35fc379e91f8c72dea643cd81">annual meeting</a></span>, where they will vote on whether to ban churches with women pastors and deliberate yet again on how to respond to sexual abuse within churches.</p><p>Some 10,553 messengers, as delegates are known, are meeting in Indianapolis. </p><p>On Wednesday, they are expected to debate whether to amend their constitution to ban churches with any <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/religion-southern-baptists-women-pastors-saddleback-3b40fd925377a9e3aa2ecb4a4072a4a6">women pastors</a></span> — from lead to associate roles. The measure received preliminary approval last year.</p><p>Early Tuesday, a small group of women stood outside the Indiana Convention Center in a low-key demonstration in support of women in ministry.</p><p>“I hope that people know women have equal value and can be pastors,” said the Rev. Meredith Stone, executive director of Baptist Women in Ministry, an organization that originated within the SBC in the 1980s, but it now works with women in a variety of Baptist denominations.</p>
    

<p>Participants said that of the hundreds of messengers filing by, reactions ranged from sneers to subtle thumbs-up signs to a few voicing “thank you” out loud.</p>



<p>Joining them was Christa Brown, who has long advocated for fellow survivors of sexual abuse in Southern Baptist churches and criticized the denomination’s resistance to reforms, an effort she has chronicled in a new memoir, “Baptistland.”</p>
    
<p>She said there’s a direct connection between issues of abuse and the equality of women in ministry.</p><p>“When you squash some people, it sets up a lot more people to be squashed,” she said.</p><p>The SBC’s statement of faith says that while women and men are both “gifted for service” in the church, the office of pastor is reserved for men alone. Some interpret that to mean only senior pastors, but the amendment would also apply to women in associate roles even if the senior pastor is male. </p>
    

<p>The SBC can’t tell its independent churches what to do, but it can decide whether they are in or out. Since 2023, it has ousted some churches with women in pastoral positions, including <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/southern-baptists-saddleback-vote-women-pastors-new-orleans-7ee6606b57d0bf0c4c7ed91316af12b1">Saddleback Church</a></span>, a California megachurch.</p><p>Politics is also a factor in sideline events. On Monday, former <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-2024-election-abortion-christians-13318983232798e44e9638a33811f844">President Donald Trump</a></span> appeared in a videotaped message to attendees of a staunchly anti-abortion conservative group that met Monday next door to the convention center. Trump appealed to the attendees for their votes.</p><p>Later Tuesday, former Vice President Mike Pence told an audience at a sideline event that he would “never” vote for President Joe Biden, criticizing him on border, abortion and other policies. But Pence stopped short of endorsing his estranged onetime running mate, former President Donald Trump.</p><p>Pence repeatedly called on GOP leadership to return to an agenda defined under former President Ronald Reagan, which he described in broad brushstrokes as promoting prosperity, freedom, international leadership, opposition to abortion and defense of religious liberty.</p><p> Pence offered a strong dose of religious themes in a question-and-answer session with Brent Leatherwood, president of the SBC’s public policy agency, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission. About 500 people attended the luncheon and gave Pence a standing ovation.</p>
    

<p>Without criticizing Trump by name, Pence criticized those who would leave the abortion issue to the states, saying that when the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision, it actually turned the issue to the states and “the American people,” and he called for officials at every level of government “to advance the sanctity of life.” He compared the “off to the states” argument with those who sought to keep slavery a states’ rights issue in the 19th century.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the overturning of a federally guaranteed right to abortion — having nominated three of the justices who overturned Roe v. Wade — but has <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-abortion-2024-ban-7bf06e0856b88a710c79a6eb85cffa6a">resisted supporting a national abortion ban</a></span> and says he wants to leave the issue to the states. </p><p>Pence said he was proud to be part of the administration whose appointments helped put Roe “onto the ash heap of history.” </p>
    

<p>He peppered in self-deprecating jokes about having been “Rush Limbaugh on decaf” when hosting a mild-mannered radio show, and how Trump teased him over controversy of Pence’s following the “Billy Graham rule” of never dining alone with a woman other than his wife. Trump, he recalled said that “after all they said about me, they’re attacking Mike Pence for being faithful to his wife.”</p><p>Pence said he remains convinced he did the right thing on Jan. 6, 2021, in fulfilling his role in certifying Biden’s election in the face of a riot and President Trump’s insistence that Pence could do otherwise. Pence said there’s nothing more un-American than the idea that one man, as vice president, could thwart the will of the electorate. </p><p>“I always believed by God’s grace on that tragic day we did our duty,” he said.</p>
    

<p>Bart Barber, a Texas pastor concluding his two-year tenure as SBC president, told messengers on Tuesday that their churches need to provide a “safe place” to worship and gather.</p><p>An Abuse Reform Implementation Task Force recently concluded its work. While it has provided a curriculum for training churches on preventing and responding to abuse, it has not achieved the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/religion-california-sexual-abuse-by-clergy-baptist-southern-convention-ba7ba613947cc893659b6e8e45ab4b73">mandate</a></span> of previous annual meetings to establish a database of offenders, which could help churches avoid hiring them.</p><p>Abuse survivor and advocate Megan Lively on Tuesday morning moved that the convention task the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission with raising awareness about abuse and providing resources on preventing and responding to it. She is a delegate from Peace Church in Wilson, North Carolina. </p><p>Though some have advocated for reforms for the past two decades, the convention has particularly struggled to respond to sexual abuse in its churches since a 2019 report by the Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express-News. It said that roughly 380 Southern Baptist church leaders and volunteers faced allegations of sexual misconduct in the previous two decades.</p><p>The denomination subsequently commissioned a report from a consulting firm, Guidepost Solutions. It concluded that leaders of the convention’s Executive Committee <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/baptist-religion-sexual-abuse-by-clergy-southern-convention-bfdbe64389790630488f854c3dae3fd5">intimidated and mistreated</a></span> survivors who sought help. The committee handles day-to-day business of the convention.</p><p>Jeff Iorg, the new president of the Executive Committee, told its members in a meeting Monday that the committee is facing a “financial crisis” because it indemnified Guidepost Solutions from any legal repercussions from the study. The convention is paying for the legal defense against two defamation lawsuits filed by two men named in the report.</p><p>“We have spent more than $2 million so far on that indemnification, and there is no end in sight,” Iorg said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://bit.ly/ap-twir" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaboration</a></span> with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

<li><strong>No appeals pending</strong>: Hosier's lawyers have said that no court appeals are currently pending, indicating that no further legal action is being taken to halt the execution.</li>
<li><strong>Gov. Mike Parson declined clemency request</strong>: The Governor turned down a clemency request from Hosier, citing a lack of remorse as one of the reasons.

<li><strong>Hosier's final statement</strong>: In a statement released to the Associated Press, Hosier said he will go to his death with love in his heart and will "go to Heaven" when he dies, encouraging others not to cry for him but to join him when their own time comes.</li>
<li><strong>Hosier's background</strong>: Hosier's father, a police officer, was killed in the line of duty in 1971. As a result, Hosier was sent to military school and enlisted in the Navy, serving four years of active duty before moving to Jefferson City, Missouri, where he worked as a firefighter and EMT for many years.</li>

In September 2009, they were shot to death near the doorway of their Jefferson City apartment.</p></div><div class="lee-article-text"><p>Detective Jason Miles told the AP that Hosier made numerous comments to other people threatening to harm Angela Gilpin in the days before the killings. After the shootings, police found an application for a protective order in Angela Gilpin’s purse, and another document in which she expressed fear that Hosier might shoot her and her husband.</p></div><div class="lee-article-text"><p>Hosier was an immediate suspect, but police couldn’t find him. They used cellphone data to track him to Oklahoma. A chase ensued when an Oklahoma officer tried to stop Hosier’s car. When he got out, he told the officers, “Shoot me, and get it over with,” court records show.</p></div><div class="lee-article-text"><p>Officers found 15 guns, a bulletproof vest, 400 rounds of ammunition and other weapons in Hosier’s car.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Virginia NAACP and five students are suing the Shenandoah County School Board, arguing that the board's decision to restore the names of two schools previously named after Confederate leaders creates a discriminatory educational environment for Black students.</li>
<li>The schools in question, Stonewall Jackson High School and Ashby Lee Elementary School, were previously renamed to Mountain View High School and Honey Run Elementary School in 2020 as part of a nationwide reckoning on race and Confederate symbols.</li>
<li>The school board voted 5-1 in May to restore the old names, sparking outrage and criticism from the NAACP and other civil rights groups.</li>
<li>The lawsuit alleges that the decision denies Black students an equal opportunity to education by forcing them to attend schools named after Confederate leaders, perpetuating racism and discrimination in the community.</li>
<li>The lawsuit also highlights a history of segregation and discrimination in Shenandoah County, arguing that the school board's decision further entrenches systemic racism and undermines efforts to promote equity and inclusivity in education.</li>

            Activists covered the king’s head with an image of the British cartoon character Wallace, from the “Wallace and Gromit” comedy series. A speech bubble sign was then also tacked onto the painting with the following caption: “No cheese Gromit, look at all of this cruelty on RSCPA farms.”

            The action was designed to bring attention to a new report, released on Sunday by the group, which investigated 45 farms whose welfare standards are guaranteed by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). The RSPCA’s Assured scheme promises that animals in protected farms are given more living space and are never kept in cages. Meat, fish and dairy products produced by these farms are marked with the RSCPA logo. Animal Rising described their findings as “damning,” alleging that they found <a href="https://www.animalrising.org/" target="_blank">“severe animal cruelty”</a> at all farms visited.

            Last month, King Charles became the royal patron of the RSPCA. In a statement provided to British newspaper <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/06/11/vegan-activists-vandalise-portrait-of-king/" target="_blank">The Telegraph</a>, an Animal Rising activist explained, “With King Charles being such a big fan of ‘Wallace and Gromit,’ we couldn’t think of a better way to draw his attention to the horrific scenes on RSPCA Assured farms! Even though we hope this is amusing to His Majesty, we also call on him to seriously reconsider if he wants to be associated with the awful suffering across farms being endorsed by the RSPCA.”

            Animal Rising describes itself as a non-violent organization campaigning for an “urgent transition to a sustainable and just plant-based food system.” It is also petitioning for the RSPCA’s Assured scheme, which it says covers up “cruelty on an industrial scale,” to be scrapped.

            The RSPCA responded to Animal Rising’s claims in a statement provided to CNN on Tuesday, stating that “any concerns about welfare on RSPCA Assured certified farms are taken extremely seriously and RSPCA Assured is acting swiftly to look into these allegations.”

            “We have responded openly and transparently to Animal Rising’s challenges to our farming work,” the statement continued. “While we understand that Animal Rising, like us, want the best for animals, their activity is a distraction and a challenge to the work we are all doing to create a better world for every animal.”

            According to Philip Mould, owner of the gallery where the portrait is on display, the painting sustained “no damage” since it was protected by a layer of Perspex. Mould told CNN the adhesive stickers used by the activists stayed on the portrait for “less than ten seconds.”

<p>Monday’s sinking “is another reminder of the urgent need to work together to address urgent migration challenges and ensure the safety and security of migrants along migration routes,” said IOM spokesperson Mohammedali Abunajela.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow AP’s coverage of migration at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/migration">https://apnews.com/hub/migration</a></span></p>

President Lazarus Chakwera declared Tuesday a national day of mourning. It later became unclear whether Chilima's wife Mary had also been on the plane when it crashed, as initially stated by the government.</p><p>"Unfortunately, all on board have perished in the crash," the Office of the President and Cabinet said  in a Tuesday morning statement. The confirmation came after more than a day-long search effort in a forested area in the mountains of northern Malawi. The military plane crashed Monday morning after it took off from the country's capital Lilongwe.</p><p>Chilima, 51, and the other passengers had been headed to attend the funeral of the country's former attorney general when their plane dropped off radar. Air traffic officials said the plane had been unable to land at Mzuzu airport, about 200 miles north of the capital, due to poor visibility, and the pilot had been advised to return to Lilongwe when the flight disappeared.</p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/11/1aca7a97-4176-447b-919a-1de2eaf57c19/thumbnail/620x401/be5f8676b35a635041d7d1d78421aa2d/malawi-chilima-plane-crash-ap24162621877227.jpg?v=e6a7e661b3d1c604b3ae2bec0d66302a#" alt="Malawi Vice President Saulos Chilima and his wife Mary  " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/11/1aca7a97-4176-447b-919a-1de2eaf57c19/thumbnail/620x401/be5f8676b35a635041d7d1d78421aa2d/malawi-chilima-plane-crash-ap24162621877227.jpg?v=e6a7e661b3d1c604b3ae2bec0d66302a 1x, https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/11/1aca7a97-4176-447b-919a-1de2eaf57c19/thumbnail/1240x802/573428f8236c759efcbc621d02865042/malawi-chilima-plane-crash-ap24162621877227.jpg?v=e6a7e661b3d1c604b3ae2bec0d66302a 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20401'%2F%3E"></span>

  <p>Some Malawian sources told CBS News later Tuesday that Chilima's wife had not been on the plane, but the government did not immediately clarify her whereabouts or condition. </p><p>Chilima, 51, had been seen in Malawi as a possible contender for next year's presidential election.</p>

<p>A somewhat controversial figure, he'd been arrested in 2022 on graft allegations, amid reports that he'd received kickbacks from a businessman for government contracts. </p><p>Chilima consistently denied the charges, right up until last month, when they were dropped by the national prosecutor, who filed a notice for the discontinuation of the case.</p><p>In a televised national address Monday night, Chawera told the nation that the search and rescue operation would continue until Chilima's plane was found. </p><p>"I know this is a heart breaking situation," he said, "and we are all frightened and concerned."</p>

Nvidia lost 0.7%.</p><p>The Federal Reserve began its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. It will conclude on Wednesday with an interest rate policy decision and a subsequent press conference featuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Although some indicators show signs of a slowing economy, investors have grown increasingly concerned this will not be enough to incentivize the U.S. central bank to cut rates in 2024.</p><p>Marko Kolanovic, JPMorgan’s top equity strategist, warned the chances of a rate cut have decreased following the stronger-than-expected May jobs report. “We see diminished prospects for easing this year, and now expect the first Fed cut only in November,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/11/jpmorgans-equity-strategist-says-stocks-are-ignoring-abundant-risks-sees-maybe-one-fed-cut.html">he wrote</a>.</p><p>Fed funds futures were indicating no chance of a cut at this week’s meeting or at the following one in July, according to <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank">CME’s FedWatch Tool.</a> However, it’s a coin toss whether the central bank will lower rates in September. Investors are also pricing in a 66% chance of a rate cut in November.</p><p>“Overall, the market has begun to prepare a bit for a little bit of a hawkish message from the Fed — not necessarily that they’re going to raise rates, but just that it’ll take longer to bring rates down,” said Bill Merz, head of capital markets research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.</p><p>He added that the key focal points for markets at this meeting will be the Fed’s dot plot and summary of economic projections. Before the Fed decision on Wednesday, investors will also closely follow the consumer price index reading for May.</p></div></div></div>
