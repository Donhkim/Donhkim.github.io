            With less than two weeks until the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle, CNN has released additional details on the parameters agreed upon by the Trump and Biden campaigns.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxg2idb400083b6kye2rdfkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The debate, which will be hosted by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash in Atlanta on June 27, will mark the first in-person showdown of the 2024 campaign between President <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> and his predecessor, former President <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-45">Donald Trump</a>. Both candidates have accepted the network’s invitation and agreed to accept the rules and format of the debate, as outlined in letters sent to the campaigns by the network in May.

            The 90-minute debate will include two commercial breaks, according to the network, and campaign staff may not interact with their candidate during that time.

            Microphones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. While no props or pre-written notes will be allowed on the stage, candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxg2idb4000c3b6kfbqz2hh3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Some aspects of the debate – including the absence of a studio audience – will be a departure from previous debates. But, as in the past, the moderators “will use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion,” according to the network.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxg2idb4000d3b6kzy4i3716@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            In order to meet CNN’s qualifications for the debate, candidates must satisfy the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president. Both Biden and Trump meet those requirements, as do Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West and Jill Stein, who are running on non-major-party tickets.
    </p>

            Participants must also file a formal statement of candidacy to the Federal Election Commission. All five have done so.

            All participating debaters must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN’s standards for reporting. Polls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.

            Though not impossible in Kennedy’s case, it is less likely that candidates other than Biden and Trump will meet those requirements.
    </p>

            Kennedy has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, making him currently eligible for 89 Electoral College votes.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hamas fighters ambushed and killed 8 Israeli soldiers in Rafah, Gaza, using rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and an ambush attack.</li>
<li>The attack occurred on Saturday, marking one of the deadliest days for Israeli soldiers in Gaza in months, as Israel continues its ground invasion of the southern region.</li>
<li>The Qassam Brigades, Hamas's armed wing, claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that their soldiers carried out a complex ambush against Israeli vehicles.</li>
<li>The Israeli army reported that at least 307 Israeli troops have been killed and thousands wounded since the start of the war in Gaza, which began on October 27.</li>
<li>The recent casualties are likely to fuel calls for a ceasefire and increase Israeli public anger, with the Israeli military spokesperson stating that an investigation will be launched into how the attack occurred.</li>

<p>Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s armed wing, said in a statement its soldiers “carried out a complex ambush against enemy vehicles” in the Saudi neighbourhood of Tal as-Sultan district, western Rafah city.</p>
<p>The armed group said it fired Yassin-105 RPGs at a D9 military bulldozer, killing and wounding an unidentified number of Israeli soldiers. A “rescue force” vehicle that later arrived was also attacked, “resulting in its destruction and the death of all its occupants”.</p>
<p>Israel’s army said in a statement the eight soldiers “fell during operational activity in southern Gaza”, without elaborating. Daniel Hagari, Israeli’s military spokesperson, said an investigation will be launched into how exactly the attack occurred.</p>
<p>“We’re working to disarm all the fighters in order to prevent Hamas from targeting civilians again like on October 7. Today, we received another reminder of the high price we are paying because of this war, and we have soldiers ready to sacrifice their lives in order to defend Israel,” Hagari said in a televised statement.</p>
<p>At least 307 Israeli troops have been killed and thousands wounded since October 27 when the ground invasion of Gaza was launched. At least 37,296 Palestinians – mostly women, children, and elderly – have died since the war began on October 7, Gaza’s health ministry says.</p>
<p>Saturday’s casualties will likely fuel calls for a ceasefire and heighten Israeli public anger. In January, <a href="/news/2024/1/23/israeli-military-encircles-khan-younis-after-24-soldiers-killed-in-gaza">21 Israeli troops were killed</a> in a single attack by Palestinian fighters in central Gaza.</p>

<h2 id="rafah-assault-expands">Rafah assault expands</h2>
<p>Despite international condemnation and censure, Israeli forces continue to push into and surround Rafah where at least 19 Palestinians were killed on Saturday. Hundreds of thousands of desperate civilians without food, water, and medicine remain trapped in the city.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>Air, sea and artillery attacks on the Tal as-Sultan area intensified after the deadly Hamas ambush.</p>
<p>Mohamad Elmasry, a professor at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, said Saturday’s attack shows Israel’s stated war goal of destroying Hamas remains elusive after eight months of combat.</p>
<p>“The Palestinian resistance fighters have put up quite a fight,” he told Al Jazeera, noting a recent news report quoting US intelligence officials saying about 70 percent of Hamas’s fighting force remains intact.</p>
<p>“What’s even worse, from an Israeli perspective, is Hamas has been able to recruit thousands of new members so there’s no manpower issue for Hamas.”</p>
<p>Gideon Levy, an author and columnist with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, said the deaths of eight soldiers is a “heavy price for Israeli society”.</p>
<p>“More and more people in Israel are asking what for and until when? This might become an endless war – a war of attrition in which as strong as Israel’s army is Hamas forces can always kill and sabotage, and then there will be direct retaliation. It leads nowhere. We’ll never achieve this ridiculous ‘total victory’ that Prime Minister Netanyahu speaks about,” Levy told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>Despite growing international pressure for a ceasefire, an agreement to halt the fighting still appears distant.</p>
<p>Since a weeklong truce in November that freed more than 100 Israelis, repeated attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed with Hamas insisting on a permanent end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu refuses to end the invasion before Hamas is “eradicated”.</p>
<p>More than 100 captives are believed to remain in Gaza, though many are believed to be dead. The armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, al-Quds Brigades, said on Saturday Israel could only regain its people if it ends the war and pulls out troops from the besieged enclave.</p>

                                        <p>BORGO EGNAZIA, Italy (AP) — Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni on Saturday dismissed a cease-fire offer for Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin as “propaganda,” as she wrapped up a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-frozen-assets-loan-39d8619f083600651fabe46b4548716d">Group of Seven summit</a></span> that saw a deal reached for <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-biden-zelenskyy-assets-loan-004dba0db6b04bb5669ac30581088501">a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.</a></span></p><p>The loan will be provided by the U.S., U.K., Canada and possibly Japan, Meloni said. The frozen Russian assets to be used as collateral are mainly in Europe, “so Europe is already contributing by identifying the guarantee mechanism,” she added.</p><p>The loan agreement was reached at the opening Thursday of the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/italy-g7-migration-meloni-africa-4ae6630cd267f87925f3dcbac2785aae">two-day annual meeting of leaders</a></span> from the G7 countries of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States in southern Italy’s Puglia region. </p><p>Asked about Putin’s cease-fire proposal, Meloni said it “seems to me more like a propaganda move than a real one.”</p>
    

<p>The Russian president said Friday he would “immediately” order a cease-fire in Ukraine and start negotiations if Kyiv begins withdrawing troops from the four regions Moscow annexed in 2022 and renounces plans to join NATO.</p><p>“If President Putin’s proposal is: We are willing to have a peace negotiation if Ukraine recognizes the invasion of Ukraine and gives up the occupied parts ... doesn’t seem particularly effective to me as a proposal,” Meloni said.</p>



<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was one of several world leaders who attended the G7 as a guest, has rejected what he called an ultimatum by Putin to surrender more territory.</p>
    
<p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-switzerland-russia-war-peace-conference-burgenstock-2a8abeb9e6e2714f6af032593706d9e5">Switzerland was hosting a peace conference</a></span> for Ukraine Saturday, although with Russia staying away, it was doubtful whether any major breakthroughs could be reached.</p><p>During the news conference, Meloni was asked about the Israel-Hamas war and why the G7 had not condemned Israel over the civilian deaths resulting from its <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-06-15-2024-d8726708ab503c29b6e652aa81f361e4">offensives in Gaza. </a></span></p><p>“I think we need to remember who started all this and it wasn’t Israel, but someone who killed civilians, women and children,” Meloni said, referring to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas in southern Israel that left around 1,200 people dead and sparked the war. Israel’s bombardment and ground attacks in Gaza have killed more than 37,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, who don’t give the breakdown of civilians and fighters. </p>
    

<p>“Now we must work for peace, which means dialogue, recognizing Israel’s right to be safe, to live in peace, and the right of the Palestinians to have their own state in which to live peacefully,” she said. “It is the only way to address this problem, our job is to dialogue with everyone.”</p><p>However, she said, Israel was falling into a trap in its response to Oct. 7.</p><p>“It looks like Israel is jumping into a trap. For the trap of Hamas was to isolate it. It seems it is working,” Meloni said, adding that Israel’s friends “need to give clear words to Israel, for its safety … and this is exactly what Italy is doing.”</p><p>The Italian premier also expressed satisfaction that “the G7 spoke for the first time about migratory flows and the fight against human traffickers.”</p>
    

<p>“We must guarantee to everyone the right not to emigrate and to leave one’s home”, she said.</p><p>Known for her hard-line stance on migration, Meloni had introduced the subject as the summit’s host and has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe. Italy is one of the main entry points into the European Union for people fleeing poverty and conflict in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.</p><p>In their final summit communique, the G7 announced a coalition to counter the smuggling of migrants, noting the seven nations would “focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organized crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Becatoros reported from Bari, Italy.

<p>Trump’s weekend plans underscore the evolving political forces shaping the presidential election this fall as he tries to deny Democratic President Joe Biden a second term. </p>



<p>Few states are expected to matter more in November than Michigan, which Biden carried by less than 3 percentage points four years ago. And few voting groups matter more to Democrats than African Americans, who made up the backbone of Biden’s political base in 2020. But now, less than five months before Election Day, Black voters are expressing modest signs of disappointment with the 81-year-old Democrat.</p><div class="Infobox" data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know about the 2024 Election Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020.

<p>Michael Whatley, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, told Michigan Republicans at a dinner Friday that the state could not be more important.</p>
    
<p>“Everybody knows if we don’t win Michigan, we’re not going to have a Republican in the White House,” Whatley said. “Let me be more blunt: If we don’t win Michigan, we’re not going to have Donald Trump in the White House.”</p>
    

<p>“We are going to determine the fate of the world in this election in November,” he added. </p><p>Trump <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-bronx-rally-minority-voters-00fae754f78333111c508d6e740a3610">argues he can pull in more Black voters</a></span> due to his economic and border security message, and that <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-black-conservative-south-carolina-primary-aa1155c31bfc3b397a32b33eff04ada8">his felony indictments</a></span> make him more relatable. </p><p>Democrats are offering a competing perspective.</p><p>“Donald Trump is so dangerous for Michigan and dangerous for America and dangerous for Black people,” Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, who is African American, said Friday. </p><p>He said it was “offensive” for Trump to address the Turning Point conference, which was taking place at the same convention center that was “the epicenter of their steal the election effort.” </p><p>Indeed, dozens of angry Trump loyalists chanting “Stop the count!” descended on the TCF Center, now named Huntington Place, the day after the 2020 presidential election as absentee ballots were being counted. Local media captured scenes of protesters outside and in the lobby. Police prevented them from entering the counting area.</p><p>The protests took place after Trump had tweeted that “they are finding Biden votes all over” in several states, including Michigan. </p>
    

<p>The false notion that Biden benefited from widespread voter fraud has been widely debunked by voting officials in both parties, the court system and members of Trump’s former administration. Still, Trump continues to promote such misinformation, which echoed throughout the conservative convention over the weekend. </p><p>Speaking from the main stage, Turning Point founder and CEO Charlie Kirk falsely described the conference location as “the scene of a crime.”</p><p>Such extreme rhetoric does not appear to have hurt Trump’s standing with Black voters, however. </p><p>Among Black adults, Biden’s approval has dropped from 94% when he started his term in January 2021 to just 55%, according to an <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnorc.org/projects/2024-the-publics-priorities-and-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a></span> poll published in March.</p><p>About 8 in 10 Black voters have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, with roughly two-thirds saying they have a “very unfavorable” view of him, according to an <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnorc.org/projects/about-half-approve-of-trumps-conviction-in-the-hush-money-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP-NORC poll conducted in June</a></span>. About 2 in 10 Black voters have a very or somewhat favorable view of Trump.</p>
    

<p>Trump won 8% of the Black vote in 2020, according to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/03/929478378/understanding-the-2020-electorate-ap-votecast-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP VoteCast</a></span>. And in what is expected to be a close election, even a modest shift could be consequential. </p><p>Maurice Morrison, a 67-year-old lifelong Detroit resident, plans to attend Trump’s church appearance. Morrison acknowledged that Trump, for whom he voted twice before and plans to again, is deeply unpopular in his community and even inside his home.</p><p>“Once he decided to run for president as a Republican, that automatically made him racist. That’s his middle name now — ‘Trump is racist’ — everybody I talk to, all the people I know, my family,” said Morrison, who is Black. “The man cares.” </p><p>Meanwhile, thousands of conservative activists, most of them young and white, were eagerly awaiting Trump’s keynote address Saturday night.</p>
    

<p>Turning Point has emerged as a force in GOP politics in the Trump era, particularly among his “Make America Great Again” movement, despite the ADL’s warning that the group “continues to attract racists.”</p><p>“Numerous individuals associated with the group have made bigoted statements about the Black community, the LGBTQ community and other groups,” the ADL, an international anti-hate group, wrote in a background memo. “While TPUSA (Turning Point USA) leaders say they reject white supremacist ideology, known white nationalists have attended their events.” </p><p>Turning Point spokesperson Andrew Kolvet dismissed the ADL’s characterization as “smears and lies.” He added that Turning Point has been blocking Fuentes from attending its events for “years.” </p><p>“The ADL is a scourge on America, which sows poison and division. They’ve completely lost the plot,” Kolvet said, describing the ADL’s criticism as “a badge of honor.” </p><p>Turning Point, long popular among Trump’s MAGA fringe, is now a central player in mainstream Republican politics. The group’s weekend speaking program featured a long list of established Republican politicians, including U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, and U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. It also included former Trump counselor Steve Bannon, who is set <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/steve-bannon-contempt-jan-6-committee-prison-2da50bcf2f8ff8f3e01ef4bf2b1b845e">to report to prison</a></span> by July 1 to begin serving a four-month sentence for defying a U.S. House subpoena.</p><p>In his remarks Friday night, Vivek Ramaswamy, who has emerged as a fierce Trump ally since unsuccessfully challenging Trump for the GOP presidential nomination, called on conservatives to reject what he said was the Democrats’ embrace of diversity.</p><p>“I am sick and tired of celebrating our diversity,” Ramaswamy charged. “It means nothing unless there is something greater that unites us.” </p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writer Linley Sanders in Washington contributed to this report.</p>

The families filed defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas, and their legal victories resulted in Mr Jones and Free Speech Systems declaring bankruptcy.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Friday’s hearing was over whether those bankruptcy cases would be converted from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7, a portion of US bankruptcy law that allows straightforward liquidation rather than more complicated financial restructuring. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On recent broadcasts and on his social media accounts, Mr Jones has continued to rail against the US justice system and claim that there is a government plot to silence him.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He has repeatedly warned that he is about to be taken off the airwaves, although US free speech laws mean he would be free to set up a new company and continue broadcasting even if his company were to be liquidated.   </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“We just dodged a bullet, praise Jesus,” Mr Jones said while broadcasting on Infowars after the hearing. “I would have been off the air today if the judge hadn’t done the right thing.

                                        <p>A judge has overturned the conviction of a Missouri woman who was a psychiatric patient when she incriminated herself in a 1980 killing that her attorneys argue was actually committed by <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/missouri-1980-killing-sandra-hemme-hearing-fa2b2d24072d179563f5e5dca774b57a">a now-discredited police officer</a></span>. </p><p>Judge Ryan Horsman ruled late Friday that Sandra Hemme, who has spent 43 years behind bars, had established evidence of actual innocence and must be freed within 30 days unless prosecutors retry her. He said her trial counsel was ineffective and prosecutors failed to disclose evidence that would have helped her.</p><p>Her attorneys say this is the longest time a women has been been incarcerated for a wrongful conviction. They filed a motion seeking her immediate release.</p><p>“We are grateful to the Court for acknowledging the grave injustice Ms. Hemme has endured for more than four decades,” her attorneys said in a statement, promising to keep up their efforts to dismiss the charges and reunite Hemme with her family. </p>
    

<p>A spokesperson for Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey didn’t immediately respond to a text or email message seeking comment Saturday. </p><p>Hemme was shackled in leather wrist restraints and so heavily sedated that she “could not hold her head up straight” or “articulate anything beyond monosyllabic responses” when she was first questioned about the death of 31-year-old library worker Patricia Jeschke, according to her lawyers with the New York-based Innocence Project. </p>



<p>They alleged in a petition seeking her exoneration that authorities ignored Hemme’s “wildly contradictory” statements and suppressed evidence implicating Michael Holman, a then-police officer who tried to use the slain woman’s credit card. </p>
    
<p>The judge wrote that “no evidence whatsoever outside of Ms. Hemme’s unreliable statements connects her to the crime.”</p><p>“In contrast,” he added, “this Court finds that the evidence directly ties Holman to this crime and murder scene.”</p>
    

<p>It started on Nov. 13, 1980, when Jeschke missed work. Her worried mother climbed through a window at her apartment and discovered her daughter’s nude body on the floor, surrounded by blood. Her hands were tied behind her back with a telephone cord and a pair of pantyhose was wrapped around her throat. A knife was under her head. </p><p>The brutal killing grabbed headlines, with detectives working 12-hour days to solve it. But Hemme wasn’t on their radar until she showed up nearly two weeks later at the home of a nurse who once treated her, carrying a knife and refusing to leave. </p><p>Police found her in a closet, and took her back to St. Joseph’s Hospital, the latest in a string of hospitalizations that began when she started hearing voices at the age of 12. </p><p>She had been discharged from that very hospital the day before Jeschke’s body was found, showing up at her parents house later that night after hitchhiking more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) across the state.</p><p>The timing seemed suspicious to law enforcement. As the interrogations began, Hemme was being treated with antipsychotic drugs that had triggered involuntary muscle spasms. She complained that her eyes were rolling back in her head, the petition said. </p>
    

<p>Detectives noted that Hemme seemed “mentally confused” and not fully able to comprehend their questions. </p><p>“Each time the police extracted a statement from Ms. Hemme it changed dramatically from the last, often incorporating explanations of facts the police had just recently uncovered,” her attorneys wrote. </p><p>Eventually, she claimed to have watched a man named Joseph Wabski kill Jeschke. </p><p>Wabski, whom she met when they stayed in the state hospital’s detoxification unit at the same time, was charged with capital murder. But prosecutors quickly dropped the case upon learning he was at an alcohol treatment center in Topeka, Kansas, at the time.</p><p>Upon learning he couldn’t be the killer, Hemme cried and she said was the lone killer. </p><p>But police also were starting to look at another suspect — one of their own. About a month after the killing, Holman was arrested for falsely reporting that his pickup truck had been stolen and collecting an insurance payout. It was the same truck spotted near the crime scene, and the officer’s alibi that he spent the night with a woman at a nearby motel couldn’t be confirmed. </p>
    

<p>Furthermore, he had tried to use Jeschke’s credit card at a camera store in Kansas City, Missouri, on the same day her body was found. Holman, who ultimately was fired and died in 2015, said he found the card in a purse that had been discarded in a ditch.</p><p>During a search of Holman’s home, police found a pair of gold horseshoe-shaped earrings in a closet, along with jewelry stolen from another woman during a burglary earlier that year. </p><p>Jeschke’s father said he recognized the earrings as a pair he bought for his daughter. But then the four-day investigation into Holman ended abruptly, many of the details uncovered never given to Hemme’s attorneys. </p>
    

<p>Hemme, meanwhile, was growing desperate. She wrote to her parents on Christmas Day 1980, saying, “Even though I’m innocent, they want to put someone away, so they can say the case is solved.” She said she might as well change her plea to guilty. </p><p>“Just let it end,” she said. “I’m tired.”</p><p>And that is what she did the following spring, when she agreed to plead guilty to capital murder in exchange for the death penalty being taken off the table.</p><p>Even that was a challenge; the judge initially rejected her guilty plea because she couldn’t share enough details about what happened, saying: “I really didn’t know I had done it until like three days later, you know, when it came out in the paper and on the news.”</p><p>Her attorney told her that her chance to not be sentenced to death was to get the judge to accept her guilty plea. After a recess and some coaching, she provided more information. </p><p>That plea later was thrown out on appeal. But she was convicted again in 1985 after a one-day trial in which jurors weren’t told of what her current attorneys describe as “grotesquely coercive” interrogations.</p><p>Larry Harman, who helped Hemme get her initial guilty plea thrown out and later became a judge, said in the petition that he believed she was innocent. </p><p>“The system,” he said, “failed her at every opportunity.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press researcher Jennifer Farrar in New York contributed.</p>

<p>Kazem Gharibabadi, the Iranian judiciary’s foreign relations chief, said on X that <a href="/news/2022/7/14/sweden-hands-life-sentence-to-ex-iranian-official-over-1988-purge">Hamid Nouri</a>, who had been sentenced in Sweden to life in prison after being convicted of war crimes and murder committed in Iran in 1988, had been released.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson confirmed Sweden’s Johan Floderus and Iranian-Swedish national Saeed Azizi were released by Tehran and are on their way back to the country.</p>
<p>Floderus, 33, a European Union diplomat, had been in detention for more than two years. His trial began in Iran in December on <a href="/news/2023/12/10/iran-begins-trial-of-swedish-eu-employee-accused-of-spying-for-israel">charges of spying for Israel,</a> which could have potentially carried the death penalty.</p>
<p>Azizi was imprisoned on national security charges carrying a five-year prison term.</p>

<p>Relations between Iran and Sweden have been on a downward spiral surrounding the case of Nouri, who was convicted in relation to his role in the deaths of thousands of political prisoners as deputy prosecutor of Gohardasht Prison near Tehran.</p>
<p>The Iranian government maintained Nouri’s <a href="/news/2022/5/2/iran-summons-swedish-envoy-over-illegal-trial-of-ex-official">trial was influenced</a> by Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), the foreign-based group considered a “terrorist” organisation by Iran for a string of bombings in the 1980s and allying with former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein during the eight-year Iran-Iraq War.</p>

<p>		</p>
<p>A Swedish appeals court upheld a life sentence for Nouri on December 19.</p>
<p>Reporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar said Nouri arrived back in Iran on Saturday. “He has been warmly welcomed by Iranian officials, and he released his first statement saying he is extremely happy.”</p>
<p>In Stockholm, Al Jazeera’s Paul Rhys said Floderus and Azizi were set to soon arrive in Sweden.</p>
<p>He described the decision to go through with the exchange as a “balancing act” of several conflicting interests for the government.</p>
<p>“Firstly, the families of the two prisoners putting pressure on the government to bring them home,” Rhys said. “Secondly, the human rights lawyers who would have considered it a real coup to get Nouri convicted in Sweden, they would have wanted Nouri to remain in prison.</p>
<p>“Thirdly, there is a very large Iranian diaspora in Sweden. Many people who say they suffer persecution in Iran and escape that by coming to Sweden, they would not have wanted Nouri to be returned to Tehran.”</p>
<p>Iran also holds dual national Ahmadreza Djalali, an academic sentenced to death on spying charges.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Amnesty International Sweden said it is concerned Djalali’s case had not been addressed in the exchange. The group said it feared he’s being used as a “political pawn” to extract a similar prisoner deal.</p>
<p>“When will he be allowed to come home?” the group wrote on X.</p>

                                        <p>OBBÜRGEN, Switzerland (AP) — Dozens of world leaders converged on a Swiss resort Saturday to discuss how to bring peace to war-ravaged Ukraine, though any hopes of a real breakthrough were muted by the absence of Russia.</p><p>More than two years into the war, the combatants <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">remain as far apart</a></span> as they’ve ever been, with Kyiv sticking to its demands that Russia leave all Ukrainian territory it has seized and Moscow pressing on with its grinding offensive that has already taken large swaths of eastern and southern Ukraine.</p><p>Despite Russia’s absence from the conference <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/switzerland-ukraine-summit-peace-putin-russia-8fa3299cbffb7054ebb1f6201dcdd3bc">at the Bürgenstock resort</a></span> overlooking Lake Lucerne, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that one measure of the two-day event’s success was “bringing back to the world the idea that joint efforts can stop war and establish a just peace.”</p><p>Attendees faced a tricky balancing act, with many chastising Russia for breaking international law while hedging their positions to leave the door open for Moscow to join future peace talks that might bring about an end to the conflict one day.</p>
    

<p>“Here, there are representatives from Latin America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, the Pacific, North America and religious leaders,” Zelenskyy said. “Now, there is no Russia here. Why? Because if Russia was interested in peace, there would be no war.”</p>



<p>“We must decide together what a just peace means for the world and how it can be achieved in a truly lasting way,” he said. “At the first peace summit, we must determine how to achieve a just peace, so that at the second, we can already settle on a real end to the war.”</p>
    
<p>About half of the roughly 100 delegations were led by heads of state and government. Analysts said turnout would be a key indicator about how much pull Ukraine and its staunch Western backers have with the broader international community.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday sought to cast a shadow over the Swiss-Ukrainian initiative for the conference. Some countries such as India, Turkey and Saudi Arabia that have retained ties, at times lucrative, with Moscow — unlike Western powers that have sanctioned Russia over the war — were also on hand.</p>
    

<p>Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, told the conference that credible peace talks will need Russia’s participation and require “difficult compromise.”</p><p>Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, acknowledged the mistrust between Russia and Ukraine, saying “each side regards the other party’s steps (in floating proposals) as an extension of broader war effort.” </p><p>“Excellencies, I must also note that this summit could have been more results-oriented if the other party to the conflict — Russia — was present in the room,” he added. </p><p>Entering the venue, President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania, a NATO member country that has been one of the most stalwart supporters of fellow former Soviet republic Ukraine, said Russian troops must leave Ukraine, and that Moscow must be held accountable for crimes there and pay reparations for the war damage. </p>
    

<p>“Right now it seems unrealistic, but I think we have to stay united, and if international society will push the Russian Federation, everything is possible,” he told The Associated Press. “I think the situation is very clear: Ukraine has to seek territorial integrity.”</p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-ukraine-peace-summit-switzerland-biden-41cb00bba18a80ca88abf9e5b378110a">U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris</a></span>, representing the United States while President Joe Biden attended a fundraiser in California, reiterated <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-ukraine-peace-summit-switzerland-biden-41cb00bba18a80ca88abf9e5b378110a">America’s full backing</a></span> for Ukraine and announced <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/verlooking%20Lake%20Lucerne">$1.5 billion in new U.S. assistance</a></span> for an array of projects such as energy infrastructure and civilian security. </p><p>China, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-sanctions-china-defense-g7-ukraine-01aa2fcfab22a5e37c51a134e9f65c57">which backs Russia</a></span>, joined scores of countries that sat out the event.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Mystery solved</strong>: The fate of a Finnish passenger plane that was shot down by Soviet bombers over the Baltic Sea in 1940 has been solved after more than 80 years. The plane, Kaleva, was carrying American and French diplomatic couriers when it was downed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Location found</strong>: A diving and salvage team in Estonia has located well-preserved parts and debris from the Junkers Ju 52 plane operated by Finnish airline Aero (now Finnair) off the tiny island of Keri near Estonia's capital, Tallinn, at a depth of around 70 meters (230 feet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The plane was en route from Tallinn to Helsinki on June 14, 1940, just three months after Finland had signed a peace treaty with Moscow following the 1939-40 Winter War. The Soviet Union was preparing to annex the Baltic states, and the plane was shot down by two Soviet DB-3 bombers just 10 minutes after taking off from Tallinn’s Ulemiste airport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Finnish silence</strong>: Finland officially kept silent about the details of the plane's destruction, only referring to it as a "mysterious crash", to avoid provoking Moscow. This silence lasted for years, adding to the mystery and intrigue surrounding the incident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Historical significance</strong>: The downing of Kaleva is an essential part of Finland's complex World War II history and sheds light on its troubled ties with Moscow. The incident has fascinated Finns and has been the subject of books, research, and television documentaries.</p>

All nine people on board the plane were killed, including the two-member Finnish crew and the seven passengers — an American diplomat, two French, two Germans, a Swede and a dual Estonian-Finnish national.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">A diving and salvage team in Estonia said this week that it had located well-preserved parts and debris from the Junkers Ju 52 plane operated by Finnish airline Aero, which is now Finnair. It was found off the tiny island of Keri near Estonia's capital, Tallinn, at a depth of around 70 meters (230 feet).</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“Basically, we started from scratch. We took a whole different approach to the search,” Kaido Peremees, spokesman for the Estonian diving and underwater survey company Tuukritoode OU, explained the group’s success in finding the plane’s remains.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The downing of the civilian plane, named Kaleva, en route from Tallinn to Helsinki happened on June 14, 1940 — just three months after Finland had signed a peace treaty with Moscow following the 1939-40 Winter War. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The news about the fate of the plane was met with disbelief and anger by authorities in Helsinki who were informed that it was shot down by two Soviet DB-3 bombers 10 minutes after taking off from Tallinn’s Ulemiste airport. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“It was unique that a passenger plane was shot down during peacetime on a normal scheduled flight,” said Finnish aviation historian Carl-Fredrik Geust, who has investigated Kaleva’s case since the 1980s.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Finland officially kept silent for years about the details of the aircraft’s destruction, saying publicly only that a “mysterious crash” had taken place over the Baltic Sea, because it didn’t want to provoke Moscow.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Though well documented by books, research and television documentaries, the 84-year-old mystery has intrigued Finns. The case is an essential part of the Nordic country’s complex World War II history and sheds light into its troubled ties with Moscow. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">But perhaps more importantly, the downing of the plane happened at a critical time just days before Josef Stalin's Soviet Union was preparing to annex the three Baltic states, sealing the fate of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania for the next half-century before they eventually regained independence in 1991.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Moscow occupied Estonia on June 17, 1940 and Kaleva’s doomed journey was the last flight out of Tallinn, though Soviets had already started enforcing a tight transport embargo around the Estonian capital. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">American diplomat Henry W. Antheil Jr., who is now considered one of the first U.S. casualties of World War II, was aboard the plane when it went down.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The 27-year-old Antheil, the younger brother of the acclaimed composer and pianist George Antheil, was on a rushed government mission evacuating sensitive diplomatic pouches from U.S. missions in Tallinn and Riga, Latvia, as it had become clear that Moscow was preparing to swallow up the small Baltic nations.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">An Associated Press wire item dated June 15, 1940 noted that “Henry W. Antheil Jr. of Trenton, N. J., attached to the United States Legation in Helsinki, was killed in the mysterious explosion of a Finnish airliner yesterday.” In the U.S. media, Antheil's death was overshadowed by much bigger news from Europe at the time: the Nazi occupation of Paris.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The U.S. Embassy in Tallinn has thoroughly documented and researched the case over the years.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Embassy spokesman Mike Snyder told the AP that “news of the possible location of the wreck of the Kaleva passenger plane is of great interest to the United States, especially since one of the first U.S. casualties of the Second World War, Diplomat Henry Antheil, occurred as a result of the plane being downed.” </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Earlier this month, the U.S. ambassador in Estonia, George P. Kent, <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://x.com/USAmbEstonia/status/1798397393429225530">shared a post on X</a> that included photos of Antheil, Kaleva and a memorial plaque by the American Foreign Service Association in Washington with Antheil’s name engraved in it.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Kaleva was carrying 227 kilograms (500 pounds) of diplomatic post, including Antheil’s pouches and material from two French diplomatic couriers — identified as Paul Longuet and Frederic Marty.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Estonian fishermen and the lighthouse operator on Keri told Finnish media decades after the downing of the plane that a Soviet submarine surfaced close to Kaleva's crash site and retrieved floating debris, including document pouches, that had been collected by fishermen from the site. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">This has led to conspiracy theories regarding the contents of the pouches and Moscow's decision to shoot down the plane. It still remains unclear why precisely the Soviet Union decided to down a civilian Finnish passenger plane during peacetime. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“Lots of speculation on the plane’s cargo has been heard over the years,” Geust said. “What was the plane transporting? Many suggest Moscow wanted to prevent sensitive material and documents from exiting Estonia.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">But he said that it could have simply been “a mistake” by the Soviet bomber pilots.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Various attempts to find Kaleva have been recorded since Estonia regained independence more than three decades ago. However, none of them have been successful.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Not even the U.S. Navy’s oceanographic survey vessel Pathfinder could locate remains of the plane in a 2008 search around the Keri island in a venture commissioned by the Estonian government from the Pentagon.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“The wreckage is in pieces and the seabed is quite challenging with rock formations, valleys and hills. It’s very easy to miss” small parts and debris from the aircraft, Peremees said. “Techniques have, of course, evolved a lot over the time. As always, you can have good technology but be out of luck.” </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">New video taken by underwater robots from Peremees’ company show clear images of the three-engine Junkers’ landing gear, one of the motors and parts of the wings. </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Peremees and his group are “absolutely” convinced the parts belong to Kaleva because of the distinctive and recognizable design of the German-made Junkers Ju 52, one of the most popular European passenger and wartime transport planes in the 1930s and early 1940s.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The plane was operated by the predecessor of the Finnish national airline Finnair.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Jaakko Schildt, chief operations officer of Finnair, described Kaleva’s downing as “a tragic and profoundly sad event for the young airline” that Finnair, then named Aero, was in 1940.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“Finding the wreckage of Kaleva in a way brings closure to this, even though it does not bring back the lives of our customers and crew that were lost,” Schildt said. “The interest towards locating Kaleva in the Baltic Sea speaks of the importance this tragic event has in the aviation history of our region.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Peremees said his company would now focus on creating 3D images of Kaleva’s debris and discuss with Estonian authorities about the possibility of raising some of the items and, if found, the plane’s cargo and human remains.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Snyder from the U.S. Embassy in Tallinn said that Washington is closely monitoring the diving group’s efforts.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“We are following the investigation of the site and will be happy to discuss with our Finnish and Estonian (NATO) allies any developments resulting from recovery efforts,” Snyder said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN">A stone memorial set up in the early 1990s to the victims of the Kaleva crash is located on Keri, and Helsinki’s old preserved Malmi airport terminal building, where Kaleva was supposed to arrive, has a memorial plaque set up in 2020 with the names of the victims.</p></div></div>

<p>The notion was hardly far-fetched. Over the course of two weeks, Gill had been posting images of a massive stake in GameStop and its call options in a portfolio that peaked at more than $550 million on June 6. Though he’s added even more stock since then, the dollar value of his holdings has dropped along with the company’s shares.</p>



<p>With the stock little changed since the early days of its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-13/gamestop-surges-as-roaring-kitty-return-adds-fuel-to-rally" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-13/gamestop-surges-as-roaring-kitty-return-adds-fuel-to-rally" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">latest mania</a>, a new kind of anxiety is building among Wall Street and retail traders alike.</p>



<p>The original 2021 GameStop rally shook the idea of short-selling to its core — eroding the appeal of betting against a floundering company when you can wind up feeling the wrath of Redditors. This time around, the existential question is about what counts as market manipulation. </p>



<p>Does posting a <a href="https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1789807772542067105" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1789807772542067105" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">meme</a>, potentially delivering an instant profit, violate the spirit of free and fair markets? Has the David versus Goliath nature of meme stocks shifted? What if Roaring Kitty <em>is </em>the Goliath? And how exactly did he build a position bigger than <a href="https://fortune.com/company/charles-schwab/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/charles-schwab/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Charles Schwab</a> Corp.’s?</p><p></p>



<p>“The original meme stock craze was us versus them, with ‘them’ being the guys who would short-sell millennials’ favorite companies like GameStop,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “But I’m not sure who ‘them’ is anymore.” </p>



<p>Gill didn’t reply to a request for comment. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Losing Charm</h3>



<p>The populist ringleader of a short squeeze that shook Wall Street in the original 2021 meme-stock rally, Gill is losing his folksy charm, at least for some followers. Trading firms and even some former fans are eying Gill with more suspicion, as Redditors pose questions like: “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1crttc4/how_is_roaring_kitty_coming_back_not_a_basic_pump/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1crttc4/how_is_roaring_kitty_coming_back_not_a_basic_pump/" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">How is Roaring Kitty coming back not a basic pump and dump scheme</a>?”</p>



<p>By Thursday, Gill’s brokerage account snapshots suggested he’d unwound an earlier position of 120,000 call options and added more GameStop, upping his portfolio to about 9 million shares of the video game retailer, worth more than $262 million. (Gill’s final post of 2021 showed he had 200,000 shares worth more than $30 million; GameStop did a four-for-one stock split in July 2022.)</p>



<p>As Gill’s actions sent the price soaring again, GameStop seized on the volatility to sell more than $2 billion worth of stock. </p><p></p>



<p>All told, anyone who bought shares over the past month and held was about as likely to lose money as profit. To some, one major difference is hedge funds and other sophisticated investors have adapted from three years ago and are likely to come out ahead — at the expense of Gill’s retail-trading fans. </p>



<p>“Some of the quantitative managers have models to look at the trends in price and those models are extremely quick to get out of the stock if they see significant downside volatility,” said Don Steinbrugge, chief executive officer of Agecroft Partners, which helps hedge funds raise money. “At some point retail investors are going to wise up and realize there’s a lot of danger.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Manipulation Concerns</h3>



<p>The episode brought to the fore questions of what constitutes market manipulation. The Wall Street Journal reported Morgan Stanley-owned brokerage E*Trade was considering barring Gill from its platform over such concerns, after previously banning other popular personalities like Dave Portnoy, the Barstool Sports founder who streams as Davey Day Trader and said he got kicked off of the brokerage.</p><p data-cy="nativoTout"></p>



<p>A spokesman for E*Trade declined to comment.</p>



<p>What’s singular about Gill’s case is that market manipulation typically involves pushing a price higher to profit off the stock movement, said Craig Marcus, a partner and co-chair of the capital markets group at law firm Ropes &amp; Gray. If Gill’s snapshots are real, that hasn’t obviously been the case, he said. </p><p></p>



<p>“You can disagree with his thesis about the value of the stock, but if all he’s doing is executing on his thesis and not doing manipulative things to profit,” it’s difficult to prove ill intent, Marcus said in an interview.</p>



<p>To be sure, Gill was accused of using his clout to manipulate prices even three years ago when he first arrived on the public stage. In 2021, a lawsuit against Gill and MassMutual alleged he was manipulating markets with his outsize influence on certain stocks. </p>
