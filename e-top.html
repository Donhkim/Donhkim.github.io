                                        <p>DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel on Saturday carried out its largest hostage rescue operation since the latest <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">war with Hamas</a></span> began, taking four to safety out of central Gaza in a heavy air and ground assault. At least 210 Palestinians, including children, were killed, a Gaza health official said.</p><p>Israelis were jubilant as the army said it freed Noa Argamani, 26; Almog Meir Jan, 22; Andrey Kozlov, 27; and Shlomi Ziv, 41, in a daytime operation in the heart of Nuseirat, raiding two locations at once while under fire. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-hostages-profiles-80b14cd4a796aa265ebfcc5bb5928477">All were well</a></span>, the military said.

The video of her abduction showed her seated between two men on a motorcycle as she screamed, “Don’t kill me!”</p>
    

<p>Her mother, Liora, has brain cancer and had released a video pleading to see her daughter. Israel’s Channel 13 said Argamani was moved to the hospital where her mother is treated. In a message released by the government, Argamani told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu she was “very excited,” saying she hadn’t heard Hebrew in so long.</p>



<p>Netanyahu in a statement vowed to continue the fighting until all hostages are freed. The operation was “daring in nature, planned brilliantly, and executed in an extraordinary fashion,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said.</p>
    
<p>Israeli aircraft hummed overhead as the bodies of 109 Palestinians including 23 children and 11 women were taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where spokesperson Khalil Degran told The Associated Press more than 100 wounded also arrived. He said that overall, 210 dead had been taken there and to Al-Awda Hospital, saying he had spoken to the director there. Al-Awda’s numbers couldn’t immediately be confirmed.</p>
    

<p>“The horrific massacre committed today by Netanyahu and his fascist government against the Palestinian people in Gaza, which led to slaughter of 210 and more than 400 wounded so far — under the pretext of liberating those detained by the resistance — confirms what the resistance has said repeatedly: that Netanyahu doesn’t plan to reach an agreement to stop the war and free the captured Israelis peacefully,” said Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official now based in Lebanon.</p><p>AP reporters saw dozens of bodies brought to Al Aqsa hospital from the Nuseirat and Deir al-Balah areas, as smoke rose in the distance and armored vehicles rolled by.</p><p>A baby was among the dead. Small children wailed, covered in blood. Bodies were placed on the ground outside, their feet bare, as more wounded were rushed in.</p><p>“My two cousins were killed, and two other cousins were seriously injured. They did not commit any sin. They were sitting at home,” one relative said in the chaos at Nuseirat refugee camp. As Palestinians explored the newly destroyed buildings, a small child sat on a collapsed metal door, overwhelmed.</p><p>Neighboring Egypt condemned “with the strongest terms” Israel’s attacks on the Nuseirat refugee camp, with its foreign ministry calling it a “flagrant violation of all rules of international law.” Neighboring Jordan also condemned it.</p>
    

<p>“The bloodbath must end immediately,” the European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on the social platform X, noting reports of civilian deaths.</p><p>Israel’s military said it had attacked “threats to our forces in the area,” adding that one commando died from his wounds.</p><p>Israel’s military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, told reporters that military intelligence determined some time ago that the hostages were being held in two apartments, about 200 meters (219 yards) away from each other, in the heart of the Nuseirat camp. He said the forces had trained repeatedly on a model of the apartment buildings. </p><p>Hagari said the forces moved in simultaneously in broad daylight on both apartments, believing this ensured the best element of surprise. But he said the rescuers came under heavy fire as they moved out, including from gunmen firing rocket-propelled grenades from within the neighborhood. </p>
    

<p>“A lot of fire was around us,” he said, adding that the military responded with heavy force, including from aircraft, to extract the rescuers and freed hostages.</p><p>A U.S. hostage cell provided advice and support throughout the process of locating and rescuing the hostages, according to a Biden administration official, who was not authorized to comment and requested anonymity. The hostage cells are multi-agency teams.</p><p>Pushing back against social media claims, the U.S. Central Command <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://x.com/CENTCOM/status/1799578307001717226" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a tweet</a></span> that neither the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-pier-aid-palestinians-00e83d1b302a23b5920c72e859430c15">American-built pier in Gaza</a></span> that brings in aid for Palestinians by sea nor any of its equipment, personnel or other assets were used in the Israeli operation. It said Israel used an area south of the pier “to safely return hostages.”</p>
    

<p>Hamas took some 250 hostages during the Oct. 7 attack that killed about 1,200 people. About half were released in a weeklong cease-fire in November. About 120 hostages remain, with 43 pronounced dead. <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hamas-gaza-israel-war-hostages-bibas-241fd9eb55ad56e79beac29f8783f634">Survivors include</a></span> about 15 women, two children under 5 and two men in their 80s.</p><p>Saturday’s operation brought the total number of rescued hostages to seven. Two were freed in February and one was freed in the aftermath of the October attack. Israeli troops have recovered the bodies of at least 16 others, according to the government.</p><p>The latest rescue lifted some spirits in Israel as divisions deepen over the best way to bring hostages home. Many Israelis urge Netanyahu to embrace a cease-fire deal U.S. President Joe Biden announced last month, but far-right allies threaten to collapse his government if he does.</p><p>Netanyahu, whose support has fallen, rushed to the hospital to greet the freed hostages and his office released a stream of photos and videos of him meeting the families. But thousands of Israelis again gathered Saturday evening for the latest anti-government demonstration and calls for a cease-fire agreement.</p><p>“It’s time to pay the price of a political deal. One deal that will bring them all back without risking soldiers,” said Omri Shtivi, whose brother Idan marked his 29th birthday Saturday while in captivity.</p><p>It was unclear what effect the rescue might have on <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-netanyahu-biden-politics-ca984e5fc518f4f5f0fbd041b5c39ddb">apparently stalled cease-fire efforts</a></span>.

It reiterated that no U.S. military personnel went ashore in Gaza. The U.S. Agency for International Development works with the U.N. World Food Program and their humanitarian partners in Gaza to distribute food and other aid coming from the U.S.-operated pier.</p>
    

<p>The deliveries came the same day that Israel mounted a heavy air and ground <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-8-6-2024-a5d1ef04763a5ed17de2d050ebc5d490">assault that rescued four hostages</a></span>, who had been taken by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attack that launched the war in Gaza. At least 210 Palestinians, including children, were killed, a Gaza health official said.</p>



<p>Pushing back against social media claims, U.S. Central Command <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://x.com/CENTCOM/status/1799578307001717226" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a tweet</a></span> that neither the pier nor any of its equipment, personnel or other assets were used in the Israeli operation. It noted that Israel used an area south of the pier “to safely return hostages.” </p>
    
<p>“The temporary pier on the coast of Gaza was put in place for one purpose only, to help move additional, urgently needed lifesaving assistance into Gaza,” the U.S. military said.</p><p>USAID said in a separate statement that no humanitarian workers were involved in the Israeli operation. </p><p>“Humanitarian aid workers in Gaza are operating in extremely difficult and insecure conditions and must be protected,” the agency said by email. “Aid workers operate under the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.”</p>
    

<p>The movement of aid through the pier brings back online one way to get desperately needed food and other emergency supplies to Palestinians trapped by the eight-month-old <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">Israel-Hamas war</a></span>.

Three U.S. service members were injured, one critically, and four vessels were beached due to heavy seas. </p><p>Early efforts to get aid from the pier into the Gaza Strip also were disrupted as crowds <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-aid-us-pier-05-17-2024-336c810724d107a41bb6628c721aea7c">overran a convoy of trucks</a></span> that aid agencies were using to transport the food, stripping the cargo from many of them before they could reach a U.N. warehouse. Officials responded by altering the travel routes, and aid began reaching those in need.</p><p>Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, told reporters on Friday that the lessons learned from that initial week of operations made him confident greater amounts of aid could be delivered now.</p>
    

<p>He said the goal was to get to 1 million pounds of food and other supplies moving through the pier into Gaza every two days. To date, about 3.5 million pounds of humanitarian aid has been delivered through the maritime route, Central Command said Saturday.</p><p>Relief agencies have pressed Israel to reopen land routes that could bring in all the needed aid. Israel says it has allowed hundreds of trucks to enter through a southern checkpoint and pointed the finger at the U.N. for not distributing aid. The U.N. says it is often unable to retrieve the aid because of the security situation.</p><p>U.N. agencies have warned that over 1 million Palestinians in Gaza could experience the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-hunger-un-07afb7fe4a1654f54b81b944a0dab535">highest level of starvation</a></span> by the middle of next month if hostilities continue.</p><p>President Joe Biden’s administration has said from the start that the pier wasn’t meant to be a total solution and that any amount of aid helps.</p>

It was a deliberate choice made in advance.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Sunak’s decision to miss some of the ceremony was always likely to cause diplomatic offence and upset veterans. And from a campaigning point of view, he was turning down some of the most powerful images any candidate could dream of, to be seen alongside the American President, the Royal Family and military figures.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">His early departure meant he wasn't part of a photograph of world leaders. Instead Foreign Secretary David Cameron was pictured standing alongside President Biden, France's President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It should have been a golden opportunity for the prime minister to project strength, particularly when the Conservatives are trying to portray Labour as weak on defence. “It was a no brainer,” one minister says. “Why not pick up the $100m bill on the floor?”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A quick apology is just about the only aspect of affair that was not a disaster.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dKljgB"><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">Ammo for smaller parties</h2></p><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The danger for the Conservatives now is not just that the D-day blunder colours the election conversation, but that fear and loathing inside the campaign bursts into the open.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clddkpy66eno" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">In the seven-party BBC debate last night</a>, the saga gave the smaller parties a political gift - Nigel Farage blasted the PM for being “unpatriotic”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Sunak is, I’m told “genuinely remorseful” about what happened and has acted in government to try to help veterans, so this stings.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But even before this, there were fears that Reform UK, under Farage’s leadership, could nudge past the Conservatives in polling, possibly in the next few days.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“If Reform overtake [it] will lead to total panic,” a party source told me. No doubt Sunak’s early exit is particularly tricky because it’s likely to upset precisely those voters the Conservatives have been trying to entice back.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">All of the smaller parties, for whom it can be hard to get a word in edgeways, were able to hammer the Tories last night with what seemed genuine indignation.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It was also noticeable that they are all assuming a Labour victory – indeed, they are trying to turn that projection to their campaigning advantage.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Greens, Plaid and the SNP all, in various ways, tried to portray themselves as the ones who can keep Labour honest, to hold the party to its left-wing roots and stop it becoming what they claim would be a softer pastiche of the Tories.</p></div><figure><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Reform UK leader Nigel Farage and Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth make their points during the BBC election debate</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">One source told me: “It’s clear the smaller parties are the only challenge to Labour, and that’s part of their way into the debate. It’s clear the Tories aren’t winning so who holds Labour to account?”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Indeed one senior Conservative source believes the share of the vote for the smaller parties is likely to be the highest it’s ever been this time round. Let’s see.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">My regular reminder: voters are volatile, and there is a long time left in this campaign.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7220exjzvno" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">But as we talked about last week, if Labour wins</a>, it might have to get used to much of the pressure coming from the broad left.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Plaid and the SNP also both made positive arguments for immigration - a rare moment in politics in 2024. An SNP insider said their party “actually has something to say, breaking the conspiracy of silence on cuts, on Brexit and on migration too”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Lib Dems - who are having the bounciest of campaigns – admit that for smaller parties, “the existential challenge is not that people don’t like your policies: it’s that people literally forget you exist”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Smaller parties sometimes have to be the fastest, the funniest, or the most controversial to cut through.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There is no doubt in this general election, though, that smaller parties could hold a lot of sway. See how often Keir Starmer’s been campaigning in Scotland to try to humble the SNP.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Or just ask Conservative MPs desperately worried about the Lib Dems and Reform.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dKljgB"><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">Questions for the campaign</h2></p><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The big moves and big mistakes of the two big parties nearly always suck up most campaign oxygen. And the epic mistake this week has rattled Conservatives across the country, leading to questions about the campaign.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">One minister furiously wanted to know how on earth the team around Sunak had allowed him to make the mistake in the first place: “What is the point of Liam [Booth-Smith], or James [Forsyth], or Isaac [Levido] in a moment like this, if they don’t say, ‘you are insane, if you do this, I quit’.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It is worth saying that one of the challenges for any campaign when their leaders are in government is that they have time when they are off the trail and doing official business that you cannot control. But this feverish weekend, that defence is not likely to do much good.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There are plenty of wider gripes about the operation. A senior Tory told me there are experienced advisers “sitting around” not being put to good use. “Donors are looking on in horror,” they said.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There is yet to be the familiar letter from business leaders backing the party, and there are suggestions that money is tight.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A former minister said that “there is no sign that Rishi and CCHQ will [get a] grip [of] the campaign” and the prospects are “uniformly bad”. Another source complained Rishi Sunak called the election having been warned there were problems inside the tent.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“This was all so predictable," the source said. “Over a year ago specific complaints were made about CCHQ being totally incapable of supporting the parliamentary party, let alone fight an election campaign. Despite those complaints, no changes were made.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Others in party HQ say they have expanded the operation and increased the number of campaign managers over the past 18 months.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A government insider pointed the finger at Sunak and his close team: “We have known for two years this was pure incompetence and arrogance. Now the whole world can see it.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Ouch! Any such problems are denied by others, who say the “team is holding together fine”.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dOZXmm"><div data-testid="image" class="sc-13b8515c-1 bbjeKz"><img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-13b8515c-0 WTpgI hide-when-no-script"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1b6d/live/40206e70-25aa-11ef-8b8c-51da4a2ef232.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1b6d/live/40206e70-25aa-11ef-8b8c-51da4a2ef232.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1b6d/live/40206e70-25aa-11ef-8b8c-51da4a2ef232.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1b6d/live/40206e70-25aa-11ef-8b8c-51da4a2ef232.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1b6d/live/40206e70-25aa-11ef-8b8c-51da4a2ef232.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1b6d/live/40206e70-25aa-11ef-8b8c-51da4a2ef232.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1b6d/live/40206e70-25aa-11ef-8b8c-51da4a2ef232.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1b6d/live/40206e70-25aa-11ef-8b8c-51da4a2ef232.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="PA Rishi Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, stand in front of Keir Starmer at Normandy D-Day event" class="sc-13b8515c-0 hbOWRP"><span class="sc-13b8515c-2 iuvLSH">PA</span></div></div><p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 khQhed"><figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw">Rishi Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, stand in front of Keir Starmer at Normandy D-Day event</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 dKljgB"><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">So what happens next?</h2></p><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And yet - take a breath, repeat after me - there are still four weeks to run.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">One minister says that when they are knocking on doors, there are still undecided voters who can shift – another says “the polling feels worse than the doorsteps”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Next week we’ll see the party manifestoes - the Conservatives expected on Tuesday, and Labour on Thursday.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">They will be a total contrast. The Tories are presenting a longer and longer list of plans designed to appeal to their former core backers – but don’t expect a shopping list from Labour. They will put forward plans that are deliberately familiar, with a message of change and reform. No traditional big cheques for public services.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The party top brass does not want to have a fight about how much money they will spend on public services, and will stick to making their case that the Conservatives have botched the economy. One source claims they can’t have an argument about how to slice up the pie of spending because “the problem we have in this country is the Tories have eaten all the pies and burnt down the kitchen too”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">After the last few days, there is a challenge for the Tories to grapple back some of the agenda, to change the conversation away from the Normandy blunder.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">As the national campaign falters, some candidates tell me they are already shifting some of their plea to voters on the doorstep. Following the example of what one describes as “smarter Labour MPs in 2017”, they shift the message to: “There is going to be a landslide, surely you don’t want that, that’s not good for the country, and why would you want to lose your local champion?”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It’s hard for Conservative politicians to say that explicitly in public, as it acknowledges their rivals are on course to win big. But a party campaign source acknowledged they’d be trying to “warn people about what a big Labour majority would do”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Some of the party’s online content is already talking about “holding Labour to account” – the implication of that, of course, is a tacit acknowledgement they’re likely to win.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But in political times, the election is practically years away. Remember too, last weekend it was Labour on the back foot, grappling to contain rows about candidates and the veteran MP Diane Abbott.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Rishi Sunak has had a shocker this week – but a hopeful member of the government told me that “Keir Starmer might have a bad day. A member of the shadow cabinet might say something completely idiotic… so we can either just start ripping our own hair out and talking about how awful it is or trying to get on with fighting an election.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But there is no doubt that after the last 48 hours, fighting that election has become harder.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"></p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><i id="top-image-credit:-bbc/alamy/pa-media" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog">Top image credit: BBC/Alamy/PA Media</i></p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/bbcindepth" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"><i id="bbc-indepth" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog">BBC InDepth</i></a><i id="is-the-new-home-on-the-website-and-app-for-the-best-analysis-and-expertise-from-our-top-journalists.-under-a-distinctive-new-brand,-we’ll-bring-you-fresh-perspectives-that-challenge-assumptions,-and-deep-reporting-on-the-biggest-issues-to-help-you-make-sense-of-a-complex-world.-and-we’ll-be-showcasing-thought-provoking-content-from-across-bbc-sounds-and-iplayer-too.-we’re-starting-small-but-thinking-big,-and-we-want-to-know-what-you-think---you-can-send-us-your-feedback-by-clicking-on-the-button-below." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"> is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.
