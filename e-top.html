I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.

<p></p><p>“We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,” Roberts said. </p>
    
<p></p><p>Those comments were widely circulated online and blasted by the Biden campaign, which issued a statement saying Trump and his allies were “dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America.”</p>
    

<p></p><p>Some of the people involved in Project 2025 are former senior administration officials. The project’s director is Paul Dans, who served as chief of staff at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management under Trump. Trump’s campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt was featured in one of Project 2025’s videos.</p><p></p><p>John McEntee, a former director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office in the Trump administration, is a senior adviser. McEntee told the conservative news site The Daily Wire earlier this year that Project 2025’s team would integrate a lot of its work with the campaign after the summer when Trump would announce his transition team.</p><p></p><p>Trump’s comments on Project 2025 come ahead of the Republican Party’s meetings next week to begin to draft its party platform.</p><p></p><p>Project 2025 has been preparing its own 180-day agenda for the next administration that it plans to share privately, rather than as part of its public-facing book of priorities for a Republican president. A key Trump ally, Russ Vought, who contributed to Project 2025 and is drafting this final pillar, is also on the Republican National Committee’s platform writing committee.</p><p></p><p>A spokesperson for the plan said Project 2025 is not tied to a specific candidate or campaign.</p>
    

<p></p><p>“We are a coalition of more than 110 conservative groups advocating policy and personnel recommendations for the next conservative president,” a statement said. “But it is ultimately up to that president, who we believe will be President Trump, to decide which recommendations to implement.”</p><p></p><p>The Democratic National Committee said the plan and the Trump campaign are part of the same “MAGA operation.” A Biden campaign spokesperson said that Project 2025 staff members are also leading the Republican policy platform.</p><p></p><p>“Project 2025 is the extreme policy and personnel playbook for Trump’s second term that should scare the hell out of the American people,” said Ammar Moussa.</p><p></p><p>On Thursday, as the country celebrated Independence Day and Biden prepared for his television interview after his halting debate performance, the president’s campaign posted on X a shot from the dystopian TV drama “The Handmaid’s Tale” showing a group of women in the show’s red dresses and white hats standing in formation by a reflecting pool with a cross at the far end where the Washington Monument should be. The story revolves around women who are stripped of their identities and forced to give birth to children for other couples in a totalitarian regime.</p><p></p><p>“Fourth of July under Trump’s Project 2025,” the post said.</p><p></p><h2>___</h2><p></p><p>Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in New York and Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Kansas Supreme Court has reaffirmed the protection of abortion rights in the state's Constitution, striking down two Republican-backed laws that banned a common second-trimester abortion procedure and created additional licensing requirements for abortion clinics.</li>
<li>The majority opinion was written by Justice Eric Rosen, who was appointed by a Democratic governor, and was joined by five other justices who were also appointed by Democratic governors.</li>
<li>The court explicitly declined an invitation to reverse its earlier ruling that the Kansas Constitution protects a right to abortion, demonstrating a strong commitment to upholding reproductive rights in the state.</li>
<li>This is the latest setback for anti-abortion advocates in Kansas, a conservative state that has been a hotspot for abortion debates in the country. In 2022, Kansans voted to protect abortion rights in the state Constitution.</li>
<li>The court's ruling aligns with the increasing trend of state courts and legislatures protecting and expanding access to abortion, in response to the weakening of federal protections following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.</li>

                                        <p>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A slow-moving and potentially record-setting <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/heat-wave-alert-climate-change-2ad854fd039aa2fbd84284ed2a064b79">heat wave</a></span> is spreading across the Western U.S., the National Weather Service said, sending many residents in search of a cool haven from the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/record-heat-deadly-climate-change-humidity-south-11de21a526e1cbe7e306c47c2f12438d">dangerously high temperatures</a></span>. The Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. are also sweltering, with oppressive heat and humidity expected to last through Saturday. </p><p>Widespread temperature records are expected to be tied or even broken during the heat wave, with much of the West Coast likely to see triple-digit temperatures that are between 15 and 30 degrees Fahrenheit (8 and 16 degrees Celsius) higher than average, the National Weather Service said.</p><p>“The duration of this heat is also concerning as scorching above average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week,” the weather service said.</p><p>In the Portland, Oregon, suburb of Gresham, Sherri Thompson, 52, was waiting in her car with her 14-year-old chihuahua Kiwani for a cooling center to open late Friday morning. Thompson has lived in her car for three years and can only run its air conditioning for about 20 minutes at a time as it causes the engine to overheat.</p>
    

<p>Thompson said the high temperatures prompted health concerns, as she had been hospitalized for a heat stroke in the past.</p>



<p>“I have anxiety and panic attacks and I get worried. I don’t want to have another heat stroke, and everything just triggers my anxiety a lot,” she said.</p>
    
<p>Inside the air conditioned center, Multnomah County spokesperson Julia Comnes oversaw county staff and people working with a local homeless services provider as they lined up thin mattresses in rows on the floor and set up cots for people with disabilities. She said the space had capacity for up to 80 people.</p><p>“Some of the hazards associated with this weekend especially is that it’s still pretty early in the season. We had a pretty cool June, so our bodies aren’t totally acclimated yet to the heat,” she said. “For people living outside or more vulnerable people, the cooling space like this is really important for them to just cool off for a few hours.”</p>
    

<p>The blistering weather in the Portland region is expected to last at least through Monday, National Weather Service meteorologist Clinton Rockey said. If the triple-digit temperatures (well over 37 degrees Celsius) stretch into Tuesday, then the region will match a record last seen in July 1941, with five consecutive days of more than 100-degree weather, Rockey said. The temperatures aren’t expected to peak as high as they did during a similar <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/environment-and-nature-0fb6b32f8d4f06cc4517ad9cb7b32abd">heat wave in 2021</a></span> — which killed an estimated 600 people across Oregon, Washington and western Canada — but the duration could pose a problem, Rockey said. </p><p>Many homes in the region lack air conditioning, and round-the-clock hot weather means people’s bodies aren’t able to sufficiently cool down at night. The issue is compounded in many city settings, where concrete and pavement can store the heat, essentially acting as an oven. </p><p>“That’s what drives people batty,” Rockey said. “It’s going to be obnoxious. And unfortunately for some people, if you’re not having good shelter, it could be a very challenging, life-threatening situation.” </p>
    

<p>In Arizona’s Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, there have been at least 13 confirmed heat-related deaths this year, while the causes of more than 160 other suspected heat deaths were still under investigation, according to the county’s most recent report on such deaths through June 29.</p><p>That doesn’t include the death of a 10-year-old boy earlier this week in Phoenix, who suffered a “heat-related medical event” while hiking with his family at South Mountain Park and Preserve, according to the Phoenix Police Department. </p><p>Among extremes, the forecast for Furnace Creek in Death Valley National Park calls for daytime highs of 129 degrees (53.8 degrees Celsius) on Sunday, and then around 130 (54.44 C) through Wednesday. The official world record for hottest temperature recorded on Earth was 134 degrees (56.67 C) in Death Valley in July 1913, but some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 recorded there in July 2021.</p>
    

<p>At Bullhead City, Arizona, the temperature already had reached 111 degrees (44.4 C) by 11 a.m. Friday. The city opened a pair of cooling centers for seniors and others, but locals seemed to be taking it in stride.</p><p>“While this is a heat wave and we urge everyone to be cautious, we typically don’t see large attendance at our cooling centers unless there are power outages,” Bullhead City spokesperson Mackenzie Covert said Friday. “Our community is hot every summer. Our residents are kind of aware of it. They all tend to have working air conditioners.”</p><p>Figure skaters took to the ice at the Reno Ice Rink in Nevada starting at 6 a.m. Friday, general manager Kevin Sunde said. By the time the rink closes at 10:30 p.m. on Friday, Sunde expected nearly 300 people would have visited, with more parents hanging around to watch kids’ hockey practice than usual.</p>
    

<p>“They may not be getting on the ice themselves, but enjoying the cool,” Sunde said. “We’re the only sheet of ice within about an hour’s drive.”</p><p>In Norfolk, Virginia, Kristin Weisenborn set up her table at an outdoor farmer’s market to sell sourdough bread. The air was hovering just below the triple digits, but the 58% humidity in the air made it feel more like 114 degrees (46 C), according to the National Weather Service. </p><p>“It’s so hot, I just hope there’s a lot of people here that can buy my bread,” said Weisenborn, 42, whose Krid’s Crumbs bakery is based in Virginia Beach.</p><p>“Otherwise we’re just standing here sweating,” she said, adding that unsold bread will be donated or frozen.</p><p>Despite the layer of unmoving humidity that hung between tables, people were already buying Weisenborn’s loaves of bread as the market got underway.</p><p>“It’s hot, but it’s July,” Weisenborn added. “Better than snow, I guess.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Boone reported from Boise, Idaho.

            French authorities have recorded more than 50 physical assaults on candidates and campaigners on the campaign trail, the country’s Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said Friday as concerns mount about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/fears-election-violence-france-intl/index.html">political violence</a> ahead of France’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/30/europe/macron-france-election-first-round-intl/index.html">high-stakes parliamentary elections</a>.

            “This campaign is short, less than three weeks. However, we have counted 51 candidates, deputies, or campaigners who have been physically assaulted. I am not counting verbal aggressions here,” Darmanin told CNN affiliate BFMTV.
    </p>

            The attacks have ranged from the less severe to “extremely serious,” Darmanin said, adding that some candidates have been hospitalised for their injuries.
    </p>

            Roughly thirty or so people have been taken in for questioning in relation to the attacks, Darmanin added.

            France has been grappling with high tensions in the run-up to this Sunday’s elections. An additional 30,000 police have been laid on to ensure that neither the far-left nor the far-right succeed in “creating disorder,” Darmanin said earlier this week.

            Politicians have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/europe/french-election-drop-outs-intl-latam/index.html">repeatedly warned that a far-right victory</a> could provoke huge protests in the streets, with French President Emmanuel Macron going so far as to say “civil war” may break out if the extreme left or right wins by a large margin in Sunday’s runoff vote.

            Meanwhile, National Rally (RN) politician Marie Dauchy, who is running in the southeastern constituency of Savoie, opted to suspend her campaign after she said was physically assaulted while campaigning at a market.

            In Cherbourg, a center-right candidate from The Republicans party, Nicolas Conquer, made a formal complaint after he claimed he was assaulted by left-wing campaigners on Monday.

            The terror threat in the country “remains extremely strong,” the interior minister warned on Friday, adding that several arrests had recently taken place in two separate places. Although the two incidents “could qualify as terrorist” incidents, they need to be formally classified as such by the national anti-terrorist prosecutor, Darmanin added.
    </p>

            RN, the party of far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen, led the first round of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/france">France’s</a> parliamentary elections last Sunday, taking it closer to the gates of power than ever before.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly95el9z00063b6jl9ja7zxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            After an unusually high turnout, the RN bloc clinched 33.15% of the vote, while the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition came second with 27.99% and Macron’s Ensemble alliance slumped to a dismal third with 20.76%, according to final results published by the Interior Ministry on Monday.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly95el9z00073b6j21m92a6k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            While the RN appears on track to win the most seats in the National Assembly, it may fall short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, suggesting France may be heading for a hung parliament and more political uncertainty.
