(AP) — A jury was seated Monday in the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-trial-gun-charges-delaware-cc96568ac3428802557c85876c820dec">federal gun case</a></span> against <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-trial-gun-charges-delaware-cc96568ac3428802557c85876c820dec">President Joe Biden’s son Hunter</a></span>, after prospective panelists were questioned about their thoughts on gun rights and drug addiction while the first lady watched from the front row of the courtroom.</p><p>Opening statements were set to begin Tuesday after the jurors — six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates — were instructed by Judge Maryellen Noreika not to talk or read about the case.</p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/hunter-biden">Hunter Biden</a></span> has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.</p><p>The case is going to trial following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he’s being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president’s son.</p>
    

<p>The proceedings are unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0">convicted of 34 felonies</a></span> in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.</p>
    
<p>Jury selection moved at a clip. The pool was chosen from roughly 65 people. Those who answered “yes” on an initial questionnaire were quizzed individually by Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. Their names were not made public.</p>




    

<p>The questions tested their knowledge of the case, surveyed their thoughts about gun ownership and inquired whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges.</p><p>One potential juror who was sent home said she didn’t know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.</p><p>“It’s not a good one,” she replied when an attorney asked her opinion.</p><p>Another was excused because he was aware of the case and said, “It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.”</p><p>Jurors who were chosen included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware. One male juror’s father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and his brother went to jail for possession of a narcotic. Another woman on the panel has a husband who is a gun owner and formerly in law enforcement. A third juror, also a woman, gets her news from YouTube and said she was vaguely aware of the case.</p>
    

<p>Hunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-federal-tax-case-california-bb2e2eb41eb2cd30206a47c40ba6044e">on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes</a></span>. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.</p><p>But Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.</p><p>This trial isn’t about Hunter Biden’s foreign business affairs — which Republicans <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-congress-subpoena-impeachment-joe-biden-f91915376997b5327eb2e747816690b5">have seized on</a></span> without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden’s darkest moments and put them on display.</p>

<p>The president was nearby, in their Wilmington home, which he left shortly after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut. He is traveling to France on Tuesday and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later. Hunter Biden’s sister, Ashley Biden, was also in court, and his wife, Melissa.</p><p>Aboard Air Force One on the way to Connecticut on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president’s ability to do his job and replied, “Absolutely not.”</p><p>“He always puts the American people first, and is capable of doing his job,” said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings’ conclusion. </p><p>Earlier, when the court took a break for lunch, Hunter Biden walked over to his mother and leaned over the railing that separates the audience from the trial participants to hug and kiss her on the cheek. Monday was the first lady’s 73rd birthday.</p><p>A family friend, Ricky Smith, sat in the audience and embraced him warmly during a break.</p><p>“It ain’t right for him to be sitting there because he was a drug addict,” Smith said.</p><p>The case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-d8f69eb645d74b7886387f713981b739">the 2015 death of his brother</a></span>, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.</p><p>Defense attorneys have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden didn’t see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked “no” to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.</p><p>If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it’s unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Long reported from Washington.

            Fauci said there are still some things the US needs to work on to be more prepared for another pandemic in the aftermath of Covid-19, saying in “some respects” the country is better prepared to deal with a health crisis than in 2020, “but in others, I am still disappointed.”

            Fauci said there was a “disconnect between the health-care system and the public health system” during Covid-19 in the US. Specifically, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could not demand information from local agencies, which caused <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/health/covid-data-problems/index.html">a lag in sharing data.</a>

            Fauci testified Monday that he has not used his personal email to conduct business, and he was not aware before a congressional investigation that a former senior adviser at the National Institutes of Health had used unofficial email.

            “What you saw, I believe, with Dr. Morens was an aberrancy and an outlier,” Fauci testified on Monday, referring to a former senior adviser at NIH. “The individuals at the NIH and NIAID are a very committed group of individuals and this one instance that you point out is an aberrancy and an outlier.”

            The committee points to email that Morens sent another colleague that suggests he would send email to Fauci’s private account and “there is no worry about FOIAs.” FOIA is the Freedom of Information Act, the law that gives the public the right to obtain federal records, including emails sent within government agencies. Morens’ email goes on to say that he can also hand information to Fauci to avoid it being a part of the public record.

            In Fauci’s testimony, he addressed what he said were “certain issues that have been seriously distorted concerning me,” particularly around the origin of the virus that led to the Covid-19 pandemic.

            Fauci testified that in early 2020, he was informed through phone calls with two scientists — <a href="https://wellcome.org/press-release/wellcome-statements-novel-coronavirus-covid-19" target="_blank">Jeremy</a> <a href="https://wellcome.org/press-release/wellcome-statements-novel-coronavirus-covid-19" target="_blank">Farrar</a>, then the director of the Wellcome Trust in the UK and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095063/" target="_blank">Kristian Andersen</a>, a scientist at Scripps Research — that they and others were concerned that the virus that causes Covid-19 could have been manipulated in the lab. The day after those calls, Fauci said he participated in a conference call with several international virologists to discuss manipulation in the lab or possible spillover from animals to humans. He characterized the discussion as “lively,” with arguments on both sides. Fauci said he did not try to steer the discussion in any direction.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwz9d0il000o3b6k00y6nbku@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Fauci said the virologists on the joint call decided to more carefully examine the genomic sequence and after further examination, and said, “several who at first were concerned about lab manipulation became convinced that the virus was not deliberately manipulated.” Scientists found the most likely scenario, Fauci said, was a virus that transferred from an animal to a human, “although they still kept an open mind.”
    </p>

            “The accusation being circulated that I influenced the scientists to change their minds by bribing them with millions of dollars in grant money is absolutely false, and simply preposterous,” Fauci said, noting he had no input into the content on a paper <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095063/" target="_blank">published </a>in March 2020 that discussed the possible origins of the virus.

            Some of the world’s leading scientists have investigated the origins of the virus, including a committee of experts from the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00295-6/fulltext" target="_blank">World</a> <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00295-6/fulltext" target="_blank">Health Organization</a>. Most scientists believe that the virus spread from animals to humans in China. Some studies have also said that the theory that the virus escaped from a Chinese lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, cannot be ruled out.

            “I cannot account nor can anyone account for other things that might be going on in China, which is the reason why I have always said and will say now, I keep an open mind as to what the origin is,” Fauci said Monday.

            Fauci detailed the threats he received during his time as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, describing death threats against him and threats against his wife and daughters.

            Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell asked Fauci to explain what some of the threats were and he replied: “Everything from harassments from emails, texts, letters of myself, my wife, my three daughters. There have been credible death threats leading to the arrest of two individuals – and credible death threats means someone who clearly was on their way to kill me. And it’s required my having protective services essentially all the time.”

            Fauci said he feared that the threats against public health workers during the Covid-19 pandemic would serve as a “powerful disincentive” for the best and brightest candidates to take up the profession.

            Fauci, who repeated the guidance during the pandemic, once said that there was no science behind it — but he meant that there were no clinical trials to back it up.

            “It had little to do with me since I didn’t make the recommendation and my saying ‘there was no science behind it’ meant there was no clinical trial behind that,” Fauci said.

            He added that he believed the CDC used studies about droplets years ago as reasoning for the 6-foot guidelines.

            When the CDC first promoted the idea of 6-foot “<a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/90522#:~:text=Allow%20other%20people%206%20feet,both%20indoor%20and%20outdoor%20settings.&amp;text=to%20keep%20at%20least%206%20feet%20of%20space%20between%20yourself,are%20not%20from%20your%20household." target="_blank">social distancing</a>” for people who had to be around others during the pandemic, scientists thought that larger contaminated droplets would fall out of the air quickly and couldn’t travel farther than 6 feet. At the time, the World Health Organization recommended that people keep a meter, or 3.3 feet, between them. But even as early as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/07/health/cdc-coronavirus-transmission/index.html">2021,</a> scientists were starting to understand that the coronavirus is airborne, meaning it could spread through droplets <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10372516/#:~:text=SARS%2DCoV%2D2%20primarily%20spreads,characterized%20by%20droplets%20and%20aerosols.&amp;text=Long%2Drange%20aerosol%20transmission%2C%20which,an%20important%20route%20of%20transmission." target="_blank">and aerosols</a>, smaller particles that could travel <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/18/health/who-airborne-pathogen/index.html">even farther</a> and float in the air.

            That’s in large part why public health agencies emphasized the importance of people wearing masks to reduce the number of germs that could float in the air and make people sick.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The fate of Hamas and Israeli leaders hangs in the balance</strong>: The leaders of both Hamas and Israel are playing a high-stakes game, where the terms of the war's end could determine their political futures and grip on power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The transition from a hostage-for-prisoner deal to a permanent ceasefire is crucial</strong>: The US President Joe Biden's plan involves a two-stage process, with the first stage releasing hostages and the second stage discussing a permanent ceasefire. However, this transition is expected to be "difficult".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has domestic reasons to take things step by step</strong>: Netanyahu needs to keep his options open to avoid losing support from his far-right coalition partners, who may demand the "elimination" of Hamas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hamas seeks permanent ceasefire guarantees upfront</strong>: Hamas leaders are likely to want guarantees of a permanent ceasefire before releasing their most valuable hostages, while Netanyahu needs to keep the option to resume fighting to maintain support from his coalition partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bridging the gap between Hamas and Netanyahu's demands will be challenging</strong>: The previous deals have collapsed due to the vast differences between the two sides. The success of the latest deal will depend on how much room Netanyahu has to find alternatives to the "elimination" of Hamas and how far Hamas leaders are willing to consider these alternatives.</p>

    <div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">For the leaders of both Hamas and Israel, ending the war in Gaza has become a deadly game of survival.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The terms on which the war finally ends could largely determine their political future and their grip on power.  For Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, even his physical survival.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It’s partly why previous negotiations have failed. It’s also why the question of how to permanently end the fighting has been put off to the last stages of the plan outlined by US President Joe Biden on Friday.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">That transition between talks on a limited hostage-for-prisoner deal to discussions about a permanent ceasefire would, Mr Biden acknowledged, be “difficult”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But it’s also where the success or failure of this latest deal is likely to hinge.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has strong domestic reasons for wanting to take this deal step by step.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Phase one, as outlined by Mr Biden, would see the release of dozens of hostages, both living and dead.  That would be widely welcomed in a country where the failure to free all those held by Hamas is, for many, a glaring moral stain on his management of the war.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But Hamas is unlikely to give up its most politically sensitive hostages – women, wounded, elderly – without some kind of guarantee that Israel won’t simply restart the war once they’re home.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Leaks, quoted by Israeli media on Monday morning, suggested that Benjamin Netanyahu has told parliamentary colleagues that Israel would be able to keep its options open.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">That option, to resume fighting – until Hamas is “eliminated” – is, some believe, the least Mr Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners will demand.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Without their support, he faces the prospect of early elections and the continuation of a corruption trial.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Netanyahu needs to keep his long-term options open, to stand a chance of winning their support for any initial hostage deal.  Hamas leaders, on the other hand, are likely to want permanent ceasefire guarantees upfront.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Previous deals have collapsed into this chasm.  Bridging it now will depend on how much room for manoeuvre Mr Netanyahu has with his hard-right government allies to find alternatives to the “elimination” of Hamas – and how far Hamas leaders are prepared to consider them.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Netanyahu talked over the weekend about the destruction of Hamas’s “military and governing capabilities” and ensuring that the group no longer posed a threat to Israel.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Few dispute that Hamas has suffered major losses to its military infrastructure – and even, some say, to its public support within Gaza and its control of the streets.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But there’s no sign that Israel has killed or captured its top leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, and leaving them free in Gaza to celebrate the withdrawal of Israeli forces would spell political disaster for Israel’s embattled prime minister.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">On Monday a US state department spokesman said that although Hamas's capabilities had "steadily degraded" in recent months, it remained a threat and the US did not believe the group could be eliminated militarily.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Meanwhile the White House said Mr Biden had "confirmed Israel’s readiness to move forward with the terms that have now been offered to Hamas" and said the Palestinian group was now the only obstacle to a deal.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Separately, military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the Israeli military would be able to ensure Israel's security in the event of any truce agreed by the government.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">However Yanir Cozin, diplomatic correspondent with Israel’s military radio station, GLZ, believes that Mr Netanyahu won’t end the war until he can frame it as a success.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“A deal that leaves Hamas is a big failure,” he said. “Eight months on, when you haven’t achieved any of the war goals – not finishing Hamas, bringing all the hostages back, or securing the borders – then he doesn’t want to end the war.  But he also understands that he cannot leave it until the next Israeli election in 2026.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“If he can say, ‘We exiled Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, they’re not living in Gaza’ – and if the people living close to Gaza and the northern border can go back – I think he can keep his government together.  But it’s a lot of ‘ifs’.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Hamas is very unlikely to agree to the exile or surrender of its top figures.  But there are clear splits emerging between Hamas leaders inside and outside Gaza.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, who has also served as defence minister, told Israeli radio on Monday that President Biden had announced the deal “after seeing that Netanyahu only moves ahead when he’s certain that Sinwar will refuse”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“How do you think Sinwar will react when he tends to agree and then he’s told: but be quick, because we still have to kill you after you return all the hostages,” he said.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In the meantime, tens of thousands of Israelis displaced after the Hamas attacks on 7 October are watching their prime minister’s next move.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Among them is Yarin Sultan, a 31-year-old mother of three who ran from her home in Sderot on Gaza’s border the morning after the Hamas attacks. She says she won’t go home until Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif are no longer free.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">“This ceasefire will kill us,” she told the BBC. “We will free the hostages, but a few years from now you will be the next hostages, you will be the next people who get murdered, the women that are raped – all this will happen again.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><i id="Additional reporting by Rushdi Aboualouf" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog">Additional reporting by Rushdi Aboualouf</i></p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>New policy expected</strong>: President Biden is set to issue an order that would shut off access to the U.S. asylum system when illegal border crossings exceed a daily threshold.</li>
<li><strong>Threshold</strong>: The daily limit is expected to be set at around 2,500 illegal crossings, with asylum processing resuming when the number drops below 1,500 crossings.</li>
<li><strong>Diversion of migrants</strong>: Migrants who attempt to enter the U.S. illegally would be returned to their home countries or Mexico and would be ineligible for asylum consideration once the daily limit is surpassed.</li>
<li><strong>Origin of the idea</strong>: The administration has been considering this move since the failure of bipartisan border legislation in 2024 that would have enacted a similar trigger to shut off asylum access.</li>
<li><strong>Next steps</strong>: The new policy is expected to be announced on Tuesday, with the exact details to be confirmed.</li>

She also criticized the MPPOA, a statewide association for law enforcement, for asking Walz to intervene while waging a concerted campaign against her credibility, leading to threats toward Moriarty and her staff and uncomfortable spectacles for the Cobb family.</p>

"Some of them taunted Ricky Cobb's twin brother, Rashad.

"Where is our humanity for the Cobb family? Where is the respect for the trauma that they and the community have suffered? Because make no mistake, Ricky Cobb was the victim in this case. Ricky Cobb should be alive today."</p>

<p>Farage, 60, had previously said he would not stand in the <a href="/news/2024/5/22/speculation-mounts-of-an-early-uk-election-as-sunak-fails-to-quell-rumours">July 4 vote</a> in order to help his friend Donald Trump campaign for the US election later this year.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 3 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>He said he will run for the anti-immigration party in a Eurosceptic seat in southeast England and also return as the party leader.</p>
<p>“I’ve decided I’ve changed my mind,” Farage told a news conference. “It’s not always a sign of weakness; it could potentially be a sign of strength.”</p>
<p>Reporting from London, where Farage gave a press conference to announce his candidacy, Al Jazeera’s Charlie Angela said Farage’s decision would likely boost  Reform UK’s chances in the vote.</p>
<p>“This [Farage’s] press conference was put together so hastily that even some senior members of the Reform party didn’t know it was happening. This proves what a master of political theatrics Nigel Farage is,” she said.</p>
<p>Angela noted that <a href="/news/2019/5/20/nigel-farage-latest-uk-right-wing-figure-hit-by-milkshake">Farage</a> has been campaigning and speaking to young people.</p>

<p>Farage has stood unsuccessfully for Parliament seven times but is still one of the most influential British politicians of his generation, putting pressure on a succession of prime ministers to take tougher positions on Europe and immigration.</p>
<p>At the last general election in 2019, Farage’s party decided not to contest seats held by the Conservatives, then led by Boris Johnson, to avoid splitting the pro-Brexit vote.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>Polls suggest the opposition Labour Party is on course for victory this time, with the Conservatives staring at one of the worst results in their history.</p>
<p>Support for Reform UK runs at about 10 percent nationally, giving the party the third highest vote share, polls show.</p>
<p>Angela reported that Farage has said that the conservatives were already crushed and he hopes to get votes from Labour voters.</p>
<p>Conservative leader Sunak has already tried to win over voters tempted by Reform with policies such as tax cuts for pensioners and the reintroduction of national service.</p>
<p>Asked on Monday if he was worried about Farage entering the contest, Sunak said a vote for Reform would help the opposition Labour Party win the election.</p>

                                        <p>HONG KONG (AP) — As the 35th anniversary of Beijing’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/2d721a4fb99b4f248c7d11b299eb3352/ap-explains-chinas-bloody-1989-tiananmen-square-crackdown">Tiananmen Square crackdown</a></span> neared, Rowena He, a prominent scholar of that bloody chapter of modern China’s history, was busy flying between the United States, Britain and Canada to give a series of talks. Each was aimed at speaking out for those who cannot.</p><p>The 1989 crackdown, in which government troops opened fire on student-led pro-democracy protesters, resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, dead, remains a taboo subject in mainland China. In Hong Kong, once a beacon of commemorative freedom, the massive June 4 annual vigil that mourned the victims for decades <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-tiananmen-massacre-anniversary-censorship-e1490a8887d79e11e4d5a8c8069e7a70">has vanished</a></span>, a casualty of the city’s clampdown on dissidents following huge anti-government protests in 2019.</p><p>He was still reeling from the loss of her academic position after Hong Kong authorities last year rejected her visa renewal, widely seen as a sign of the financial hub’s decline in intellectual freedom. Despite the exhausting schedule of talks, the former protester in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou in 1989 viewed this as her duty.</p>
    

<p>“We cannot light the candles in Hong Kong anymore. So we would light it everywhere, globally,” she said.</p>



<p>As Beijing’s toughened political stance effectively extinguished any large-scale commemorations within its borders, overseas commemorative events have grown increasingly crucial for preserving memories of the Tiananmen crackdown. Over the past few years, a growing number of talks, rallies, exhibitions and plays on the subject have emerged in the U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia and Taiwan.</p>
    
<p>These activities foster hope and counteract the aggressive efforts to erase reminders of the crackdown, particularly those seen in Hong Kong. In 2021, the city’s police <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-beijing-hong-kong-national-security-albert-ho-637199f7dece6a0e16aec03e1180f93c">charged three leaders</a></span> of the group that organized the vigil with subversion under a 2020 sweeping national <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-laws-de500d4fce1ad5d160f7619e7a95e29e">security law</a></span> that has all but wiped out public dissent. Later, the group <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-hong-kong-political-activism-democracy-83054fecd10f66751d688403f8cc75d0">voted to disband</a></span>. Tiananmen-related <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/arts-and-entertainment-beijing-hong-kong-national-security-8f6a67e2b4b6b1a73b7ca7c5a583026d">statues were also removed</a></span> from universities.</p>
    

<p>Last week, under a new, home-grown security law, Hong Kong police <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-article-23-security-law-first-arrests-85606b3a413ca82d002353214f1eb044">arrested seven people</a></span> on suspicion of alleged sedition over their posting of social media content about commemorating the Tiananmen crackdown. A Christian newspaper, which typically publishes content related to the event ahead of its anniversary, left its front page mostly blank. It said it could only turn words into blank squares and white space to respond to the current situation. </p><p>On Tuesday, the park that used to hold the vigil will be occupied by a carnival held by pro-Beijing groups. </p><p>However, attempts to silence commemorative efforts have failed to erase the harrowing memories from the minds of a generation of liberal-minded Chinese in the years after tanks rolled into the heart of Beijing to break up weeks of student-led protests that had spread to other cities and were seen as a threat to Communist Party rule.</p><p>He, who was 17 years old at the time, recalls that protesters like her took to the streets out of love for their country. When the crackdown happened, she spent the entire night in front of her TV, unable to sleep. After she returned to school, she was required to recite the official narrative — that the government had successfully quelled a riot — in order to pass her exams.</p>
    

<p>“I never killed anyone. But I lived with that survivor’s guilt all those years,” she said.</p><p>To preserve memories of the event, a museum dedicated to the Tiananmen crackdown <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/tiananmen-china-protests-memorial-dissent-4ec2e0e60fff0905491dfc67bc4cd314">opened</a></span> in New York last June. It features exhibits such as a blood-stained shirt and a tent used by student protesters. </p><p>A similar museum operated by vigil organizers was shuttered in Hong Kong in 2021. </p><p>As of early May, its board chair Wang Dan, also a leading former student leader of the Tiananmen protests, estimated the New York museum attracted about 1,000 people, including Chinese immigrants, U.S. citizens and Hong Kongers. To expand its audience, Wang said he plans to organize temporary exhibitions on university campuses in the U.S., and possibly in other countries over the longer term.</p>
    

<p>He said overseas memorial events are crucial because mainland Chinese and Hong Kongers can see overseas memorial activities online. </p><p>“It can have an effect in mainland China because young people there all know how to use VPNs to circumvent internet censorship,” he said. </p><p>Aline Sierp, a professor of European history and memory studies at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, said overseas commemorative activities allow the memories to travel and endure, providing access for other people and future generations. </p><p>But she said it can be “a double-edged sword” because adapting the memories to new places might risk fragmenting or de-contextualizing them in the future. </p><p>Alison Landsberg, a memory studies scholar at George Mason University in Virginia, said that overseas efforts carry the potential to inspire people from other places who are facing their own challenges in the pursuit of democracy.</p>
    

<p>To carry the memories forward, film and television dramas can be powerful tools for people to take on memories of events through which they didn’t live, she said. </p><p>She said overseas theater productions about the crackdown, which began last year in Taiwan and continued in London this year, have a greater possibility of making those connections and potentially reaching a broader audience.</p><p>“When you have a dramatic narrative, you have the capacity to bring the viewer into the story in a kind of intimate way,” Landsberg said.</p><p>Last week, members of an audience at a London theater were visibly moved, some to tears, after watching the play “May 35th,” a title that subtly references the June 4 crackdown.</p><p>The play, produced by Lit Ming-wai, part of the Hong Kong diaspora who moved to the U.K. after the enactment of the 2020 security law, tells the story of an elderly couple who wish to properly mourn their son who died in 1989. </p><p>Its director, Kim Pearce, who was born in the U.K. in the 1980s, said the tragedy had resonated with her from a young age and she was once moved to tears when she read the poem “Tiananmen” by James Fenton. Working on this project, she said, has further deepened her connection to the stories.</p><p>British theater-goer Sue Thomas, 64, also found the play deeply moving. “Particularly as a parent myself now, which I wasn’t then, which sort of made me think of it in a much more sort of heartfelt way,” she said.</p><p>At the theater, He, the scholar, served as one of the post-show speakers, sharing her struggles and the motivations behind her work with the audience. She said the play was so powerful that it made her relive the trauma of the past 35 years, leaving her in tears and causing her to lose her contact lenses.</p><p>“It shows how much suffering people had to endure all these years,” she said. “If there’s anything we can do, I hope that we would bring the younger generation to understand this.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Ji reported from London. </p>
