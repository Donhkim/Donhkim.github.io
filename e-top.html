<p>The immunity decision all but closed the door on the possibility that Trump could face trial in his 2020 election interference case in Washington before this November’s vote. The timeline in itself is a victory for the former president, who has sought to delay his four criminal cases past the balloting.</p>

<p>Daniels claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 after meeting him at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe.

            While the Biden campaign and White House have maintained that the president is staying in the race and have chalked up Biden’s debate performance to a bad night that doesn’t overshadow his accomplishments, lawmakers from across the party have been reaching out to share their anxieties about Biden remaining at the top of the ticket.

<ol>
<li><strong>Category 5 Hurricane Beryl</strong>: Hurricane Beryl has become the strongest Atlantic storm ever observed during July, achieving a Category 5 monster storm, and is unprecedented in its rate of strengthening, intensity, and location for this time of year.</li>
<li><strong>Landfall on Grenada's Carriacou Island</strong>: The storm made landfall on Monday on Grenada's Carriacou Island, and weakened to a high-end Category 4 storm on Tuesday afternoon.</li>
<li><strong>Life-threatening winds and storm surge</strong>: The National Hurricane Center expects "life-threatening winds and storm surge" in Jamaica on Wednesday, and probable impacts in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula by Thursday night or Friday.</li>
<li><strong>Major hurricane strength in Jamaica</strong>: Beryl is expected to still be around major hurricane strength as it impacts Jamaica on Wednesday.</li>
<li><strong>Potential hurricane in Mexico</strong>: The storm could still be a hurricane by the time it's forecast to hit Mexico, although it is expected to weaken further in the days ahead.</li>

              </figcaption></figure><p>Shortly after the law was signed in January 2023, six groups of Illinois residents, firearms sellers and gun rights advocacy groups challenged the restrictions on certain semi-automatic rifles and large-capacity magazines as a violation of the Second Amendment. In four of the cases, a federal district court in Southern Illinois agreed to block the ban, but in the remaining two, district courts refused to do so.</p><p>A three-judge panel on the 7th Circuit reviewed the decisions, and in a divided ruling, kept the weapons ban in place. Applying the Supreme Court's framework announced in 2022, the appeals court said in part that there is a "long-standing tradition of regulating the especially dangerous weapons of the time, whether they were firearms, explosives, Bowie knives or other like devices" to protect public safety.</p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'>
    </p>
<p>As part of this tradition, the 7th Circuit majority found, there is a long history of allowing the military and law enforcement to have access to "especially dangerous weapons," while restricting civilians from owning them.</p><p>The panel wrote that it is "not persuaded that the AR-15 is materially different from the M16," and noted that the Supreme Court has said those firearms can be regulated or banned.</p><p>The firearms banned under the Illinois law are "much more like machine guns and military-trade weaponry than they are like the many different types of firearms that are used for individual self-defense," the 7th Circuit said, concluding that these semi-automatic rifles are not considered arms protected by the Second Amendment.</p><p>The challengers appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court, arguing that under the Illinois ban, law-abiding residents can't have firearms that are owned by millions of Americans.</p><p>"The Seventh Circuit's decision demonstrates a continuing refusal to follow this court's Second Amendment precedents and manifests a continued distaste for, if not hostility towards, the people's right to keep and bear arms," lawyers for one group of plaintiffs, led by the group Gun Owners for America, wrote in a Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1010/302806/20240311151547947_GOA%20GOF%20v.%20Raoul%20Petition%20for%20Certiorari.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a>.</p><p>Another group of challengers, led by the National Association for Gun Rights, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-880/300347/20240212112603932_NAGR%20Petition.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">argued</a> that laws banning weapons that are in common use for lawful purposes are "categorically unconstitutional."</p><p>"If courts continue to operate under the misimpression that the right to keep and bear arms protects only neutered firearms like break-barrel shotguns and bolt-action hunting rifles, the Second Amendment will offer little but a parchment barrier against tyranny," Gun Owners of America said in their filing.</p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'>
    </p>
<p>But lawyers for the state urged the Supreme Court to turn away the dispute, which would leave the ban in place, because it is too soon for it to intervene.</p><p>"Courts are working with diligence and care to apply the text-and-tradition standard announced two years ago in Bruen to laws prohibiting civilian possession of assault weapons and [large-capacity magazines] — many of which have been on the books for decades. And, as the decision below demonstrates, they are doing so in a manner consistent with" the Supreme Court's precedents, they said in a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-944/307659/20240415180459341_AWB%20BIO%20Final%20PDF_A.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a>.</p><p>Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the state's solicitor general also noted that the 7th Circuit applied the Supreme Court's history-and-tradition test, and determined that the features of certain semi-automatic weapons and large-capacity magazines are "unsuitable and unnecessary for civilian self-defense."</p><p>The lower court's decision, they said, "found that the tradition of restricting certain weapons for civilian use included a tradition of reserving some of them, if appropriate, to the military or law enforcement. That tradition is supported by many federal, state, and local laws."</p><p>In a statement on Tuesday, Raoul said his office "will continue to vigorously defend its constitutionality as litigation returns to the lower courts."</p><p>"In Illinois, we are addressing gun violence in a comprehensive way, and I will continue to use every tool available to protect our children and communities from the trauma of gun violence," he said.</p>

<h2>Massachusetts State Police response</h2><p>Massachusetts State Police Col. John Mawn spoke about the decision Tuesday, and addressed what Proctor's actions mean for the department.</p><p>"We have to take this head on. We have to be accountable to ourselves, to each other, to the residents and visitors to the Commonwealth. We have to look in the mirror. We have to be hyper focused on making sure that we are professional and that we are in a continuous cycle of evaluation and improvement and refinement," Mawn said. "We need to work very hard to engage the public in a more meaningful way so we can understand what it is that we need to do and where we want to go in order to maintain trust, build trust, and in some cases regain it."</p><h2>What will happen to Trooper Proctor?</h2><p>There are multiple scenarios that could happen following Proctor's disciplinary hearing. He could get his job back, be suspended without pay, be suspended with pay, or receive restricted duties. The hearing cannot end with Proctor being fired, though it is the first step in the process that could lead to his eventual termination. </p><p>Mawn said Massachusetts State Police's disciplinary actions are dictated by the process set by its collective bargaining agreement. </p>

    </p>
<p>"I think I've been very clear and I want to remain very clear. Misconduct in any way, shape or form by the Massachusetts State Police will not be tolerated," Mawn said. "I think I've said that I condemn [Proctor's] comments in the strongest terms possible. They are not reflective of the Massachusetts State Police. That's not where we want to be as an organization. I believe we will certainly continue to monitor that as we are moving through the process of our internal affairs investigation."</p><h2>Gov. Maura Healey's response</h2><p>Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey previously said she was <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/trooper-proctor-texts-maura-healey-state-police/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">"disgusted"</a></span> by Proctor's text messages. </p><p>Healey was asked again Tuesday about Proctor's standing with Massachusetts State Police.</p><p>"I fully support the decision made by MSP on this ... This is the right thing to do. There is a process. So we have to wait for that process to go forward," Healey said. "There's no tolerance for that behavior, frankly for anyone in law enforcement, with anyone in public service."</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Florida judge has released 150 pages of grand jury transcripts from 2006 that investigated sex trafficking and rape allegations against financier Jeffrey Epstein.</li>
<li>The transcripts reveal that prosecutors knew about detailed accusations against Epstein years before he was given a sweetheart deal. The investigation began a year earlier and involved two victims, including one who alleged Epstein molested her when she was 14 years old.</li>
<li>The grand jury testimony revealed that victims were paid for sex acts and encouraged to recruit other underage girls, with the detective on the case saying "the younger, the better".</li>
<li>Despite the gravity of the accusations, Epstein cut a deal with prosecutors two years later and spent only 13 months in jail as part of a work release program after pleading guilty to state prostitution crimes.</li>
<li>The release of the transcripts comes after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill creating an exemption for cases like Epstein's, allowing the release of the documents on July 1 or afterward.</li>

Two victims were questioned during the proceedings — including one who alleged that Epstein, then in his 50s, molested her when she was 14 years old.</p>    
  <p>The second victim said she was raped by Epstein the day before her 18th birthday.</p><p>A detective on the case testified that victims were paid for the sex acts and encouraged to recruit other underaged girls and told "the younger, the better."</p>

<p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill in February allowing the release of the documents on July 1 or afterward. Florida grand jury transcripts are usually kept secret, but the bill <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/judge-calls-jeffrey-epstein-most-infamous-pedophile-in-american-history-as-he-releases-transcripts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">created an exemption for cases like Epstein's.</a></span></p><p>"There needs to be a mechanism in some of these rare circumstances where people can get the truth and where we can try to pursue justice," DeSantis said when signing the bill.</p><p>Despite the gravity of the accusations, Epstein cut a deal with prosecutors two years later. He spent only 13 months in jail as part of a work release program after pleading guilty to state prostitution crimes. He also had to register as a sex offender.</p><p>Some of Epstein's victims spoke about the case in February.</p>

<p>"We have been left in the dark with no answers to what is going on and why things played out the way that they did," said Jena-Lisa Jones, one of the alleged victims.</p><p>The prosecution has been criticized for their questioning of the victims during the 2006 proceedings, including asking them to acknowledge they had committed prostitution with Epstein. Prosecutors also pointed out that some of the victims had past issues such as drug use and shoplifting.</p><p>"One of the big takeaways from the grand jury testimony here is that people knew about this really problematic conduct for a long time and not much was done to stop Jeffrey Epstein," said Jessica Levinson, a CBS News legal contributor.</p><p>Epstein was arrested in 2019 on federal charges for sex trafficking dozens of underage girls. His death in prison before facing trial was <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epsteins-suicide-justice-dept-watchdog-report-finds/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">ruled a suicide</a></span>.</p><p>Last year, a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/jeffrey-epstein-suicide-blamed-on-jail-guard-negligence-and-misconduct-justice-department-watchdog-4/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Department of Justice watchdog</a></span> said a "combination of negligence and miscoduct" allowed Epstein to take his own life.</p><p>Twelve of Epstein's accusers <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/12-epstein-victims-sue-the-fbi/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">sued the FBI in February</a></span> for failure to protect them, according to a complaint filed in federal court in New York. The complaint alleges that tips, reports and complaints about Epstein's activities were provided to the FBI starting in 1996.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lucy Letby, a former nurse, has been found guilty of trying to kill a premature baby girl, known as Baby K, at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neo-natal unit.</li>
<li>Letby, 34, was convicted of attempting to murder Baby K following a retrial. Previously, she was convicted by a different jury of the murders of seven babies and the attempted murders of six others at the same hospital between 2015 and 2016.</li>
<li>The trial was a retrial, as an earlier jury delivered a hung verdict. Letby's guilty verdict was announced after the retrial, which is the result of a lengthy and emotional process for the families involved.</li>
<li>Baby K's family released a statement describing their experience as a "long, torturous and emotional journey - twice". They expressed relief that justice has been served, but noted that it does not erase the extreme hurt, anger, and distress they have endured.</li>
<li>Letby's guilt raises questions about the events that led to the deaths and attempted murders of the babies and infants at the hospital. The prosecution relied on evidence of inconsistencies in Letby's alibis and inconsistencies in her own testimony, among other factors, to build its case.</li>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>FDA approves Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's drug donanemab</strong>: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's drug donanemab, which will be sold under the brand name Kisunla, for adults with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li><strong>Limited treatment options for Alzheimer's</strong>: Donanemab's approval expands the limited treatment options for Alzheimer's disease in the US, a condition that affects nearly 7 million Americans and is the fifth-leading cause of death for adults over 65.</li>
<li><strong>Positive reaction from Alzheimer's Association</strong>: Joanne Pike, president and CEO of the Alzheimer's Association, welcomed the approval, calling it "real progress" that will allow people more options and greater opportunity to have more time.</li>
<li><strong>Obstacles in the drug's path to market</strong>: Donanemab faced obstacles in its path to market, including an FDA rejection last year due to insufficient data, and a delay in March. An advisory panel to the FDA recommended the treatment for full approval last month.</li>
<li><strong>Future projections for Alzheimer's disease</strong>: The number of Americans with Alzheimer's disease is projected to rise from nearly 7 million today to almost 13 million by 2050, highlighting the need for continued research and development of effective treatments like donanemab.</li>

Patients were able to end their treatment and switch to a placebo after six, 12 or 18 months after they hit certain goals for amyloid plaque clearance.</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">More CNBC health coverage</h2></div></div></div></div><div class="group"><p>The drug, which is administered through monthly infusions, will cost an estimated $12,522 for a six-month course, $32,000 for 12 months and $48,696 for 18 months. Medicare coverage and reimbursement is available for eligible patients, Eli Lilly said.</p><p>Neither treatment is a cure. Drugs that target and clear amyloid plaque can also have significant safety risks, including swelling and bleeding in the brain that can be severe and even fatal in some cases. </p><p>Three patients who took Eli Lilly’s drug in a late-stage trial died from severe forms of those side effects, called amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA.</p><p>Eli Lilly’s drug is now the third of its kind to reach the market after Leqembi and an ill-fated therapy from Biogen and Eisai called Aduhelm. The two companies recently dropped that medicine. The FDA received criticism for its expedited approval of Aduhelm in 2021 despite a negative recommendation from an advisory panel.</p></div><div class="group"><div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-2"><div class="RelatedContent-container"><div class="RelatedContent-collapsibleContainer RelatedContent-collapsed"><div class="RelatedContent-collapsibleContent"><div><h2 class="RelatedContent-header">Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO</h2></div><p class="RelatedContent-fadingGradient"></p></div></div></div></div></div><p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"></p></div></div>
