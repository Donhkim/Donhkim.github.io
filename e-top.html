            US intelligence discovered earlier this year that the Russian government planned to assassinate the chief executive of a powerful German arms manufacturer that has been producing artillery shells and military vehicles for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, according to five US and western officials familiar with the episode.
    </p>

            The plot was one of a series of Russian plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine’s war effort, these sources said. The plan to kill Armin Papperger, a white-haired goliath who has led the German manufacturing charge in support of Kyiv, was the most mature.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyhdvkz000033b6khsunirjs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            When the Americans learned of the effort, they informed Germany, whose security services were then able to protect Papperger and foil the plot. A high-level German government official confirmed that Berlin was warned about the plot by the US.

            For more than six months, Russia has been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/10/europe/russia-shadow-war-nato-intl-latam/index.html">carrying out a sabotage campaign</a> across Europe, largely by proxy. It has recruited local amateurs for everything from arson attacks on warehouses linked to arms for Ukraine to petty acts of vandalism — all designed to stymie the flow of weapons from the West to Ukraine and blunt public support for Kyiv.
    </p>

            But the intelligence suggesting that Russia was willing to assassinate private citizens underlined to Western officials just how far Moscow was willing to go in a parallel shadow war it is waging across the west.
    </p>

            Papperger was an obvious target: His company, Rheinmetall, is the largest and most successful German manufacturer of the vital 155mm artillery shells that have become the make-or-break weapon in Ukraine’s grinding war of attrition. The company is opening an armored vehicle plant inside of Ukraine <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/10/business/rheinmetall-german-tank-factory-ukraine/index.html">in the coming weeks</a>, an effort that one source familiar with the intelligence said was deeply concerning to Russia. After a series of gains earlier this year, Moscow’s war effort has once again stalled amid redoubled Ukrainian defenses and punishing losses in personnel.

            The series of plots, not previously reported, helps explain the increasingly strident warnings from NATO officials about the seriousness of the sabotage campaign — one that some senior officials believe risks crossing the threshold into armed conflict in eastern Europe.

            “We’re seeing sabotage, we’re seeing assassination plots, we’re seeing arson.

            German officials declined to comment on the specifics of CNN’s reporting. But speaking on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington on Thursday, Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said it shows how Russia is “waging a hybrid war of aggression” on European allies.

            Russia’s sabotage campaign has been a major point of discussion among NATO officials gathered in Washington for the bloc’s 75th anniversary summit. NATO has sought to improve intelligence sharing across the alliance so that the nations will be able to connect the dots between what otherwise might appear to be disparate criminal activities unique to their own country.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyhdvkz0000h3b6kyt2idsdi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            But the campaign — and in particular Russia’s willingness to take lethal action against European citizens on foreign soil — has raised difficult questions about how the alliance should respond. In theory under Article 5, an armed attack on a NATO member state is an attack on all.
    </p>

            Russia’s sabotage campaign has, at times, smacked of a shotgun approach carried out by amateurs. Some of the crimes linked to the campaign have not had obvious links to the conflict in Ukraine; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk publicly suggested that a fire at an IKEA in Lithuania could have been the work of Russia, for example. In Poland, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/10/europe/russia-shadow-war-nato-intl-latam/index.html">CNN has reported</a>, a Ukrainian man was recruited over Telegram by a Russian handler he never met in person and was paid just $7 to spray anti-war graffiti. Later, he was asked to plant surveillance cameras and burn down the fence of a Ukrainian-owned transportation company.

            Some analysts have referred to the effort as a “hybrid” campaign, <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_156338.htm" target="_blank">one that uses</a> non-military tools like propaganda, deception and sabotage. But US and European officials are gradually hardening against defining Russia’s sabotage efforts that way.

            “I fundamentally reject the idea that what we’re seeing is a hybrid campaign from Russia. There are hybrid elements of it. When I think of ‘hybrid’, I think of … defacing monuments,” the senior NATO official said. “Things that meet that traditional definition of ‘below the threshold of armed conflict.’”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyhdvkz0000l3b6kwjc0zclo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Because Russia is recruiting operatives to carry out arson and plotting assassinations — lethal action — “I’m not as confident that those all fall below this threshold that ‘hybrid’ implies,” the official said.
    </p>

            It was not clear whether the intelligence related to Rheinmetall suggested Russia intended to kill Papperger directly or hire a local proxy.

            Other Russian efforts have been far more serious than spraying a little graffiti or vandalizing a diplomat’s car: US military bases across Europe were <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/30/politics/us-military-bases-europe-alert/index.html">placed on a heightened state of alert</a> last week for the first time in a decade after the US received intelligence that Russian-backed actors were considering carrying out sabotage attacks against US military personnel and facilities, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN.

            Donald Trump urged the judge in his New York hush money case to dismiss his conviction in light of the<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/01/politics/presidents-immunity-supreme-court-what-matters/index.html"> Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity</a> last month, according to a new court filing.
    </p>

            Trump’s lawyers argued in a 55-page filing that the jury’s guilty verdict should be vacated because the district attorney’s office relied on evidence at trial related to Trump’s official acts as president, which Trump’s lawyers asserted should not have been permitted in light of the Supreme Court’s recent immunity decision.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyhu4zab00043b6kju1gc5on@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “In order to vindicate the Presidential immunity doctrine, and protect the interests implicated by its underpinnings, the jury’s verdicts must be vacated and the Indictment dismissed,” Trump’s attorneys wrote to Judge Juan Merchan.
    </p>

            The Manhattan district attorney “violated the Presidential immunity doctrine and the Supremacy Clause by relying on evidence relating to President Trump’s official acts in 2017 and 2018 to unfairly prejudice President Trump in this unprecedented and unfounded prosecution relating to purported business records,” Trump’s attorneys wrote. “Much of the unconstitutional official-acts evidence concerned actions taken pursuant to ‘core’ Executive power for which ‘absolute’ immunity applies.”

            Last week, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/trump-sentencing-date-delay-proposal/index.html">Merchan postponed Trump’s sentencing </a>to allow Trump to file his motion to dismiss the guilty verdict. The district attorney’s office will respond later this month, and Merchan said he will decide the matter in September, with a potential sentencing scheduled on September 18, if necessary.

            Merchan had initially set Thursday as the day that Trump would be sentenced following his May<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/30/politics/donald-trump-hush-money-trial-verdict/index.html"> conviction on 34 counts</a> of falsifying business records, when Trump became the first former US president to be convicted of a felony. But that schedule was scrapped after the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity last month, in which the court’s conservative wing found that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/01/politics/presidents-immunity-supreme-court-what-matters/index.html">presidents have absolute immunity</a> for core official acts.
    </p>

            In their filing, Trump’s lawyers pointed to testimony at trial – including from White House officials Hope Hicks and Madeleine Westerhout– they argued should not have come before the jury, as well as tweets he sent while president.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyhuc6zi000k3b6k5kjvmdu9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            All of Hicks’s testimony concerning events in 2018, when she was serving as the White House Communications Director, concerned official acts based on core Article II authority for which President Trump is entitled to absolute immunity,” Trump’s attorneys argued. “Trump specifically forbids prosecutors from offering ‘testimony’ from a President’s ‘advisers’ for the purpose of ‘probing the official act.’”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyhuc6zi000l3b6khrc8mlny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The filing says Westerhout was forced to testify about national security matters and her work for Trump, calling prosecutors’ questioning “invasive.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyhuc6zi000m3b6kcr0xn2x7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            “This invasive compelled testimony included information regarding President Trump’s official-capacity ‘work habits,’ ‘preferences,’ ‘relationships and contacts,’ and ‘social media’ practices at the White House,” Trump’s lawyers argued.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyhuc6zi000n3b6kox51355r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Trump’s attorneys pointed to a March 2018 text message that Westerhout sent Hicks while they were White House advisers working on Trump’s behalf: “Hey- the president wants to know if you called David pecker again.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clyhuc6zi000o3b6kuzow85w6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            In addition, Trump’s lawyers wrote that Trump, while president, used his Twitter account as “one of the White House’s main vehicles for conducting official business.”
    </p>

            “More broadly, permitting prosecutors to use a President’s public statements on matters of public concern in criminal proceedings would chill the President’s willingness and ability to communicate with the public,” they wrote. “That would result in an impermissible ‘intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch’ and the ‘enfeebling of the Presidency.’”
    </p>

            Trump’s attorneys also criticized the district attorney’s office for not waiting for the Supreme Court before taking the case to trial.

            “At bottom, the ‘pressure campaign’ theory turned on DANY’s efforts to assign a criminal motive to actions that President Trump took in 2018 as the Commander in Chief responsible for the entire Executive Branch,” his lawyers wrote. The Manhattan district attorney “urged this Court to front-run the Supreme Court on a federal constitutional issue with grave implications for the operation of the federal government and the relationships between state and federal officials. The record is clear: DANY was wrong, very wrong.”

            Following the Supreme Court ruling, Trump’s lawyers filed a letter earlier this month to the judge asking permission to file the motion to set aside the verdict.

            Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s team responded earlier this month by asserting that Trump’s argument was “without merit,” but also that they did not oppose postponing the sentencing while Merchan decided Trump’s motion.

            The judge announced that same day that he would allow the two sides to file briefs this month and that he would rule on the matter on September 6. Trump’s sentencing would be postponed until September 18, Merchan wrote – “if such is still necessary.”

<li>The whales blew bubbles and rocked the boat as they played around Waddington, causing his boat to wobble and making him concerned that they might hit the rudder.</li>
<li>Waddington described the encounter as a "special treat" and said he was both thrilled and a bit scared by the unexpected meeting with the whales.</li>

            Dozens more who staffed Trump’s government hold positions with conservative groups advising Project 2025, including his former chief of staff Mark Meadows and longtime adviser Stephen Miller. These groups also include several lawyers deeply involved in Trump’s attempts to remain in power, such as his impeachment attorney Jay Sekulow and two of the legal architects of his failed bid to overturn the 2020 presidential election, Cleta Mitchell and John Eastman.

            To quantify the scope of the involvement from Trump’s orbit, CNN reviewed online biographies, LinkedIn profiles and news clippings for more than 1,000 people listed on published directories for the 110 organizations on Project 2025’s advisory board, as well as the 200-plus names credited with working on “Mandate for Leadership.”

            Overall, CNN found nearly 240 people with ties to both Project 2025 and to Trump, covering nearly every aspect of his time in politics and the White House – from day-to-day foot soldiers in Washington to the highest levels of his government. The number is likely higher because many individuals’ online résumés were not available.

            In addition to people who worked directly for Trump, others who participated in Project 2025 were appointed by the former president to independent positions. For instance, Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr authored an entire chapter of proposed changes to his agency, and Lisa Correnti, an anti-abortion advocate Trump appointed as a delegate to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, is among the contributors.

            Several people involved in Project 2025 didn’t serve in the Trump administration but were influential in shaping his first term. One example is former US Attorney Brett Tolman, a leading force behind the former president’s criminal justice reform law who later<a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grants-clemency-122320/" target="_blank"> helped arrange a pardon for Charles Kushner</a>, the father of Trump’s son-in-law.

            The extensive overlap between Project 2025 and Trump’s universe of allies, advisers and former staff complicates his efforts to distance himself from the work. Trump’s campaign has sought for months to make clear that Project 2025 doesn’t speak for them amid an intensifying push by President Joe Biden and Democrats to tie the Republican standard bearer to the playbook’s more controversial policies.

            Behind Project 2025 is the Heritage Foundation, a 51-year-old conservative organization that aligned itself with Trump not long after his 2016 victory. Heritage is led by Kevin Roberts, a Trump ally whom the former president praised as “doing an unbelievable job” on a February night when they shared the same stage.

            Heritage conceived Project 2025 to begin planning so a Republican president could hit the ground running after the election. One of its priorities is creating a roadmap for the first 180 days of the new administration to quickly reorient every federal agency around its conservative vision. Described on its website as “a movement-wide effort guided by the conservative cause to address and reform the failings of big government and an undemocratic administrative state,” Project 2025 also aims to recruit and train thousands of people loyal to the conservative movement to fill federal government positions.

            One organization advising Project 2025, American Accountability Foundation, is also putting together a roster of current federal workers it suspects could impede Trump’s plans for a second term. Heritage is<a href="https://americanaccountabilityfoundation.com/blog/2024/05/20/breaking-announcing-project-sovereignty-2025/" target="_blank"> paying the group $100,000 for its work</a>.

            Many of Project 2025’s priorities are aligned with the former president, especially on immigration and purging the federal bureaucracies. Both Trump and Project 2025 have called for eliminating the Department of Education.

            But Project 2025 has lately become a lightning rod for other ideas Trump hasn’t explicitly backed. Within “Mandate for Leadership” are plans to<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/trump-conservatives-pornography-fight/index.html"> ban pornography</a>,<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/abortion-agenda-donald-trump/index.html"> reverse federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone</a>, exclude the morning-after pill and men’s contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act, make it harder for transgender adults to transition, and eliminate the federal agency that oversees the National Weather Service.

            Its voluminous and detailed plans also run counter to Trump’s desire for<a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/07/politics/republican-gop-platform-annotated-dg/"> a streamlined GOP platform</a> absent any language that Democrats could wield against Republicans this cycle.

            Trump’s campaign has repeatedly said in recent months that “reports about personnel and policies that are specific to a second Trump Administration are purely speculative and theoretical” and don’t represent the former president’s plans. Project 2025 and similar policy proposals coming from outside Trump’s campaign are “merely suggestions,” campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita wrote in a statement.

            However, Trump’s attempts to distance himself from Project 2025 have already encountered credibility challenges. The person overseeing Project 2025, Paul Dans, was a top official in Trump’s White House who has previously said he hopes to work for his former boss again. Shortly after Trump’s Truth Social post last week, Democrats noted a recruitment video for Project 2025 features a Trump campaign spokeswoman. On Tuesday, the Biden campaign posted dozens of examples of connections between Trump and Project 2025.

            CNN’s review of Project 2025’s contributors also demonstrated the breadth of Trump’s reach through the upper ranks of the vast network of organizations working to move the country in a conservative direction – from women’s groups and Christian colleges to conservative think tanks in Texas, Alabama and Mississippi.

            New organizations centered around Trump’s political movement, his conspiracy theories around his electoral defeats and his first-term policies are deeply involved in Project 2025 as well. One of the advisory groups, America First Legal, was started by Miller, a key player in forming Trump’s immigration agenda. Another is the Center for Renewing America, founded by Russ Vought, former acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, who wrote for Project 2025 a detailed blueprint for consolidating executive power.

<li><strong>Markets expect rate cut in September</strong>: Following the positive inflation data, markets are now pricing in a roughly 89% chance of a rate cut at the Federal Reserve's September meeting, up from 75% the day prior.</li>
<li><strong>Labor market adds jobs, unemployment rate rises</strong>: The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the labor market added 206,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in May, ahead of expectations, but the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4.1%, its highest reading in almost three years.</li>
<li><strong>Core PCE inflation gauge shows slowdown</strong>: The core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, showed a year-over-year change of 2.6% in May, the slowest annual gain in more than three years.</li>
<li><strong>Economists call for rate cut</strong>: Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet believes the recent data strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates in September, particularly given the softening labor market. However, he warns against reading too much into the decline in the consumer price index.</li>

But recent economic data has helped fuel a narrative that the central bank should cut rates sooner than later.</p><p>Immediately following Thursday's encouraging inflation data, which showed headline inflation falling month over month for the first time since May 2020, markets were pricing in a roughly 89% chance the Federal Reserve begins to cut rates at its September meeting, up from 75% a day prior, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to data from the CME Group;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="93">according to data from the CME Group</a>.</p><p>The data is the latest to build the case for Fed rate cuts.</p><p>On Friday, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the Bureau of Labor Statistics;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link " data-rapid_p="94">the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> showed<a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-adds-more-jobs-than-expected-in-may-as-unemployment-rate-ticks-higher-164923920.htmlhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/june-jobs-report-us-labor-market-adds-206000-jobs-unemployment-rate-rises-to-41-112324134.html" data-ylk="slk:the labor market added;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link" data-rapid_p="95"> the labor market added</a> 206,000 nonfarm payroll jobs last month, ahead of the 190,000-plus expected by economists.
