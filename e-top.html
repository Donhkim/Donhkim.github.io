    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Vice President Kamala Harris was interrupted by protesters</strong> during a campaign event in Philadelphia aimed at engaging Asian American and Pacific Islander voters. The protesters were objecting to the Biden administration's support for Israel's war in Gaza.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The protesters chanted "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"</strong> as they interrupted Harris's remarks. The phrase is a reference to the Palestinian nationalist movement's goal of establishing an independent state on the entire territory of Israel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Harris responded by acknowledging the protesters' right to voice their concerns</strong>, but also emphasized that she was "speaking right now" and would continue with her prepared remarks. She also mentioned that the event was focused on engaging Asian American and Pacific Islander voters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supporters of the event also began chanting "Four more years"</strong>, drowning out the protesters for a brief moment. This suggests that the event was still focused on promoting the Biden-Harris ticket, despite the interruption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The incident highlights the ongoing controversy surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</strong>, which remains a divisive issue in American politics. The Biden administration's support for Israel's military actions in Gaza has been met with criticism from some progressive Democrats and advocates for Palestinian rights.</p>

<p>"Folks, you've probably noticed there's a lot – a lot of speculation lately. What's Joe Biden going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out?" he told the crowd. "Here's my answer: I am running and we're going to win. And nothing's going to change that."</p><p>A spate of travel to battleground states, interviews with journalists and a rare <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watch-biden-press-conference-defying-calls-to-drop-out/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">solo news conference</a></span> have not tamped down the angst within the party about Biden's candidacy and his prospects against Trump in November.</p><p>During his speech, Biden vowed to "shine a spotlight on Donald Trump" and what the presumptive Republican nominee would do if he returned to the White House.</p><p>"He inherited millions of dollars only to squander it. He's filed for bankruptcy six times," Biden said. "He even went bankrupt running a casino. I didn't think that was even possible. Doesn't the house always win in a casino?"</p><p>The president also criticized the media, claiming it was focusing on his errors and not on Trump's. It prompted his supporters to boo reporters in the room — a staple of Trump rallies — though Biden tried briefly to calm the jeers, saying "no, no, no."</p><p>"I guess they don't remember that Trump called Nikki Haley Nancy Pelosi. Well, no — no more. Donald, no more free passes. Today, we're going to shine a spotlight on Donald Trump," he said.</p><p>After the rally, Ken Jacobs, 71, said Biden's speech should put to rest any talk that he couldn't handle another four years in office.</p>

<p>"He should repeat that exact speech at the Democratic convention," Jacobs told The Associated Press. "It shows that he has the stamina for this."</p><p>Anne Baxter, 62, told the Associated Press that Biden is correct in staying in the race and decried the media, celebrities and other Democratic leaders calling on him to step down.</p><p>"I'm glad he's not listening to these knuckleheads, because it's not the base," the retired teacher said. "You heard these people here."</p><p>In 2016, Trump won Michigan by a thin margin attributed in part to reduced turnout in predominantly Black areas like Detroit's Wayne County, where Hillary Clinton received far fewer votes than former President Barack Obama did in previous elections.</p><p>Biden reclaimed much of that support four years ago, when he defeated Trump in Michigan by a 154,000-vote margin, but he has work to do. Detroit, which holds a population that is nearly 78% Black, saw a 12% turnout in the Feb. 27 primary, almost half that of the 23% total turnout in the state.</p><p>Key parts of Biden's coalition in Michigan are also upset with him over Israel's offensive following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Michigan holds the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the nation, contributing to over 100,000 people voting "Uncommitted" in Michigan's Democratic primary in February.</p>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/giuliani-bankruptcy-freeman-moss-2020-election-3cf8d70d1dc2608705c9f938bbb8941d">threw out the bankruptcy case</a></span> of former New York Mayor <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/rudolph-giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a></span> on Friday. He cited repeated “uncooperative conduct,” including a failure to comply with court orders and disclose sources of income.</p><p>While Giuliani’s creditors can now pursue other legal remedies, such as seizing his apartments and other assets, the judge’s decision also allows the former prosecutor and longtime ally of former President Donald Trump to now try to appeal a massive $148 million defamation verdict.</p><p>Here are some details of the bankruptcy case:</p><h2>What was the judge’s reasoning for dismissing the case?</h2><p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane had sharp criticism for Giuliani, calling him a “recalcitrant debtor” who thumbed his nose at the bankruptcy process to shield himself from the defamation judgment and other debts. </p><p>“Transparency into Mr. Giuliani’s finances has proven to be an elusive goal,” Lane wrote in his decision, adding how he “sees no evidence that this will change.”</p>
    

<p>Lane expressed concern Giuliani funneled his income into companies he owned and never reported any income from those entities. He also failed to disclose he is pitching his own “Rudy’s Coffee” brand and didn’t immediately disclose a book contract. </p>



<h2>Did Guiliani want this to happen?</h2><p>Not at first. Giuliani filed for bankruptcy last December, days after a jury awarded the eye-popping judgement to two former Georgia election workers who said he spread lies about them in 2020 and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/rudy-giuliani-georgia-election-workers-defamation-trial-0151222465923e9dcad489adb7661f0a">upended their lives</a></span> with racist threats and harassment. The bankruptcy filing had frozen collection of that debt.</p>
    
<p>Giuliani’s lawyers this month sought to have a trustee sell off his assets, but they changed their minds and on Wednesday pushed for the case to be dismissed. Giuliani’s spokesperson said he expects the former U.S. attorney will ultimately be “totally vindicated” in court. </p><h2>What happens next?</h2><p>Now that the case has been tossed out, Giuliani is no longer protected from creditors, including judgments, collection actions, foreclosures and repossessions, because of an automatic stay granted under federal bankruptcy law. That means his creditors can try to recoup at least some of the money he owes by various means, such as getting a court order to seize his assets. </p>
    

<p>It also means the two election workers can return to the court and seek enforcement of their judgment. Their lead bankruptcy attorney said in a statement on Friday they plan to “move forward as quickly as possible.” Giuliani is now free to appeal the defamation verdict.</p><h2>What is the current state of Giuliani’s finances?</h2><p>When Giuliani filed for bankruptcy, he listed nearly $153 million in existing or potential debts. That included nearly $1 million in state and federal tax liabilities, money he owes lawyers and millions more in potential judgements in lawsuits against him.

<ol>
<li><strong>Delta Air Lines has changed its employee uniform policy</strong> after a controversy arose when two flight attendants wore Palestinian flag pins, leading to an outcry from some users on a social media platform. The new policy bans employees from wearing pins representing any country or nationality except the United States, starting from Monday.</li>
<li><strong>The controversy began with a single user's post</strong> on a social media platform, which described the Palestinian pins as "Hamas badges" and sparked outrage. The post was shared and deleted, but a screenshot showed one of the attendants' posts expressing sympathy for passengers who might be "terrified" by the pins.</li>
<li><strong>Delta initially apologized and removed the employee who made the offending post</strong> from handling social media communications. The airline later announced the new uniform policy, citing the need to ensure a "safe, comfortable, and welcoming environment" for all customers.</li>
<li><strong>The controversy is seen as part of a broader issue of anti-Palestinian racism</strong>, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). The group welcomed Delta's apology and hopes that the incident will contribute to greater understanding and acceptance of diverse cultures and identities.</li>
<li><strong>The incident reflects ongoing tensions surrounding the Israel-Hamas war</strong>, which has sparked protests and controversy globally. The war has also been linked to increased tensions on college campuses, with some students advocating for boycotts and divestment campaigns against Israel.</li>

                                        <p>ATLANTA (AP) — Delta Air Lines is changing its employee uniform policy following a turbulent ride through a social media storm started by an X user’s outrage over two flight attendants who were photographed wearing Palestinian flag pins.</p><p>The uproar over the July 10 post on X, which described the Palestinian pins as “Hamas badges,” led Delta to ban its employees from wearing pins representing any country or nationality besides the U.S. The rule will take effect Monday.</p><p>“We are proud of our diverse base of employees and customers and the foundation of our brand, which is to connect the world and provide a premium experience,” the Atlanta-based airline said in a statement “We are taking this step to help ensure a safe, comfortable and welcoming environment for all.”</p><p>Delta’s policy shift reflects the ongoing tensions surrounding the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">Israel-Hamas war,</a></span> which has triggered high-profile protests that, among other things, have roiled college campuses.</p>
    

<p>Both attendants pictured wearing the pins were in compliance with Delta’s previous policy giving employees more flexibility with uniform accessories. </p>



<p>Before Delta announced its new policy, one of its employees escalated the situation by posting a reply on X asserting the attendants wearing the Palestinian pins were violating company rules and sympathizing with passengers who might be “terrified” by it. That post has since been deleted but was captured in a screenshot shared by the American Muslim rights group CAIR, the Council on American-Islamic Relations.</p>
    
<p>Delta apologized <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://x.com/Delta/status/1811471772367077668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a post</a></span> and said the employee responsible for the reply had been removed from handling its social media communications.</p><p>“What happened with Delta is just the latest example of anti-Palestinian racism,” Edward Ahmed Mitchell, the national deputy executive director of CAIR, told The Washington Post. He said the group welcomed Delta’s apology. “And my hope is that this incident will begin to slowly, slowly move the needle in a different direction.”</p>
