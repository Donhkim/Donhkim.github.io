            US authorities obtained intelligence from a human source in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Donald Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president in recent weeks, multiple people briefed on the matter told CNN.

            The existence of the intelligence threat from a hostile foreign intelligence agency — and the enhanced security for Trump — raises new questions about the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-assassination-shot-07-16-24/index.html">security lapses at the Saturday rally in Butler, Pennsylvania,</a> and how a 20-year-old man managed to access a nearby rooftop to fire shots that injured the former president.

            A US national security official said the Secret Service and Trump campaign were made aware of the threat before Saturday’s rally.

            “Secret Service learned of the increased threat from this threat stream,” the official told CNN. “NSC directly contacted USSS at a senior level to be absolutely sure they continued to track the latest reporting. USSS shared this information with the detail lead, and the Trump campaign was made aware of an evolving threat. In response to the increased threat, Secret Service surged resources and assets for the protection of former President Trump. All of this was in advance of Saturday.”
    </p>

            The Trump campaign would not disclose whether it was made aware of the Iran threat. “We do not comment on President Trump’s security detail. All questions should be directed to The United States Secret Service,” the campaign said in a statement.
    </p>

            Secret Service officials have warned the Trump campaign repeatedly against holding outdoor rallies, which pose greater risks than events to which the agency can better control access, people briefed on the matter said. The warnings have been more general in nature, the sources said.
    </p>

            “The Secret Service and other agencies are constantly receiving new potential threat information and taking action to adjust resources, as needed,” Anthony Guglielmi, an agency spokesman, said on Tuesday. “We cannot comment on any specific threat stream, other than to say that the Secret Service takes threats seriously and responds accordingly.”

            At one point during this election cycle, the campaign stopped holding spontaneous off-the-record events where guests weren’t swept by Secret Service beforehand due to security concerns, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.

            NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said there’s no known link between shooter <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/15/us/thomas-crooks-trump-rally-shooting-invs/index.html">Thomas Matthew Crooks</a> and anyone else at the moment.

            “The investigation of Saturday’s attempted assassination of former President Trump is active and ongoing. At this time, law enforcement has reported that their investigation has not identified ties between the shooter and any accomplice or co-conspirator, foreign or domestic,” Watson said.

            The Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations denied there is an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump.

            “These accusations are unsubstantiated and malicious. From the perspective of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Trump is a criminal who must be prosecuted and punished in a court of law for ordering the assassination of General Soleimani. Iran has chosen the legal path to bring him to justice,” a spokesperson for the mission told CNN.

            Iran has repeatedly vowed revenge for the US military’s killing of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Iranian military’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in January 2020. And former senior Trump administration officials who worked on national security have had tight security since leaving the government.

            In August 2022, the Justice Department announced criminal charges against a member of the IRGC for allegedly trying to orchestrate the assassination of John Bolton, who served as Trump’s national security adviser. US prosecutors said the plot against Bolton was “likely in retaliation” for Soleimani’s assassination.

            Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was also a target of the Iranian assassination plot, according to a federal law enforcement source familiar with the investigation and a source close to Pompeo.

            Trump’s former national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, had a US government security detail due to threats from Iran, like Pompeo and other former Trump officials, but that detail was dropped last summer, according to sources familiar with the matter. O’Brien is now paying for his own private security detail, sources said. Lawmakers were not given a specific reason for the decision, which led to frustration. O’Brien did not respond to a request for comment.

            For months, law enforcement officials have been concerned about the persistent threat of Iran potentially attempting to assassinate former Trump officials and the former president himself, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. But the recent intelligence suggested a significant uptick in the threat, the sources told CNN.

Sacks previously chipped in $1 million of his personal fortune to a pro-Vance super PAC, according to FEC records.</p>

    </p>
<p>But it's the relationship with Thiel that has been the most consequential for Vance. Their personal and financial ties formed long before Vance formally entered politics.</p><p>At Yale Law, Vance attended a talk by Thiel about technological stagnation and the decline of American elites.</p><p>"He saw these two trends … as connected," Vance later wrote about his first encounter with Thiel in a 2020 blog post in the Catholic journal The Lamp Magazine. "If technological innovation were actually driving real prosperity, our elites wouldn't feel increasingly competitive with one another over a dwindling number of prestigious outcomes." Vance called Thiel's talk "<a href="https://thelampmagazine.com/blog/how-i-joined-the-resistance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the most significant moment</a>" of his time at Yale.</p><p>After Yale Law and a short stint at a corporate law firm, Vance moved to San Francisco to work as a venture capitalist. Thiel hired him to join his tech fund, Mithril Capital — all while Vance continued to work on his memoir, "Hillbilly Elegy."</p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'>
    </p>
<p>In 2019 Vance moved back to his native Ohio, where he started his own venture capitalist firm, heavily backed by Thiel and other elite tech investors. By then he was flirting with a potential run for elective office, and Thiel was encouraging him. By the time Vance finally took the plunge in 2021, he had been transformed from one of Trump's most vitriolic critics (he once called Trump "an American Hitler" in a private message to a friend) into one of his most effective defenders and fundraisers. </p><p>Thiel brought Vance to his very first meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in February 2021, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/trump-vance-vp-decision.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">New York Times</a>.</p><p>In the 2022 campaign, Thiel made $15 million in donations to Vance's SuperPAC, Protect Ohio Values, a staggering amount from a single individual for a Senate race, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan group that tracks the influence of money on politics. But that wasn't all. Thiel also steered at least $200,000 to Vance's super PAC from a group he controlled called Per Aspera Policy, according to the Kansas City Star and OpenSecrets. Per Aspera is a dark money nonprofit, which means that its spending is used to influence elections, but it is not required to disclose its donors. In the same cycle, Vance's super PAC also received hundreds of thousands in contributions from the Mercer, Uihlein and Lindner families, all staples of mega-conservative political giving in recent years.  </p><p>It is not entirely clear what Thiel may have wanted in exchange for his largesse. (Thiel declined comment for this story.)  Thiel's philosophy has been <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/what-is-it-about-peter-thiel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">described</a> as "techno-libertarian," but critics say it veers toward authoritarianism, and even fascism (he wrote in an article in a <a href="https://www.cato-unbound.org/issues/april-2009/scratch-libertarian-institutions-communities/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">libertarian journal</a> in 2009, "I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible").  </p><p>A co-founder of PayPal and Palantir Technologies, and an early investor in Facebook, Thiel also has business interests with the U.S. government, which may be especially important at a time when the tech sector is under intense scrutiny from both Democrats and Republicans. Whether his goals are ideological or financial, government watchdogs are watching closely.  </p><p>"We've seen this long history of financial entanglements between Thiel and Vance," said Anna Massoglia, editorial and investigations manager at OpenSecrets. "Thiel's interests in having Vance in office are not explicit, but there's no question he has business interests that could be benefited by having someone like JD Vance in his corner."  </p><p>There are at least some indications that Thiel's political generosity has translated into influence. In 2016, Thiel helped bail out Trump financially at a time when he most needed it: after the release of the "<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-defends-lewd-2005-conversation-about-women-as-locker-room-banter/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Access Hollywood</a></span>" tape. He gave $1.25 million, and shortly after Trump's 2016 victory, Thiel was given an office at Trump Tower where he recommended candidates for jobs in the incoming administration, according to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/11/peter-thiel-2024-election-politics-investing-life-views/675946/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Atlantic's Barton Gellman</a>. In short order, two close associates of Thiel's won plum positions in the Trump administration. One was tapped to be chief technology officer; another was named to the senior staff of the National Security Council. </p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'>
    </p>
<p>But after years of handing tens of millions to Vance, Trump and other Republicans, Thiel told Gellman that he's not giving to any politician in 2024. In his view, they failed to make the changes he hoped to see, and he now thinks it matters little who's in power. In April, Trump called him to ask for $10 million. Thiel said in the Atlantic interview that he turned him down, and Trump told him he was "very sad, very sad to hear that." </p>

            Drones are used today by everything from small rural police departments with a handful of members to major federal law enforcement agencies. But they weren’t in the sky over the former President Donald Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania when a gunman shot him and three other attendees from a nearby rooftop.

            “What happened here? I think pretty clearly there was a security lapse, at least. And we need to find out, for example, why were drones not used in the area?” House Speaker Mike Johnson asked on CNN on Sunday evening. “I have not gotten a satisfactory answer on that yet. That seems pretty obvious that you would do that so you could see people on rooftops.”

                                        <p>DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes killed more than 60 Palestinians <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">in southern and central Gaza</a></span> overnight and into Tuesday, including one that struck an Israeli-declared “safe zone” crowded with thousands of displaced people. </p><p>Airstrikes in recent days have brought a constant drumbeat of deaths of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, even as Israel has pulled back or scaled down major ground offensives in the north and south. Almost daily strikes have hit the “safe zone” covering some 60 square kilometers (23 square miles) along the Mediterranean coast, where Israel told fleeing Palestinians to take refuge to escape ground assaults. Israel has said it is pursuing Hamas militants who are hiding among civilians after offensives uprooted underground tunnel networks. </p><p>Tuesday’s deadliest strike hit a main street lined with market stalls outside the southern city of Khan Younis in Muwasi, at the heart of the zone that is packed with tent camps. Officials at Khan Younis’ Nasser Hospital said 17 people were killed. </p>
    

<p>Apparently referring to the strike, the Israeli military said in a statement that it targeted a commander in Islamic Jihad’s naval unit west of Khan Younis. It said it was looking into reports that civilians were killed.</p>



<p>The attack hit about a kilometer (0.6 miles) from a compound that Israel struck on Saturday, saying it was targeting Hamas’ top military commander, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-deif-strike-gaza-240de52f3d69976d0199336513dfd4ef">Mohammed Deif</a></span>. That blast, in an area also surrounded by tents, killed <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-07-13-2024-83bc4de7ed25b317c7871fd5c0999ad1">more than 90 Palestinians, including children,</a></span> according to Gaza health officials. It is still not known if Deif was killed in the strike.</p>
    
<p>The new airstrikes came as Israel and Hamas continued to weigh <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-ceasefire-negotiations-ab6925549d8f523a6e5c61e88e7eec8a">the latest cease-fire proposal</a></span>. Hamas has said talks meant to wind down the nine-month-long war <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-war-hamas-07-14-24-news-728bb0842141ba246456422ebf93deb0">would continue</a></span>, even after Israel targeted Deif. International mediators are working to push Israel and Hamas toward a deal that would halt the fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.</p>
    

<p>Israeli forces have repeatedly had to launch new offensives to combat Hamas fighters they say have been regrouping in parts of Gaza that the military has previously invaded. Still, the military has sounded increasingly confident that it has severely damaged the militants’ organization and infrastructure in its 9-month-old campaign.</p><p>The military said Tuesday that it has eliminated half of the leadership of Hamas’ military wing and that some 14,000 militants have been killed or detained. It said it killed six brigade commanders, over 20 battalion commanders, and approximately 150 company commanders from Hamas’ ranks, and that over the course of the war, it has hit 37,000 targets from the air within the Gaza Strip, including more than 25,000 terrorist infrastructure and launch sites. </p><p>The figures could not be independently confirmed. </p><p>Israel’s ground campaigns have focused on northern Gaza and the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah, where it says it has destroyed extensive Hamas tunnel networks. The offensives have left entire neighborhoods flattened. While ground operations continue in Rafah, airstrikes now appear to be hitting heavily in the areas untouched by previous offensives in the center and the coastal “safe zone.”</p>
    

<p>Strikes late Monday and on Tuesday hit the Nuseirat and Zawaida refugee camps in central Gaza. Strikes on four houses killed at least 24 people, including 10 women and four children, according to officials at Al Aqsa hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah.</p><p>Another hit a U.N. school in Nuseirat where families were sheltering, killing at least nine people. AP footage showed the school’s yard covered in rubble and twisted metal from a structure that was hit. Workers carried bodies wrapped in blankets, as women and children watched from the classrooms where they have been living. </p><p>Israel’s military said Hamas militants were operating from the school to plan attacks. Its claim could not be independently confirmed. </p><p>Other strikes in Khan Younis and Rafah killed 12 people, according to medical officials and AP journalists. An AP journalist counted the bodies at the hospital before a funeral was held at its gates.</p>
    

<p>The military said air force planes struck some 40 targets in Gaza over the past day, among them observation posts, Hamas military structures and explosives-rigged buildings. Israel blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militants operate in densely populated areas.</p><p>The Israeli military said Tuesday that it would begin sending draft notices <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-ultraorthodox-military-draft-gaza-war-c35b3a025da8cdd9b61f1c748a209419">to Jewish ultra-Orthodox men next week</a></span> — a step that could destabilize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and trigger more large protests in the community. Under long-standing political arrangements, ultra-Orthodox men had been exempt from the draft, which is compulsory for most Jewish men — an exemption that created resentment among the general public in Israel.</p>
    

<p>The war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.</p><p>Hamas’ October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.</p><p>Violence has also surged in the West Bank. On Tuesday a Palestinian stabbed an Israeli policeman, wounding him lightly, before another officer opened fire, killing the assailant who was identified as a 19-year-old from Gaza.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Find more of AP’s coverage at <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war</a></span></p>

From a scientific and conservation point of view, this is huge.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The department is working with a nearby group, Te Runanga o Otakou, to decide on next steps for the whale. If it turns out to be a spade-toothed whale, this will mark the first time scientists can dissect one.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Genetic samples were sent to the University of Auckland. It could take weeks or months for experts to process the DNA and determine what species the animal belongs to.</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/16/USAT/74430330007-20240704-125553.jpg?width=660&amp;height=495&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/16/USAT/74430330007-20240704-125553.jpg?width=1320&amp;height=990&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="An animal that washed up on a New Zealand beach on July 4, 2024.

Scientists were able to use that sample, as well as skeletal remains of two other specimens from Whakari/White Island and Robinson Crusoe Island to name a new species. The creatures found in Bay of Plenty and north of Gisborne helped scientists confirm a first-ever color pattern of the species.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The species has <a href="https://us.whales.org/spade-toothed-beaked-whale/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">never been spotted in the wild</a>, according to wildlife charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation, and little is known about its behavior or the full extent of its whereabouts. In addition to New Zealand, spade-toothed whale remains have also been found in Chile.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The whale found on July 4 has been moved to cold storage to preserve the remains until the involved agencies decide what to do next. Figuring out the next steps may take longer since the whale is so rare, said Davies, the Department of Conservation’s Coastal Otago operations manager.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><em>Saleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.
