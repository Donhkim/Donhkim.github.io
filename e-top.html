Trump’s team ended with a former federal prosecutor who was called to attack the credibility of the prosecution’s key witness, one of two people summoned to the stand by the defense.

<p>The jury was sent home for a week, until May 28, when closing arguments are expected, but the attorneys returned to the courtroom to discuss how the judge will instruct jurors before deliberations, a sort of road map meant to help them apply the law to the evidence and testimony. The two sides haggled over word choices, legal phrases and how to describe various campaign-related issues.</p>
    

<p>Trump, the first former American president to be tried criminally, did not answer questions about why he did not testify.</p>



<p>Trump had previously said he wanted to take the witness stand in his own defense, but there was no requirement or even expectation that he do so. Defendants routinely decline to testify. His attorneys, instead of mounting an effort to demonstrate Trump’s innocence to jurors, focused on attacking the credibility of the prosecution witnesses. That’s a routine defense strategy; the burden of proof in a criminal case lies with the prosecution. The defense doesn’t have to prove a thing.</p>
    
<p>Yet even as Trump denounces the trial as a politically motivated travesty of justice, he has been working to turn the proceedings into an offshoot of his <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-new-york-hush-money-trial-56fd4f4bb7562772c701a2acab76e9fd">presidential campaign</a></span>. He’s capitalized on the trial as a fundraising pitch, used his time in front of the cameras to criticize President Joe Biden and showcased a parade of his <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-speaker-mike-johnson-court-09aef3de395fa77843f2600f40da6ac3">own political supporters</a></span>.</p>
    

<p>Prosecutors have accused the presumptive Republican presidential nominee of a scheme to scoop up and bury negative stories in an illegal effort to influence the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records to conceal the alleged scheme and denied any wrongdoing. It’s the first of <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/projects/trump-investigations-civil-criminal-tracker/">Trump’s four criminal cases to go to trial</a></span>, and quite possibly the only one before the 2024 presidential election.</p><p>“They have no case,” Trump said outside court. “There’s no crime.”</p><p>He also again attacked the prosecutor, despite repeated warnings from Judge Juan M.

        </div><p>But the crux of the prosecution’s case centers not on the spectacle but on business transactions, including internal Trump Organization records in which payments to Cohen were labeled legal expenses. Prosecutors argued that those payments were really reimbursements to Cohen, doled out in chunks, for a $130,000 payment he made on Trump’s behalf to keep Daniels quiet.</p><p>Trump has been charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records. The offense is in the lowest tier of felony charges in New York state, and it is punishable by up to four years in prison, though there is no guarantee that a conviction would result in prison time.</p>
    

<p>Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. defended his father’s decision not to testify.</p><p>“There’d be absolutely no reason, no justification to do that whatsoever. Everyone sees it for the sham that it is,” the younger Trump said as he left a news conference with supporters of the former president outside the courthouse.</p><p>The judge has yet to rule on a defense request to throw out the charges, before jurors even begin deliberating, based on the argument that prosecutors have failed to prove their case. Such long-shot requests are often made in criminal cases but are rarely granted.</p>
    

<p>The final witness was Robert Costello, a former federal prosecutor, who was first called Monday afternoon and who angered the judge by <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-michael-cohen-363a86879b97d2367831b1392f42689d">rolling his eyes and talking under his breath</a></span>. The judge cleared the courtroom and threatened to remove Costello if he didn’t show more respect.</p><p>Tuesday’s testimony was absent the same kind of drama as Trump’s lawyers sought to use Costello to undermine Cohen’s credibility. The two had a professional relationship that splintered in spectacular fashion. Costello had offered to represent Cohen soon after the lawyer’s hotel room, office and home were raided and as Cohen faced a decision about whether to remain defiant in the face of a criminal investigation or to cooperate with authorities in hopes of securing more lenient treatment.</p><p>Costello bristled as he insisted to prosecutors that he did not feel animosity toward Cohen and did not try to intimidate him. “Ridiculous. No,” he said to the latter.</p><p>But Costello has repeatedly maligned Cohen’s credibility and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-grand-jury-new-york-costello-7fbb5cfdd0db010cea262d34f60efd5c">was even a witness</a></span> before last year’s grand jury that indicted Trump, offering testimony designed to undermine Cohen’s account. In a Fox News Channel interview last week, Costello accused Cohen of lying to the jury and using the case to “monetize” himself.</p><p>Prosecutors sought to show that Costello was part of a pressure campaign to manipulate and arm-twist Cohen in order to keep him in Trump’s corner once he came under federal investigation. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Costello about a 2018 email in which he assured Cohen that he was “loved” by Trump’s camp, “they are in our corner” and “you have friends in high places.”</p><p>Asked who those “friends in high places” were, Costello said he was talking about Trump, then the president. </p><p>Trump lawyer Emil Bove tried to undo that portrayal.</p><p> “Did you ever pressure Michael Cohen to do anything?” Bove asked. </p><p>“No,” Costello replied.</p><p>After the defense rested, the judge dismissed the jurors and looked ahead to closing arguments — the last time the jury will hear from either side. Deliberations could begin as early as next Wednesday, giving the panel their first chance to talk about the case. Until then, they’re barred from discussing it.</p><p>“I’ll see you in a week,” Merchan told the jury. </p><h2>___</h2><p>Long reported from Washington.

    <div><section class="content__body"><p><em>Washington</em> — A trove of newly unsealed documents related to the federal probe into former President Donald Trump's handling of classified information sheds light on the secret grand jury investigation that preceded the charges against him and the sealed proceedings that have taken place since he was indicted. </p><p>The documents confirmed Tuesday that federal agents suspected that the former president might have sought to impede the probe in ways not previously acknowledged by prosecutors and that documents with classified markings were recovered from Trump's Florida bedroom in the months after the FBI searched his Mar-a-Lago resort. They also revealed a once-confidential legal battle between defense attorneys who alleged investigatorial misconduct, and a Justice Department standing by its probe. </p><p>Special counsel Jack Smith charged the former president with 40 federal counts tied to his alleged unlawful retention of national defense information — documents with classified markings that deal with topics ranging from nuclear capabilities to military policy — and obstruction of the federal investigation into his handling of sensitive government records. Trump and his co-defendants, aide Walt Nauta and former employee Carlos de Oliveira, all pleaded not guilty,  and the former president has criticized the probe. </p>    
  <p>The 2023 federal indictment against Trump alleged he sought to impede investigators by making false representations to his attorneys. Prosecutors also said Nauta and de Oliveira allegedly engaged in an unsuccessful scheme to push a Mar-a-Lago IT worker to delete security camera footage. </p><p>But in a 2023 judicial opinion that was unsealed Tuesday, former Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the federal district court in Washington, D.C., wrote it was "likely" Trump had gone further than allegedly misleading his attorneys, possibly "instructing his agents to avoid the surveillance cameras he then understood to have been deputized by the government." </p>

<p>Howell detailed numerous instances in which the former president, his attorneys, and his aides reacted to federal requests for information about any documents with classified markings from Trump's time in the White House located at his Florida resort after his presidency ended. </p><p>In June 2022, a Washington, D.C. grand jury subpoenaed the security camera footage at Mar-a-Lago, information that was later relayed to Trump over the phone by his then-attorney, Evan Corcoran. </p><p>"The government contends that this conversation furthered a different stage of the former President's ongoing scheme to foil the government's attempts to retrieve all classified-marked documents responsive to the subpoena," the judge wrote. </p><p>Shortly after Trump's call with Corcoran about the subpoena, according to the judge, an unnamed witness, whose conduct matches that of Nauta, "rearranged his travel schedule, choosing to fly to Florida on June 25, 2022, instead of Illinois with the former president as previously scheduled." </p>

    </p>
<p>According to the judge's recounting of events, government prosecutors suspected Nauta's change in travel was part of Trump's "attempts to ensure that any subsequent movement of the boxes back to the storage room could occur off camera." </p><p>"The government has provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the June 24, 2022 phone call may have furthered the former president's efforts to obstruct the government's investigation," Howell wrote. </p><p>The judge's widely-reported opinion in 2023 was a major turning point in the special counsel's probe into Trump's conduct as she took the relatively unusual step of piercing attorney-client privilege by compelling Corcoran to testify before a grand jury about his interaction with Trump. It was released for the first time publicly on Tuesday confirmed much of what was previously reported.</p><p>Although the standard of proof in the grand jury proceedings was much lower for prosecutors than that of a jury trial, Howell wrote that because Trump might have used his attorney in furtherance of an alleged crime, the privilege between him and Corcoran could not apply. </p><p>At the time, CBS News reported Howell also ruled prosecutors could use voice memos and notes from Corcoran's time as the former president's attorney, despite challenges under the same attorney-client privilege. </p><p>In February, Trump's legal team asked the federal judge overseeing the criminal case, Aileen Cannon, to dismiss the charges and suppress evidence in part based upon what they argued was an erroneous decision by Howell. That motion for dismissal was unsealed Tuesday, too, after Cannon ordered much of the record unsealed with redactions. </p><p>Cannon has yet to rule on whether to grant some of Trump's efforts to dismiss the indictment. A trial was set to begin this month, but Cannon indefinitely postponed its start, citing issues surrounding pre-trial motions and the use of classified evidence in proceedings. </p>

    </p>
<p>Howell's 2023 opinion also detailed the searches by Trump's attorneys that were conducted after August 2022, when the FBI conducted its court-authorized search of Mar-a-Lago, for additional documents potentially covered by a grand jury subpoena for records bearing classification markings issued in May 2022.</p><p>In 2022, CBS News reported Trump's attorneys handed over to investigators other documents they had recovered after hiring an outside firm to conduct searches of all of Trump's properties for any classified documents </p><p>Two records were discovered in November of that year in a box in a storage unit located in West Palm Beach, Florida, that was leased by the General Services Administration, according to the filing.</p><p>A box with four more records with classification markings was discovered in a closet at Mar-a-Lago in mid-December 2022, Howell wrote, referencing reports included with a certification of compliance filed by Trump's post-presidency office. Those documents were part of a response to the May 2022 grand jury subpoena and "contained markings at the Secret level," according to the court filing.</p><p>Trump's office turned over to the FBI the entire box that contained the four documents on Jan. 5, 2023, as well as two additional documents that should have been handed over after  the May 2022 subpoena: "one empty folder and another mostly empty folder marked 'Classified Evening Summary,'" which were found in Trump's bedroom at Mar-a-Lago, according to Howell's opinion.</p><p>"Notable, no excuse is provided as to how the former president could miss the classified-marked documents found in his own bedroom at Mar-a-Lago," the judge wrote.</p><p>One of those attorneys, former Trump defense team member Timothy Parlatore, later sat for a grand jury interview to attest to the search </p>

    
    
<p id="leader-plus-inc5" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",5]'>
    </p>
<p>That grand jury deposition was also the subject of allegations by the former president of prosecutorial misconduct. A portion of the interview was also unsealed on Tuesday in which a prosecutor on Smith's team questioned Parlatore about his attorney-client privilege with his client, Trump. </p><p>"If the former President's so cooperative, why hasn't he allowed you to share his conversations with the Grand Jury today," the prosecutor asked, according to the page of transcript that was released Tuesday. </p><p>"Are we really doing this," Parlatore responded. </p><p>That transcript was unsealed as part of an exhibit to a filing by Trump's legal team accusing Smith's team of engaging in prosecutorial misconduct. The former president filed the motion in February under seal, and Cannon released them on the public docket Tuesday. </p><p>In the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653.561.0_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">February filing,</a> Trump's team alleged the Justice Department improperly worked with the National Archives and the Biden White House to bring the charges, and later "abused the grand jury process." The allegations, made out of public view, amounted to what Trump's lawyers argued were grounds for dismissal. </p><p>Smith's team, however, defended their conduct and rejected Trump's allegations, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653.562.0_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">writing in March</a>, "This case has been investigated and prosecuted in full compliance with all applicable constitutional provisions, statutes, rules, regulations, and policies." </p><p>"There has been no prosecutorial misconduct." </p>

<p>The documents were unsealed just as Nauta is set to appear in Cannon's courtroom on Wednesday. He has alleged the Justice Department engaged in selective prosecution by bringing the charges against him because he opted not to cooperate in the probe. Smith's team has opposed that assertion and Cannon is set to hear arguments from both sides. </p>

            In asking for a $10,000 cash bond along with the requirement that Giuliani appear in Arizona within a month to be processed, prosecutor Nicholas Klingerman told the judge that Giuliani “has failed to reach out or be cooperative in this process.”

            That evening, Giuliani posted a tweet saying that “if Arizona authorities can’t find me by tomorrow morning” they would have to dismiss the indictment. An hour after the post, Klingerman said, agents saw him leave the party and served him.

            “I have a fair number of threats … and I don’t have security any longer since I’ve been in bankruptcy. So I have very specific rules,” Giuliani said, explaining why agents were unable to serve him at this New York apartment.

            “I do consider this indictment a complete embarrassment to the American legal system.

  <p>Wise Smith previously challenged Willis in 2020, along with then-incumbent District Attorney Paul Howard. </p><p>"People are ready for a change," Wise Smith told CBS News. "People are tired of the same-old, same-old from that office. People want a breath of fresh air." </p>

<p>Wise Smith, 41, called for Willis' resignation Monday. He pointed to a pair of <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/republican-lawmakers-target-trump-prosecutors-amid-indictments/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">GOP-led congressional investigations</a></span> probing the district attorney's office use of federal funds. </p><p>Last week, GOP Senators Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson sent a letter to Willis requesting information about several Justice Department grants and alleged "the Fulton County DA may have misused funds from these grants to fund unrelated travel or the purchase of computers and "swag."' </p><p>"It's a very serious job where people are trusting you to do the right thing and to have continuous allegations of misuse of those funds to do that, it's time to go, " Wise Smith said. </p><p>The House Judiciary Committee is also conducting a probe into the district attorney's funding and has threatened to hold Willis in contempt of Congress. This month, Chairman Jim Jordan also asked former special prosecutor Nathan Wade, who was romantically involved with Willis, to testify before the panel. </p>

<p>Willis has denied any wrongdoing. </p><p>"Jim Jordan has time after time after time attacked my office with no legitimate purpose," Willis said. "He has now turned his tricks into he's going to look into grant programs, which I invite him to do, and we have complied with his subpoenas, but yet he continues his attacks to try to interfere in a criminal investigation." </p><p>A state Senate committee in Georgia has also opened a probe into Willis' office and has indicated it is prepared to subpoena her. Willis said the inquiry is "not legitimate." </p><p>"And so it shall fail, and it's not going to go anywhere," she said. </p><p>WIllis launched the election subversion investigation into former President Trump's efforts to <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-was-indicted-georgia-trump-18-co-conspirators-fulton-county/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">overturn the 2020 election</a></span> in Georgia shortly after she won her first term.

<p>With campaign signs dotting portions of Fulton County, Willis makes no mention of the Trump case in her ads. </p><p>"I took on the gangs and violent offenders," Willis says in a television ad airing in the Atlanta metro. "We've seen the third largest crime drop in America." </p><p>Willis, who is the first woman to lead the Fulton County D.A.'s office, points to her experience in the community including the establishment of a pre-indictment diversion program to offer second chances to offenders, initiatives targeting at-risk youth and greater transparency with law enforcement. </p><p>Wise Smith founded the National Social Justice Alliance nonprofit to combat police brutality and says his goal, if elected, is to end mass incarceration and "dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline." If elected, on Day One, he said he hopes to establish a school-based internship and mentorship program. Wise Smith also wants to divert non-violent marijuana and THC cases, expunge old non-violent convictions and put more focus on victim-centered crimes. </p><p>"So much time right now is wasted on prosecuting marijuana, is wasted on prosecuting crimes where the basis or foundation was a mental disability or substance addiction or homelessness," Wise Smith explained. "If we partner up folks with resource providers that can help them turn their lives around, then I have more attorneys, more investigators, more money and more time to attack the rapes, the robberies, the murders and the crimes that really impact our safety."  </p><p>Wise Smith was the only candidate to show up last month for an Atlanta Press Club debate where he addressed an empty podium. Willis did not attend.</p><p>Wise Smith told CBS News he would "respect the decision of the voters no matter which way it goes" in the primary but stopped short of saying whether he would endorse Willis if she advances. </p>

<p>Willis hopes to prevail despite the ongoing challenges. </p><p>"I am not going to be broken and I am going to still be standing here doing my job lawfully," Willis said.</p>

They had to crawl over the debris to get out.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“I have over 100 porcelain dolls — ceramic pieces I made,” Handsacker said. “We don’t know where they are yet. It’ll be a matter of getting in there.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Her own grandparents lost their home in the five-tornado spree that touched down in Charles City in 1968, and her grandfather was trapped for three days in his car. </p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">She said she and her husband know they’re lucky they came away unscathed; they believe that God was looking out for them.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“It pays to teach Sunday school!," she said.

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>South Carolina governor signs bill restricting gender-affirming care for minors</strong>: Governor Henry McMaster signed a bill into law on Tuesday that forbids health professionals from performing gender-transition surgeries, prescribing puberty-blocking drugs, and providing hormone treatments for patients under 18.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New law requires school staff to inform parents of students' gender identity</strong>: The law also requires principals, teachers, and other school staff to notify parents when their children ask to use a name or pronouns different from their legal name or sex assigned at birth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The bill is part of a broader trend</strong>: The law is part of a nationwide trend, with about two dozen states passing laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors. South Carolina's law is notable for explicitly banning hormone treatments and surgeries for minors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The measure was passed by state lawmakers with religious rhetoric</strong>: The bill's sponsors, including House Majority Leader David Hiott, cited religious beliefs in support of the legislation. Hiott commented that "God created us male and female, that's it."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The law increases restrictions on gender-affirming care in multiple areas</strong>: The law expands the ban on care for minors to all providers statewide, and it also bars adults under 26 from using Medicaid to cover the costs of gender-affirming care.</p>

The state now joins about two dozen others that have passed laws restricting or banning what doctors call gender-affirming care for minors.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The law, which goes into effect immediately, also requires principals, teachers and other school staff members to tell parents when their children want to use a name other than their legal one, or pronouns that do not match their sex assigned at birth.</p><h2 class="css-vlsv4n e12nqm5i0" id="link-2c7b0750"><span>Background</span></h2><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">South Carolina lawmakers tried to pass similar legislation in 2021 and 2022 but failed to get them through the State House of Representatives. In 2022, the clock ran out on a broader bill banning transition care for minors, but lawmakers put a clause in the state budget that banned a pediatric clinic at a public hospital from using state funds on transition care for people under 16. The clinic soon went further, <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/musc-medical-university-south-carolina-trans-healthcare-emails" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ending hormonal treatments</a> to anyone under 18.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">This year, House Republicans made gender-transition treatment a priority. “When God created us, he created us male and female, that’s it,” said David Hiott, the House majority leader and a co-sponsor of the bill, at the start of the legislative session in January. “All these other folks that want to change that from birth, change that through their life, we need to stand up against that.”</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The measure, known as House Bill 4624, was passed by the legislature earlier this month.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">  </span>The new legislation not only expands the ban on care for minors to all providers statewide, but also bars adults under 26 from using Medicaid to cover the costs for such care.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">In <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://x.com/henrymcmaster/status/1792997798444417131" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a social media post</a> on Tuesday, Mr. McMaster said the bill “protects our state’s children from irreversible gender transition procedures” and added that he would meet with its supporters at a ceremonial signing next week.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">At a House committee hearing in January, Dr. Elizabeth Mack, president of the South Carolina chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, criticized the measure, saying there was “no mainstream organization that doesn’t support gender-affirming care.”</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">“Gender-affirming care is evidence-based, suicide-prevention care,” she said at the time. She added that gender-transition surgery was currently not being performed in South Carolina, and that transition care was being done only after much deliberation between doctors, parents and children.</p><p class="css-zry96z" aria-live="polite" role="note"><a class="css-1081t4c" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=8WXW7">Subscribe to The Times</a> to read as many articles as you like.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay was hospitalized with sepsis</strong>: Mackinlay, the MP for South Thanet, contracted a life-threatening episode of sepsis, which led to the amputation of his hands and feet.</li>
<li><strong>Waking up to a shocking discovery</strong>: Mackinlay recalled waking up from an induced coma to find his limbs had turned completely black, with his hands and feet being "like plastic" and almost unrecognizable.</li>
<li><strong>Amputation and subsequent prosthetics</strong>: Mackinlay underwent the amputation of his hands and feet, but was able to save the parts above the elbows and knees. He has since been fitted with prosthetic legs and hands, and hopes to be known as the "first bionic MP".</li>
<li><strong>The sudden onset of symptoms</strong>: Mackinlay began feeling unwell on September 27, but initially didn't think much of it. It wasn't until his wife, a pharmacist, tested his blood pressure and temperature that she became concerned about his condition.</li>
<li><strong>Recovering and returning to Parliament</strong>: Mackinlay is due to return to Parliament for the first time since his ordeal, and is expected to use his experience to raise awareness about the dangers of undiagnosed sepsis.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Egyptian intelligence changed the terms of a ceasefire proposal</strong>: Egyptian intelligence officials quietly changed the terms of a ceasefire proposal that Israel had already signed off on, ultimately scuttling a deal that could have released Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners and temporarily ended the fighting in Gaza.</li>
<li><strong>The changes were made by a senior Egyptian intelligence official</strong>: A senior Egyptian intelligence official, Ahmed Abdel Khalek, was responsible for making the changes to the ceasefire proposal. Khalek is a deputy to the Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel.</li>
<li><strong>The changes led to anger and recrimination among officials</strong>: The changes made by Egyptian intelligence led to a wave of anger and recrimination among officials from the US, Qatar, and Israel, and left ceasefire talks at an impasse.</li>
<li><strong>CIA Director Bill Burns was angry and embarrassed</strong>: CIA Director Bill Burns, who had been leading American efforts to broker a ceasefire agreement, was angry and embarrassed by the changes, believing it made him look like he wasn't in the loop or hadn't informed the Israelis of the changes.</li>
<li><strong>The changes were a surprise to other parties involved</strong>: The changes to the ceasefire proposal were a surprise to other parties involved in the negotiations, including the US, Qatar, and Israel, who believed they had agreed to a different set of terms.</li>
