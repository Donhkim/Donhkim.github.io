            Israeli officials have slammed the United States and descended into a bout of infighting over<strong> </strong>US President Joe Biden’s remarks that he would <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/07/politics/us-israel-bomb-shipment-pause-rafah-incursion/index.html">halt some shipments of American weapons to Israel</a> if a full-scale ground operation is launched into the city of Rafah.

            After Biden made his remarks, in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett, Gilad Erdan, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, said he believed the decision “can encourage the enemies of the State of Israel and the Israeli nation,” while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted to the announcement by posting a short clip of a speech he delivered a few days ago, in which he said: “If Israel is forced to stand alone, Israel will stand alone.”
    </p>

            Netanyahu reiterated the sentiment on Thursday, on the eve of the country’s Independence Day, saying: “In the War of Independence 76 years ago, we were few against many. We had no weapons, there was an arms embargo on Israel, but with the greatness of spirit, bravery and unity among us - we won.”
    </p>

            The US president’s announcement that he was prepared to condition American weaponry on Israel’s actions is a turning point in the seven-month conflict between Israel and Hamas. And his acknowledgement that American bombs <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/report-looms-biden-israel-international-law/index.html">had been used to kill civilians</a> in Gaza was a stark recognition of the United States’ role in the war.

            The comment from Biden to CNN is a major setback for Israel’s war. The US is by far Israel’s most important and most powerful ally, and without its support, Israel’s firepower and ambitions in Gaza would be weakened.
    </p>

            The Biden administration has for months been putting pressure on Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza and to ensure more humanitarian aid can be delivered there.

            The US has also repeatedly called on Netanyahu and his government to reconsider its plans for a full-scale invasion of Rafah, the southernmost city of Gaza where more than 1 million people are sheltering after fleeing from fighting elsewhere in the strip.
    </p>

            Israel has, so far, carried out a limited operation around the city, taking control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing — a crucial entry point for aid into Gaza — and carrying out military strikes on the city’s fringes.
    </p>

            New satellite images obtained by CNN from Planet Labs show Israel’s attack in Rafah has <a href="https://cnn.com/2024/05/08/middleeast/rafah-israel-idf-ground-operation-intl-latam/index.html">expanded from airstrikes </a>to ground operations in recent days.

            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Monday told some people in eastern Rafah to “evacuate immediately” ahead of a military operation in the city. They were told to go to Al-Mawasi, a coastal town near the city of Khan Younis that aid groups have described as overcrowded and not appropriate for habitation. The UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) estimated that nearly 79,000 people have fled the city since Monday.

            Despite mounting international pressure, the Biden administration has stood firm with Israel until now, delivering weapons and other support. The threat on Wednesday came just a day after Biden used his speech at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum to remind people of the horrors of the October 7 attacks on Israel, when Hamas-led fighters killed around 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped<a href="https://cnn.com/2024/04/06/middleeast/israeli-hostage-families-war/index.html"> more than 250</a>. Many of the hostages taken into Gaza on that day are still being held in the strip.
    </p>

            “Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7 — including Hamas’ appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize Jews. It’s absolutely despicable – and it must stop,” he said on Tuesday, raising his voice.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clvz98hsh00043b6jvnwfmpuk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            But the president struck a very different note on Wednesday. “I made it clear that if they go into Rafah – they haven’t gone in Rafah yet – if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities – that deal with that problem,” Biden said, adding that the US would continue supplying defensive weapons to Israel.
    </p>

            Netanyahu said Biden had made a mistake in an interview with the American talk show host known as Dr. Phil, to be broadcast on Thursday night. Netanyahu said Israeli forces are doing what they can to let the people leave Rafah, and that he hoped that the two leaders would find a way to overcome their differences.
    </p>

            “I’ve known Joe Biden for many years, 40 years and more. We often had our agreements, but we’ve had our disagreements. We’ve been able to overcome them. I hope we can overcome them now,” Netanyahu said.

            Speaking at an event honoring fallen Israeli soldiers and victims of terror attacks, Israel’s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said: “I turn to Israel’s enemies as well as to our best of friends and say - the State of Israel cannot be subdued, not the IDF, not the defense establishment, and not the State of Israel. We will stand strong, we will achieve our goals - we will hit Hamas, we will hit Hezbollah, and we will achieve security.”

                            <p>A Florida deputy fired the six rounds that killed Senior Airman Roger Fortson within seconds of the airman opening the door, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfDvWs9Bfn0" target="_blank">police body camera footage released Thursday reveals</a>.</p><p>The footage shows the unidentified deputy firing into Fortson's chest as the airman opens his apartment door and appears to be holding a handgun at his side. The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office deputy shoots Fortson, who was assigned to a <a href="https://www.military.com/special-operations">special operations</a> squadron at <a href="https://www.military.com/base-guide/hurlburt-field">Hurlburt Field</a>, immediately after telling the airman to step back -- giving him virtually no time to respond.</p><p id="content-adblock-663d5c6b4aea5"></p><p id="content-adblock-663d5c6b4aea7"></p><p>Only as Fortson is lying on the floor of his apartment fatally wounded does the deputy tell him to drop his weapon, a firearm that was legally owned, according to an attorney for the airman's family.</p><p><strong>Read Next:</strong> <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/05/09/they-took-my-gift-away-interview-mother-of-florida-airman-killed-police-describes-shock.html">'They Took My Gift Away': In Interview, Mother of Florida Airman Killed by Police Describes Shock</a></p><p>The footage was released by the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office during a press conference Thursday as questions swirl around the May 3 death of Fortson. Officials say they were responding to a call of a disturbance that led them to the apartment, but the body cam footage raised more concerns about the deputy's use of deadly force and the vague second- and third-hand information that led them to Fortson's door.</p><p id="content-adblock-663d5c6b4b024"></p><p id="content-adblock-663d5c6b4b026"></p><p>The sheriff's office has not identified the deputy who shot the airman but said an investigation is underway.</p><p>Okaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden did not take any questions after releasing the footage at the press conference. In a prior statement, he said he had placed the involved deputy on leave and also asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, as well as the State Attorney's Office, to conduct an investigation.</p><p>Fortson's family has claimed he was home alone and there was no disturbance in the apartment. His mother said in <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/05/09/they-took-my-gift-away-interview-mother-of-florida-airman-killed-police-describes-shock.html">an exclusive interview</a> with Military.com on Thursday that the airman was "murdered."</p><p>The 23-year-old lived in an off-base apartment in Fort Walton Beach, in the Florida panhandle, and was assigned to a special operations squadron that flies AC-130J Ghostrider gunships.</p><p>"In the four-and-a-half minute, heavily redacted video, it is very troubling that the deputy gave no verbal commands and shot multiple times within a split second of the door being opened, killing Roger," Ben Crump, a renowned civil rights attorney retained by Fortson's family, said in an emailed statement Thursday.</p><p>In the footage, shot by a camera on the deputy's uniform, the officer can be seen knocking on the door without announcing himself and then standing off to the side, apparently out of view of the door's peephole.</p><p>The deputy knocks again and announces he's with the sheriff's office. Fortson then opens the apartment door.</p><p>The following series of events happen within seconds.</p><p>Fortson can be seen standing in the doorway, holding a gun in his hand with his arm down by his side. Immediately, he is told by the deputy to "step back" and then -- without a pause -- a rapid succession of shots rings out from the officer's gun.</p><p>The airman falls to the floor on his back. Only then does the deputy tell him to "drop the gun." Fortson weakly responds that he doesn't have it.</p><p>"As the officer didn't tell Roger to drop the weapon before shooting, was the officer trained to give verbal warnings? Did the officer try to initiate lifesaving measures? Was the officer trained to deal with law-abiding citizens who are registered gun owners?" Crump said.</p><p>The information that led police to Fortson's apartment also appears to have been questionable.</p><p>Publicly available police radio chatter from that day reveals the information about the disturbance came from several sources in the apartment complex. In the body cam footage, a male at the front office of the complex and a woman who spoke with deputies both said they were reporting secondhand information about a potential disturbance.</p><p>"Don't have anything further than a male and female; it's all fourth-party information from the front desk at the leasing office," a deputy said on the radio, Military.com previously reported.</p><p>When the deputy asks a man in the front leasing office "what's going on," he replies, "I'm not sure" and that he had been told to call a woman if deputies came by.</p><p>"So, there's a fight going on or something?" the deputy asked the man. "I wasn't present for that," the man, whose face is blurred out on the video, responds.</p><p>The deputy then walks over to an unidentified woman in the parking lot of the apartment complex building and asks, "So, are they fighting or something?" She responds, "She was saying it happens frequently, but this time it was getting out of hand."</p><p>The deputy then asks "which door?" The woman responds, "I'm not sure."</p><p>The woman tells the law enforcement officer that she was walking by an apartment two weeks earlier and heard a verbal fight but "wasn't sure where it came from."</p><p>But the officer asks "which room is it?" and the woman responds, "1401." She adds, "But the girl sounded scared, the one who called."</p><p>It's not clear who originally reported the disturbance. Crump said Fortson was home alone on a video call with his girlfriend when police came to the apartment.</p><p>Meka Fortson, Roger's mother, told Military.com in an exclusive interview Thursday that her son had always wanted to serve his country and had dreams of becoming a pilot. She said he had recently returned from a <a href="https://www.military.com/deployment">deployment</a> overseas, only to die in his apartment.</p><p>"It's a disbelief. Every day, I try to go to sleep early to wake up like it's a dream," she said. "He just came back from deployment from fighting for us. With everything we got going on in our country, he's fighting for us and he came back to be murdered, slain like that so violently."</p><p>Crump told Military.com on Thursday no gunfire was exchanged and that Fortson was a model citizen who did not pose a threat. There was no returning gunfire shown in Thursday's body camera footage.</p><p>"The reality is he was the best of us. He was the person who you would trust with a firearm. I mean, he was military trained," Crump said. "So, for them to put out a statement claiming self-defense is just misleading because they're trying to suggest that what they did was justified."</p><p>In a statement Wednesday, Crump cited an account by the girlfriend who was on the video call, saying that Roger Fortson didn't see anyone when he looked out the peephole and that "police burst through the door."</p><p>Following the release of the video, Crump detailed in an emailed statement, "The girlfriend acknowledges that, even though she initially thought the door was forced open by the police, that she stands by her emotional recollection of what happened.</p><p>"We remain adamant that the police had the wrong apartment as Roger was on the phone with his girlfriend for a substantial amount of time leading up to the shooting, and no one else was in the apartment," Crump said in a statement.</p><p>The girlfriend, who has not been named, is reportedly planning to hold a press conference in the near future.</p><p>During a portion of their FaceTime video, which was recorded by the girlfriend and shared with Military.com, Fortson can be heard groaning and saying "I can't breathe." The deputy yells, "Do not move, stop moving."</p><p>The Sunshine State has prioritized the ease of buying and carrying firearms in recent years, including special carve-outs for service members that simplify the process further, such as not requiring troops to take safety courses in order to qualify to carry concealed weapons under a 2023 law.</p><p>Ann Stefanek, a Department of the <a href="https://www.military.com/air-force">Air Force</a> spokeswoman, told Military.com on Thursday that leadership at the wing where Fortson served is in contact with and supporting his family. She added, "The Air Force is also actively working in conjunction with local authorities to thoroughly investigate this incident and gather all pertinent facts related to this terrible tragedy."</p><p>Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters Thursday that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has not reached out to the family and that they were "saddened" by the loss of a service member.</p><p>"We certainly never want to see our airmen or any military member, or any part of our [Department of Defense] family be put into a situation like this," Ryder said.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/05/09/they-took-my-gift-away-interview-mother-of-florida-airman-killed-police-describes-shock.html#:~:text=Read%20Next%3A-,Police%20Who%20Shot%20Florida%20Airman%206%20Times%20in%20His%20Home%20May%20Have%20Entered%20Wrong%20Apartment%2C%20Family%20Says,-Roger%20Fortson%20lived"><em>Police Who Shot Florida Airman 6 Times in His Home May Have Entered Wrong Apartment, Family Says</em></a></p>

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Biden administration has announced a new rule that allows officials to remove illegal immigrants considered a public safety or national security threat earlier in the asylum process, typically within days of arriving at the border.</li>
<li>The rule applies to those considered a risk to national security, including terrorists, or public safety, and would allow statutory denials to be applied earlier in the process.</li>
<li>According to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) senior official, the rule is expected to only affect a small population, but will be an important tool in removing individuals who may pose a risk to the United States.</li>
<li>The administration has also announced revised guidance that allows asylum officers to consider whether an asylum seeker could relocate to a different part of their home country instead of seeking asylum in the US.</li>
<li>The administration claims that the changes are part of its efforts to "ensure the safety of the American public" and to "identify and remove those individuals who present a security risk and have no legal basis to remain here", but notes that more sweeping changes to the system can only come from congressional action.</li>

Montgomery eventually disposed of his daughter's body in March 2020.</p><p>"There is nothing minimal about the crimes that he is being convicted for today," said prosecutor Ben Agati at Montgomery's sentencing. He offered to reduce the request to 35 years to life, instead of 45 to life, if Montgomery revealed where Harmony's body could be found but Montgomery said nothing. "He has just yet shown you again in this courtroom and for anybody else that he is heartless, immoral, selfish and an unapologetic murderer of his own child," said Agati.</p><h2><br></h2><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/01/06/9872091d-b971-4dac-9bc7-a27edc401ef1/thumbnail/620x349/0c1a26759d845ddadf50a776d11b77b0/mpd.jpg?v=218688c1357f974b9630d4fa8914721c#" alt="mpd.jpg " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/01/06/9872091d-b971-4dac-9bc7-a27edc401ef1/thumbnail/620x349/0c1a26759d845ddadf50a776d11b77b0/mpd.jpg?v=218688c1357f974b9630d4fa8914721c 1x, https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/01/06/9872091d-b971-4dac-9bc7-a27edc401ef1/thumbnail/1240x698/2766fb2659fb306837a14dec5b3d15c7/mpd.jpg?v=218688c1357f974b9630d4fa8914721c 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

I hope you hear her sweet voice telling you to stop hitting her over and over, or how she looked the very last time you saw her, broken and bruised." Sorey vowed to keep looking for Harmony for the rest of her life.</p><p>The second victim impact statement was from Sorey's sister, who said Montgomery was in prison when Harmony was born. "I was talking you down from how scared you were because you wanted to be the best dad and I believed in you and reminded you how good you were with my daughter, that you would be the best dad and not to worry. I couldn't even believe how wrong I actually was." She called Montgomery a monster and a coward and accused him of never loving his daughter, "because if you did, she'd still be here today."</p><p>A statement was also read by a victim advocate from Kayla Montgomery, Montgomery's estranged wife. Kayla Montgomery was a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/adam-harmony-kayla-montgomery-murder-trial-new-hampshire/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">star witness</a></span> for the prosecution, who testified how he killed Harmony and hid her body for months. Kayla Montgomery also testified she was scared of him and that's why she lied on his behalf to protect him.</p><p>In her statement, Kayla Montgomery said she and Montgomery were happy to have custody of Harmony but then everything changed when they fell deeper into addiction and their lives fell apart.</p><p>"You are not the person I married, not the person who loved me and who never hurt me," Kayla Montgomery said in her statement.</p><p>Blair and Johnathan Miller, the adoptive fathers of Harmony's 7-year-old brother Jamison, spoke next.

"You introduced murder into his life and forever created a void that can never be filled." He said he and his husband have told Jamison that Harmony is an angel now.</p><p>Johnathan Bobbitt-Miller said Adam introduced a nightmare into his son's life. Through tears, he recounted Jamison's reaction to when he was told Harmony was dead. "He's a very active kid and that day, he just stopped and he held us and he said, 'No, I need my big sister. Why? Why did this happen?'" He said Jamison keeps asking what happened to her.</p><p>"How do we tell our 7-year-old that you murdered his sister? His protector, his best friend, and you showed no remorse. I wish they could be happy together today," said Johnathan Miller. He then read words from Jamison himself. </p><p>"I'm really sad she's an angel. I miss her. She was my best friend. I hope she can see me playing basketball, being silly with my brothers and I wish I could bring Harmony to my school to meet my friends and my teacher," read Johnathan Bobbitt-Miller. </p><p>The final victim impact statement was from Harmony's foster mother. Michelle Raftery said Harmony filled her family's life with joy and laughter when she lived with them. She described Harmony as a kind and compassionate girl who loved Minnie Mouse and playing dress-up and was always willing to share. "We lost a daughter and my children lost their sister," said Raftery.</p><p>Raftery said since learning what happened to Harmony, she's had trouble sleeping and concentrating. "We had to explain to our children things that we never wanted them to hear and explain why a father, who was supposed to love and protect her, was being arrested for murder," said Raftery.</p>

<h2>Search for Harmony continues</h2><p>After court, Sorey said she won't give up searching for her daughter's remains.</p><p>"I don't want people to think that it's over because it's not, it's not over," said Sorey. "She's still out there and she's all alone."</p><p>Manchester Police Chief Allen Aldenberg also confirmed that the search for Harmony will continue.</p><p>"We'll continue to take steps to make sure this does not happen again in the state of New Hampshire or anywhere else," said Aldenberg.</p>

        </div><p>Putin has turned Victory Day — the country’s most important secular holiday — into a pillar of his nearly quarter-century in power and a justification of his military action in Ukraine.</p><p>Two days after beginning his <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-president-inauguration-ukraine-355bd36a2e833800187af848dc24a7dc">fifth term in office</a></span>, he led the festivities across Russia that recall the nation’s wartime sacrifice.</p>
    

<p>“Victory Day unites all generations,” Putin said in a speech in Red Square that came on the coldest May 9 in decades amid some snow flurries. “We are going forward relying on our centuries-old traditions and feel confident that together we will ensure a free and secure future of Russia.”</p><p>As battalions marched by and military hardware — both old and new — rumbled over the cobblestones, the sky cleared briefly to allow a flyby of warplanes, some of which trailed smoke in the white, red and blue of the Russian flag. </p>



<p>Putin hailed the troops fighting in Ukraine as “our heroes” for their courage, resilience and self-denial, adding that “all of Russia is with you.”</p>
    
<p>He accused the West of “fueling regional conflicts, inter-ethnic and inter-religious strife and trying to contain sovereign and independent centers of global development.”</p><p>With tensions with Washington over Ukraine soaring to their highest level since the Cold War, Putin issued another stark reminder of Moscow’s nuclear might.</p><p>“Russia will do everything to prevent global confrontation, but will not allow anyone to threaten us,” he said. “Our strategic forces are in combat readiness.”</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth="">

<p>Nuclear-capable Yars intercontinental ballistic missiles were pulled across Red Square, underscoring his message.</p><p>The Soviet Union lost about 27 million people in World War II, an estimate that many historians consider conservative, scarring virtually every family.</p><p>Nazi troops overran much of the western Soviet Union when they invaded in June 1941, before being driven back all the way to Berlin, where the USSR’s hammer and sickle flag was raised above the ruined capital. The U.S., U.K, France and other allies mark the end of the war in Europe on May 8.</p><p>The immense suffering and sacrifice in cities like Stalingrad, Kursk and Putin’s native Leningrad — now St. Petersburg — still serve as a powerful symbol of the country’s ability to prevail against seemingly overwhelming challenges.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

        </div><p>Since coming to power on the last day of 1999, Putin has made May 9 an important part of his political agenda, featuring missiles, tanks and fighter jets. Medal-bedecked veterans joined him Thursday to review the parade, and many — including the president — wore the black-and-orange St. George’s ribbon that is traditionally associated with Victory Day.</p>
    

<p>About 9,000 troops, including about 1,000 who fought in Ukraine, took part in Thursday’s parade.</p><p>Although the U.S. and U.K. ambassadors did not attend, Putin was joined by other dignitaries and presidents of several former Soviet nations along with a few other Moscow allies, including the leaders of Cuba, Guinea-Bissau and Laos.</p><p>In his speech, he accused the West of “revanchism … hypocrisy and lies” in seeking to play down the Soviet role in defeating Nazi Germany.</p><p>Putin described Victory Day as “very emotional and poignant.”</p><p>“Every family is honoring its heroes, looking at pictures with dear faces and remembering their relatives and how they fought,” he said.</p><p>Putin, 71, talks frequently about his family history, sharing memories of his father, who fought on the front during the Nazi siege of the city and was badly wounded.</p><p>As Putin tells it, his father, also named Vladimir, came home from a military hospital during the war to see workers trying to take away his wife, Maria, who had been declared dead of starvation. But the elder Putin did not believe she had died — saying she had only lost consciousness, weak with hunger. Their first child, Viktor, died during the siege when he was 3, one of more than 1 million Leningrad residents who died in the 872-day blockade, most of them from starvation.</p>
    

<p>For several years, Putin carried a photo of his father in Victory Day marches — as did others honoring relatives who were war veterans — in what was called the “Immortal Regiment.”</p><p>Those demonstrations were suspended during the coronavirus pandemic and then again amid security concerns after the start of the fighting in Ukraine.</p><p>As part of his efforts to burnish the Soviet legacy and trample on any attempts to question it, Russia has introduced laws that criminalized the “rehabilitation of Nazism” that include punishing the “desecration” of memorials or challenging Kremlin versions of World War II history.</p>
    

<p>When he sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Putin evoked World War II in seeking to justify his actions that Kyiv and its Western allies denounced as an unprovoked war of aggression. Putin cited the “denazification” of Ukraine as a main goal of Moscow, falsely describing the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is Jewish and lost relatives in the Holocaust, as neo-Nazis.</p><p>Putin tried to cast Ukraine’s veneration of some of its nationalist leaders who cooperated with the Nazis in World War II as a sign of Kyiv’s purported Nazi sympathies. He regularly made unfounded references to Ukrainian nationalist figures such as Stepan Bandera, who was killed by a Soviet spy in Munich in 1959, as an underlying justification for the Russian military action in Ukraine.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

Tiago Franco, a firefighter from Sao Paulo deployed to lead the rescue, was quoted as saying in a statement from that state’s security secretariat. “We tried to approach in a calm way.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Firefighters and veterinarians climbed onto the mostly submerged roof, sedated and immobilized the horse and then laid him on an inflatable raft — all 770 pounds of him. The operation involved four inflatable boats and four support vessels, with firefighters, soldiers and other volunteers.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The rescue was broadcast live on television networks that filmed from their helicopters. Social media influencer Felipe Neto sent out updates to his almost 17 million followers on X as the rescue was underway. Afterwards, he offered to adopt him.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"Caramelo, Brazil loves you!!! My God, what happiness," he wrote.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's wife, Janja, posted a video of herself sharing the good news with the Brazilian leader, whispering into his ear at an official event. He smiled, gave a thumbs up and hugged her to him. Rio Grande do Sul's Gov. Eduardo Leite also celebrated the rescue, posting on X: “All lives matter, we stand firm!” </p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Caramelo is recovering at a veterinary hospital affiliated with a university.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Mariângela Allgayer, a veterinarian and professor at the institution, said Thursday afternoon on social media that he arrived very dehydrated.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">He is about 7 years old and, based on his characteristics, was likely used as a draft animal for a cart, Bruno Schmitz, one of the veterinarians who helped rescue and evaluate Caramelo, later told television network GloboNews. He’s also very gentle, Schmitz added, which greatly helped with the administration of sedatives.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“It was a very difficult operation, well beyond the standards even for specialized teams. I think they had never been through something like this before, but thank God everything went well,” he said, then showed Caramelo standing up.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The stranded horse is just one of many animals rescue workers have been striving to save in recent days. Rio Grande do Sul state agents have rescued about 10,000 animals since last week, while those in municipalities and volunteers have saved thousands more, according to the state's housing secretariat.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Animal protection groups and volunteers have been sharing images of difficult rescues and heartwarming scenes of pets reuniting with their owners on social media. One video that went viral shows a man crying inside a boat, hugging his four dogs after rescuers went back to his home to save them.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Heavy rains and flooding in Rio Grande do Sul have killed at least 107 people. Another 136 are reported missing and more than 230,000 have been displaced, according to state authorities. There is no official tally for the number of animals that have been killed or are missing, but local media have estimated the number is in the thousands.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Not far from where Caramelo was rescued, pet owners in Canoas celebrated as they waited in line to get donations at a makeshift animal shelter organized by volunteers.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">“So much bad news, but this rescue does give people here some more hope,” said Guilherme Santos, 23, as he sought dog food for his two puppies. “If they can rescue a horse, why not all dogs that are still missing? We can definitely do this.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Carla Sassi, chairwoman of Grad, a Brazilian nonprofit that rescues animals after disasters, said she is meeting with state government officials in Canoas to discuss emergency measures to rescue pets.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">___</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Sá Pessoa reported from São Paulo.</p></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two Boeing 737 planes have been involved in separate accidents: one in Senegal and the other in Turkey. The Senegalese plane skidded off the runway before takeoff, injuring at least 10 people, while the Turkish plane suffered a burst tire during landing, forcing it to evacuate all 190 people on board.</li>
<li>The Senegalese plane, operated by TransAir, was bound for Bamako, Mali, and had 85 people on board, including two pilots and four cabin crew. At least 10 people were injured, with photos showing the damaged plane in a grassy field.</li>
<li>The Turkish plane, operated by Corendon Airlines, was landing at Gazipasa airport in southern Turkey when one of its tires burst, causing the aircraft to be evacuated. The airline denied reports that the plane had landed on its nose, but the Turkish transport ministry confirmed damage to the nose landing gear.</li>
<li>The accidents have raised further concerns about Boeing's safety record, coming amidst a crisis over the manufacturer's poor safety record. The company has faced numerous crises over the years, including the crashes of its MAX 737 model.</li>
<li>The Senegalese airport was closed after the accident, but reopened by 11:00 GMT. In Turkey, flights were diverted to nearby Antalya airport while the damaged plane was removed.</li>

<p>Eight-five people – including two pilots and four cabin crew – were on board the flight operated by TransAir and bound for the Malian capital Bamako. At least 10 people were injured, the transport ministry said.</p>
<p>Photos showed the damaged plane at a standstill in a grassy field with a damaged wing, its emergency exit slides deployed.</p>
<p>Videos shared on social media appeared to show a left wing on fire. The aircraft was later cordoned off with red and white tape, the Reuters news agency reported.</p>
<p>The facility was closed after the accident but had reopened by 11:00 GMT, the airport operator said.</p>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<p>In Turkey, 190 people – including six crew members – were safely evacuated from a Boeing 737-800 belonging to Corendon Airlines after one of the aircraft’s tyres burst on Thursday during landing at Gazipasa, an airport near the Mediterranean coastal town of Alanya.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>Corendon Airlines denied Turkish media reports that the aircraft, which had arrived from Cologne, Germany, had landed on its nose. Turkey’s Ministry for Transport and Infrastructure reported damage to the plane’s nose landing gear.</p>
<p>Flights were diverted to nearby Antalya airport while the aircraft was removed, the ministry said.</p>
<p>It was the second incident at a Turkish airport in as many days. On Wednesday, a Boeing 767 cargo aircraft belonging to FedEx made an <a href="/news/2024/5/8/turkey-launches-probe-after-boeing-plane-lands-without-front-landing-gear">emergency landing</a> at Istanbul Airport after its front landing gear failed. No one was injured and the crew safely evacuated the aircraft.</p>
<p>Manufacturers are not typically involved in the operation or maintenance of jets once they enter service, but Boeing has been under intense media and regulatory scrutiny following a series of incidents involving its 737s.</p>
<p>In January, <a href="/news/2024/1/12/us-opens-safety-investigation-into-boeing-after-alaska-airlines-blowout">a door panel blew out</a> of a Boeing 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. The midair blowout followed two 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.</p>
<p>Further denting the company’s image, air safety officials in the United States are currently <a href="/economy/2024/5/7/us-officials-probe-claims-boeing-workers-falsified-inspection-records">investigating</a> whether employees at Boeing falsified inspection records for the 787 Dreamliner.</p>
