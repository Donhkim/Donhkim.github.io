    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Boeing's CEO, David Calhoun, appeared before the Senate investigations subcommittee to answer questions about the company's plans to fix its manufacturing problems and address whistleblower concerns.</li>
<li>The hearing was attended by relatives of the 346 people who died in two crashes of Boeing's 737 Max jetliners, as well as the family of a Boeing whistleblower who died earlier this year.</li>
<li>Senator Richard Blumenthal, chair of the committee, opened the hearing by recognizing the victims' families and criticizing Boeing for its mistakes. He said the hearing was a "moment of reckoning" for the company.</li>
<li>Calhoun apologized for the grief caused by the crashes and acknowledged that Boeing needs to do better in responding to employee concerns. He also stated that he would speak directly with whistleblowers.</li>
<li>The hearing was prompted by a recent incident in which a panel on a 737 Max blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight, raising concerns about the safety of Boeing's best-selling commercial aircraft.</li>

No one was seriously injured in the incident, but it raised fresh concerns about the company’s best-selling commercial aircraft. </p>
    

<p>Calhoun sat at the witness table and fidgeted with his eyeglasses as Blumenthal spoke. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., thanked the CEO for coming to face “tough questions.” Before giving his prepared opening statement, Calhoun stood and faced the people in the audience holding poster-sized photos of some of the 346 people who died in the 2018 and 2019 crashes. </p>



<p>“I apologize for the grief that we have caused,” he said.</p>
    
<p>Senators asked Calhoun if Boeing retaliated against employees who reported concerns and if he had ever spoken directly with any whistleblowers. He replied that he hadn’t but said he would. </p><p>The toughest line of inquiry came from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who repeatedly asked Calhoun about what he did to deserve the size of his salary. Calhoun, who has said he <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/boeing-ceo-calhoun-0abff1ccc6262ffb03f97c6a619bd1ec">plans to retire</a></span> at the end of the year, earned $32.8 million in compensation last year. </p>
    

<p>“You’re focused on exactly what you were hired to do, which is that you’re cutting corners. You are eliminating safety procedures. You are sticking it to your employees. You are cutting back jobs because you’re trying to squeeze every piece of profit you can out of this company,” Hawley said, his voice rising. “You’re strip-mining it. You’re strip-mining Boeing.”</p><p>Asked by Hawley why he had not resigned, Calhoun answered: “Senator I’m sticking this through. I’m proud of having taken the job. I’m proud of our safety record. And I am very proud of our Boeing people.”</p><p>Hawley interrupted. “You’re proud of the safety record?” he asked with incredulity. </p><p>Calhoun responded, “I am proud of every action we’ve taken.” </p><p>Hawley shot back, “Frankly sir, I think it’s a travesty that you’re still in your job.” </p><p>Hours before Calhoun arrived on Capitol Hill, the Senate panel released a 204-page report with new allegations from a whistleblower who said he worries that “nonconforming” parts — ones that could be defective or aren’t properly documented — are going into <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/boeing-max-jet-incident-crashes-f73fb7b9eaff7f6549c88e958f7b8b38">737 Max jets</a></span>. </p><p>Sam Mohawk, a quality assurance investigator at the 737 assembly plant <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/boeing-safety-quality-faa-audit-fc3a23505363800e1c6d4debd98c4d74">near Seattle</a></span>, claims Boeing hid evidence of the situation after the Federal Aviation Administration informed the company a year ago that it would inspect the plant.</p>
    

<p>“Once Boeing received such a notice, it ordered the majority of the (nonconfirming) parts that were being stored outside to be moved to another location,” Mohawk said, according to the report. “Approximately 80% of the parts were moved to avoid the watchful eyes of the FAA inspectors.”</p><p>The parts were later moved back or lost, Mohawk said. They included rudders, wing flaps and tail fins — all crucial in controlling a plane.</p><p>The FAA said it would “thoroughly investigate” claims raised in the Senate report. A Boeing spokesperson said the company got the subcommittee report late Monday night and was reviewing the claims. </p><p>The 737 Max has a troubled history.

<p>Mohawk told the Senate subcommittee that the number of unacceptable parts has exploded since production of the Max resumed following the crashes.

            Fauci was in the public eye for decades as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health,<strong> </strong>but he<strong> </strong>became a veritable household name at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as part of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, which was charged with monitoring and mitigating the spread of the virus.

            Fauci spoke frequently to the worried and bewildered American public at government news conferences, giving status updates and offering guidance on face masks, social distancing, school closures, hospitalization rates and, eventually, vaccines. Many credit him with helping the country navigate the uncharted waters of the coronavirus crisis with his medical expertise, calm demeanor and signature Brooklyn-tinged gravelly voice.

            At the same time, Fauci was navigating his own political headwinds – some from his boss, former President Donald Trump, who tried to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/19/politics/donald-trump-anthony-fauci-coronavirus/index.html">play down the threat</a> of SARS-CoV-2 even as he initiated <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/29/politics/operation-warp-speed-coronavirus-vaccine/index.html">Operation Warp Speed</a>, the $10 billion-plus public-private partnership focused on rapidly developing vaccines as well as therapeutics.

            Speaking to CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Fauci described how “painful” it was at one point to correct Trump about hydroxychloroquine to prevent Covid-19 during a news conference early in the pandemic, a move that upset some of the President’s aides.
    </p>

            But Trump’s attention was elsewhere, Fauci said: When he called the doctor to his office, the President surprised him by talking about how many people were watching the news conferences.

            As the pandemic continued, many coronavirus deniers, conspiracy theorists and antivaxxers blamed Fauci personally for struggles with school closures, mask mandates and vaccine recommendations. Even now, Fauci recently testified, he still <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/fauci-covid-19-pandemic-hearing-threats-cnntv/index.html">faces death threats</a>.

            The pandemic was not the first time Fauci found himself in the center of a political and medical maelstrom. He was in the hot seat during the HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s, when his agency spearheaded the effort to fight the widening epidemic. HIV/AIDS activists called him and the entire medical establishment out for not doing enough or moving quickly enough to help people infected with the virus.

            Yet throughout his career, Fauci seems to have taken public criticism in stride and used it, even, to build something better. It was an attitude he learned in childhood.

            “The Jesuit priests, when you thought that all of a sudden the whole world was pounding on you, they would say ‘Illegitimi non carborundum,’<em> </em>which means ‘don’t let the bastards wear you down,’ which … lately, that is a very relevant and appropriate saying,” Fauci told Gupta.

            Fauci recently sat down for a conversation with Gupta — one of the many they have shared over the years — to discuss his life’s work and his legacy.

            <strong>Dr. Sanjay Gupta:</strong> You talk about this interesting press briefing that you did. This is in March of 2020. And you had to correct the record, even if the President was talking. How challenging is that?
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxknm0fy00053b6jd3ytpzj8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            <strong>Dr. Anthony Fauci</strong>: I said to myself, “I have a responsibility to preserve my own personal integrity and a responsibility to the American public.” … So when I walked up to the podium, I said, “Here it goes!”
    </p>

            That was painful to me, to have to do that, but there was no doubt that I had to do it. I mean, it wasn’t like, “Well, maybe you should, and maybe you shouldn’t.” There was no doubt that I had to do it, because I would actually be just relinquishing my responsibility. And what happened is that the President was less upset about that than the people around him, who <em>really</em> got upset.
    </p>

            But then he called me in his office once when he wanted to ask me another question, and he was looking at three different televisions, and he says, “My God, these ratings are amazing. They’re better than cable; they’re better than network.”
    </p>

            The President — it’s no secret. I’m not divulging a secret about the President — he was very, very fixated on image and ratings. And he thought that the amount of attention that was given to the press briefings was really terrific.

            <strong>Gupta:</strong> I want to talk about the 54 years of public service — almost 40 years, as you say, as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Go back to June 5, 1981. That was a date you really talked a lot about in the book. What’s the significance of that?

            <strong>Fauci: </strong>I was in my office in the clinical center at the NIH, and I read the June 5 [<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5021a1.htm#:~:text=Twenty%20years%20ago%2C%20on%20June,homosexuals%22%3B%20two%20had%20died." target="_blank">issue of the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</a>, which described five cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia among five gay men in LA] and I looked at it and I said, “Gosh, what a curiosity. This is strange that they’re all gay men.” But maybe there was talk about using poppers or drugs to enhance your sexual experience that maybe somehow had the collateral effect of suppressing their immune system.

            But it bothered me. Boy, you really have got to suppress the immune system a lot to get pneumocystis [a serious lung infection caused by a common fungus]. … So I put it aside, saying “it’s probably a fluke, and it’s just going to disappear.”
    </p>

            The real transforming thing came one month later, in July of 1981, when <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/1265" target="_blank">the second MMWR</a> came; this time, 26 — curiously — all young, otherwise healthy gay men, not only from L.A. but from San Francisco and New York City, who presented not only with pneumocystis but with Kaposi’s sarcoma and multiple other opportunistic infections.

            I can say — retrospectively, when you try to evaluate the different landmarks in your life, in your career — reading that MMWR totally transformed my professional career because I made the decision right there, even though I had a very successful career up to that point … I said, “this is a brand new disease.  And even though I don’t know what it is, there’s no doubt it’s an infection. … And it seems to be destroying the immune system.” And here I am: boards in internal medicine, boards in infectious diseases, boards in clinical immunology. I said, “If there’s one disease that I have to study, is this disease.”

            <strong>Gupta:</strong> I don’t think many people who sort of know you from Covid realize that in many ways, you went through some of these same challenges before with HIV/AIDS. Not just new disease, trying to find new therapeutics, but the activists. What was that part of your life like?
    </p>

            <strong>Fauci:</strong> Well, naturally, people ask about the difference or similarity between the pushing back against me and the government in HIV and pushing back against the government and me as the face of Covid. … It is as different as peanuts and watermelons.
    </p>

            It just is very different because the [HIV/AIDS] activists were trying to get the attention of the authorities, the scientific authorities and the regulatory authorities, that the time-proven way of approaching the development of interventions for a new disease doesn’t work well for a disease that’s rapidly killing themselves and their friends and their loved ones.

            So they wanted a seat at the table. … So their confrontation to us was based on a good thing. I think back to <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2020/07/remembering-john-lewis-the-power-of-good-trouble/" target="_blank">John Lewis’ “good trouble”</a> versus bad trouble. They made good trouble for us because they wanted us to just put ourselves in their shoes. …

            Again, one of the best things I did in my career was to, instead of running away from them the way most of the scientific community did … I said to myself, “This can’t work, so let me put aside the theatrics and the disruption and listen to what they have to say.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clxjjc3zi000p3b6jvnp12kj6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            And what they had to say made absolutely perfect sense to me. And I said to myself, “If I were in their shoes, I would be doing exactly what they’re doing.” That’s when I invited them in to sit down with us and said “let’s start talking.” … It became such that they became an important part of the community scientific effort to address HIV with therapeutics, with prevention, with regulation, to the point now where they’re on all of our advisory committees. They’re part of the discussion. And quite frankly, many of them turned out to be some of my closest friends.

            <strong>Gupta:</strong> But just to punctuate this point, though, at that time, going back 40 years, did you feel that way, the way you’re describing it now? I mean, this idea that, “Hey, look, there might be something to be gained from these confrontations”?
    </p>

            <strong>Fauci:</strong> The thing that drove me was empathy, which has been something that has driven my motivation about medicine and about anything that I’ve done, that goes back to my family, that I describe in the book: my parents and my training in the Jesuit schools. There’s empathy for people who are in trouble and people who are suffering.
    </p>

            When you combine empathy with listening to them — just forget the screaming and the yelling. Just listen to what they’re saying. And I’ve got to tell you, it just made perfect sense to me. So my interaction and my response to them, as I often get asked, is dramatically different than someone, on the basis of no evidence, accuses you of killing people or that scene <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/video/dr-fauci-covid-hearing-marjorie-taylor-greene-src-digvid">of Marjorie Taylor Greene at the hearing</a>.

            <strong>Fauci: </strong>I’ve thought about that, and when I think about legacies — I really, honestly mean this — I will leave that to other people to decide. I know what I’ve done … with the development of drugs for HIV, with the development of the vaccine for Covid. I know that, but that’s not [for me to] say, “I want my legacy to be this,” because people are going to have different interpretations of that …

            But what I would want my legacy to be, something that I am certain of, is that I have given it 100% every single day.

I just gave everything I could for the discipline I’m in, which is science, medicine and public health. <em>That’s</em> what I’d like my legacy to be.

<li>The House Ethics Committee has identified "additional allegations" against Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) that "merit review" as part of an ongoing investigation into sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.</li>
<li>The committee is now investigating claims that Gaetz dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.</li>
<li>The Ethics Committee has difficulty in obtaining relevant information from Gaetz and others since the probe began in April 2021, amid a federal criminal sex trafficking investigation of Gaetz and a friend, Joel Greenberg.</li>
<li>The committee has determined that certain allegations merit continued review after conducting interviews with more than a dozen witnesses and examining thousands of pages of documents.</li>
<li>The committee has suspended its probes into four separate allegations of wrongdoing against Gaetz, citing the difficulty in obtaining information and the ongoing nature of the investigation.</li>

The mounting costs of Social Security and Medicare continue to weigh on the nation’s finances, along with rising interest rates, which have made it more costly for the federal government to borrow huge sums of money.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">As a result, the United States is expected to continue running large budget deficits, which is the gap between what America spends and what it receives through taxes and other revenue. The budget deficit in 2024 is projected to be $1.9 trillion, up from a forecast earlier this year of $1.6 trillion. Over the next 10 years, the annual deficit is projected to swell to $2.9 trillion by 2034. As a share of the economy, debt held by the public in 2034 will be 122 percent of gross domestic product, up from 99 percent in 2024.</p><p class="css-zry96z" aria-live="polite" role="note"><a class="css-1081t4c" href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=8WXW7">Subscribe to The Times</a> to read as many articles as you like.</p></div></div></div>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The US is working to prevent a greater war between Israel and Hezbollah, according to Amos Hochstein, a White House envoy.</li>
<li>The two sides have been engaged in near-daily clashes since October, with Hezbollah firing rockets and drones at Israeli military sites and Israel responding with airstrikes.</li>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel have regularly traded fire across the Israel-Lebanon border over the last eight months. Last week, the Lebanese group fired hundreds of rockets and drones at Israeli military sites after one of its commanders was killed.</p>
<p>Speaking after meeting with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a close ally of Hezbollah, Hochstein called for “urgent” de-escalation.</p>
<p>“We have seen an escalation over the last few weeks. And what President Biden wants to do is avoid a further escalation to a greater war,” Hochstein told reporters.</p>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<p>The US envoy had travelled to Beirut following <a href="/news/2024/6/17/us-envoy-meets-with-israeli-leaders-as-tensions-with-hezbollah-escalate">meetings in Israel</a> on Monday. Israel’s Haaretz reported that he had warned Israeli officials that continuing the Israeli-Hezbollah confrontation could lead to a “wide-scale Iranian attack”.</p>
<p>In Beirut, Hochstein said it is in “everyone’s interest” to resolve the conflict quickly and diplomatically. “That is both achievable and it is urgent.”</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<h2 id="iplomatic-framework">‘Diplomatic framework’</h2>
<p>Hochstein’s visit came Hezbollah unilaterally suspended its attacks for two days during the Eid al-Adha Muslim holiday, which began on Sunday. But that pause ended on Tuesday with Hezbollah saying that it targeted an Israeli tank with a suicide drone.</p>
<p>The Lebanese group also released a nine-minute video of what it said was footage its surveillance drones brought back from Israel. The video showed and identified military facilities in the north of the country as well as key infrastructure in Haifa – Israel’s third largest city – including a power plant and commercial port.</p>
<p>Hezbollah has said it will not halt its attacks into northern Israel unless there is a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said Hezbollah was boasting about the footage it captured from the Haifa port and threatening to attack international companies in it.</p>
<p>“We are very close to the moment of decision to change the rules against Hezbollah <a href="/features/2024/6/7/explainer-are-lebanon-and-israel-on-the-cusp-of-war">and Lebanon</a>. In an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed and Lebanon will be severely hit,” Katz wrote in a social media post on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“The State of Israel will pay a price on the front and home fronts, but with a strong and united nation, and the full power of the [Israeli military], we will restore security to the residents of the north.</p>
<p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also <a href="/news/2024/6/5/netanyahu-says-israel-prepared-for-very-intense-operation-near-lebanon">said</a> earlier this month that “one way or another, we will restore security to the north”, and his hardline nationalist coalition partners have called for an aggressive military response.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said on Monday that it killed a “central operative” in Hezbollah’s rocket division in a drone strike.</p>
<p>The US State Department said late on Monday that it is advancing a proposal to avert a large-scale conflict.</p>
<p>“There is a diplomatic framework that we believe is reachable that would resolve this conflict without a full-on war,” a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>In Beirut, Hochstein called for the adoption of the Gaza <a href="/news/2024/6/17/us-says-hamas-is-to-blame-for-ceasefire-delay-but-is-it-hamas-or-israel">ceasefire proposal</a> being pushed by Biden’s administration in the hope that it would quickly bring peace across the “Blue Line”, referring to the disputed Israel-Lebanon border.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<p>“A ceasefire in Gaza and, or, an alternative diplomatic solution could also bring the conflict across the Blue Line to an end” and allow the return of displaced civilians to southern Lebanon and northern Israel, he said.</p>
<p>Hezbollah recently said that it has carried out more than 2,100 military operations against Israel since October 8. The Lebanese group started its attacks with the outbreak of the war in Gaza in what it says is an effort to support Palestinians.</p>
<p>The Israel-Lebanon border violence has killed at least 473 people on the Lebanese side, most of them fighters but also including 92 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>
<p>Israeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country’s north.</p>

            South Korea does not legally recognize same-sex marriage but in February 2023, a South Korean court <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/21/asia/south-korea-same-sex-benefits-ruling-intl-hnk/index.html">ruled in favor</a> of a same-sex couple seeking equal health benefits.

Masigan, a Philippine Star columnist and special consultant to the Middle East Media Research Institute's (MEMRI) Chinese Media Studies project, told Fox News Digital. "Every time the Philippines makes a move, China escalates… for instance, when the Philippines adds two Coast Guard vessels, the Chinese will add six." But Masigan says his nation will not "fall into this Chinese trap," and will continue to follow international law while working to strengthen the U.S.-Australia-Philippines-Japan alliance and increase cooperation with Taiwan, Vietnam and Malaysia. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The People’s Republic of China</a> (PRC) claims roughly 90% of the South China Sea, with Philippines Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. telling the media that China is converting the region into the "Lake of China." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/timeline-clashes-between-china-philippines-south-china-sea-following-latest-ship-collision" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>A TIMELINE OF CLASHES BETWEEN CHINA AND THE PHILIPPINES IN SOUTH CHINA SEA, FOLLOWING LATEST SHIP COLLISION</strong></a></p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>A Chinese Coast Guard ship approaches a Philippine ship, foreground, causing a minor collision, in the vicinity of Second Thomas Shoal on March 5, 2024.</span> <span>(Philippine Coast Guard via AP)</span></p></div></div></div><p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. recently spelled out what Chinese control of these waterways would mean, noting, "There is no such thing as a regional issue any longer… the South China Sea is the passageway for half of the world’s trade and therefore the peace and stability of the South China Sea and the freedom of navigation of South China Sea is a world issue."  </p><p>Chinese Navy or Coast Guard ships harass Taiwanese or Vietnamese fishing boats on a near-daily basis, but since the end of 2023, Beijing has significantly turned up the heat on the Philippines. The Chinese have fired military-grade lasers and high-powered water cannons at both civilian and Philippine Coast Guard ships. Other hostile PRC actions include encircling, blocking and even ramming Philippine vessels.  </p><p>China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) now has the largest number of active warships in the world, and China’s Coast Guard, a paramilitary force with over 160 armed vessels and numerous patrol boats, has stepped up confrontations with Filipino fishermen, as well as the Philippine Coast Guard. China also makes use of a "maritime militia," fishing boats with deputized personnel equipped by the Chinese military.</p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>A Chinese Coast Guard ship uses a water cannon on a Philippine patrol ship, BRP Cabra as it approaches Second Thomas Shoal, locally known as Ayungin Shoal, in the disputed South China Sea on Dec. 10, 2023.</span> <span>(Philippine Coast Guard via AP)</span></p></div></div></div><p>President Marcos has repeatedly called on China to dial down its aggressive moves, warning that should a Philippine citizen (military or civilian) lose their life in one of these confrontations, "we would have crossed the Rubicon."  </p><p>The major area of friction is in the Spratly Island chain. These features (most of which don’t meet international law criteria to be called "islands") are claimed in totality by Beijing, as well as by Taiwan. Taiwan holds several islands but mostly pays lip service to its claims. </p><p>Taiwan is officially the Republic of China (ROC), and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/taiwan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ROC constitution</a> makes essentially the same territorial claims communist China makes. This is absurd to most in Taiwan, but should they be changed, China would accuse Taiwan of "declaring independence" and war would almost immediately follow. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/chinese-coast-guard-blocked-medical-evacuation-philippines-says-barbaric-inhumane" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CHINESE COAST GUARD BLOCKED MEDICAL EVACUATION, PHILIPPINES SAYS: 'BARBARIC AND INHUMANE'</u></strong></a></p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>A Chinese Coast Guard vessel patrols near the BRP Sierra Madre, a marooned transport ship that Philippine marines live on as a military outpost, in the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, part of the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, March 30, 2014.</span> <span>(Reuters/Erik De Castro)</span></p></div></div></div><p>Certain shoals, islets or even rocky outcroppings in the Spratly Islands are also claimed by Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines. But out of all these claimants, only China has taken significant moves to militarize the islands it holds or is building. </p><p>In 1999, a U.S.-built, World War II-era landing craft belonging to the Philippine Navy was intentionally grounded on the Second Thomas Shoal, a tiny submerged reef in the South China Sea, or the West Philippine Sea, a term favored by the Philippines. </p><p>This rusting hulk, the BRP Sierra Madre, is a symbolic outpost representing Philippine sovereignty, and a handful of Philippine marines are stationed on board. At the end of December 2023, China sent 27 vessels to encircle the Second Thomas Shoal to prevent the ship from being resupplied. </p><p>The deliberate beaching of the BRP Sierra Madre was done, the Philippines says, after China built structures on Mischief Reef, an atoll located roughly 130 nautical miles from the Philippines’ Palawan Province in the mid-1990s.  </p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>President Biden and Philippines President Ferdinand R.

In 2016, a Chinese commercial jet landed on what was once a few rocks surrounding a lagoon. </p><p>Mischief Reef is just one of several artificial islands China has built in the South China Sea; military bases from which it can enforce its "nine-dash-line." </p><p>These are nine lines drawn on a 1946 map of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/swedens-defense-chief-voices-concern-bejings-aggressive-maneuvers-south-china-sea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South China Sea</a> that claim everything from Taiwan to not far off the coast of Vietnam, and to the east, the lines encroach upon the beaches of the Philippines. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/philippines-warns-red-line-beijing-amid-heightened-tensions-south-china-sea" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PHILIPPINES WARNS OF ‘RED LINE’ WITH BEIJING AMID HEIGHTENED TENSIONS IN SOUTH CHINA SEA</strong></a></p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Chinese President Xi Jinping waves during an event at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Oct. 23, 2022.</span> <span>(AP Photo/Andy Wong, File)</span></p></div></div></div><p>In 2023, China added yet another line to what it calls "inseparable parts of China." It’s now the "ten-dash-line," which is raising serious concerns about Beijing’s ambitions. </p><p>"An important issue with China’s multiplying dashed lines is that it’s not clear what they include," Taipei Times columnist Michael Turton told Fox News Digital, echoing sentiments common among China watchers. "Will 10 lines become 20 over the next few years? Will China claim the dark side of the moon, now that they’ve landed a probe there?" Turton asks. </p><p>Dean Karalekas, author of "Civil-Military Relations in Taiwan: Identity and Transformation<i>," </i>told Fox News Digital, "Taiwan is the prize. But China’s military hasn’t tasted combat in decades." Bullying the relatively militarily weak Philippines, however, "could be how the untested Chinese Navy acquires a bit of combat experience," </p><p>Karalekas says, "Beijing wonders whether America has the stomach for another war. A good litmus test for this is whether the U.S. Navy responds to a clear casus belli against the Philippines – a U.S. treaty ally with whom there is no ambiguity – strategic or otherwise." </p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Fishing boats carrying activists and volunteers belonging to a nongovernment coalition called Atin Ito, Tagalog for This is Ours, pass by waters off Palauig Point, Zambales province, northwestern Philippines as they head toward Scarborough Shoal on May 15, 2024.</span> <span>(Philippine Coast Guard via AP)</span></p></div></div></div><p>If a Chinese move against the Philippines doesn’t trigger a military response from Washington despite its clear treaty obligations there, "then Beijing may interpret this to mean that the U.S. is unlikely to go to bat for Taiwan, especially now, with a Biden administration that just projects weakness." </p><p>Karalekas noted that would allow "China to gauge America’s response time, observe their tactics, and develop invaluable experience fighting the U.S. Navy, in a low-stakes conflict they can easily withdraw from without losing face."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-sends-warplanes-boats-taiwan-phone-call-xi-biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CHINA SENDS WARPLANES, BOATS AROUND TAIWAN FOLLOWING PHONE CALL BETWEEN XI AND BIDEN</u></strong></a></p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Filipino soldiers on Mavulis Island during a trip by the chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, in Batanes, Philippines, June 29, 2023.

The U.S., Philippine, Japanese, and Australian militaries are discussing closer cooperation. The U.S. now has access to nine temporary bases in the Philippines (and more are being built on the Philippine islands closest to Taiwan). Taiwan and the Philippines have been working on training cooperation since 2021. In April this year, Taiwan confirmed that it plans to sign a more comprehensive agreement with the Philippines to strengthen mutual maritime security.<strong> </strong>On June 15, Taiwan launched a new, 4000-ton Coast Guard vessel that comes equipped with three high-pressure water cannons with a range of 120 meters to perform "dispersal tasks," Taiwanese authorities said. </p><p>There is no South China Sea <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/nato" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version of NATO</a> and the fact that Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam all have overlapping claims, experts agree, does play into China’s divide-and-conquer strategy. But in comments to Fox News Digital, MERMI’s Anna Mahjar-Barducci noted that while the Philippine Navy "monitors" Vietnam’s island-building activities in waters within Manila’s exclusive economic zone, her nation’s military is focused on China. </p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Philippine troops watch a Philippine Coast Guard ship as they secure an area at the Philippine-occupied Thitu island, locally called Pag-asa island, on Dec. 1, 2023, in the disputed South China Sea.</span> <span>(AP Photo/Aaron Favila, File)</span></p></div></div></div><p>She cited Philippine Navy spokesman Commodore Roy Vincent Trinidad who said, "Vietnam does not initiate illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions against us, unlike China." Philippine Coast Guard spokesman Jay Tarriela agrees, noting that "Vietnam focuses on minding their own affairs… They do not engage in harassing our fishermen or illegally deploying Coast Guard vessels and maritime militia in the waters surrounding our occupied maritime features."</p><p>Earlier this month, the Chinese Coast Guard dumped food, meant for the marines aboard the Sierra Madre<i>,</i> into the ocean. When asked to comment on the situation on the Second Thomas Shoal, Chinese officials parroted the party line: that the area belongs to China and the Philippine ship must be towed away. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</u></strong></a></p><p>The U.S. is reportedly considering giving the Philippines military drones, transport aircraft, and other defense systems. President Marcos, who visited Washington in April, told the press that while he does not believe a full-scale conflict with China is imminent or inevitable, he wants Beijing to understand that there is a red line, which once crossed, will result in a military response. </p><p>This military response may happen faster than previously thought. On Monday, July 17, a Philippine sailor reportedly sustained severe injuries after Chinese ships once again blocked a Philippines resupply mission to the BRP Sierra Madre. The details of the incident are not fully clear, but it appears Chinese ships may have again rammed Philippine vessels, and in what reportedly is a new tactic, Chinese ships also attempted to tow away Philippine vessels. How seriously the sailor was injured is unknown, but "red lines" may have already been crossed.</p><p>On Tuesday, State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller issued a statement condemning China's actions over its actions on BRP Sierra Madre, calling the actions "escalatory and irresponsible." His statement reiterated that "The United States reaffirms that Article IV of the 1951 United States-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty extends to armed attacks on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft – including those of its Coast Guard – anywhere in the South China Sea."</p></div>  </div>
