    <div><section class="content__body"><p>The first tropical storm of the Atlantic season formed over the Gulf of Mexico Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said. The tropical storm has been <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-names-list-2024-season/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">named Alberto</a></span>.</p><p>Forecasters said the storm could bring heavy rains, coastal flooding and gusty winds to the Texas and northeastern Mexico coasts through Thursday. Alberto is likely to reach the Mexican coast late Wednesday or early Thursday. On Wednesday morning, the National Hurricane Center said the storm system was "lumbering" towards the region at about 8 miles per hour. The National Weather Service <a href="https://x.com/NWSSanAntonio/status/1803407097302020395" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> early rains had begun in Texas and that rain could impact the I-35 highway later in the day. </p><p>At 10 a.m. local time, the National Weather Service said that the system was officially a named tropical storm. </p>    
  <p>A Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas coast from the San Luis Pass south to the mouth of the Rio Grande and the northeastern coast of Mexico from the Rio Grande mouth to Puerto de Altamira.</p><p>Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches are possible across northeast Mexico into southern Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches, and they'd probably result in "considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico," meteorologists said. A storm surge as high as four feet might hit parts of the Texas coast.</p>

    </p>
<p>The heaviest rain is expected in south Corpus Christi, with forecasters predicting between 6 and 10 inches. Storm surge is also anticipated in Galveston and Surfside Beach, where there is already major flooding. </p><p>The National Weather Service said on Wednesday morning that overall rain totals have decreased. Most areas will likely see between 1 to 3 inches of rain, the forecasting center said, but local flooding of 4 inches or more is possible. A flood watch remains in effect until Thursday. </p><p>The disturbance was "quite large" early Wednesday, the hurricane center noted, with tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 415 miles to the north of the system's center.</p><p>As of 4 a.m. CDT, the center was some 315 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas and moving west-northwest at 8 mph with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. </p>

<p>The hurricane center upgraded what had been the season's first tropical storm watch to a tropical storm warning at 4 a.m. CT on Tuesday. Three hours later, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for the parts of the country's northeastern coast, south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Puerto de Altamira, replacing the tropical storm watch previously in effect there.

                                        <p>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-north-korea-putin-kim-27b5d9f1a4e265d0b6e3f4e266ea753e">an agreement Wednesday</a></span> that pledges mutual aid if either country faces “aggression,” a strategic pact that comes as both face escalating standoffs with the West.</p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-north-korea-putin-kim-agreement-7221909867dbb999de8adb23604e3c79">Details of the deal</a></span> were not immediately clear, but it could mark the strongest connection between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War. Both leaders described it as a major upgrade of their relations, covering security, trade, investment, cultural and humanitarian ties. </p><p>The summit came as Putin visited North Korea for the first time in 24 years and the U.S. and its allies expressed <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-us-munitions-ukraine-war-7091eaba254b680888a9b1ec8a68135f">growing concerns</a></span> over a possible arms arrangement in which Pyongyang provides Moscow with badly needed munitions for its <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">war in Ukraine</a></span>, in exchange for economic assistance and technology transfers that could enhance the threat posed by Kim’s nuclear weapons and missile program.</p>
    

<p>From North Korea, Putin traveled to Vietnam, where he exited his plane onto a red carpet and briefly shook hands with dignitaries while soldiers in white dress uniforms stood at attention. In Hanoi, Putin is scheduled to meet with Vietnam’s most powerful politician, Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, and <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-new-president-to-lam-1c7c8e83a5c5fb1c92192f1121c50189">new President To Lam</a></span>, as the Russian leader seeks to strengthen ties with a longtime partner.</p>



<p>During Putin’s visit to North Korea, Kim said the two countries had a “fiery friendship,” and that the deal was their “strongest ever treaty,” putting the relationship at the level of an alliance. He vowed full support for Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p>
    
<p>Putin called it a “breakthrough document” reflecting shared desires to move relations to a higher level.</p><p>North Korea and the former Soviet Union signed a treaty in 1961 that experts say necessitated Moscow’s military intervention if the North came under attack. The deal was discarded after the collapse of the USSR, replaced by one in 2000 that offered weaker security assurances. It wasn’t immediately clear if the new deal provides a similar level of protection as the 1961 treaty.</p>
    

<p>Kim met Putin at the airport, where the two shook hands, hugged twice and rode together in a limousine. The huge motorcade rolled through the capital’s brightly lit streets, where buildings were decorated with giant Russian flags and portraits of Putin.</p><p>After spending the night at a state guest house, Putin was welcomed Wednesday morning in a ceremony at the city’s main square, filled with what appeared to be tens of thousands of spectators, including children with balloons and people in coordinated T-shirts of the red, white and blue national colors of both countries. Crowds lining the streets chanted “Welcome Putin,” and waved flowers and flags.</p><p>Putin and Kim saluted an honor guard and walked across a red carpet. Kim introduced key members of his leadership, including Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui; top aide and ruling party secretary Jo Yong Won; and the leader’s powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong.</p><p>At their talks, Putin thanked Kim for North Korea’s support in Ukraine, part of what he said was a “fight against the imperialist hegemonistic policies of the U.S. and its satellites against the Russian Federation.”</p>
    

<p>Putin praised ties that he traced to the Soviet army fighting the Japanese military on the Korean Peninsula at the end of World War II, and Moscow’s support for Pyongyang during the Korean War.</p><p>What kind of support was pledged in the agreement was not spelled out. Explanations of the agreement by the leaders did not specify what the “mutual assistance” would be in the event of aggression against either country — troops, materiel or some other sort of aid.</p><p>Kim has used similar language before, consistently saying North Korea supports what he describes as a just action to protect Russia’s interests and blaming the crisis on the West’s “hegemonic policy.”</p><p>North Korea is under heavy U.N. Security Council sanctions over its weapons program, while Russia also faces sanctions by the U.S. and its Western partners over its invasion of Ukraine.</p>
    

<p>U.S. and South Korean officials accuse the North of providing Russia with artillery, missiles and other military equipment for use in Ukraine, possibly in return for key military technologies and aid. On Tuesday, a U.S. State Department spokesman said that in recent months, Washington has seen North Korea “unlawfully transfer dozens of ballistic missiles and over 11,000 containers of munitions to aid Russia’s war effort.”</p><p>Both Pyongyang and Moscow deny accusations of weapons transfers, which would violate multiple U.N. Security Council sanctions that Russia previously endorsed.</p><p>Along with China, Russia has provided political cover for Kim’s efforts to advance his nuclear arsenal, repeatedly blocking U.S.-led efforts to impose fresh U.N. sanctions on the North over its weapons tests.</p>
    

<p>In March, a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/un-us-north-korea-russia-sanctions-monitoring-72f8cbac116dea7c795d9a3357fc45f3">Russian veto in the Security Council</a></span> ended monitoring of U.N. sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear program, prompting Western accusations that Moscow is seeking to avoid scrutiny as it buys weapons from Pyongyang.</p><p>Putin’s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters in Pyongyang the leaders exchanged gifts. Putin presented Kim with a Russian-made Aurus limousine and other gifts, including a tea set and a naval officer’s dagger. Ushakov said Kim’s presents to Putin included artwork depicting the Russian leader.</p><p>Later, Putin and Kim attended a concert featuring marching soldiers, weapons-throwing, dancing and patriotic songs. Putin clapped and spoke to Kim through a translator, saying something that made both laugh.</p><p>The Russian leader also visited the Сhurch of the Life-Giving Trinity in Pyongyang and gave a Trinity icon to the Orthodox church.</p><p>At a dinner before he left for Vietnam, Putin cited a proverb that said “a close neighbor is better than a distant relative,” while Kim toasted the “immortality of the invincible DPRK-Russia relations that are the envy of the world.”</p><p>The Kremlin’s website said the leaders signed an agreement to build a road bridge on their border, and another on cooperation in health care, medical education and science. Putin also said that Russia would not rule out developing military-technical cooperation with North Korea.</p><p>In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Putin’s visit illustrates how Russia tries, “in desperation, to develop and to strengthen relations with countries that can provide it with what it needs to continue the war of aggression that it started against Ukraine.”</p><p>Koo Byoungsam, spokesperson of South Korea’s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said the Seoul government was still interpreting the results of the summit, including what Russia’s response might be if the North comes under attack.</p><p>China is North Korea’s biggest ally and economic lifeline, accounting for most of the country’s trade. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said high-level exchanges between Moscow and Pyongyang are “bilateral arrangements between two sovereign states,” without giving a specific assessment of the agreements.</p><p>Sam Greene of the Center for European Policy Analysis said Putin’s trip to Pyongyang is an indication of how beholden he is to some other countries since invading Ukraine. Previously, “it was always the North Koreans coming to Russia. It wasn’t the other way around,” he said.</p><p>The trip is a good way to make “the West nervous” by demonstrating Moscow has interests and clout beyond Ukraine, Greene added.</p><p>The North could also seek to increase labor exports to Russia and other activities to get foreign currency in defiance of U.N. sanctions, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank run by South Korea’s main spy agency. There will likely be talks about expanding cooperation in agriculture, fisheries and mining and further promoting Russian tourism to North Korea, the institute said.</p><p>Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, with the pace of both Kim’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-missile-test-kim-jong-un-tensions-89bbe080f9670093a4d9b47e66fd65fc">weapons tests and combined military exercises</a></span> involving the U.S., South Korea and Japan intensifying in a tit-for-tat cycle.

<ol>
<li><strong>Louisiana becomes the first state</strong> to pass a law requiring public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments.</li>
<li><strong>The legislation is a new development</strong>, as no other state has previously required the display of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms.</li>
<li><strong>The law does not specify</strong> how the Ten Commandments should be displayed, leaving it up to individual schools to decide.</li>
<li><strong>The move is likely controversial</strong>, as similar displays have been challenged in the past for violating the separation of church and state.</li>

            Though Barrett acknowledged in her opinion that “tradition has a legitimate role to play in constitutional adjudication,” the Trump nominee said that “the court’s laser-like focus on the history of this single restriction misses the forest for the trees” and sought to poke holes in the history and tradition-first route taken by Thomas and the other conservative justices who agreed with his legal rationale.

In <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/politics/supreme-court-guns-second-amendment-new-york-bruen/index.html">New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v.

            But there were no gun laws on the books at the nation’s founding that dealt explicitly with domestic violence. And so to uphold the federal law, the court will have to likely have to at least explain how that standard applies to modern laws.

            When Thomas issued his majority decision in Bruen two years ago, Barrett joined Thomas’ opinion in full. But she also penned a brief concurrence to highlight the “limits on the permissible use of history” in deciding cases. Among them, she said, was identifying the historical date needed to assess whether a restriction was constitutional.

            In the months and years following the court’s decision in Bruen, the “history and tradition” framework has led judges across the US to strike down various gun restrictions while also perplexing some jurists who have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/29/politics/federal-judge-supreme-court-gun-rights/index.html">noted the obstacles that accompany the new rule.</a>

            But in a striking concurrence that captured support from both liberal and conservative justices, Justice Elena Kagan asserted that the court’s historic analysis need not end with the late-18th century. Instead, Kagan wrote, the court could look at more modern times – a “continuing tradition” to decide the constitutionality of a government policy.

            In the trademark dispute, Vidal v. Elster, Thomas’ legal reasoning for upholding the section of the Lanham Act at issue broke new ground: It was, Sotomayor wrote, the first time the court had taken the history and tradition approach to decide a free speech controversy.

<p>The Houthis have launched dozens of military operations against ships since November, using drones, missiles and explosive-laden boats. The group initially said it would target ships linked to Israel but later expanded that to ships it said were linked to the US and some allies.</p>
<p>While most of the attacks have not resulted in deaths, an assault on a Barbados-flagged ship <a href="/news/2024/3/6/suspected-houthi-attack-ship-gulf-of-aden-yemen">killed three</a> sailors in March.</p>
<p>Another attack on a Ukrainian-owned vessel last week set the ship ablaze and <a href="/news/2024/6/14/one-sailor-injured-merchant-ship-on-fire-after-houthi-missile-attack">severely injured</a> one crew member.</p>
<p>In their statement, the shipping industry groups also called for the release of the crew members of the Galaxy Leader, a cargo ship seized by the Houthis in November.</p>

            Those prospects took a turn for the worse Tuesday, when Hezbollah flaunted a 9-minute video filmed by a drone showing civilian and military locations in and around one of Israel’s largest cities, Haifa.

The achievement caps Nvidia’s rise from a respected maker of video game hardware to the purveyor of one of tech’s hottest commodities: specialized AI chips. The pivot has seen Nvidia dramatically transform its fortunes in a matter of years, growing from a <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/" aria-label="market capitalization">market capitalization </a>of around $16 billion in 2016 to just under $800 billion towards the end of 2021 before dropping to around $300 billion in 2022 amid <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-is-down-57-should-you-buy-right-now" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-is-down-57-should-you-buy-right-now" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-is-down-57-should-you-buy-right-now" aria-label="poor demand">poor demand</a> for gaming chips and a wider rout on U.S. stock markets. The boom in generative artificial intelligence, kickstarted by the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022, has helped propel Nvidia to new heights as demand for its specialized AI chips soared. Since then, the company’s value has multiplied from around $400 billion in late 2022 to $1 trillion by mid 2023, $2 trillion by early 2024 and $3 trillion by the middle of 2024 on a near vertical climb. Nvidia shares are up more than 170% this year alone and its stratospheric growth shows little sign of stopping as tech firms duel it out to dominate the nascent market for AI.</p>
