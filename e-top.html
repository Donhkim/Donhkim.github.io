<p>Defense attorneys will argue that the disbarred lawyer who served prison time is out to get the former president and cannot be believed. </p>
    

<p>Two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that Cohen is expected to take the stand Monday. The people could not discuss the matter publicly and and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Trump’s lawyers complained after Cohen this week wore a shirt featuring a figure resembling the former president behind bars in a social media video. They have argued it’s unfair Trump is under a gag order that prevents him from speaking publicly about witnesses while Cohen has continued to post about Trump on social media.</p>
    
<p>“It’s becoming a problem every single day that President Trump is not allowed to respond to this witness but this witness is allowed to continue to talk,” defense attorney Todd Blanche said.</p><p>Merchan told prosecutors they should inform Cohen “that the judge is asking him to refrain from making any more statements” about the case or about Donald Trump. Prosecutors told the judge they had already requested that Cohen and other witnesses not talk about the case, but had no direct means of controlling their behavior.</p>

Trump was never charged with any crime related to that federal investigation.</p><p>Trump, who was visibly angry during much of Daniels’ testimony, chatted frequently with his lawyers and read through a stack of papers on the table in front of him as jurors heard from witnesses including AT&amp;T and Verizon workers, who authenticated phone records. </p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

Despite all the drama, in the end, the trial is about money changing hands — business transactions — and whether those payments were made to illegally influence the 2016 election.</p>
    

<p>Back on the witness stand Friday morning was Madeleine Westerhout, a former Trump White House aide. Prosecutors used Westerhout’s testimony to detail the process by which Trump got personal mail — including checks to sign — while in the White House. It’s relevant because that’s how he received and signed the checks that reimbursed Cohen for the payment to Daniels, prosecutors say.</p><p>Westerhout testified that Trump was “very upset” when The Wall Street Journal published a 2018 story about the hush money deal with Daniels.</p><p>“My understanding was that he knew it would be hurtful to his family,” Westerhout said, though she acknowledged she didn’t recall him saying so specifically. The answer, elicited by Trump lawyer Susan Necheles, goes to the defense’s argument that Daniels was paid to stay silent in order to protect Trump’s family, not his campaign.</p>
    

<p>Daniels’ story of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump was a crucial building block for prosecutors, who are seeking to show that the Republican and his allies buried unflattering stories in the waning weeks of the 2016 presidential election in an effort to <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-opening-stormy-daniels-6beee9b99114898ee0dd60185d43bac5">illegally influence the race.</a></span></p><p>Over more than 7½ hours of testimony, Daniels relayed in graphic detail what she says happened after the two met at a 2006 celebrity golf outing at Lake Tahoe where sponsors included the adult film studio where she worked. Daniels explained how she felt surprise, fear and discomfort, even as she consented to sex with Trump.</p><p>During combative cross-examination, Trump’s lawyers sought to paint Daniels as a liar and extortionist who’s trying to take down the former president after drawing money and fame from her claims.</p><p>After Daniels left the witness stand Thursday, Trump’s attorneys pushed for a mistrial over the level of tawdry details she provided, but Judge Juan M.

            NOAA’s severe space weather watch suggests the storm could trigger numerous effects for life on Earth, possibly affecting the power grid as well as satellite and high frequency radio communications. Here’s what that means for technology users.

            The solar activity NOAA’s talking about involves the release of energy from the sun that travels through space and eventually reaches Earth.

            When that radiation hits the magnetic sphere surrounding the planet, it causes fluctuations in <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/ionosphere#:~:text=The%20Ionosphere%20is%20part%20of,used%20for%20communication%20and%20navigation." target="_blank">the ionosphere</a>, a layer of the upper atmosphere.

            Those changes can directly affect satellites and other spacecraft in orbit, altering their orientation or <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/nesc/understanding-the-potential-dangers-of-spacecraft-charging/" target="_blank">potentially knocking out</a> their electronics.

            Moreover, the changes to the ionosphere can block or degrade radio transmissions trying to pass through the atmosphere to reach satellites. And they can also prevent radio transmissions from successfully bouncing off the ionosphere — which some radio operators normally do to increase the range of their signals.

            Since GPS satellites depend on signals penetrating the ionosphere, the geomagnetic disturbance scientists are expecting could affect that critical technology used by planes, ocean-going vessels, and in the agriculture and oil and gas industries. And it could affect <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/impacts/hf-radio-communications" target="_blank">shortwave radio transmissions</a> used by ships and aircraft, emergency management agencies, the military and even ham radio operators, all of whom rely on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency" target="_blank">high frequency </a>radio airwaves that NOAA says could be scattered by the storm.

            Consumer wireless networks rely on different radio frequencies than the high frequency band, so it appears unlikely that the storm will directly affect cellular service. The GPS features on your phone also typically use a mix of pure GPS and cellular tower-based location tracking, so even if GPS signals are disrupted, phone users may still be able to maintain a rough location fix.

            So long as the underlying electrical infrastructure that supports wireless networks remains unaffected, even an extreme space weather event should result in “minimal direct impact to public safety line of-sight radio and commercial cellular services … and no first-order impact to consumer electronic devices,” according to researchers <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014SW001095" target="_blank">summarizing</a> the findings of a 2010 study of extreme space weather conducted by NOAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

            Still, many wireless carriers providers already maintain backup power generators and mobile cellular towers that they can deploy in the event of a natural disaster or other major incident.

            The judge who presided over Bannon’s trial previously agreed to let him hold off from serving his sentence while his appeal played out. In its ruling Friday, the three-judge appeals panel gave Bannon time to appeal its ruling to the full DC-based appeals court before it formally notifies the trial judge that the conviction was upheld.

            Bannon could also turn directly to the Supreme Court for additional appeals, possibly further delaying when he needs to start serving his prison term.

            In the DC Circuit’s new ruling, Judge Bradley Garcia, an appointee of President Joe Biden, backed the trial judge’s exclusion of an advice-of-counsel defense, as Bannon had claimed he had rebuffed the subpoena because of supposed executive privilege concerns expressed to him by his lawyer.

            “This exact ‘advice of counsel’ defense is no defense at all,” Garcia wrote, noting that the contempt law only required proof that Bannon “deliberately and intentionally” did not respond to the subpoena.

            The appeals court noted that “the communications from former President Trump’s counsel” that Bannon had tried to rely on to defend his conduct did not purport “to authorize Bannon’s refusal to produce any documents or appear for his deposition.”
    </p>

            The DC Circuit also rejected Bannon’s argument that the House select committee that investigated the January 6 insurrection was improperly formed.

            Bannon is one of two former members of Trump’s inner circle who faced prosecution for not participating in the House January 6 probe. The second, former Trump White House aide <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/19/politics/peter-navarro-jail-contempt-of-congress/index.html">Peter Navarro</a>, is currently serving a four-month prison sentence for his 2023 conviction.

            When the now-defunct House panel sought documents and testimony from Bannon in 2021, it pointed to alleged communications between Bannon and Trump in the days leading up to the January 6 Capitol attack, as well as comments Bannon made on his podcast the day before the riot that “all hell is going to break loose tomorrow.”

While that probe is ongoing, he said, "no determination has been made as to whether the deputy's actions were justified or not." The deputy has been placed on administrative leave.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"What we do know at this time is that the deputy did announce himself, not once but twice," Aden said. "Mr. Fortson's comments indicate that he did acknowledge it was law enforcement at the door and he arrived at the door with a firearm in his hand. The deputy knocked on the correct door, he did not cover the peephole or otherwise obscured its view in any way."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">But Fortson's family reiterated their belief that authorities went to the wrong door.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"We remain adamant that the police had the wrong apartment as Roger was on the phone with his girlfriend for a substantial amount of time leading up to the shooting, and no one else was in the apartment," Fortson's family said in a statement following the release of the footage.</p><h2 class="RxNCg PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq">What the bodycam footage shows</h2><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Deputies responded last Friday to an apartment after receiving a call for "a disturbance in progress," Aden said in a previous statement.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"Hearing sounds of a disturbance, (a deputy) reacted in self-defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun and after the deputy had identified himself as law enforcement," the sheriff said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"The deputy shot the man, who later succumbed to his injuries," said the sheriff. The deputy involved in the shooting has not been identified by officials.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The bodycam footage, dated May 3, begins at roughly 4:28 p.m. with a deputy arriving at what appears to be an apartment complex.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">A woman at the complex is heard telling the deputy there was a disturbance in apartment 1401 and that it was "getting out of hand."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The same woman tells the deputy she previously walked by the apartment and heard yells and "a slap," but added she wasn't sure where it came from.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The deputy takes the elevator to the fourth floor and knocks on a door three times. The apartment number "1401" is visible in the footage. He announces himself twice, saying, "Sheriff's office, open the door." There is nothing heard on the footage from inside the apartment.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Within seconds of the apartment's door opening, the deputy says "Step back" and is then seen firing his weapon. Fortson is seen standing at the door with his hands down and what appears to be a lowered firearm in his right hand. He immediately falls to the floor as the deputy fires. At least five shots are heard.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">While Fortson is on the floor, the deputy yells "Drop the gun" twice. Fortson is heard saying, "It's over there," and then, "I don't have it."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The deputy continues to point his weapon at Fortson and tells him not to move, while Fortson remains on the floor. The deputy continues pointing his weapon at Fortson while calling for EMS.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Deputies communicated with dispatch that Fortson had been shot six times with multiple gunshot wounds to the chest with one exit wound, according to police dispatch calls, obtained by CNN affiliate WEAR.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Fortson's family said after the video's release, "It is very troubling that the deputy gave no verbal commands and shot multiple times within a split second of the door being opened, killing Roger."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"As the officer didn't tell Roger to drop the weapon before shooting, was the officer trained to give verbal warnings? Did the officer try to initiate life-saving measures? Was the officer trained to deal with law-abiding citizens who are registered gun owners?" their statement added.</p><h2 class="RxNCg PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq">Footage released from FaceTime call during shooting</h2><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Later Thursday, Crump also released nearly four minutes of the FaceTime call he says Fortson was on with his girlfriend when he was shot.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The video shows what appears to be the ceiling of an apartment as a man - presumably Fortson - can be heard groaning and saying, "I can't breathe." Another man - presumably the deputy - tells him: "Do not move. Stop movin'."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The deputy can then be heard saying, "Hang on man, we've got an ambulance comin' for you. Don't move."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Presumably speaking to others, the deputy then says, "We're good. He had a gun since he opened the door." The deputy is heard shouting but much of it is inaudible.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Another person can later be heard detailing Fortson's wounds saying, "We've got three gunshot wounds, one exit," before another voice says, "Yeah, he's shot up."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Eventually, someone is heard saying Fortson has six gunshot wounds. Fortson was pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><h2 class="RxNCg PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq">Fortson was playing video games, family attorney says</h2><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In their earlier news conference Thursday, Crump and Fortson's mother described him as a responsible young man and a patriot who had long dreamed of serving in the US Air Force.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"To the sheriff's department that took my gift ... I need you guys to tell the truth about my son. I need you to get his reputation right," Fortson's mother said.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"I know my son did not do anything to you guys. If he scared you, or if you guys wasn't trained properly, I apologize," she said. "But please clean my baby's reputation."</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Fortson entered active duty in November 2019 and was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron, according to a statement from the Air Force, which noted the shooting occurred at the airman's off-base residence.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is "closely" following the reports of the shooting, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy"><b class="cXscX">ALSO SEE:</b><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://6abc.com/okaloosa-county-sheriffs-office-acron-cop-florida-deputy-jesse-hernandez-shooting/14432563/" target="_blank"> Okaloosa County deputy fires gun at patrol car with person inside after mistaking acorn for gunshot | VIDEO</a></p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Crump said the 23-year-old had been home for about 30 minutes and playing video games prior to the shooting.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Fortson heard two separate knocks at the door and when no one could be seen through the peephole, he retrieved his gun, Crump said, citing Fortson's girlfriend. Crump said Fortson's gun was legally owned.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The girlfriend said law enforcement responded to the wrong apartment, and there was no disturbance there at the time, Crump said. Fortson was alone at the time, Crump said, citing Fortson's girlfriend.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">"(Fortson) was on the phone with his girlfriend in the apartment by himself with his dog," Crump told CNN's Jake Tapper Thursday evening.

    <p>Here are five key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has stated that it will "take time" for people to "really feel better" despite the economy emerging from recession, with figures showing a 0.6% growth in the first quarter of the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UK economy had previously shrunk in the second half of last year, but has since shown "real momentum" according to Mr Sunak. However, he admitted that there is "more work to do".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The economy grew 0.6% between January and March, exceeding analysts' forecasts of 0.4% growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Labour and the Liberal Democrats have responded critically, with Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves stating that despite the economic growth, "working people are still worse off" after 14 years of economic chaos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The growth is attributed to an increase in the production of goods and services, measured by gross domestic product (GDP), which rose by more than expected in the first three months of the year.</p>

                                        Opal Sandy was born deaf as a result of auditory neuropathy, a condition that disrupts the way sound is conveyed to the brain from the inner ear. But at 18 months, the UK toddler can now "hear almost perfectly after groundbreaking surgery that took just 16 minutes," the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/may/09/uk-toddler-has-hearing-restored-in-world-first-gene-therapy-trial" target="_blank"><em>Guardian</em></a> reports. Auditory neuropathy can be caused by a fault in the OTOF gene, which emits a protein that enables cells to communicate with the auditory nerve that connects the inner ear (cochlea) to the brain. Opal became the first person to take part in a new gene therapy trial just before her first birthday. She received an infusion containing a working copy of the gene in her right ear and a cochlear implant in her left, the <a href="https://youtu.be/oRgjPiShACA?si=gns-8HBHoM1YT4dQ" target="_blank">BBC</a> reports.

                                        The initial results are "better than I hoped or expected," showing "a potential cure" for deafness caused by OTOF mutations, says Dr. Manohar Bance, one of the UK's leading otologists and chief investigator for the trial, per the <em>Guardian</em>. With Opal, the results are "very spectacular—so close to normal hearing restoration," he adds. The toddler began responding to sounds within three weeks of the injection. She now "has functional hearing in her treated right ear and no longer requires the use of a cochlear implant in her left," per <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/regeneron-gene-therapy-baby-girl-deaf-opal-sandy-1898883" target="_blank"><em>Newsweek</em></a>. Her "gobsmacked" parents, meanwhile, have to contend with her making as much noise as possible, the <em>Guardian</em> reports.

                                        Positive results have also been seen in a second child who's undergone the same therapy, known as DB-OTO. "It was quite spectacular and a bit awe-inspiring really," says Bance. Officials are recruiting more deaf children in the UK, Spain, and the US to take part in the CHORD trial, sponsored by US biotech company Regeneron, to include 18 children total. All participants will be monitored for five years. Opal received only a low dose of gene therapy. Two other children will receive the same dose in one ear, while three children will receive a higher dose. If all goes well, other children will receive doses in both ears. Bance notes the trial is "just the beginning of gene therapies," which could potentially <a href="https://www.newser.com/story/316441/doctors-say-gene-therapy-cured-2-of-cancer.html">treat or cure</a> <a href="https://www.newser.com/story/328321/at-35m-this-might-be-priciest-fda-approved-drug-ever.html">a variety</a> <a href="https://www.newser.com/story/342128/this-treatment-could-be-a-big-first-for-genetic-diseases.html">of diseases</a>.

    <p class="AudioEnhancement-description">AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on a plane that skidded off a runway in Senegal.</p>
    
</div><p>Passengers jumped down the emergency slides at night while flames engulfed one side of the aircraft and screams were heard all around, recounted Malian musician Cheick Siriman Sissoko, who filmed the passengers’ ordeal on his phone. </p>
    

<p>“I saw my life flash before my eyes,” he said. “I thought about my mother, my wife, my kids,” Sissoko, 39, told The Associated Press from the hotel where passengers were recovering from the shock.</p>



<p>“Only the slide on one side opened, so there was complete panic during the evacuation,” he added.</p><p>Ibrahim Diallo, 20, a Malian citizen aboard of the flight, said the plane had attempted to take off earlier that night but failed. </p>
    
<p>“The pilot told us everything was under control and that we’re going to try to take off again,” he told the AP. “The second time, smoke started coming from one of the wings.”</p><p>Boeing referred all request for comment to the airlines. “Carriers operate and maintain their airplanes for upwards of 30 to 40 years,” its statement said. “We will provide any requested support to our customer.”</p><p>Air Sénégal posted a statement on the social media platform X, saying that flights between Dakar and Bamako were rescheduled, but did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
    

<p>It was the third incident involving a Boeing airplane this week.

<p>The Aviation Safety Network, which tracks airline accidents, described the plane in Senegal’s crash as a Boeing 737-38J, an aircraft that was delivered in the 1990s. The network published photos on X of the damaged plane in a grassy field, surrounded by fire suppressant foam. One engine appeared to have broken apart and a wing was also damaged, according to the photos. </p><p>The network is part of the Flight Safety Foundation, a nonprofit group that aims to promote safe air travel and tracks accidents.</p>
