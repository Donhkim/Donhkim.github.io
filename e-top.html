<ol>
<li>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the killing of at least 45 people in a displaced Palestinians camp in Rafah as "a tragic accident".</li>
<li>The strike, carried out on Sunday night, was targeted at a Hamas compound, according to the Israeli military, and was meant to eliminate a Hamas commander and another senior official.</li>
<li>However, the blast and subsequent fires killed at least 45 people, including 23 women, children, and older people, with 249 people wounded, according to the Gaza health ministry.</li>
<li>Prime Minister Netanyahu has accused Hamas of hiding among the civilian population, saying that "every uninvolved civilian who is hurt is a tragedy" for Israel, but "a strategy" for Hamas.</li>
<li>The incident comes at a sensitive time, three days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt its offensive in the city, and as diplomats aim to restart negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas.</li>

    <div><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said Monday that the killing of dozens of people in a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah was “a tragic accident.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">His comments came at a particularly delicate time, just three days after the International Court of Justice appeared to order Israel to immediately halt its offensive in the city and as diplomats were <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/25/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostage-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">aiming to restart</a> negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas at some point in the next week.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Israel said the strike on Sunday night killed two Hamas officials, but the civilian deaths generated instant condemnation, likely making it harder for Israel to defend its view that the ambiguity of the court order allowed it to continue its campaign in Rafah.</p><div class="css-1dv1kvn"><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Mr. Netanyahu said in a speech to the Israeli Parliament that Israel tried to minimize civilian deaths by asking Gazans to evacuate, but “despite our supreme effort not to harm uninvolved civilians, a tragic accident occurred to our regret last night.” He accused Hamas of hiding among the general population, saying, “For us, every uninvolved civilian who is hurt is a tragedy. For Hamas it’s a strategy. That’s the whole the difference.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The military said the target of the strike on Sunday was a Hamas compound, adding that “precise munitions” were used to eliminate a Hamas commander and another senior Hamas official at the site.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">But at least 45 people were killed by the blast and subsequent fires, according to the Gaza health ministry, including 23 women, children and older people. The ministry said that 249 people were wounded.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure class="img-sz-large css-hxpw2c e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group"><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption" class="css-1g9ic6e ewdxa0s0"><span class="css-jevhma e13ogyst0">Palestinians in Rafah gathering at the site where internally displaced people were killed by an Israeli strike.

Eyewitnesses described intense fires in the aftermath of the strike.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The Israeli military said in a statement on Monday that it had taken a number of steps before the strike to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians, including conducting aerial surveillance and using precise munitions. “Based on these measures, it was assessed that there would be no expected harm to uninvolved civilians,” the military said.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Military drone footage of the attack, reviewed by The New York Times, showed the munition striking an area housing several large cabinlike structures and parked cars.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Two Israeli officials said that the strike took place outside the designated humanitarian zone that was supposed to offer safe refuge to residents being told to evacuate to get out of harm’s way. The military <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1795089873772142873" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">produced a map</a> showing what it said was the location of the strike in relation to the designated humanitarian area.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The military named the two targets of the strike as Yassin Rabia, the commander of Hamas’s leadership in the occupied West Bank, and Khaled Nagar, a senior official in the same wing of the group. The military said the West Bank wing was responsible for planning, funding and carrying out terrorist attacks throughout the West Bank and within Israel.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure class="img-sz-medium css-d754w4 e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group"><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption" class="css-gbc9ki ewdxa0s0"><span class="css-jevhma e13ogyst0">Palestinian children peer into a funeral vehicle carrying the bodies of victims of the Israeli strike in Rafah. </span><span class="css-1u46b97 e1z0qqy90"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mohammed Salem/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">In a statement, Hamas described the Israeli strike on Rafah as “a horrific war crime” and demanded the “immediate and urgent implementation” of the World Court’s decision. The group did not refer to the Israeli military’s assertions about the two Hamas officials who were the targets of the strike.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The strike occurred in Tal as Sultan in northwest Rafah, according to the military. Israeli ground troops have so far been operating in southeast Rafah, and in the narrow corridor along the Egyptian border.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">The order issued on Friday by the court, an arm of the United Nations, in The Hague came as part of a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. It called on Israel to immediately halt any actions in Rafah, “which may inflict upon the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that would bring about its physical destruction in whole and in part.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">Israeli officials have argued that the 13-2 ruling allowed it to continue fighting in Rafah on grounds that Israel had not, and would not, inflict such conditions on Palestinians.</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0">But even some of Israel’s allies do not view the order that way. Germany’s vice chancellor, Robert Habeck, said on Saturday that Israel’s offensive in Rafah was “incompatible with international law.” And President Emmanuel Macron of France said on Monday that he was “outraged” by the airstrike in Rafah, adding that these operations “must stop.”</p><p class="live-blog-post-content css-1smqmx3 etfikam0">Patrick Kingsley and Myra Noveck contributed reporting.</p><div class="live-blog-post-signed-bylines css-j3uhc5"><p class="css-e9nh73 e1jsehar1"><span class="byline-prefix">— </span><span class="css-1baulvz last-byline" itemprop="name"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner" class="css-n8ff4n e1jsehar0">Isabel Kershner</a></span> reporting from Jerusalem</p></div></div></div>

<li>The victims, ranging in age from 10 to 13, were stabbed during a screening of the movie "IF". The stabbings were reportedly unprovoked and random.</li>

<p>The jury will then be asked to deliberate and reach a verdict, just months before the country heads to the polls for what is expected to be a <a href="/news/2024/5/5/us-elections-are-six-months-away-where-do-things-stand-and-whats-next">closely fought November election</a> between Trump, a Republican, and his Democratic rival President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Trump, who faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business documents in relation to hush money payments made to an adult film star before the 2016 presidential election, has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Here’s all you need to know about the historic case – the first criminal trial against a former US president – and what comes next.</p>

<p>Prosecutors and defence lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments, which are expected to last for much of Tuesday.</p>
<p>The arguments function as hourlong recaps of the key points each side wants to make before the jurors begin their deliberations.</p>
<p>The defence team will go first, followed by the prosecution.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-each-side-argue">What will each side argue?</h2>
<p>Prosecutors have sought to make the case throughout the trial that Trump took part in a hush money scheme aimed at stifling bad press that could have hurt his chances in the 2016 presidential election, which he won.</p>
<p>They have shown the jury financial statements and questioned several witnesses, including <a href="/news/2024/5/9/trumps-lawyer-presses-stormy-daniels-on-day-14-of-hush-money-trial">Stormy Daniels</a>, the adult film star whose alleged affair with Trump is at the centre of the case. Trump has denied any sexual encounter took place.</p>
<p>The prosecution’s star witness, ex-Trump lawyer <a href="/news/2024/5/14/michael-cohen-to-resume-testimony-in-trump-hush-money-trial">Michael Cohen</a>, also <span>testified that the former president was directly involved in the scheme and authorised payments.</span></p>
<p>The defence, for its part, has sought to discredit the witnesses, including by painting Cohen as a serial liar. <a href="/news/2018/8/22/ex-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-pleads-guilty-implicates-president">Cohen pleaded guilty</a> in 2018 to federal charges related to the hush money payments as well as for lying to the US Congress.</p>
<p>But this week, Trump’s team does not have to prove anything or convince jurors of his innocence.</p>
<p>To prevent a conviction, they need to persuade at least one of the 12 jurors that prosecutors have failed to prove Trump’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt – the standard for criminal cases.</p>
<p>The defence may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-jury-being-asked-to-decide">What is the jury being asked to decide?</h2>
<p>While courtroom drama has dominated media coverage of the trial, the case boils down to whether Trump knowingly covered up a <a href="/podcasts/2024/5/22/hush-money-a-gag-order-and-protests-the-trump-stormy-daniels-trial">$130,000 payment to Daniels</a> for her silence in an effort to prevent her claims from derailing his 2016 White House bid.</p>
<p>The jury must decide not only if Trump caused the records of payments to be falsified but also if he did so to cover up another crime – an undeclared campaign donation in this case. Both findings would make the alleged offences felonies under New York state law.</p>
<p>In <a href="/news/2024/4/22/battlelines-drawn-jury-hears-opening-arguments-in-trump-hush-money-case">an interview with Al Jazeera</a> at the outset of the trial, Gregory Germain, a law professor at Syracuse University in upstate New York, summed up “the two essential elements” of the indictment: “Where’s the fraud and where’s the [secondary] crime?”</p>
<p>After each side delivers its closing arguments, the judge overseeing the case, <a href="/news/2024/5/10/five-takeaways-from-day-15-of-donald-trumps-new-york-hush-money-trial">Juan Merchan</a>, will give the jury lengthy instructions on how to interpret the law and evidence during their deliberations. This could happen as early as Wednesday.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<h2 id="how-do-jury-deliberations-work">How do jury deliberations work?</h2>
<p>The deliberations will proceed in secret in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that is intentionally opaque.</p>
<p>During their deliberations, the jurors will have access to all of the evidence and will be able to ask questions of the judge, who will confer with prosecutors and defence lawyers before deciding how to answer.</p>
<p>There is no time limit on how long the jury takes to deliberate. The jurors must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.</p>
<p>To reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it. If the jury is unable to unanimously decide a verdict, it deadlocks, and Merchan would declare a mistrial.</p>
<p>Once jurors inform the court they have reached a verdict, Merchan will summon the parties to the courtroom to hear it read by the jury foreperson. Merchan must still affirm the verdict and enter a final judgement. Either side may ask him to effectively overrule the jury.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-if-trump-is-convicted">What happens if Trump is convicted?</h2>
<p><a href="/news/2024/2/5/how-will-donald-trumps-criminal-trials-affect-his-re-election-bid">If Trump is convicted</a>, it would likely be several weeks or months until he is sentenced.</p>
<p>As a first-time offender of a nonviolent crime, the ex-president and the Republican Party’s 2024 presumptive presidential nominee would likely be released on bond in the meantime.</p>
<p>The maximum sentence for Trump’s crime of falsifying business records is up to four years in prison. But while prison time is a possibility, experts said a fine, probation or community service are all far more likely options.</p>
<h2 id="will-a-conviction-affect-trump-s-election-chances">Will a conviction affect Trump’s election chances?</h2>
<p>That remains unclear.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/6-months-out-tight-presidential-race-trump-biden-poll/story?id=109909175" target="_blank">ABC News/Ipsos poll</a> from early May found that an overwhelming percentage of Trump supporters – 80 percent – said they would back the former president in November even if he is found guilty of a felony.</p>
<p>But 16 percent said they would reconsider their support if he is found guilty while 4 percent said they would withdraw it, the poll showed.</p>
<p>Another poll, published last week by Quinnipiac University, showed that 6 percent of Trump voters said they would be less likely to vote for Trump if he is convicted, 24 percent said they would be more likely to vote for him and 68 percent said it would not affect their choice.</p>
<p>While the percentage of voters who said they would ditch Trump if he is convicted is low, it could nevertheless prove important in a neck-and-neck contest between Trump and Biden.</p>
<p>“Will a conviction sink Trump? The vast majority of his supporters say it would be no big deal. But in an extremely tight race, that 6 percent could tip the balance,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.</p>

<li><strong>Pope Francis rejected the idea of gay priests</strong>: When asked if gay men could train for the priesthood as long as they remained celibate, Pope Francis reportedly said they should not, stating that there is already "too much of an air of frociaggine in the Church".</li>
<li><strong>Reported comments confirmed by numerous sources</strong>: Multiple Italian news agencies have confirmed the Pope's reported words, citing numerous sources, including the Italian investigative website Dagospia.</li>
<li><strong>Meeting took place behind closed doors</strong>: The incident reportedly occurred during a meeting with Italian bishops, which took place behind closed doors, making it difficult to independently verify the exact wording and context of the Pope's comments.</li>

                                        <p>MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A Papua New Guinea government official has told the United Nations that more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive by last Friday’s <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/papua-new-guinea-landslide-yambali-enga-642d9e8e0c913efa25ed2d67df318393">landslide</a></span> and has formally asked for international help.</p><p>The government figure is roughly triple the U.N. estimate of 670 killed by the landslide in the South Pacific island nation’s mountainous interior. The remains of only five people had been recovered by Monday, local authorities reported. It was not immediately clear why the tally of six reported on Sunday had been revised down.</p><p>In a letter to the United Nations resident coordinator dated Sunday and seen by The Associated Press, the acting director of the country’s National Disaster Center, Luseta Laso Mana, said the landslide “buried more than 2,000 people alive” and caused “major destruction” in Yambali village in Enga province.</p>
    

<p>Estimates of the casualties have varied widely since the disaster occurred, and it was not immediately clear how officials arrived at the number of people affected.</p><p>The International Organization for Migration, which is working closely with the government and taking a leading role in the international response, has not changed its estimated death toll of 670 released on Sunday, pending new evidence.</p>



<p>“We are not able to dispute what the government suggests but we are not able to comment on it,” said Serhan Aktoprak, chief of the U.N. migrant agency’s mission in Papua New Guinea.</p>
    
<p>“As time goes in such a massive undertaking, the number will remain fluid,” Aktoprak added.</p><p>U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres sent “heartfelt condolences” to the families of the victims and the people and government of Papua New Guinea and said the U.N. and its partners are supporting the government’s response efforts, and “the United Nations stands ready to offer additional assistance at this challenging time,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday.</p>
    

<p>The death toll of 670 was based on calculations by Yambali village and Enga provincial officials that more than 150 homes had been buried by the landslide. The previous estimate had been 60 homes.</p><p>The office of Papua New Guinea Prime Minister <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/papua-new-guinea-biden-ambrose-finnegan-marape-cannibals-9479088c4262fe6879258e5ad135238f">James Marape</a></span> did not respond Monday to a request for an explanation of what the government estimate of 2,000 was based on. Marape has promised to release information about the scale of the destruction and loss of life when it becomes available.</p><p>Determining the scale of the disaster is difficult because of challenging conditions on the ground, including the village’s remote location, a lack of telecommunications and tribal warfare throughout the province which means international relief workers and aid <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/papua-new-guinea-landslide-6908ec1ed79d30c6a02dfa3bdac25f79">convoys</a></span> require military escorts.</p><p>At least 26 tribal warriors and mercenaries were killed in a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/papua-new-guinea-massacre-tribal-violence-8b3615e28e5b64fa8bf8090d06fec3f4">battle</a></span> between two warring tribes in Enga in February, as well as an unconfirmed number of bystanders.</p><p>The national government’s lack of reliable census data also adds to the challenges of determining how many are potentially dead.</p><p>The government estimates Papua New Guinea’s population at around 10 million people, although a U.N. study, based on data including satellite photographs of roof tops, estimated in 2022 it could be as high as 17 million. An accurate census has not been held in the nation in decades.</p>
    

<p>The landslide also buried a 200-meter (650-foot) stretch of the province’s main highway under debris 6 to 8 meters (20 to 26 feet) deep, creating a major obstacle for relief workers.</p><p>Mana said the landslide would have a major economic impact on the entire country.</p><p>An excavator donated by a local builder Sunday became the first piece of heavy earth-moving machinery brought in to help villagers who have been digging with shovels and farming tools to find bodies.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Conservative Party has proposed a new policy, "Triple Lock Plus", which aims to increase the tax-free pension allowance and ensure that pensioners do not pay income tax.</li>
<li>The policy would increase the personal allowance for pensioners by at least 2.5% or in line with the highest of earnings or inflation, ensuring that they do not pay income tax on their pensions.</li>
<li>The policy is expected to cost £2.4bn a year by 2029-30, which will be funded through improvements to tax collection and cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion.</li>
<li>The policy is aimed at addressing concerns raised by charities such as Age UK and Independent Age, which have reported increased calls from pensioners worried about being dragged into paying income tax.</li>
<li>The policy is seen as an attempt to demonstrate the Conservative Party's commitment to supporting pensioners, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak stating that the party is "on the side of pensioners" and committed to ensuring they have "peace of mind and security in retirement".</li>

<ol>
<li>North Korea attempted to launch a spy satellite into orbit, but the rocket exploded mid-flight and failed to reach its intended destination.</li>
<li>The failure was reportedly due to a problem with a new liquid fuel rocket motor, although officials are still investigating the cause of the failure.</li>
<li>The launch was detected by South Korea's military, which reported an "unidentified projectile" launched southwards over the Yellow Sea.</li>
<li>Japan also detected the launch and ordered evacuations in southern Okinawa prefecture as a precautionary measure, although the rocket did not ultimately fly over Japanese territory.</li>
<li>North Korea had announced its plan to launch the satellite earlier in the day, stating that the launch window would last until June 4, but the failure of the launch means that the satellite was not successfully deployed into orbit.</li>

<p>“The launch of the new satellite carrier rocket failed when it exploded in mid-air during the flight of the first stage,” the deputy director general of North Korea’s National Aerospace Technology Administration said in a report carried by state media.</p>
<p>An initial analysis suggested that the cause was a newly developed liquid fuel rocket motor, but other possible causes were being investigated, the report said.</p>
<p>Officials in South Korea and Japan had said earlier that the launch appeared to have failed.</p>
<p>South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korea fired an “unidentified projectile southwards” over the Yellow Sea and that several minutes afterwards many fragments were spotted in the sea.</p>
<p>In Japan, public broadcaster NHK reported a similar outcome.</p>
<p>A senior Japanese Ministry of Defence official told reporters: “The missile did not fly into the area that had been announced, and the situation is not as North Korea had intended. We are still analysing whether it is a satellite or not,” Japan’s Kyodo news agency reported.</p>
<p>Japan had issued an emergency alert ordering evacuations in southern Okinawa prefecture before lifting the warning and saying the rocket was not expected to fly over Japanese territory.</p>
<p>North Korea issued a <a href="/news/2024/5/27/north-korea-plans-to-launch-space-satellite-by-june-4-japan">notification</a> of its launch plan earlier in the day, saying the launch window would last until June 4.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>Nuclear-armed North Korea successfully launched <a href="/news/2023/11/21/north-korea-launches-suspected-spy-satellite">its first spy satellite in November</a>, drawing international condemnation.</p>
<p>The US called the launch a “brazen violation” of UN sanctions, two months after Russian President Vladimir Putin met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the Vostochny Cosmodrome in eastern Russia and <a href="/gallery/2023/9/13/photos-when-vladimir-putin-met-kim-jong-un">promised technical assistance</a> to the isolated country.</p>
<p>Kim said at the end of last year that Pyongyang would <a href="/news/2023/12/31/north-korea-to-launch-3-new-satellites-in-2024-as-kim-warns-war-inevitable">launch three more military spy satellites</a> in 2024 as he continues a military modernisation programme that saw a record number of weapons tests in 2023.</p>
<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol said another satellite launch – North Korea’s fourth attempt – would “undermine regional and global peace and stability” while the South Korean military conducted attack formation flight and strike training to demonstrate “the strong capabilities and will of our military”.</p>
<p>Experts said spy satellites could improve Pyongyang’s intelligence-gathering capabilities, particularly over South Korea, and provide crucial data in any military conflict.</p>
<p>Seoul and the United States accuse the North of sending Moscow weapons for use in its war in Ukraine in return for the technical assistance.</p>
<p>A group of Russian engineers entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported on Sunday, quoting a government official.</p>
