<li>President Biden told a gathering of Democratic governors that he needs to get more sleep and work fewer hours, including curtailing events after 8 p.m.</li>
<li>The comments were made during a meeting intended to reassure Democratic governors that he is still in command of his job and capable of mounting a robust campaign against former President Donald Trump.</li>
<li>The remarks were a stark acknowledgment of fatigue from the 81-year-old president, who has been experiencing more frequent and pronounced lapses over the past few months.</li>
<li>The lapses have been noticed by current and former officials, according to a report by The New York Times.</li>
<li>The comments suggest that President Biden may be starting to prioritize his health and well-being, recognizing the importance of getting enough rest to perform his duties effectively as president.</li>

<li><strong>Labour Party expected to win elections</strong>: Observers are predicting a landslide win for the Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, which would end 14 years of Conservative Party rule and make Starmer the new Prime Minister.</li>
<li><strong>Starmer's lack of charisma a concern</strong>: While Starmer is considered "prime-ministerial" by some, he is often described as lacking charisma, which could be a problem for a leader who needs to connect with the public.</li>
<li><strong>Starmer's humble upbringing</strong>: Starmer has stressed his humble roots, describing his father as a toolmaker and his mother a nurse, in an effort to connect with voters. However, some feel he is uncomfortable with the public display of emotion needed to tell his story.</li>
<li><strong>Sunak's wealthy background</strong>: In contrast, Conservative Party leader Rishi Sunak, a former Goldman Sachs banker, has a wealthy background, being married to the daughter of an Indian billionaire. This has been highlighted in the media.</li>
<li><strong>A new chapter for Britain</strong>: Starmer has promised a "new chapter" for Britain, full of "hope and opportunity", if the Labour Party wins the election. This message is likely to resonate with voters who are eager for change after 14 years of Conservative government.</li>

<p>“The male was not conscious, or breathing and had no pulse,” according to <a href="https://www.clevelandpolicefoundation.org/patrol-officers-brittany-vajusi-and-jamieson-ritter-police-officers-of-the-month/">a post from the Cleveland Police Foundation.</a> “Patrol Officers Vajusi and Ritter immediately went to work removing clothing, applying chest seals, and starting CPR. For several minutes, the officers worked tirelessly giving chest compressions and restored the victim's pulse. Though the victim sadly passed away moments later, the officers gave it their all to give the victim a chance at survival.”</p>                    </div>

<p>The second was on April 20 when officers Ritter and Vajusi responded to the 1000 block of Old River Road where a male had jumped into the Cuyahoga River.</p>                    </div>
                    <div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text">
<p>“Patrol Officers Vajusi and Ritter, along with several other officers, successfully pulled the male from the water,” according to the Cleveland Police Foundation. “Patrol Officers Vajusi and Ritter assisted in providing first aid and warming the male up in order to prevent hypothermia.

<p>“Upon their arrival, they located a male who had been shot multiple times,” according to the Cleveland Police Foundation. “For the next five minutes, Patrol Officers Vajusi and Ritter removed the male's clothing, applied bandages and chest seals, and gave words of encouragement to the male in an effort to keep him alive. As if this wasn't enough, they were also inquiring for information about who had shot him. Their inquiries ultimately led to the arrest of the suspected shooter. The officers literally conducted the investigation at the same time they were saving the victim's life. Patrol Officer Ritter stayed with the victim all the way until he was inside the EMS wagon. I do not believe the victim would have survived had it not been for Patrol Officer Vajusi and Ritter's dedication to saving lives.”</p>                    </div>

    <div><div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC bOdfO " data-testid="prism-article-body"><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC">On Thursday, June 27, President Joe Biden had one of the worst debates for an incumbent president in recent memory. According to a <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/538-ipsos-june-2024-presidential-debate-poll" target="_blank">538/Ipsos poll</a> conducted after the debate using Ipsos’s <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel" target="_blank">KnowledgePanel</a>, the average debate watcher thought the president did “poor” (on a scale from “terrible” to “excellent”), and only 21 percent thought he performed best in the debate. By contrast, although former President Donald Trump turned in just an “about average” performance that included <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/jun/28/2024-presidential-debate-fact-check-biden-trump/" target="_blank">numerous lies</a>, 60 percent of debate watchers told 538/Ipsos they thought he performed the best. And according to <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/" target="_blank">538’s average</a>, Trump’s margin in national polls has increased by 2 percentage points since the debate.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In the aftermath of Biden’s performance, the president has faced a barrage of calls to drop out of the presidential race to make way for a Democrat with a better chance of defeating Trump. Following a slew of articles written by its op-ed columnists, for example, <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/biden-election-debate-trump.html" target="_blank">The New York Times editorial board wrote</a>, “The greatest public service Mr. Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election.” Even some elected Democrats have taken the extraordinary step of publicly suggesting he should step aside, with <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://x.com/LloydDoggettTX/status/1808220760697082309" target="_blank">Rep. Lloyd Doggett writing on Tuesday</a>, “Too much is at stake to risk a Trump victory.”</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">If Biden were to step aside, Vice President Kamala Harris is the most likely choice to replace him as the Democratic nominee — not necessarily because she is the best pick (this is impossible to test) but purely by virtue of her being first in line to the presidency. The million-dollar question, then, is whether Democrats would be better off with Harris as their nominee than with Biden.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">That’s ultimately an unanswerable question, given the unprecedented and hypothetical nature of such a switcheroo, but we <em>can</em> attempt to quantify Harris’s odds of winning based on the (limited, imperfect) information we do have. So, as a thought experiment, we ran two different versions of the <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/" target="_blank">538 presidential forecast</a> with Harris as the Democratic nominee instead of Biden.</p><h2 class="RxNCg PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq">538’s election forecast, Harris-Trump edition</h2><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Let’s get one caveat out of the way: We don’t have that many public polls testing Harris against Trump. From April 1 through July 2, just over a dozen polls asked about this alternative matchup. But we do have polls from all the major swing states, thanks largely to <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/analysis/swing-state-polling-may-2024" target="_blank">tracking from Morning Consult</a>, and we have enough national surveys to calculate a Harris-versus-Trump national polling average — and thus to forecast how she would perform in states without any polls.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">For the most part, national polls have shown Harris doing about the same as Biden in head-to-head polls against Trump. In a <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/Fox_March-22-25-2024_National_Topline_March-27-Release.pdf" target="_blank">March Fox News poll</a> for example, Trump led Harris by 6 points and Biden by 5 points (well within the survey’s margin of error). And as recently as June 28, a <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2024/6/29/in-post-debate-poll-voters-think-biden-is-too-old-to-be-president-yet-alternative-candidates-perform-similarly-against-trump" target="_blank">Data for Progress poll</a> showed the president and vice president each losing to Trump by 3 points (also within the margin of error). That said, a <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24787646/cnn-poll.pdf" target="_blank">June 28-30 CNN/SSRS poll</a> found Harris losing to Trump by only 2 points while Biden was trailing by 6. This was also within the margin of error but was nonetheless a bigger gap and could mark the beginning of a shift for Harris.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">When we plug all these polls into a polls-only version of the 538 forecasting model — which jettisons the economic and political priors our full model uses, giving us an apples-to-apples comparison between candidates — Harris has a <em>slightly</em> higher chance of winning the Electoral College than Biden, but it’s not a significant difference: 38-in-100 versus 35-in-100. On a state-by-state level, Biden looks stronger than Harris in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, while Harris’s odds are higher than Biden’s in Nevada.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Harris also does slightly better than Biden in our forecast of the national popular vote. The model forecasts that Trump would outpace Harris nationally by 1.5 points, while he would outrun Biden by 2.1 points. However, this could be an artifact of our model not having any Harris-versus-Trump polls that include independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who tends to take slightly more votes away from Democrats than Republicans when included in a poll.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">However, Harris’s popular-vote edge is almost entirely negated by the bigger Electoral College bias against her. In our polls-only forecast pairing Biden against Trump, the Democratic candidate needs to win the popular vote by just 1.1 points to win the presidency. That’s thanks to Biden doing better in Pennsylvania, the likeliest tipping-point state in our model. Harris, by contrast, would need to win the popular vote by 3.5-4 points to win Pennsylvania and, with it, the Electoral College.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">However, whether Harris would truly be a stronger candidate than Biden also depends on information besides the polls. In our full forecast model — which includes a <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/538/538s-2024-presidential-election-forecast-works/story?id=110867585" target="_blank">variety of non-polling economic and political variables</a>, which we call the “fundamentals” — Harris does much worse than Biden across the board. Whereas Biden has a 48-in-100 chance to win the Electoral College, Harris has only a 31-in-100 chance.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">This is thanks in large part to the <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jcampbel/documents/ForecastIssuesCampbell2014PS.pdf" target="_blank">boost our model confers</a> on Biden as the <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/campuspress.yale.edu/dist/5/444/files/2013/05/mayhew_incumbencyadvantage_2008.pdf" target="_blank">incumbent president</a>, which is worth an extra point for Biden over Harris in our fundamentals-only forecast of the national popular vote. However, one factor our model does not consider is whether presidents’ approval rating and economic growth impact incumbents running for reelection more than non-incumbents running from the same party, and that may actually push Harris’s numbers over Biden’s. In other words, your mileage may vary depending on how much you believe that Biden should get a boost because he’s the sitting president. There is no objectively correct answer here; one of the reasons election forecasting is hard is that it requires judgment calls like these.</p><h2 class="RxNCg PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq">Sometimes, it makes sense to bet on uncertainty</h2><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Biden’s core problem may not be captured in current polls, however. As his critics said after the debate, concerns about age and competency do not go away with time; in fact, they tend to get worse. Our forecast for Biden today depends on many known knowns and known unknowns, and, unfortunately for Democrats, the known downsides for Biden currently outweigh the known upsides. Another way of saying this is that Biden’s chief risk is a “hard” risk (as opposed to a soft one) — a product of an immutable trait that voters are unlikely to overlook by November.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Replacing Biden with Harris, by contrast, would introduce more uncertainty into the election; in other words, Democrats would be betting that her “soft” risks aren’t as bad as Biden’s. For example, Harris had one of the <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://voteview.com/person/41701/kamala-devi-harris" target="_blank">most left-leaning voting records</a> during her time in the U.S. Senate, which could hurt her among moderate voters. Yet Biden already does poorly with moderates — and at current levels of political polarization, a cross-cutting issue like Biden’s age may make more of a difference with swing voters, anyway, than any narrow disagreements about policy.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN">At the end of the day, any decisions about whom the Democratic Party nominates for president will — or should — take more than just the polls into account. Right now, there is a lot of uncertainty around the alternatives for Biden. We have few polls for Harris, for example, and other alternatives are less well known and have not been vetted at the level a president or vice president is scrutinized at (<a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/538/kristi-noem-blamed-shooting-dog-realities-rural-life/story?id=110027836" target="_blank">just ask South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem</a>). Until recently, that uncertainty was enough to hold calls for a new Democratic nominee at bay. But just as uncertainty creates more downside for a party, it also creates more upside. Given what Democrats have now realized about Biden, they may be willing to take that risk.</p></div></div>

            Turbidity is a measure of cloudiness in water the EPA says can be used to assess water quality and filtration effectiveness to indicate whether disease-causing organisms could be present.

            Turbidity can indicate the presence of organisms including bacteria, viruses and parasites that can cause nausea, cramps, diarrhea and headaches. Infants, young children, older adults and people with compromised immune systems may be at greater risk, DC Water said.

            <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/03/us/atlanta-boil-water-advisory/index.html">Atlanta</a> was under a state of emergency last month, after disruptions to its water service left a large swath of the city under boil-water advisories. Some summer school programs and hospital operations in the area were paused as a result. Atlanta officials cited aging pipes and crumbling infrastructure when addressing the issue.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dogs at the polls</strong>: During the British election, dogs were reportedly seen waiting outside polling stations as their owners voted. This was a notable trend in the news coverage of the election.</li>
<li><strong>Scotland</strong>: The article mentions specifically that this was observed in Edinburgh, Scotland, where a Shih Tzu named Joey was seen waiting outside a polling station with its owner.</li>
<li><strong>Photographic evidence</strong>: The article includes a photo of Joey the Shih Tzu waiting outside the polling station, which was taken by Jane Barlow and released by the PA via AP.</li>
<li><strong>No canine political impact</strong>: While dogs were present at the polls, there is no suggestion in the article that they had any influence on the election outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Lighthearted election coverage</strong>: The article's tone is lighthearted and humorous, making note of the unusual trend of dogs accompanying their owners to the polls.</li>

            The call came as Israel and Hamas <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/03/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-hostage-talks-intl-latam/index.html">appear to be on the brink of a framework agreement</a> for a deal, an Israeli source familiar with the negotiations has told CNN. Hamas recently provided a response to the framework to Qatari and Egyptian mediators, a move Israeli officials believe will enable the two parties to enter detailed negotiations to reach an agreement. A deal, however, is still not finalized nor is it assured.
    </p>

            The call lasted 30 minutes and was “focused” on the details of the hostage and ceasefire deal, according to a senior administration official, who added that Biden will have the “opportunity” to talk about the deal with other world leaders next week during the NATO summit, which will be held in Washington.
    </p>

            Israel and Hamas appear to be on the brink of a framework agreement for a deal, an Israeli source familiar with the negotiations previously told CNN.

            When asked if the administration believes that Netanyahu is playing politics and could try to sabotage the deal, the official said that the deal is structed in a way that “fully protects Israel’s interests.”

The proposed language focused on a period in the first phase of the proposal when Israel and Hamas would be expected to hold more negotiations with the goal of moving to the second phase of the deal.

            Biden and Netanyahu last spoke on May 6. The two men are expected to meet in Washington in several weeks when the Israeli prime minister visits to address Congress, a source familiar with the matter previously told CNN’s MJ Lee. US and Israeli officials are still in the process of nailing down logistical details for the Biden-Netanyahu meeting, which would likely take place at the White House, the source said. The two leaders will see each other, barring any abrupt last-minute change in circumstances.

            The call also comes as Biden is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/04/politics/biden-rising-tide-pressure-reelection-bid-analysis/index.html">fighting for his own political survival</a> back home after floundering on the debate stage against former President Donald Trump last week. Biden’s handling of the conflict between Israel and Hamas remains a key issue of concern for many in the Democratic Party, including younger voters.

It is said to have landed in the southern French village and lodged itself in a rock wall about 33 feet off the ground. </p>
