            Hajj officials asked pilgrims to carry umbrellas and stay hydrated amid the harsh conditions while the Saudi army deployed more than 1,600 personnel with medical units specifically for heatstroke and 30 rapid response teams. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers took part.

            The Hajj is a source of prestige for Saudi Arabia’s king, who holds the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques as the guardian of Islam’s holiest sites.

            Experts say that with oil sales generating close to a billion dollars a day for the kingdom, the pilgrimage’s economic benefit is marginal by comparison. But its great, untapped potential could bring significant riches to the kingdom in the long term.

            Pilgrimage revenues were forecast to average about <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1151751/saudi-arabia" target="_blank">$30 billion a year</a> and create 100,000 jobs for Saudis when the kingdom attracted around 21 million worshippers annually during the 10-day Hajj as well as the yearlong Umrah pilgrimage, according to official data cited by Reuters. The government is targeting 30 million pilgrims by 2030.

</h2></p><div data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">According to Forbes magazine, Mr Mellon is a descendant of Thomas Mellon, an Irish immigrant who amassed a fortune in real estate and banking after arriving in the US in 1818.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Mellon family - which also included Mr Mellon's grandfather Andrew, a former US treasury secretary - is today worth over $14bn (£11bn). Forbes estimates that that the Mellons are the 34th richest family in the US. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Born in 1942, Mr Mellon attended Yale University where he studied city planning. His father was a major donor at the school and provided the funding to establish the Yale Center for British Art - the largest collection of British art outside the United Kingdom. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In 1981, Mr Mellon formed Guilford Transportation Industries, a holding company named after his hometown of Guilford, Connecticut. It quickly bought up three major railways that stretched from Canada, through New England and into the mid-Atlantic region of the US. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The firm, which had maintained its chief focus on railroads, pivoted in 1998 when it bought the brand of the famed - but long bankrupt - Pan American World Airways. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Perhaps influencing the purchase, Mr Mellon had developed a love for flying around this time - logging more than 11,500 hours in the cockpit. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"As owner of the company [Pan Am] and with the skill necessary to do the job, he became a commercial pilot and quite literally kept the American institution that is Pan Am flying," reads a synopsis <a target="_blank" href="https://greenbeanbookspdx.indielite.org/book/9781510780347" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">for an upcoming autobiography</a> due to be published in 2025. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Through much of this, he served as trustee of the Andew W.

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Biden begins private debate preparations</strong>: President Joe Biden will spend the next few days at Camp David preparing for the June 27 presidential debate against Donald Trump, a debate which is expected to be intense and consequential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trump's prep process</strong>: Trump will stay on the campaign trail before meeting with his team for two days of private meetings at his Florida estate, an informal prep process. Allies are urging him to focus on his governing plans and prepare for pointed questions about his views on election fraud and abortion rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Firsts for the debate</strong>: The CNN debate on June 27 will be historic in several ways: it's the first time presumptive nominees have met on the debate stage this early in the general election season, and it will feature the oldest two candidates to date. Additionally, Trump will face questions about his felony conviction in his hush money trial, which is scheduled to conclude two weeks after the debate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debate rules</strong>: The debates will take place at a CNN studio in Atlanta with no audience, and each candidate's microphone will be muted except when they're speaking. No props or prewritten notes will be allowed, and the candidates will only be permitted to use a pen, paper, and water. There will be no opening statements, and a coin flip determined who would speak first and last.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pressure on Biden</strong>: Biden's team is aware that he cannot afford an underwhelming performance in the debate, as any mistakes could be difficult to recover from. The next debate isn't until September, so any stumbles on June 27 will have a significant impact on the campaign.</p>

                    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — President Joe Biden begins an intense period of private preparations Friday at Camp David for what may be the most consequential presidential debate in decades.</p>
<p>The 81-year-old Democrat’s team is aware he cannot afford an underwhelming performance when he faces Republican rival Donald Trump for 90 minutes on live television June 27. Biden’s team expects aggressive attacks on his physical and mental strength, his record on the economy and immigration and even his family.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/rfk-jr-fails-to-qualify-for-cnns-debate-setting-up-showdown-between-biden-and-trump"><strong>READ MORE:</strong> RFK Jr. fails to qualify for CNN’s debate, setting up showdown between Biden and Trump</a></p>
<p>Trump, 78 and ever confident, will stay on the campaign trail before going to his Florida estate next week for two days of private meetings as part of an informal prep process.</p>
<p>The ex-president’s allies are pushing him to stay focused on his governing plans but expect him to be tested by pointed questions about his unrelenting focus on election fraud, his role in the erosion of abortion rights and his unprecedented legal baggage.</p>
<p>The CNN debate will be full of firsts, with the potential to reshape the presidential race. Never before in the modern era have two presumptive nominees met on the debate stage so early in the general election season. Never before have two White House contenders faced off at such advanced ages, with widespread questions about their readiness.</p>
<p>And never before has a general election debate participant been saddled with a felony conviction. The debate stage meeting comes just two weeks before Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on 34 felony counts in his New York hush money trial.</p>
<p>“You can argue this will be the most important debate, at least in my lifetime,” said Democratic strategist Jim Messina, a 54-year-old who managed President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign.</p>
<h2>Pressure on Biden</h2>
<p>The ground rules for the June 27 debate, the first of two scheduled meetings, are unusual.</p>
<p>The candidates agreed to meet at a CNN studio in Atlanta with no audience. Each candidate’s microphone will be muted, except when it’s his turn to speak. No props or prewritten notes will be allowed onstage. The candidates will be given only a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water.</p>
<p>There will be no opening statements. A coin flip determined Biden would stand at the podium to the viewer’s right, while Trump would deliver the final closing statement.</p>
<p>The next debate won’t be until September. Any stumbles June 27 will be hard to erase or replace quickly.</p>
<p>Biden arrived at Camp David on Thursday night and is expected to hunker down with senior campaign aides until the debate. While traveling to the mountainside retreat, he gave a thumbs up to reporters when asked how debate prep was going.</p>
<p>The president’s aides have been reluctant to share details about his preparations, run by former chief of staff Ron Klain. But they’ve signaled he’s preparing to be aggressive and wouldn’t shy away from using the term “convicted felon” to describe his opponent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/capehart-and-johnson-on-how-the-biden-trump-debates-could-shape-the-campaign-season"><strong>WATCH:</strong> Capehart and Johnson on how the Biden-Trump debates could shape the campaign season</a></p>
<p>One adviser not authorized to speak publicly about debate strategy noted Biden has been increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the debate. That’s still while trying to project himself as “the wise and steady leader” in contrast with Trump, the adviser said.</p>
<p>Among some political operatives, there’s the sense Biden may have more to lose given his struggle to generate momentum amid signs of weakness within his political coalition. Trump and his allies have set an extraordinarily low bar, however, by suggesting for months Biden is contending with serious physical limitations that make it difficult for him to stand for 90 minutes or string together two sentences.</p>
<p>“It’s like the mirror test. Put a mirror under Biden’s nose, and if it fogs it up, he wins, right? That’s about what the threshold is for Biden,” Republican strategist and Trump ally David Urban said with a laugh. “Can Biden demonstrate that he’s mentally nimble? That’s the big question.”</p>
<p>Yet Trump sought to shift expectations in a Thursday interview with the “The All-In Podcast” in which he veered sharply away from his typical Biden taunts. He said Biden “destroyed” vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan in their 2012 debate.</p>
<p>“I assume he’s going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater,” Trump said of Biden. “I don’t want to underestimate him.”</p>
<p>Biden’s aides have dismissed concerns about his age and mental readiness. They’re fighting against what they allege is deceptive editing of video clips to suggest he’s confused.</p>
<p>But while some Democrats project confidence, Biden’s allies also say he has spent much of the last two weeks traveling — in Europe and on the West Coast — limiting his ability to prepare. Others note incumbent presidents typically struggle in the season’s opening general election debate.</p>
<p>Messina made both points even as he sought to play up the political stakes for Trump. He suggested Trump was taking an unnecessary political risk by debating Biden, given Trump’s early advantage in many polls.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have done the debate if I was him,” Messina said of Trump. “If you’re tied or a little bit ahead of the incumbent, why would you want to give him this air? He decided he wanted to do this to knock him out, and if he doesn’t, then I think he’s in real trouble.”</p>
<h2>Trump projecting confidence</h2>
<p>Trump’s team sees the faceoff as an opportunity to demonstrate a clear contrast with Biden’s leadership ability and governing record.</p>
<p>And while downplaying his preparations, Trump aides have a pattern of insisting he doesn’t prepare for debates when, in fact, he does — in his own way. Instead of mock debates with lecterns and stand-ins or hours spent poring over policy books, the ex-president is expected to rely on a series of conversations about policy and strategy with aides and political allies.</p>
<p>Trump will also make public appearances over the coming days.</p>
<p>On Saturday, he’s set to host a rally in Philadelphia and deliver a keynote address to a conference of Christian conservatives in Washington. He also has a fundraiser in New Orleans on Monday before going to his Florida estate for meetings.</p>
<p>“Biden needs rehearsals with handlers to find some way to explain this mess he’s made of our nation,” Trump spokesman Brian Hughes said. “President Trump is always prepared to present to Americans his record of success and Biden’s weakness and failures.”</p>
<p>Biden’s camp is aware Trump will likely focus on his son Hunter, as the then-president did on the debate stage four years ago. Hunter Biden was recently convicted on three felony charges related to the purchase of a gun while allegedly being addicted to drugs.<br>
Republicans have also criticized Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings when Joe Biden was vice president.</p>
<p>Biden’s allies are also concerned, however, their famously combative rival might be on good behavior.</p>
<p>“For both campaigns, the goal here is reaching an audience of moderate, independent, swing voters in swing states who will, in many ways, be the deciding factor in this election,” said former Biden administration official Bill Russo.</p>
<p>“Trump has kind of a golden opportunity here. If he can pretend that he’s a reasonable human being for 90 minutes while he’s in the spotlight, he’s got a lot to gain,” Russo added. “The real key here is which Trump shows up.”</p>

A heat emergency was in effect for Washington, DC, where upper 90s and even triple-digit temperatures for the first time since 2016 will be possible.

            <strong>• Search for “more loss of life” in New Mexico fires: </strong>In New Mexico, authorities reported <a href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/us-heatwave-fires-storms-06-19-24#h_0c726a441ead07a005d95dd37468d141">that at least two people</a> died, 1,400 structures were destroyed and and more than 8,000 residents were evacuated as a result of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/us-heat-wave-fires-storms-06-18-24/index.html">wildfires</a>. The mayor of hard-hit Ruidoso, New Mexico, said they were preparing for more fatalities in the fires and bringing in dogs to help the search for “more loss of life.” The South Fork and Salt fires have together burned an estimated 24,000 acres and were still 0% contained as of Friday. Evacuations are still in effect for Village of Ruidoso and City of Ruidoso Downs residents and additional evacuation orders have been issued in at least seven more areas.

            <strong>• Flood threat in fire zone: </strong>A flash flood warning was issued for Ruidoso and other New Mexico areas burned by the South Fork Fire after 0.5 inches of rain fell in the morning. More rain was expected into the late afternoon hours. Rain earlier in the week created a flash flood emergency with water rescues as a torrent of mud and water rushed from burned areas. Ground charred by fire, also known as a burn scar, loses its ability to effectively absorb water and more easily floods.

            • <strong>California firefighters brace for 100-degree heat: </strong>California is heating up Friday, with triple-digit temperatures expected in some areas. Heat alerts span parts of southern and central California, including in Colusa County, where firefighters are working to rein in the Sites Fire spanning over 19,100 acres. High temperatures between 100 and 106 are expected and could hinder firefighting efforts.

            The extreme heat and humidity will combine to push the heat index – or how hot it feels – to 100 to 105 degrees over a widespread area, with 110 degrees possible in the southern mid-Atlantic. Record overnight low temperatures will <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/30/weather/nighttime-heat-danger-climate-change-xpn-scn/index.html">increase health risks</a> by reducing the ability for people to cool down at night.

<li><strong>China's cautious response</strong>: China has not commented on the new defense pact between Russia and North Korea, and its statements have been vague, leading experts to believe that Beijing may be struggling to decide on a response.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns over influence</strong>: China may be worried about losing its influence over North Korea, as the Russia-North Korea partnership could potentially shift the balance of power in the region and increase instability on the Korean Peninsula.</li>
<li><strong>Conflicting goals</strong>: China has conflicting goals in its relations with North Korea and Russia. It wants to maintain peace on the Korean Peninsula, while also countering the US and its allies globally. This complexity may be contributing to China's hesitation to respond to the new pact.</li>
<li><strong>No easy options</strong>: Expert Victor Cha suggests that China does not have a clear option in responding to the Russia-North Korea partnership. He describes the situation as "very weak" and notes that China may be unable to make a decision due to conflicting views or lack of knowledge on how to evaluate the situation.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty about China's role</strong>: The Russia-North Korea partnership may mark a significant shift in regional dynamics, and China's role in the region remains uncertain. While some in Beijing may welcome the partnership as a way to push back against US dominance, others may be concerned about the potential destabilizing effects and the impact on China's relationships with both Russia and North Korea.</li>

<p>The Chinese response has been “very weak,” said Victor Cha, senior vice president for Asia and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, adding that it could be a sign that Beijing doesn’t yet know what to do.</p>



<p>“Every option is a bad option,” he said. “You’re either unable to make a decision because of very strongly held competing views or ... you’re just incapable of making a decision because you just don’t know how to evaluate the situation.”</p>
    
<p>Some in Beijing may welcome the Russia-North Korea partnership as a way of pushing back at America’s dominance in world affairs, but Cha said that “there is also a great deal of discomfort” in China, which doesn’t want to lose its sway over its neighbor to Russia, doesn’t want to see a destabilizing nuclear power on its doorstep, and doesn’t want to bring the <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine">conflict in Europe</a></span> to Asia.</p>
    

<p>But China isn’t raising these concerns publicly. “They don’t want to push Kim Jong Un further into the arms of Vladimir Putin,” Cha said, referring to the leaders of the two countries.</p><p>Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, declined to comment on the new agreement. “The cooperation between Russia and the DPRK is a matter between two sovereign states. We do not have information on the relevant matter,” he said, referring to North Korea by the initials for its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. </p><p>John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, told reporters that the pact between Russia and North Korea “should be of concern to any country that believes that the U.N. Security Council resolutions ought to be abided by.” The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea to try to stop its development of nuclear weapons.</p><p>Kirby also said the agreement “should be of concern to anybody who thinks that supporting the people of Ukraine is an important thing to do. And we would think that that concern would be shared by the People’s Republic of China.” </p>
    

<p>One area that China could be concerned about is whether Russia will help North Korea’s weapons program by sharing advanced technology, said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.</p><p>“If China is indeed concerned, it has leverage in both Russia and North Korea and it could probably try to put some limitations to that relationship,” he said.</p><p>The meeting between Putin and Kim this week was the latest chapter in decades of complicated political and military relationships in East Asia, where the Chinese Communist Party, once an underdog, has emerged as a leading power that wields influence over both North Korea and Russia. </p><p>That and other developments have raised alarms in the U.S. that Beijing, now the world’s second-largest economy, could challenge the U.S.-led world order by aligning itself with countries such as Russia, North Korea and Iran. Beijing has rejected that allegation.</p><p>Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, said Beijing doesn’t want to form a three-way alliance with North Korea and Russia, because it “needs to keep its options open.”</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth="">

<p>Such a coalition could mean a new Cold War, something Beijing says it is determined to avoid, and locking itself to Pyongyang and Moscow would be contrary to China’s goals of maintaining relationships with Europe and improving ties with Japan and South Korea, she said.</p><p>Sun added that the rapprochement between North Korea and Moscow “opens up possibilities and potentials of uncertainty, but based on what has happened so far, I don’t think that China’s national interests have been undercut by this.”</p><p>Closer ties between Putin and Kim could weaken Beijing’s sway and leave it as the “biggest loser,” said Danny Russel, who was the top U.S. diplomat for Asia in the Obama administration.</p>
    

<p>“Apart from irritation over Putin’s intrusion into what most Chinese consider their sphere of influence, the real cost to China is that Russia’s embrace gives North Korea greater impunity and room to maneuver without consideration to Beijing’s interests,” he said.</p><p>Russel, now vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said that Kim is eager to reduce his country’s dependence on China.</p><p>“The dilution of Chinese leverage means Kim Jong Un can disregard Beijing’s calls for restraint,” he said, “and that is much more likely to create chaos at a time when (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping desperately wants stability.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Tang reported from Washington.

<ol>
<li><strong>Ancient ship discovery</strong>: A 3,300-year-old ship and its cargo were discovered by a natural gas company, Energean, off the coast of northern Israel, about 55 miles from the Mediterranean coast.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced navigation</strong>: The finding suggests that ancient seafarers had more advanced navigation abilities than previously thought, as they could travel without a line of sight to land. The ship was found at a depth of 1.1 miles, indicating that it was sailing far from land.</li>
<li><strong>Undisturbed by time</strong>: The ship has been undisturbed by waves, currents, and fishermen for millennia, providing a unique opportunity for research and preservation.</li>
<li><strong>Changes understanding of ancient mariners</strong>: The discovery "changes our entire understanding of ancient mariner abilities" said Jacob Sharvit, head of the IAA marine unit, as it is the first ship of its era to be found so far from land.</li>
<li><strong>How ancient sailors navigated</strong>: According to Sharvit, the sailors likely used the sun and stars to navigate, rather than keeping an eye on land while moving from port to port, as was previously assumed by researchers.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>The British Prime Minister's Residence is Misleading</strong>: Despite being known as 10 Downing Street, the actual residence of the British Prime Minister is actually located at 11 Downing Street, and has been so for nearly three decades.</li>
<li><strong>The Complex has Over 100 Rooms</strong>: The combined complex at 10-12 Downing Street has over 100 rooms, including a press briefing room and a large garden. However, the doors marked 10-12 are merely decorative and don't lead to separate houses.</li>
<li><strong>Big Announcements Often Happen Outside the Iconic Black Door</strong>: Although the Prime Minister resides at 11 Downing Street, big announcements like their appointment or resignation often take place outside the iconic black door with a 10 on it.</li>
<li><strong>Recent Prime Ministers Have Resigned Outside This Door</strong>: In the last 8 years, four British Prime Ministers have resigned outside this door, including David Cameron, who seemed pleased to be leaving office.</li>
<li><strong>The Context of David Cameron's Resignation</strong>: Cameron resigned as Prime Minister following the UK's vote to leave the European Union (Brexit), which had devastating consequences and resulted in Cameron's departure. His resignation was followed by controversy and accusations of lying about the reasons for the referendum.</li>

    where does the British prime minister live easy right 10 Downing Street well actually for nearly three decades every prime minister has lived above the door marked 11 I don't know whether you've ever been there see 10 Downing Street isn't quite what it appears if you haven't why not join me now and come and have a look at it Downing Street itself is a culdesac and Dead End Street if you're being unkind but it's so narrow that it's really less a street than in an Alleyway along one side are doors marked 10 11 and 12 they look like neighboring tow houses but the doors are entirely for show all three lead into the same massive complex with more than 100 rooms the complex has a press briefing room behind door number nine and a massive Garden out the back both of which are great spots to hold press conferences with plenty of room for Jos and cameras Shelter From the rain and plenty of other good helpful things but for whatever reason whenever the prime minister is announcing something really really big like their appointment or their resignation ladies and gentlemen we're leaving Downing Street for the last time they do it outside the iconic black door with a 10 on it I have just accepted the invitation of her majesty the queen to form a government some of the most important moments in modern British political history have happened in that narrow alley often in the rain would the Press jostling for position when the curtain Falls it's time to get off the stage in the last 8 years four British prime ministers have resigned outside that door usually they're not all that happy about it but one guy seemed pretty pumped to be getting out of there David Cameron I expect to go to the palace and offer my res ation so we'll have a new prime minister in that building behind me by Wednesday evening thank you very much in 2016 David Cameron was so thrilled to be resigning that he sang a little song as he walked back through the black door forgetting that he was wearing a radio M right now why would someone be so thrilled to resign as prime minister that they're singing a little diddy as they do it well in Cameron's case it's akin to singing a little Dy on your way out of a house party after you clogged the toilet he'd made a big mess and he wasn't going to have to be the one to clean it up the UK is waking up to the hard reality of a referendum that split the European Union toppled a prime minister and spread turmoil on financial markets the British people have spoken and the answer is we're out great great is breaking on an independent United Kingdom brexit means brexit order this Parliament is a dead Parliament it should no longer sit this prime minister to talk about morals and morality is a disgrace the time is coming Mr Speaker there's still confusion and very little information in a country split down the middle feel like they voted B on lies barus you're a liar the buck stops here today David Cameron's colossal gamble that brought about brexit and how it sent Britain into chaos and division I'm Matt Bon and from if you're listening this is who broke Britain if you ask any Australian today where Britain is they would say Europe it's a European country surrounded by other European countries but that wasn't always the case Britain was once the center of our universe the mother country even 60 years after we became the little country that GT the Australian prime minister proudly declared I'm British to the boot Hills British right and through and through and yet in the 1960s when Britain said that they were potentially going to join the European Union then called the EC Australians were pissed well I think personally has an Australian Britain is a very greedy country very self England's been dependent on Australia for a long long time this fellow appears to be pissed in at least two senses of the word but now she got to the common market she didn't care a damn about Australia or anything else or in the colonies now why were these Australians angry about something that might happen on the other side of the world well it's all about trade for the previous couple of centuries the British Empire primarily traded with the colonies Britain was the factory and the empire was the farm and the mine it worked in Britain's favor labor land and resources were much cheaper in the colonies than in Europe but once those colonies became Nations they started demanding better rates so Britain started buying local by 1960 Britain was trading as much with Europe as it was with its former Empire so it decided to cut the cord and join the eec where you could buy and sell Goods to European countries with no taxes or tariffs we want wholeheartedly genuinely and sincerely to become a member of the European common market this was according to both sides of British politics great for the UK now this is important for economic reasons for the country as a whole it's very important for individuals as well because it means that the competition would get prices down as this goes on although it did mean that they had gone from being the center of the universe to being part of a kind of a co-op with their neighbors 2 years after the UK joined the eec a national referendum was held Britain's first basically to check whether the public was okay with the whole thing in the campaign some argued that Britain should go back to trading with the old Empire others said that that argument made no sense a Europe without Britain like a Britain without Europe would be both weaker and less prosperous it sounds familiar doesn't it the electorate voted 2: one to remain in Europe from the moment that Britain joined the European Union there have been people who wanted to turn around and leave you want to be citizens of a European Union for 50 years leaders in both major parties found themselves repeatedly having to defend the EU it is time to take on those who believe if we are pro British we must be anti-european more than 50% of our Traders with Europe 3 million jobs depend upon it we don't want Britain to be on the sidelines when the security and the prosperity of Europe are being decided the EU was a really convenient donkey on which to pin any problem that you might have even problems that weren't necessarily the eu's fault Britain's Farmers became sick and tired of dealing with strict European regulations Britain's manufacturing jobs began to disappear and were replaced with jobs in finance tourism it Logistics Healthcare and government Administration for many Britains these are hard times with little immediate Prospect of industrial growth the number of jobless is unlikely to dwindle in the near future ever since the 70s the Poland company ipsos has been tracking support for leaving the EU I spent an afternoon making charts trying to figure out why support for leaving the EU seems to go as high as 70% at times and then plummets as low as 29% at others finally I found a stat that seems to explain it it seems like the fewer jobs there are the more people want to leave the EU and in 2010 when David Cameron the conservatives swept to power unemployment was high 18 months into his term as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped up to a Podium to give a massive speech it was build as the speech of his life Cameron wanted to squash the talk about leaving the European Union once and for all we will give the British people a referendum with a very simple in or out choice to stay in the European Union on these new terms or to come out all together but it was in fact a bet the podium he spoke at was a metaphorical poker table and he was going all in we're going to get out there lead it shape it and win for Britain in our national interest David Cameron was going to campaign in favor of staying in the European Union and he was confident that his side would win so why was David Cameron so confident well look imagine him sitting at a Picadilly circus Casino poker table sunglasses on playing with his chips he thought he was holding a perfect hand he peels his cards up off the table to have one more peep at them and suppresses a little smile card one his Ace of Hearts the guys leading the push to leave the EU were in Cameron's view a bunch of fruit cakes and loonies and closet races mostly the UK independence party ukip had performed well in local and European elections and had spooked some conservative MPS but their leader Nigel far was romly dismissed by David Cameron as a clown's leader Nigel farage is adept at creating headlines for the cause this is how he welcomed the European council's president Herman Van Romo you have the Charisma of a damp Rag and the apparance of a lowgrade bank Clerk and the question that I want to ask that we're all going to ask is who are you Cameron thought that a referendum would kick Nigel farage to the curb card 2 the ace of diamonds was was the parliament itself three quarters of MPS including the opposition leader were sta remainers Card 3 his Ace of clubs was his own record on referendums in 2011 Cameron had led a campaign against changing the UK's voting system and confounded pollsters by winning the referendum it seems David Cameron has done a good job of making the elector believe that preferential voting the system Australia's used for 80 years is just too complicated besides referendums globally usually enforce the status quo particularly if the ramifications of what people are voting on are unclear if you don't know vote no card four Cameron's Ace of spad was the fact that the entire Global Community basically every world leader every European news outlet and most American ones were on his side when Obama's backing you how can you lose well at least that's how people felt in 2013 so four of a kind a very strong hand Cameron went all in but little did he know that the leave campaign would put together an unlikely hand of their own they look like smaller cards but lined up they make a straight flush their first card a two of spades in 2015 the labor leader who was a staunch remainer was replaced with socialist MP Jeremy Corbin who had a long history of Euros skepticism we have a European bureaucracy totally unaccountable to anybody though Corbin campaigned with rain he was accused of only doing it half-heartedly they're seething over his lackluster sales job to convince labor voters to stay in the EU vote to remain in order to defend investment defend jobs defend workers rights two the three of Spades was the surprising rise of nationalism and anti-immigrant sentiment throughout the country you can go to Whole parts of London now and you will not hear English even spoken it's about time we started putting the interests of British workers and British Families First now that one could say I'm a racist are you absolutely not one more time we card three The Four Spates was this guy Boris Johnson is an excellent retail politician fond of silly stunts he has broad political appeal Alexander Boris defl Johnson who became internationally famous as mayor of London during the 2012 London Olympic games can you get me a rope get me a rope okay he had in the past been a supporter of the European Union but 4 months before the vote he announced his intention to campaign vigorously for leave they say the EU it's crap but we have no alternative well my f I'm afraid we do have an alternative he was very famous charismatic and a great campaigner a huge boost to the leave Camp it is the biggest stitch up since the Bayer tapestry many thought that he was cynically using it as an opportunity to try and become Prime Minister which he denied my chances of being prime minister are about as good as being re incarnated as an as an olive next the five of Spades was Johnson and farage's willingness to lie it is paradoxical inconsistent incoherent that we are being urged every week to send 350 million pounds of our taxpayers money to Brussels see that wasn't true at all what I'm concerned about is that people are being told things that aren't correct but the card that tied it all together the six of Spades was something that ALS Al helped Donald Trump to Victory a few months later the uncontrolled wave of disinformation on Facebook and Twitter pushed by groups both inside and outside the UK where uninformed voters were told a vote for raain would lead to increased Terror attacks and increased immigration the campaign managed to do something unexpected make leaving the European Union seemed like a return to status quo even though the Empire is long gone a 2 3 4 5 and six of Spades individually the cards are virtually worthless but together they make a straight flush which beats David Cameron's hand at any poker table in the world this means that the UK has voted to leave the European Union we've got our country back the 52% of Britain who voted for brexit were concentrated in areas hit hard by the loss of manufacturing jobs areas with lots of people who felt left behind by the modern British economy they were concentrated in areas hit hard by the conservative government's austerity Cuts there was also a concentration of leave votes among Britain's most wealthy who were financially secure enough to ignore the Doom and Gloom economic predictions made by the Romain campaign it was demographically bizarre and took pollsters and politicians alike by surprise for the politicians the prospect of actually removing Britain from the EU was daunting it was a massive Nation altering policy that the government itself opposed it was a recipe for political chaos just hours after the results became clear the black door with the 10 on it opened and David Cameron walked out in Danning street but I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country country to its next destination he had gone all in and lost right it took 3 and 1/2 years for the UK to actually leave the EU and it's an era that was utterly chaotic parliamentarians who didn't really think brexit was a good idea tore each other to shreds over how it should be delivered there were two snap elections Parliament was shut down for a while Boris Johnson was reincarnated as an olive it was total Madness think of another word deadlock gridlock roadblock and with 8 years of hindsight the legacy of the brexit referendum is complicated the economic effect is basically unmeasurable it might be big it might be small it might be good it might be bad but we will never really know because on the day that the UK finally left the European Union on the 30 1st of January 2020 it will become official at 11:00 p.m. GMT that's midnight Brussels time and less than 12 hours from now yeah this happened on the same day the UK has tonight confirmed its first cases of the Corona virus with two people of the same family testing positive within weeks the entire country would be in lockdown any semblance of austerity policies were abandoned and economic indicators were off the scale so who really knows what brexit did but what we do know is that the political turmoil of brexit left Britain underprepared for the nightmare that was on their doorstep and that story is next who broke Britain

Dealerships continued to report issues with CDK systems on Friday.</p><a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/2012/09/09/the-day-in-pictures/1410095/" data-t-l=":l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - The day in pictures" data-g-r="nav_mo" data-g-tn="pgcss" data-g-mtn="pg1410095" data-g-moh="hpgm" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" data-c-id="1410095"><img class="gnt_em_gl_i" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/18/USAT/74136412007-afp-2157536592.jpg?crop=4238,2385,x2,y336&amp;width=660&amp;height=372&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/18/USAT/74136412007-afp-2157536592.jpg?crop=4238,2385,x2,y336&amp;width=1320&amp;height=744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt=""><p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"></p><p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="55"><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg__ca"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"></use></svg><svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"><use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_expand"></use></svg></p><p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="The day in pictures" aria-label="A look at the day's best photographs from around the world."></p></a><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">CDK Global works with 15,000 retail locations </h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Finney did not respond to questions on how many dealerships were impacted, but CDK’s website says the company works with more than <a href="https://www.cdkglobal.com/automotive" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">15,000 retail locations</a> across North America.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">One of the leading providers of cloud-based software to dealerships in the country, CDK's software <a href="https://www.cdkglobal.com/media-center/cdk-global-brings-digital-transformation-automotive-retail-new-category-software-cdk" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">helps dealerships manage</a> vehicle acquisitions, sales, financing, insuring, repairs and maintenance.
