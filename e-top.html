<li>Tropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, has been downgraded to a tropical depression and is expected to dissipate later in the day or tonight.</li>
<li>At least three deaths have been attributed to the storm, which made landfall over Mexico earlier on Thursday and caused heavy rains and flooding in parts of Mexico and Texas.</li>

It will continue to move west before dissipating later in the day or on Thursday night, according to the <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT1+shtml/200841.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">National Hurricane Center</a> in Miami. </p><p>As of 10:30 a.m. ET, the tropical depression was about 95 miles west of Tampico, Mexico, and 280 miles southwest of Brownsville, Texas. The storm has maximum sustained winds of 35 miles per hour, down from earlier Thursday when the maximum sustained winds were 50 miles per hour. The storm is moving west at about 18 miles per hour. </p>    
  <p>There remains a threat for a "tornado or two across parts of Deep South Texas."</p><p>All tropical storm warnings associated with Alberto have been discontinued, the NHC said, but flooding and rain continues on both sides of the border. About another inch of rain is forecast for the Texas coast, while gusty winds are starting to subside. Northern Mexico may see another 5 to 10 inches of rain Thursday, with the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas seeing up to 20 inches of rain in total. </p>

    </p>
<p>That "will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico," the hurricane center said.</p><p>Mexican authorities downplayed the risk posed by Alberto and instead pinned their hopes on its ability to ease the parched region's water needs.</p><p>"The (wind) speeds are not such as to consider it a risk," said Tamaulipas state Secretary of Hydrological Resources Raúl Quiroga Álvarez during a news conference late Wednesday. Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. "This is what we've been (hoping) for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas." </p><p>Much of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought conditions, with northern Mexico especially hard hit. Quiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande. </p>

    </p>
<p>"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas," he said. </p><p>But in nearby Nuevo Leon state, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla River in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain. </p><p>Nuevo Leon Gov. Samuel García wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passes.  </p><p>People in Mexico expressed hope for Alberto bringing rain. </p><p>Blanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico, ventured out to the city's waterfront Wednesday to await Alberto's arrival. </p><p>"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water," said Coronel Moral. "Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry." </p><p>Authorities closed schools for the remainder of the week in Tamaulipas since there could be localized flooding.</p>

<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-russia-putin-visit-98891f7ec2565b79e4c255a7d7d2f6ed">Vladimir Putin</a></span> signed the pact at a summit Wednesday in Pyongyang. Both described it as a major upgrade of bilateral relations, covering security, trade, investment, cultural and humanitarian ties.</p>



<p>The office of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol issued a statement condemning the agreement, calling it a threat to his country’s security and a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and warned that it would have negative consequences on Seoul’s relations with Moscow.</p>
    
<p>“It’s absurd that two parties with a history of launching wars of invasion — the Korean War and the war in Ukraine — are now vowing mutual military cooperation on the premise of a preemptive attack by the international community that will never happen,” Yoon’s office said.</p>
    

<p>At the United Nations in New York, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul called it “deplorable” that Russia would act in violation of multiple U.N. sanctions resolutions against North Korea that Moscow voted for.</p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

        </div><p>Putin has said in response that Moscow “reserves the right” to arm Western adversaries, and reiterated that notion on Thursday. </p><p>“I said, including in Pyongyang, that in this case we reserve the right to supply weapons to other regions of the world,” he said. “Keeping in mind our agreements with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, I’m not ruling that out.”</p>
    

<p>The summit between Kim and Putin came as the U.S. and its allies expressed <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-us-munitions-ukraine-war-7091eaba254b680888a9b1ec8a68135f">growing concern</a></span> over a possible arms arrangement in which Pyongyang provides Moscow with badly needed munitions for the war in Ukraine, in exchange for economic assistance and technology transfers that could enhance the threat posed by Kim’s nuclear weapons and missile program.</p><p>Following their summit, Kim said the two countries had a “fiery friendship,” and that the deal was their “strongest-ever treaty,” putting the relationship at the level of an alliance. He vowed full support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Putin called it a “breakthrough document,” reflecting shared desires to move relations to a higher level.</p><p>North Korea and the former Soviet Union signed a treaty in 1961, which experts say necessitated Moscow’s military intervention if the North came under attack. The deal was discarded after the collapse of the USSR, replaced by one in 2000 that offered weaker security assurances.</p>
    

<p>There’s ongoing debate on how strong of a security commitment the deal entails. While some analysts see the agreement as a full restoration of the countries’ Cold War-era alliance, others say the deal seems more symbolic than substantial.</p><p>Ankit Panda, a senior analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that the text appeared to be carefully worded as to not imply automatic military intervention.</p><p>But “the big picture here is that both sides are willing to put down on paper, and show the world, just how widely they intend to expand the scope of their cooperation,” he said. </p><div class="Enhancement" data-align-center="">

            While experts say war between Israel and Hezbollah remains unlikely, the very mention of Cyprus adds a new dimension to the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza. It risks drawing a European Union nation into a war that has already spread across the Middle East and puts the spotlight on Cyprus’s ties with Israel.

            An island in the Eastern Mediterranean located on a geopolitical fault line between the Middle East and southern Europe, Cyprus is geographically much closer to the conflicts in the Middle East than it is to European power centers.

            The island is twice the size of the US state of Delaware, and it is split into two parts: a Greek-speaking southern part known as the Republic of Cyprus, and a Turkish-speaking region known as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The island’s divide reflects the rivalry between regional foes Greece and Turkey. Most of the international community only recognizes the sovereignty of the Greek part of Cyprus, and that was the nation Nasrallah’s threats were directed at.

            The island has previously been caught in the crossfire of regional conflicts, a reminder of its proximity to the volatile Middle East.

Cypriot officials believed the missile was linked to military operations in Syria, saying it landed less than 15 (24km) miles north of the capital Nicosia.

            A scenario in which Israel uses Cypriot bases for its military forces, which Hezbollah warned against, would “effectively expand Gaza war into the European Union,” Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran analyst and editor of Amwaj.media, wrote on X.

            “Hezbollah’s release of drone footage of sensitive positions inside Israel is meant as a deterrent to Israel,” Lina Khatib, associate fellow in the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN, referring to the 9-minute drone video released by Hezbollah on Tuesday, showing civilian and military locations in and around the Israeli city Haifa.

            “It is normal for both Israel and Hezbollah to have military plans in place for handling a potential escalation.

She had been arrested for allegedly trying to remove a document from a city council meeting that she claimed she did not realize she had in the first place, and the charges were eventually dropped. </p><p>The Supreme Court on Thursday reversed the Fifth Circuit's decision, finding that Gonzalez's research showing that the statute under which she had been charged had never been used in her county to prosecute someone for "trying to steal a nonbinding or expressive document" was sufficient to support her claim. The Fifth Circuit, in ruling against her, said she needed more.</p><p>"That court thought Gonzalez had to provide very specific comparator evidence – that is, examples of identifiable people who ‘mishandled a government petition’ in the same way Gonzalez did but were not arrested," the Supreme Court said in an unsigned opinion, adding that "the demand for virtually identical and identifiable comparators goes too far."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/supreme-court-hears-case-texas-grandmother-thrown-jail-criticizing-city-government"><strong>SUPREME COURT HEARS CASE OF TEXAS GRANDMOTHER THROWN IN JAIL AFTER CRITICIZING CITY GOVERNMENT</strong></a></p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>Castle Hills police arrested then-Councilwoman Sylvia Gonzalez in July 2019 on a rarely used charge of tampering with a public document.</span> <span>(Courtesy Institute for Justice)</span></p></div></div></div><p>Gonzalez's story began in 2019, when constituents had complained that the city manager, Ryan Rapelye, was unresponsive, particularly to their concerns over the condition of their streets. </p><p>As soon as she was elected, Gonzalez championed a nonbinding petition calling for the city manager to be replaced with a previous manager who residents felt had done a better job. Another resident introduced the petition at Gonzalez's first city council meeting. Discussion of the manager's job performance "grew contentious," according to court records, and the meeting was extended through the following day.</p><p>At the end of the meeting, Gonzalez said she straightened up the papers strewn across her dais and put them in her binder before going to talk to a constituent.</p><p>A police officer interrupted the conversation, telling Gonzalez that Trevino wanted to speak with her, according to court documents. Gonzalez went back to the dais and Trevino asked where the petition was. Gonzalez said she didn't know. Trevino allegedly asked her to look in her binder, saying he could see a clip inside.</p><p>Indeed, the petition was in the binder, so Gonzalez handed it over and thought nothing of it. But two months later, she learned from a neighbor that there was a warrant out for her arrest.</p><p>"I didn't even know what I was accused of," Gonzalez, a 72-year-old grandmother, told Fox News.

Three weeks into the investigation, the police chief assigned a "trusted friend and local attorney" to take over as a "special detective," according to Gonzalez's complaint.</p><p>The special detective produced an arrest affidavit alleging that Gonzalez had "been openly antagonistic" toward the city manager from her first meeting, "wanting desperately to get him fired." The affidavit also accused Gonzalez of misleading a woman by "telling her several fabrications" about Rapelye in order to get her signature, according to court documents.</p><p>Detectives found probable cause to believe Gonzalez stole her own petition when she put it in her binder with other papers, violating a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Texas ban</u></a> on intentionally removing or destroying government records, according to court documents from the defendants.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/ranchers-say-state-flooded-lands-killing-animals-supreme-court-decide-texas-pay" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>RANCHERS SAY THE STATE FLOODED THEIR LANDS, KILLING ANIMALS.

IJ looked at 10 years of Bexar County data and couldn't find "anything even remotely similar" to Gonzalez's case, she added.</p><p>Rather than seek a summons for the nonviolent misdemeanor, the special detective took the unusual step of asking for an arrest warrant, the lawsuit contends. The special detective also went straight to a district court judge, circumventing the Bexar County District Attorney's Office.</p><p>"They wanted to punish me, and they wanted to make sure I went to jail. And they did a good job," Gonzalez said.</p><p>Gonzalez turned herself in, was handcuffed, spent the day sitting in jail and had her mugshot splashed across the evening news. Even though the DA's office dropped the charge, her brief political career was over.</p><p>Gonzalez sued Trevino, Siemens, special detective Alexander Wright and the city in 2020, alleging they deprived her of her rights under the First and 14th Amendments of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/constitution" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>U.S. Constitution</u></a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</u></strong></a></p><p id="cultivate-embed" data-question-id="646"></p><p>"This is a great day for the First Amendment and Sylvia Gonzalez, who has courageously fought against retaliatory actions by government officials," Bidwell said.</p><p>"The Supreme Court’s revision of its First Amendment retaliation doctrine ensures that Americans can seek justice when they have evidence of a retaliatory arrest. Retaliatory arrests undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and this ruling helps safeguard the rights of all Americans to speak out without fear of retribution," Bidwell said. </p>  <div class="article-meta"><div class="author-bio"><p>Brianna Herlihy is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.</p></div></div></div> </div>

<li><strong>Concerns over separation of church and state</strong>: Opponents, including civil liberties groups, argue that the law breaks the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which prohibits laws respecting an establishment of religion.</li>

<li><strong>Legal challenge planned</strong>: Four civil liberties groups have confirmed they plan to challenge the law in court, citing the religious diversity of Louisiana's schools and arguing that the law is "blatantly unconstitutional".</li>

Governor Jeff Landry signed it off on Wednesday. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Christians see the Ten Commandments as key rules from God on how to live.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The new law describes them as "foundational" to state and national governance. But opponents say the law breaks America's separation of church and state.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The first amendment to the US Constitution - known as the Establishment Clause - says that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The state law requires that a poster include the sacred text in "large, easily readable font" on a poster that is 11 inches by 14 inches (28cm by 35.5cm) and that the commandments be "the central focus" of the display.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The commandments will also be shown alongside a four-paragraph "context statement" which will describe how the directives "were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The posters must be on display in all classrooms receiving state funding by 2025 - but no state funding is being offered to pay for the posters themselves.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Similar laws have recently been proposed by other Republican-led states, including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Four civil liberties groups have confirmed that they plan a legal challenge, highlighting the religious diversity of Louisiana's schools.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The law was "blatantly unconstitutional", said a joint statement from the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But the bill's author, Republican state lawmaker Dodie Horton, has spoken of the importance of returning a "moral code" to classrooms. She was quoted saying "it’s like hope is in the air everywhere" as the bill was rubber-stamped by the governor. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">There have previously been numerous legal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in public buildings, including courthouses and police stations as well as schools.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In 1980, the US Supreme Court struck down a similar Kentucky law requiring that the document be displayed in elementary and high schools. This precedent has been cited by the groups contesting the Louisiana law.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the requirement that the Ten Commandments be posted "had no secular legislative purpose" and was "plainly religious in nature" - noting that the commandments made references to worshipping God.</p></div></div>

<li>A 3,300-year-old ancient sunken ship from the Bronze Age has been discovered in the Mediterranean Sea, off the coast of Israel.</li>
<li>The ship is believed to have sunk between 1400 and 1300 B.C. after encountering a storm or pirates, and has been lying undisturbed at a depth of over a mile for over 3,000 years.</li>
<li>The ship is considered the "first and oldest wrecked ship" discovered in the deep sea in the eastern Mediterranean, and is a significant historical find.</li>
<li>The shipwreck was discovered by an underwater robot while conducting a survey in the area, and its remnants were found in an unusually well-preserved state, with two jugs recovered from the site.</li>
<li>The discovery is significant not only for its historical importance, but also for its insight into the navigational skills of ancient mariners, who were able to traverse the Mediterranean Sea without the aid of modern navigation tools.</li>

Start saving.”

            But, after allegations emerged that their staff had placed bets on the date of the election, the Conservatives deleted the post Thursday.

            Sunak and the Conservatives have been polling behind Labour since November 2021 and as things stand the Conservatives are expected to suffer a historic defeat on July 4. It would be the first time Labour has entered power from opposition since 1997 and would end 14 years of controversial government by the Conservative Party.

            Final results will not be known until July 5. If Sunak does lose the election, he will leave office the same day.

class="dcr-iy9ec7">Each year tens of thousands of pilgrims try to join the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly official permits.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Saudi authorities reported clearing hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca this month, but it appears many still participated in the main rites which began last Friday. This group was more vulnerable, because without official permits they could not access air-conditioned spaces provided for the 1.8 million authorised pilgrims to cool down.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“People were tired after being chased by security forces before Arafat day. They were exhausted,” one Arab diplomat said on Thursday about Saturday’s day-long outdoor prayers that marked the climax of the hajj.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The diplomat said the main cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other problems.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Egyptian officials were visiting hospitals to obtain information and help Egyptian pilgrims receive medical care, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“However, there are large numbers of Egyptian citizens who are not registered in hajj databases, which requires double the effort and a longer time to search for missing persons and find their relatives,” it said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Egypt’s president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has ordered that a “crisis cell” headed by the prime minister follow up on the deaths of the country’s pilgrims.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Sisi stressed “the need for immediate coordination with the Saudi authorities to facilitate receiving the bodies of the deceased and streamline the process”, said a statement from his office.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Pakistan and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/indonesia" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Indonesia</a> also confirmed more deaths on Thursday.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Out of about 150,000 pilgrims, Pakistan had so far recorded 58 deaths, a diplomat said. “I think given the number of people, given the weather, this is just natural,” the diplomat said.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Indonesia, which had about 240,000 pilgrims, had raised its death toll to 183, its religious affairs ministry said, compared with 313 deaths recorded last year.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Deaths have also been confirmed by Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan and Iraq’s autonomous Kurdistan region. In many cases, authorities have not specified the cause.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Friends and relatives have been searching for missing pilgrims, scouring hospitals and pleading online for news, fearing the worst.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Two diplomats said on Thursday that Saudi authorities had begun the burial process for dead pilgrims, cleaning the bodies and putting them in white burial cloth and taking them to be interred.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">“The burial is done by the Saudi authorities. They have their own system so we just follow that,” said one diplomat, who said his country was working to notify loved ones as best it could.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The other diplomat said that it would be impossible to notify many families ahead of time, especially in Egypt, which accounts for so many of the dead.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia" data-link-name="in body link">Saudi Arabia</a> has not provided information on deaths, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of “heat exhaustion” on Sunday alone.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">Last year, various countries reported more than 300 deaths during the hajj, mostly Indonesians.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">The timing of the hajj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.</p><p class="dcr-iy9ec7">A 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of the climate crisis, heat stress for hajj pilgrims would exceed the “extreme danger threshold” from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, “with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses”.</p></div></div>
