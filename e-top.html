effectiveness.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Some of those gathered in the Swiss resort of Bürgenstock were not Ukraine's closest supporters, including Saudi Arabia, whose foreign minister has warned that Ukraine will have to make difficult compromises, and Kenya, which spoke out against recent sanctions on Russia.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The final document calls for Ukrainian control to be restored over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is currently occupied by Russia.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It also refers to Russia's invasion as a "war", a label

leaders who attended, saying he was grateful that they had shown independence in coming despite pressure from Russia for them to stay away.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"This summit says that international support [for Ukraine] is not weakening," he said, noting that states not previously involved in diplomatic efforts had joined the process.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">And asked by the BBC if Ukraine's weaker position on the battlefield had forced him to consider diplomatic moves, he replied that this was not the case and Ukraine had always talked about peace.</p><p

data-component="text-block" class="sc-43e6b7ba-0 bWSguZ"><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Earlier Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that attendees were united in their quest for peace in Ukraine.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"We all know we're only at the beginning, the beginning of a path to peace," he said. </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"And despite some of us around

class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"You do not invade another country. You do not abduct children. You do not play politics with the world's food supply. And you do not endanger nuclear safety."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It had been expected that all the delegations would endorse a final statement condemning Russia's invasion, but Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer told journalists on Sunday that the declaration would not be supported unanimously.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Zelensky said on Saturday that the results of the Swiss summit would be communicated to Moscow "so that at the second peace summit we can fix the real end of the war".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Russia has described the Swiss event as a waste of time, and on Friday President Vladimir Putin said he would agree to a ceasefire if Ukraine withdrew troops from four regions which Russia partially occupies and claims to have annexed.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But a day later <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxee131gejpo" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">Western leaders attending the summit strongly rejected Mr Putin's proposal</a>.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni described it as "propaganda" and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak accused Mr Putin of "spinning a phoney narrative about his willingness to negotiate".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Then on Sunday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian leader did not rule out talks with Ukraine, but added that guarantees would be needed to ensure their credibility and Mr Zelensky could not be a participant.</p></div></article></div>

It could help address the overwhelming needs of Palestinians that have surged in recent weeks with Israel’s incursion into Rafah.</p><p>The army said that the daily pause would begin at 8 a.m. (0500 GMT) and last until 7 p.m. (1600 GMT) and continue until further notice. It’s aimed at allowing aid trucks to reach the nearby Israel-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing, the main entry point, and travel safely to the Salah a-Din highway, a main north-south road, the military said. The crossing has had <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/18334690/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bottleneck</a></span> since Israeli ground troops moved into Rafah in early May.</p>
    

<p>COGAT, the Israeli military body that oversees aid distribution in Gaza, said the route would increase the flow of aid to other parts of Gaza, including Khan Younis, the coastal area of Muwasi and central Gaza.

<p>A U.N. spokesperson, Jens Laerke, told The Associated Press that Israel’s announcement was welcome but “no aid has been dispatched from Kerem Shalom today,” with no details.

Hamas has demanded changes that appear unacceptable to Israel.</p><p>With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to press ahead with the war and many members of his far-right government opposed to the cease-fire proposal, news of the military’s pause triggered a minor political storm.</p><p>An Israeli official quoted Netanyahu as saying the plan was “unacceptable to him” when he learned of it. The official said that Netanyahu received assurances that “there is no change” in the military’s policy and “fighting in Rafah continues as planned.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to speak with the media.</p><p>Israeli television stations later quoted Netanyahu as criticizing the military: “We have a country with an army, not an army with a country.”</p>
    

<p>But neither Netanyahu nor the army canceled the new arrangement. While the army insisted “there is no cessation of fighting” in southern Gaza, it also said the new route would be open during daytime hours “exclusively for the transportation of humanitarian aid.”</p><p>The fighting continued. Nine people, including five children, were killed Sunday when a house was struck in Bureji in central Gaza, according to AP journalists who counted the bodies at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. A man wept over the small sheet-wrapped bundle in his arms. Two of the children had been playing in the street.</p><p>“What did this girl do to you, Netanyahu? Isn’t this forbidden for you?” a woman cried, holding a dead child.</p><p>Israel’s military didn’t respond to questions about the strike.</p><p>Israel announced the names of 12 soldiers killed in recent attacks in Gaza, putting the number killed since Israel began its ground invasion of Gaza last year at 309. Hamas killed around 1,200 people during its Oct. 7 attack and took 250 hostage, Israeli authorities say. Health officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 37,000 Palestinians have been killed.</p>
    

<p>Israel’s military offensive has plunged Gaza into a humanitarian crisis, with the U.N. reporting hundreds of thousands of people on the brink of famine.</p><p>Hamas’ supreme leader, Ismail Haniyeh, called for more pressure to open border crossings. Another crossing, the Rafah terminal between Gaza and Egypt, has been closed since Israel moved into the city. Egypt has refused to reopen the crossing as long as Israel controls the Palestinian side.</p><p>The flow of aid in southern Gaza has declined just as need grew. More than 1 million Palestinians, many of whom had already been displaced, <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-hamas-rafah-palestinians-evacuees-refugees-2f4e37cb3e40560f4980d8a70baaa81e">fled Rafah after the invasion</a></span>, crowding into other parts of southern and central Gaza. Most languish in tent camps, with open sewage in the streets.</p>
    

<p>From May 6 until June 6, the U.N. received an average of 68 trucks of aid a day. That was down from 168 a day in April and far below the 500 a day that aid groups say are needed.</p><p>COGAT says there are no restrictions on the entry of trucks. It says more than 8,600 trucks of all kinds, aid and commercial, entered Gaza from all crossings from May 2 to June 13, an average of 201 a day. But much of that aid has piled up at crossings.</p><p>A COGAT spokesman, Shimon Freedman, said it was the U.N.’s fault that its cargo stacked up on the Gaza side of Kerem Shalom. He said its agencies have “fundamental logistical problems,” especially a lack of trucks.</p><p>The U.N. denies such allegations. It says the fighting often makes it too dangerous for U.N. trucks inside Gaza to travel to Kerem Shalom. It also says the pace of deliveries has slowed because Israel’s military must authorize drivers to travel to the site, a system Israel says was designed for drivers’ safety.</p><p>The new arrangement aims to reduce the need for coordinating deliveries by providing an 11-hour uninterrupted daily window</p><p>Because of a lack of security, some aid trucks have been looted by crowds as they moved along Gaza’s roads. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the army would provide security to protect trucks moving along the highway.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Wafaa Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Lee Keath from Cairo.

<p id="block-2c1961c7-d408-47ae-adf8-35fef60b025d">Today was a perfect Father’s Day with lots of sunshine, some fair weather clouds during the afternoon and low humidity once again. A touch cooler, with highs in the mid-upper 70s for most and a slight breeze. </p>



<p id="block-2c1961c7-d408-47ae-adf8-35fef60b025d">Next week, we are looking at our first heat wave of the year, with highs in the 90s and heat indices in the 100s! Make sure your AC units are in place and working properly. Stock up on water, ice and electrolyte-filled drinks. Find your cool spot if you need to, as this heat and humidity will really drain you as we go into the end of next week! Record heat likely in spots…</p>



<p>There will be some storminess around later in the week and into the weekend as the heat tries to break down. Severe weather may be possible so stay tuned for updates on that.</p>

They located him at a mobile home park in Shelby Township where he killed himself hours after the shooting. Police said they believed the shooter lived with his mother, who was not home at the time.</p><p class="sc-bczRLJ dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hxNyjp itaLjB article-text"><b>What have we learned about the investigation?</b></p><p class="sc-bczRLJ dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hxNyjp itaLjB article-text">Police are still investigating why the man decided to open fire on random strangers.

The investigation will include putting together a timeline of what he did leading up to and after the shooting.</p><p class="sc-bczRLJ dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hxNyjp itaLjB article-text">A rifle was discovered in the home where the shooter was found dead. Oakland County sheriff Michael Bouchard said, “Because we had quick containment on him, that if he had planned to do anything else -- and it wouldn’t surprise me because having that on the kitchen table is not an everyday activity -- that there was probably something else, a second chapter potentially.”</p><p class="sc-bczRLJ dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hxNyjp itaLjB article-text">Bouchard said police had no previous contact with the shooter and he did not have a criminal record.

We haven’t fleshed that out yet and that’s obviously something that is gonna be part of this investigation but we’d also encourage people, look, if someone is struggling with very severe mental health challenge and they have weapons in their hand that’s a good time to loop in mental health professionals and certainly public safety. We really need to be in front of so many of these tragedies rather than hear about it after. Almost every one of these things I’ve analyzed, and I’ve analyzed active shooters going back 25 years, have a very clear component that if somebody shared information it could have been interrupted,” Bouchard said.</p><p class="sc-bczRLJ dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hxNyjp itaLjB article-text">In February of this year, Michigan enacted new gun laws that included an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) law.

It came a day after more than 1.8 million <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/77b05b14674d6997b25b7b58df0d8052">pilgrims congregated at a sacred hill, known as Mount Arafat</a></span>, outside the holy city of Mecca, which Muslim pilgrims visit to perform the annual five-day rituals of Hajj.</p><p>Fourteen Jordanian pilgrims have died from sunstroke during the Hajj, according to Jordan’s state-run Petra news agency. The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it has coordinated with Saudi authorities to bury the dead in Saudi Arabia, or transfer them to Jordan.</p>
    

<p>Mohammed Al-Abdulaali, spokesman for the Saudi Health Ministry, told reporters that more than 2,760 pilgrims suffered from sunstroke and heat stress on Sunday alone. He said the number was likely to increase and urged attendees to avoid the sun at peak times and drink water. “Heat stress is the greatest challenge,” he said.</p>



<p>The pilgrims left Mount Arafat on Saturday evening to spend their night in a nearby site known as Muzdalifa, where they collected pebbles to use in the symbolic stoning of pillars representing the devil.</p>
    
<p>The pillars are in another sacred place in Mecca, called Mina, where Muslims believe Ibrahim’s faith was tested when God commanded him to sacrifice his only son Ismail. Ibrahim was prepared to submit to the command, but then God stayed his hand, sparing his son. In the Christian and Jewish versions of the story, Abraham is ordered to kill his other son, Isaac.</p><p>On Sunday morning, crowds headed on foot to the stoning areas. Some were seen pushing disabled pilgrims on wheelchairs on a multi-lane road leading to the complex housing the large pillars. Most pilgrims were seen sweltering and carrying umbrellas to protect them against the burning summer sun.</p>
    

<p>An Associated Press reporter saw many pilgrims, especially among the elderly, collapsing on the road to the pillars because of the burning heat. Security forces and medics were deployed to help, carrying those who fainted on gurneys out of the heat to ambulances or field hospitals. As the temperature spiked by midday, more people required medical help. The heat had reached to 47 C (116.6 F) in Mecca, and 46 C (114.8 F) in Mina, according to Saudi meteorological authorities.</p><p>Despite the suffocating heat, many pilgrims expressed joy at being able to complete their pilgrimage. </p><p>“Thank God, (the process) was joyful and good,” said Abdel-Moaty Abu Ghoneima, an Egyptian pilgrim. “No one wants more than this.”</p><p>Many pilgrims will spend up to three days in Mina, each casting seven pebbles at three pillars in a ritual to symbolize the casting away of evil and sin.</p><p>While in Mina, they will visit Mecca to perform their “tawaf,” or circumambulation, which is circling the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque counterclockwise seven times. Then another circumambulation, the Farewell Tawaf, will mark the end of Hajj as pilgrims prepare to leave the holy city. </p>
    

<p>The rites coincide with the four-day Eid al-Adha, which means “Feast of Sacrifice,” when Muslims with financial means commemorate Ibrahim’s test of faith through slaughtering livestock and animals and distributing the meat to the poor.</p><p>Most countries marked Eid al-Adha on Sunday. Others, like Indonesia, will celebrate it Monday.</p><p>President Joe Biden in a statement wished Muslims around the world a blessed Eid al-Adha and noted the holiday is a time of prayer, reflection and sacrifice.</p><p>“The Hajj and Eid al-Adha remind us of our equality before God and the importance of community and charity — values that speak directly to the American character,” it said. “The United States is blessed to be home to millions of American Muslims who enrich our nation in countless ways, from medicine to technology, education, public service, the arts, and beyond.”</p>
    

<p>Once the Hajj is over, men are expected to shave their heads and remove the shroud-like white garments worn during the pilgrimage, and women to snip a lock of hair in a sign of renewal and rebirth.</p><p>Most of the pilgrims then leave Mecca for the city of Medina, about 340 kilometers (210 miles) away, to pray in Prophet Muhammad’s tomb, the Sacred Chamber. The tomb is part of the prophet’s mosque, one of the three holiest sites in Islam, along with the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.</p><p>All Muslims are required to make the Hajj once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. Many wealthy Muslims make the pilgrimage more than once. The rituals largely commemorate the accounts of Prophet Ibrahim and his son Prophet Ismail, Ismail’s mother Hajar and Prophet Muhammad, according to the Quran, Islam’s holy book.</p>
    

<p>More than 1.83 million Muslims performed Hajj in 2024, Saudi Hajj and Umrah Minister Tawfiq bin Fawzan al-Rabiah said in a briefing, slightly less than last year’s figures when 1.84 million made the rituals.</p><p>Most of the Hajj rituals are held outdoors with little if any shade. It is set for the second week of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month in the Islamic lunar calendar, so its time of the year varies. And this year the pilgrimage fell in the burning summer of Saudi Arabia. </p><p>This year’s Hajj came against the backdrop of the devastating <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war">Israel-Hamas war</a></span>, which has pushed the Middle East to the brink of a regional conflict. </p><p>Palestinians in the Gaza Strip weren’t able to travel to Mecca for Hajj this year because of the closure of the Rafah crossing in May when Israel extended its ground offensive to the city on the border with Egypt.

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Labour Party's election manifesto includes £2 billion of extra funding each year to tackle NHS waiting lists and improve healthcare.</li>
<li>The party has been criticized for not setting out detailed costings for its health plans, with health think tanks warning that both Labour and the Conservative parties' plans would require significantly more funding.</li>
<li>Shadow Social Care Minister, Liam Streeting, acknowledged that Labour's manifesto does not have a plan to raise money to fund social care, despite pledging to "get a grip" on it. He suggested that the party would negotiate a fair pay agreement for carers to increase the workforce and tackle delayed discharges from hospitals.</li>
<li>Streeting also stated that he has no plans to change the cap on care costs, introduced by the current government, which allows people to spend their savings on care without owing the government.</li>
<li>The article also mentions Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, who was a minister in the Lib Dem-Conservative coalition government between 2010 and 2015, during which significant cuts were made to adult social care.</li>

"I know the Conservatives have baked into their plans council tax rises, that’s in the government’s spending forecast."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Asked about the think tanks suggesting that Labour's sums don't add up, Mr Streeting said Labour's manifesto was “not a spending review”, implying there could be more spending "if conditions allow". </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Harper claimed that Mr Streeting had “let the cat out of the bag a bit about Labour’s plans”.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He said his comments showed Labour's manifesto "actually wasn’t the whole story" but was "a document to get them through the election campaign" </p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"And he’s confirmed that there are more spending promises to come, and that can only mean one thing," he said. "It means more taxes.”</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Under Conservative governments since 2010, Ms Kuenssberg pointed out, people are paying 51% more in cash terms on council tax in England, which is forecast to increase by £10bn over the next five years.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Mr Harper said Conservative councils delivered better services with lower council tax than Labour ones, but was challenged by Ms Kuenssberg.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">She said the average Band D property tends to be higher in Labour-run councils but the overall average council tax bill tends to be lower in Labour councils.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He was also challenged over criticism from former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who had said voters are switching to Reform because taxes are too high, the criminal justice system is too lenient and public services are too inefficient, despite 14 years of Tory government.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Yes, our record is important, I think in many areas our record is very impressive," he said. "But elections are about the future and they’re about choices.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"They’re about whether you want to cut taxes - our manifesto has a clear costed plan to do that, Labour’s is about raising taxes - ours is about cutting migration, legal and illegal, a clear plan to do so, Labour’s is not - that’s a very clear choice for people."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Reacting to the BBC interviews, Greater Manchester's Labour Mayor Andy Burnham told the programme he was "encouraged" by Mr Streeting's pledges on fixing social care, including a pay rise for carers, but called for an end to "point-scoring" because both Labour and the Tories "have failed on it".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"It's a difficult inheritance for the Labour Party," Mr Burnham said.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"In the end the only answer is to provide social care on NHS terms and to ask for a contribution from people that is proportionate to their assets."</p></div></div>

<ol>
<li>In 2010, John Ford, a former actor, was arrested by London police for attempting to steal a soon-to-be-released copy of Tony Blair's memoir.</li>
<li>Ford had previously admitted to using deception and illegal means to obtain confidential information for the Sunday Times newspaper.</li>
<li>After his arrest, Ford contacted a journalist, Robert Winnett, who was a veteran of the Sunday Times and was set to become the editor of The Washington Post. Ford claimed that he had collaborated with Winnett repeatedly and trusted him to come to his rescue.</li>
<li>According to draft book chapters written by Ford, Winnett helped Ford obtain an untraceable phone and reassured him that his clandestine efforts would remain secret, citing the "remarkable omerta" of British journalism.</li>
<li>Ford's claims have raised questions about the journalistic ethics of Winnett and the Sunday Times, and whether they had an obligation to report or stop Ford's illegal activities.</li>

He said he regretted the move because the employee later lost his job.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="42SVXAB2PFD6FDJ4BRW2YWMBI4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Winnett reported in June 2002 that 60 British-based millionaires had placed orders for the new Maybach model. “Sources say,” Winnett wrote, that buyers had put down deposits of 50,000 pounds for a modern version of what had once been “the Nazis’ favourite limousine.”<b> </b>The New York Times first linked Ford’s public comments to the Winnett story.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5PT67AVO7BADBFL3P2GGU3WYZY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Co-authors of these stories either declined to comment or did not respond to inquiries.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P57UQGVRGZDNXGJVQKQBQE3VY4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Mark Lewis, a media lawyer who has brought high-profile phone-hacking claims, said revealing who had ordered high-end cars was plainly unjustified by public interest, the exemption carved out for blagging under U.K. law. “It seems like the perfect example of something that interests the public but has no public interest,” he said.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JJTQPSLM2BCMLMCLQYCPDPAHZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">A Sunday Times spokesperson declined to address specific stories but pointed to a past statement saying the paper “has employed many contributors and researchers to work on stories, or parts of stories” but “strongly rejects the accusation that it has in the past retained or commissioned any individual to act illegally.”</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DIFKK6KKWJHCJFX6566VYP2KZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Ford divulged in his 2018 piece for Byline Investigates that he had sought Blair’s manuscript at the behest of the Sunday Times. After his arrest, however, he contacted Winnett, by then at the Telegraph, because Winnett “remained in close contact with his friend Will Lewis, one of the leaders of News International’s Management and Standards Committee (the unit Murdoch set up to clean house after phone hacking).”</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4TN4T5DC45BFRGCU6CGCEDXDGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">After Ford’s arrest, on allegations of fraud by false representation, Winnett recommended a lawyer, Ford recalled in the draft book chapters.

Among others who attended the meal, according to Ford’s drafts, was a longtime Winnett colleague: Claire Newell, the Sunday Times journalist who, in Ford’s telling, had asked him to obtain the Blair manuscript.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UDZBDEONHVBRVE6QLM62XDMFME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Newell had been arrested in 2004 under suspicion that she had passed government papers to the Sunday Times while working as a temporary secretary in the Cabinet Office, the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/oct/16/uk.pressandpublishing">reported</a> at the time. Winnett had helped arrange for Newell to pass confidential leaks to the paper, according to an account in a book by journalist Nick Davies, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Flat-Earth-News-Award-winning-Distortion/dp/0701181451">Flat Earth News</a>.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PODG47EFUNF5FCRXGW3U77KLBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Newell was questioned in 2004 but not charged.

That shared experience, according to Ford’s drafts, meant no one would blow the whistle on the tactics that had landed him in jail.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XU5UB3U6GNAH3IWJKLJ45NBTQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">“It was clear that most had no idea of the specifics of my incident but people knew something had happened,” he wrote in the drafts. “It is pretty incredible that a group of journalists could collectively cover up this story.”</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EL6W6KQXUBH2NA43QXV53Z5CQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Ford did not remain invisible for long, becoming a flash point in a vexed public debate over press ethics in Britain.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BKVD3M65LVCODBH733EWP5GHBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">John Witherow, a former longtime editor of the Sunday Times, acknowledged in public testimony and statements in 2011 and 2012 that the paper had repeatedly employed Ford and two private investigators to impersonate public officials, sports regulators and others to obtain stories it deemed in the public interest. Witherow’s admissions came in response to a year-long government investigation known as the Leveson Inquiry that sprung from revelations of phone hacking by the Murdoch-controlled News of the World tabloid.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SFK5YFWRPFAVXOEMVXHCER4FQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">In the fallout from those revelations, Witherow sought to crack down on the use of subterfuge in reporting, prohibiting pseudonyms and alter egos, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/aug/05/sunday-times-bans-use-of-subterfuge">according to the Guardian</a>.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SJ547X5ZWNBTNPGFVTNFPQJPTM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Still, he made a public-interest case for blagging under questioning by members of Parliament in 2012. He gave an example of a reporter posing as a businessman to see if a lawmaker would take money to ask questions in a government hearing. The reporting led to the suspension of two lawmakers, he noted.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IJICUUJIUFBNHMHJG42DJWQMKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Witherow said Ford was one of the paper’s regular blaggers and had worked on “various investigations,” including into the soccer authority FIFA.

    <p>Here are the 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to a recent study by Chapman University and the Frontier Center for Public Policy, four cities in California - San Jose, San Francisco, San Diego, and Los Angeles - are among the most unaffordable in the world, with a price-to-income ratio of 9 or above.</li>
<li>The study found that the housing crisis in California is particularly severe, with high housing prices and relative to incomes having a "feudalizing impact" on young people, minorities, and immigrants.</li>
<li>The study attributed the unaffordability of housing in California to "urban containment policies" that limit sprawl and increase density, resulting in higher land prices and dramatically higher home prices.</li>
<li>The study warned that the housing crisis poses an existential threat to the middle class, reducing standards of living and increasing poverty, and that the escalation of land costs is the primary reason for the crisis.</li>
<li>The study also found that the housing crisis affects not just California, but other cities around the world, with 11 cities having a price-to-income ratio of 9 or above, including Hong Kong, Sydney, Vancouver, and others.</li>

    <div><p>There are unaffordable housing markets, and then there are “impossibly unaffordable” markets, four of which are in California, a recent study said.</p><div class="paywall">



<p>The housing crisis represents an obstacle to upward mobility, and the Golden State risks suffering from especially acute stratification, according to the annual <a href="http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf" rel="noopener" data-type="link" data-id="http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">Demographia International Housing Affordability</a> report, which was produced by Chapman University in California and the Frontier Center for Public Policy in Canada.</p>



<p>“High housing prices, relative to incomes, are having a distinctly feudalizing impact on our home state of California, where the primary victims are young people, minorities, and immigrants,” wrote Chapman’s Joel Kotkin. “Restrictive housing policies may be packaged as progressive, but in social terms their impact could be better characterized as regressive.”</p>



<p>The report points to “urban containment policies” that are meant to limit sprawl and increase density. Those have resulted in higher land prices, which have translated to dramatically higher home prices, it explained. </p>



<p>The trend toward increasing density was geared toward reducing reliance on cars and freeways, improving gridlock, and making neighborhoods more walkable. But the report said while such policies were well intentioned, they resulted in land prices being eight to 20 times higher in urban containment boundaries than outside of them.</p><p></p>



<p>In determining affordability, the report looked at 94 markets in Australia, Canada, China, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, the U.K., and the U.S., comparing the median home price in each location against the median income. </p>



<p>A price-to-income ratio of 3 and below was deemed affordable, with higher ratios corresponding to worsening levels of unaffordability. A ratio of 9 or above was labeled “impossibly unaffordable.” Of the 11 cities in that category, four of them are in California.</p>



<ol><li>Hong Kong (16.7)</li>



<li>Sydney (13.8)</li>



<li>Vancouver (12.3)</li>



<li>San Jose (11.9)</li>



<li>Los Angeles (10.9)</li>



<li>Honolulu (10.5)</li>



<li>Melbourne (9.8)</li>



<li>San Francisco (9.7)</li>



<li>Adelaide (9.7)</li>



<li>San Diego (9.5)</li>



<li>Toronto (9.3)</li></ol>



<p>The report also warned that the housing crisis poses an existential threat to the middle class, noting that high housing costs have reduced standards of living and increased poverty.</p>



<p>“The middle-class is under siege principally due to the escalation of land costs,” it said. “As land has been rationed in an effort to curb urban sprawl, the excess of demand over supply has driven prices up.”</p>



<p>The report pointed out that all of the “impossibly unaffordable” cities follow urban planning policies favoring more density, and recommended that cities open up the availability of land to reduce housing costs.</p><p></p>



<p>In the U.S. housing market, the worsening affordability problem has been exemplified by the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/housing-market-starter-home-going-extinct-affordability-havens/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/housing-market-starter-home-going-extinct-affordability-havens/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/housing-market-starter-home-going-extinct-affordability-havens/" class="sc-80b85506-0 ovBKL">disappearance of the $200,000 starter home</a>. That’s left many millennials trying to upgrade to bigger homes to accommodate their growing families out in the cold. </p>
