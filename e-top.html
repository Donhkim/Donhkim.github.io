            While the RN appears on track to win the most seats in the National Assembly, it may fall short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, suggesting France may be heading for a hung parliament and more political uncertainty.

            Projections show that, after the second round of voting next Sunday, the RN would win between 230 and 280 seats in the 577-seat lower house – a staggering rise from its count of 88 in the outgoing parliament. The NFP was projected to secure between 125 and 165 seats, with Ensemble trailing with between 70 and 100 seats.
    </p>

            The election, which Macron called after his party was battered by the RN in European Parliament elections earlier this month, could leave him to see out the remaining three years of his presidential term in an awkward partnership with a prime minister from an opposition party.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly1x4pn0001i3b6jx6v0s0l1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The RN election party in the northern town of Henin Beaumont erupted in celebration as the results were announced – but Marine Le Pen was quick to stress that next Sunday’s vote will be key.
    </p>

            “Democracy has spoken, and the French people have placed the National Rally and its allies in first place – and has practically erased the Macronist bloc,” she told a jubilant crowd, adding: “Nothing has been won – and the second round will be decisive.”
    </p>

            “The vote taking place next Sunday is one of the most decisive in the entire history of the Fifth Republic,” Bardella said.

            In bullish speeches before the first round, Bardella said he would refuse to govern a minority government, in which the RN would require the votes of allies to pass laws. If the RN falls short of an absolute majority and Bardella stays true to his word, Macron might then have to search for a prime minister on the hard left, or somewhere else entirely to form a technocratic government.
    </p>

            With an unprecedented number of seats going to a three-way run-off, a week of political bargaining will now ensue, as centrist and left-wing parties decide whether or not to stand down in individual seats to block the nationalist and anti-immigrant RN – long a pariah in French politics – from winning a majority.
    </p>

            When the RN – under its previous name, the National Front – has performed strongly in the first round of votes in the past, left-wing and centrist parties have previously united to block them from taking office, under a principle known as the “cordon sanitaire.”
    </p>

            After Jean-Marie Le Pen – the father of Marine and decades-long leader of the National Front – unexpectedly defeated the Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin in the 2002 presidential election, the Socialists swung their weight behind the center-right candidate Jacques Chirac, delivering him a landslide in the second-round runoff.

            In an attempt to deny the RN a majority, the NFP – a left-wing coalition that formed earlier this month – promised it will withdraw all of its candidates who came in third place in the first round.

            “Our instruction is clear – not one more vote, not one more seat for the National Rally,” Jean-Luc Melenchon, the leader of France Unbowed – the largest party in the NFP – told supporters Sunday.

            “A long week awaits us ahead, everyone will take his or her decision with conscience, this decision will determine, in the long-term, the future of our country and each one of our destinies,” Melenchon added.

            Marine Tondelier, leader of the Green Party – a more moderate part of the NFP – made a personal plea to Macron to stand down in certain seats to deny the RN a majority.

            “We’re counting on you: withdraw if you come third in a three-way race, and if you don’t qualify for the second round, call your supporters to vote for a candidate who supports republican values,” she said.

            Macron’s Ensemble allies have also called on their supporters to prevent the far right taking office, but have warned against lending their votes to the firebrand Melenchon.

            Gabriel Attal, Macron’s protege and the outgoing prime minister, urged voters to prevent the RN from winning a majority, but said Melenchon’s France Unbowed party “is preventing a credible alternative” to a far-right government.

            Former prime minister Eduoard Philippe, another Macron ally, said: “No votes should be cast for National Rally candidates, but also for France Unbowed candidates, with whom we differ on fundamental principles.”

            Whether tactical voting can prevent the RN winning a majority is not clear. In Sunday’s vote, the RN won support in places that would have been unthinkable until recently. In the Nord department’s 20th constituency, an industrial heartland, the leader of the Communist Party, Fabien Roussel, was defeated in the first round by an RN candidate with no previous political experience. The seat had been held by the Communists since 1962.

            Macron’s decision to call a snap election – France’s first since 1997 – took the country and even his closest allies by surprise. Sunday’s vote was held three years earlier than necessary and just three weeks after Macron’s Renaissance party was trounced by the RN at the European Parliament elections.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly1x5lva001z3b6jvei76ni5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            Macron has pledged to see out the remainder of his final presidential term, which runs until 2027, but he now faces the prospect of having to appoint a prime minister from an opposition party – in a rare arrangement known as “cohabitation.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly1x5lva00203b6jf1314pug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            The French government faces little trouble in passing laws when the president and majority in parliament belong to the same party. When they don’t, things can grind to a halt. While the president determines the country’s foreign, Europe and defense policy, the parliamentary majority is responsible for passing domestic laws, like pensions and taxation.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly1x5lva00213b6jjmnkgdim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            But these remits could overlap, potentially sending France into a constitutional crisis. Bardella, for instance, has ruled out sending troops to help Ukraine resist Russia’s invasion – an idea floated by Macron – and said he would not allow Kyiv to use French military equipment to strike targets inside Russia. It is unclear whose will would prevail in disputes like this, where the line between domestic and foreign policy is blurred.
    </p>



    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly1x5lva00223b6jc7mfooa5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            A far-right government could spell a financial as well as constitutional crisis. The RN has made lavish spending pledges – from rolling back Macron’s pension reforms to cutting taxes on fuel, gas and electricity – at a time when France’s budget might be brutally slashed by Brussels.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cly1x5lva00233b6jdoliigqq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            With one of the highest deficits in the Eurozone, France may need to embark on a period of austerity to avoid falling foul of the European Commission’s new fiscal rules. But, if implemented, the RN’s spending plans would make France’s deficit soar – a prospect that has alarmed the bond markets and led to warnings of a “Liz Truss-style financial crisis,” referring to the shortest-serving prime minister in British history.
    </p>

            In a terse statement Sunday evening, Macron said the high turnout showed French voters’ “desire to clarify the political situation” and called for his supporters to rally in the second round.

              </figcaption></figure><p>"We came to the United States, finally, to get the education and to get the good jobs here," hoping for a peaceful life after decades of strife and violence in Myanmar, Lay Htoo, who identified himself as one of Nyah's cousins, told the Associated Press in a phone interview.</p>

<p>The teen's parents were waiting for medical examiners to release his body and wondering what would become of the officers.</p><p>"They want them to be in prison forever," the cousin said.</p><p>At a vigil Saturday night, Nyah Mway's brother, Lah, said through an interpreter that he wouldn't be satisfied until the officers "are put in jail," <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/crime/2024/06/family-friends-strangers-gather-to-mourn-13-year-old-nyah-mway-who-was-fatally-shot-by-utica-officer.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Syracuse.com reported</a>.</p><p>Others at the vigil questioned officials' account of the shooting.</p>

    </p>
<p>"None of it adds up," said Kay Klo, one of those at the gathering.</p><p>According to police, Nyah Mway and another 13-year-old boy were stopped Friday night because they allegedly fit descriptions of suspects in an armed robbery that happened the day before in the same area. Police said one was also walking in the road, a violation of state traffic law.</p><p>The body camera video shows an officer saying he needs to pat them down for any weapons. While officers were questioning the teens, one of them – later identified as Nyah Mway – ran away, turned and appeared to point a black item at them.</p><p>Officer Bryce Patterson caught up with Nyah Mway, tackled and punched him, and as the two wrestled on the ground, Officer Patrick Husnay opened fire, body camera video showed. Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said at a news conference Saturday that the single shot hit the youth in the chest.</p><p>The teenager was taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died of his injuries.</p><p>Police said the item the boy was holding was later determined to be a BB or pellet gun that closely resembled a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine. Police released an image showing the device did not have an orange band on the barrel that many BB gunmakers have added in recent years to distinguish their products from firearms.</p><p>A bystander video posted to Facebook and obtained by CBS News also showed an officer tackling the teen and punching him as two other officers arrived, then a gunshot ringing out as the teen was on the ground.</p>

    </p>
<p>Regarding that video, police said in a statement that it was "aware of a video of the incident circulating on social media platforms, which does not portray the incident in its entirety."</p><p>Husnay, Patterson and Officer Andrew Citriniti were placed on paid administrative leave as the investigations go forward.</p><p>Under New York law, the attorney general's office looks into every death at the hands of law enforcement. The Utica Police Department's probe, meanwhile, will explore whether officers followed policies and training.</p><p>The police chief called the shooting "a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved."</p><p>To Nyah's cousin, Isabella Moo, however, the police narrative seemed like "trying to criminalize him a lot more and trying to protect the police officers."</p><p>"The escalation of this should not have happened, and our police officers need to be trained a lot better or a lot differently," she said to AP in a phone interview. "The city needs to be held accountable, and this should not have been done to any child."</p><p>Utica's population of 65,000 includes more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, <a href="https://www.thecenterutica.org/community-resources/economic-impact/populations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according to The Center</a>, a nonprofit group that helps to resettle refugees.</p>

<p>Karens are among groups warring with the military rulers of Myanmar, the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.</p><p>Nyah's family fled about two decades ago from Myanmar to Thailand, where Nyah was born in a refugee camp, and then immigrated through a resettlement program to the U.S. about nine years ago, Htoo said. He said the teen's father works at a convenience store.</p><p>Htoo said Nyah was keen on math, soccer and spending time with friends when he wasn't caring for his younger siblings. Interested in learning, he sometimes attended Bible study with his friends, though his family members are Buddhists, the cousin said.</p><p>The cousin said he'd been told that on Friday night, the boy informed his mother he was going to a store to buy something, and that was the last she saw of him.</p><p>She hasn't slept since, except for 10-minute naps, her tears resuming every time she awakens, he said.</p>

Prosecutors said Read hit her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, with her SUV before leaving him to die in the snow in <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-hung-jury-canton/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Canton</a></span> back in <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-trial-timeline-john-okeefe/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">January 2022</a></span>. Read is charged with second degree murder, manslaughter while operating under the influence of alcohol, and leaving the scene where there has been personal injury and death. She and her defense attorneys claim she's being framed and that his body was dumped in the snow after he was possibly beaten inside the home of a fellow Boston police officer.</p><p>The potential jail time and courtroom debate have likely driven a wedge between jurors, who sent a note to the judge on Friday saying they're deadlocked and unable to come to a unanimous decision. Judge Beverly Cannone sent them back to the deliberation room, asking them to keep trying.</p><h2>What happens next?</h2><p>"If the jury still cannot reach a unanimous verdict, then the judge will declare a mistrial," said legal analyst Jennifer Roman. "Which means there will be no guilty or not guilty finding against Karen and she could be tried again. A decision, a verdict, a hung jury, whatever the case may be, will come to us by Monday afternoon, the very latest Tuesday morning."</p><p>Legal analyst Phil Tracy predicted the state will want to try her again if there's a hung jury but he said it would be difficult.</p>

<p>"To get jurors that haven't made an opinion yet is going to be brutal," Tracy said.   </p>

<p>Mayor Tim Keller said multiple areas near Downtown flooded, especially the Central underpass. He noted that the underpass has always struggled with rain. He also mentioned the Marble Arno Pump Station near Lomas and Broadway. At first, the pumps in the pond weren’t fully working, but crews were eventually able to get it up and running. If it hadn’t worked, the mayor said the area would have seen a lot more flooding.</p>



<p>“Our city experienced historic weather last night, and our hearts are with everyone who experienced any damage or was put in a dangerous situation,” said Mayor Tim Keller. “We’re grateful that our departments jumped into action to keep people safe all over Albuquerque, and worked together with our partners to prevent more serious flooding in some of our city’s treasured historic neighborhoods.” </p>





<p>Flooding and power outages caused some street lights to stop working, and two fire engines and three city buses were damaged. Some city buildings were impacted, like the main police station, which had water in its basement.</p>



<p>It was a busy night for police and fire crews as the emergency center was taking a lot of calls, and multiple areas had to be closed down. Albuquerque Fire Rescue (AFR) said they responded to 142 calls from 8 p.m. to midnight. </p>





<p>There was one report claiming two people were in an arroyo and needed to be rescued, but AFR couldn’t locate anyone. Additionally, 10 water rescues were initiated for people stuck in vehicles. The mayor said there were no deaths due to the flooding.</p>





<p>Albuquerque Community Safety made its rounds on Sunday morning to check on residents in heavily impacted areas. They said they’re continuing to support the community in any way they can. </p>

<li><strong>North Korea test-fires ballistic missiles</strong>: North Korea launched two ballistic missiles on Monday, with the first missile flying 600 kilometers (370 miles) and the second missile 120 kilometers (75 miles).</li>
<li><strong>Missiles flight direction and possible landing</strong>: The missiles were launched from the town of Jangyon in southeastern North Korea and flew in a northeastern direction. The first missile landed in the waters off the North's eastern city of Chongjin, while the second missile's flight distance was too short to reach the eastern waters and may have crashed in an inland area of the North.</li>
<li><strong>South Korea and US maintain readiness</strong>: South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff stated that they maintain a firm readiness to repel any provocations by North Korea in conjunction with the military alliance with the United States.</li>
<li><strong>North Korea responds to US-SK-Japan drills</strong>: The missile tests came two days after South Korea, the US, and Japan ended their new multidomain trilateral drills, known as the "Freedom Edge" drill, which was meant to improve joint ballistic-missile defense, anti-submarine warfare, surveillance, and other skills and capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>North Korea criticizes US-SK-Japan partnership</strong>: North Korea's Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Sunday, strongly denouncing the "Freedom Edge" drill and calling the US-South Korea-Japan partnership an Asian version of NATO, which it said openly destroyed the security environment on the Korean Peninsula.</li>

<p>Israeli tanks, which re-entered Shujayea four days ago, fired shells towards several houses, leaving families trapped inside and unable to leave, residents said.</p><div class="more-on"><h2 class="more-on__heading">Keep reading </h2><span class="screen-reader-text">list of 3 items</span><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class="more-on__article"><span class="screen-reader-text">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class="screen-reader-text">end of list</span></div>
<p>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimated that “60,000 to 80,000 people were displaced” from Shujayea in recent days.</p>
<p>For those who remain, “our lives have become hell”, said 50-year-old resident Siham al-Shawa.</p>
<p>She told the AFP news agency that people were trapped as strikes could happen “anywhere” and “it is difficult to get out of the neighbourhood under fire”.</p>
<p>“We do not know where to go to protect ourselves,” she said.</p>
<p>		</p>

<p>		</p>
<p>Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said residents who managed to flee the neighbourhood say the scale of destruction is “massive”.</p><div id="article-newsletter-slot"><div class="sib-newsletter-form general-style" aria-label="Newsletter signup Widget"><div class="sib-form-container"><div class="sib-container--large sib-container--horizontal"><p class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera-container"><h3 class="sign-up-for-al-jazeera">Sign up for Al Jazeera</h3><h4 class="newsletter-title">Weekly Newsletter</h4></p></div></div><span class="google-recaptcha-policy" aria-hidden="true">protected by <strong>reCAPTCHA</strong></span></div></div>
<p>He said the central areas of Gaza City have also been “pounded” by Israeli forces.</p>
<p>“In the past hour, a residential flat was targeted. Medical sources we’ve talked to say at least 15 people have been killed today in the north after people’s homes were directly hit by artillery shells,” Abu Azzoum said.</p>
<p>He noted that in Rafah, there was a continuation of “indiscriminate Israeli attacks as residents flee for their lives”.</p>
<p>“In the al-Mawasi district – declared a ‘safe zone’ by Israel’s military – they’ve been setting fire to makeshift tent camps where displaced Palestinians have been sheltering,” he added.</p>
<p>Speaking at a weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated his stance that there was no substitute for victory in the war against Hamas.</p>
<p>“We are committed to fighting until we achieve all of our objectives: Eliminating Hamas, returning all of our hostages, ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel and returning our residents securely to their homes in the south and the north,” he said.</p>
<h2 id="empty-shells">‘Empty shells’</h2>
<p>Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan meanwhile said there’s been no progress in ceasefire talks. He said on Saturday that the Palestinian group is still ready to discuss any truce proposal that ends the nearly nine-month assault.</p>
<p>While the offensive focused on Gaza, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, one man was killed and five were wounded in an Israeli strike near the city of Tulkarem, according to the Palestinian health ministry.</p>
<p>The armed wing of Hamas and the allied Palestinian Islamic Jihad reported fierce fighting in both Shujayea and Rafah, saying their fighters had fired antitank rockets and mortar bombs against Israeli forces operating there.</p>
<p>Arab mediators’ efforts, backed by the United States, have stalled. Hamas says any deal must end the offensive and bring a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting until Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007, is eradicated.</p>
<p>The Palestinian health ministry said 43 bodies of slain Palestinians arrived at hospitals in the last 24-hour reporting period. At least 111 others were wounded.</p><p class="connatix-wysiwyg-container"><span class="connatix-container"></span></p>
<p>Israel’s offensive has so far killed at least 37,877 people, according to the Gaza health ministry, and has left the heavily built-up coastal enclave in ruins.</p>
<p>Israeli tanks pushed deeper into several districts in the east, west and centre of Rafah, near the border with Egypt, on Sunday, and medics said six people had been killed in an Israeli strike on a house in Shaboura, in the heart of the city.</p>
<p>Six bodies from the Zurub family were transferred to Nasser Hospital in the nearby city of Khan Younis, where dozens of relatives paid their respects.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Residents said the Israeli army had torched the Al-Awda mosque in the centre of Rafah, one of the city’s best known.</p>
<p>Israel has said its military operations in Rafah are aimed at eradicating the last armed battalions of Hamas. It continues to severely restrict the entry of much-needed humanitarian aid, medicine, and fuel into the enclave, which is on the verge of famine.</p>
<p>The United Nations and other relief agencies have voiced alarm over the dire humanitarian crisis and the threat of starvation that the assault and Israeli siege have brought for Gaza’s 2.4 million people.</p>
<p class="p1">“Everything is rubble,” said Louise Wateridge from the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), speaking Friday from the city of Khan Younis.</p>
<p class="p1">“There’s no water there, there’s no sanitation, there’s no food. And now, people are living back in these buildings that are empty shells.”</p>

    <p>Here are 5 key points from the news article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The presidential election in Iran has resulted in a runoff between two candidates: Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist, and Saeed Jalili, a hardliner. Both candidates received over 9 million votes, with Pezeshkian getting 10.4 million and Jalili getting 9.4 million.</li>
<li>The election is a significant indication of a shift in Iranian politics, as Pezeshkian is the first reformist candidate to make a strong showing in a presidential election in several years. He is known for his desire to improve relations with the West and lift international sanctions.</li>
<li>The runoff election is scheduled to take place on Friday, and the winner will replace the late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash in May.</li>
<li>Pezeshkian has expressed his desire to revive the nuclear deal with the West, which was abandoned by former President Donald Trump in 2018. His victory could potentially lead to improved relations between Iran and Western countries.</li>
<li>The election has sparked hope among some Iranians that a new leader will bring about change and improve the country's economy, which has been struggling due to international sanctions and domestic issues. One voter, Nima Saranghi, said he voted for Pezeshkian hoping for a better future for his country and the possibility of resolving problems with the West.</li>

                                        <p>TORONTO (AP) — A strike by plane mechanics forced Canada’s second largest airline, WestJet, to cancel hundreds more flights Sunday, upending plans of roughly 110,000 travelers over the Canada Day long weekend and prompting the carrier to demand action from the federal government.</p><p>Some 680 workers, whose daily inspections and repairs are essential to airline operations, walked off the job Friday evening despite a directive for binding arbitration from the labor minister.</p><p>“WestJet is in receipt of a binding arbitration order and awaits urgent clarity from the government that a strike and arbitration cannot exist simultaneously; this is something they have committed to address and like all Canadians we are waiting,” WestJet Airlines President Diederik Pen said in a statement Sunday.</p><p>Since Thursday, WestJet has cancelled 829 flights scheduled to fly between then and Monday — the busiest travel weekend of the season.</p>
    

<p>The vast majority of Sunday’s trips were called off as WestJet pared down its 180-plane fleet to 32 active aircraft and topped the global list for cancellations among major airlines over the weekend.</p>



<p>Trevor Temple-Murray was one of thousands of customers scrambling to rebook after their trips were scrapped less than a day in advance.</p><p>“We’ll just have to wait it out,” said Temple-Murray, a resident of Lethbridge, Alberta, who waited in a car with his wife and 2-year-old son in the parking lot of the Victoria, British Columbia, airport. They were trying to get a plane to Calgary.</p>
    
<p>Their 6:05 p.m. flight had been cancelled, and they wouldn’t know until the evening whether a scheduled 7 a.m. flight the next day would go ahead.</p><p>“There are a lot of angry people in there,” Temple-Murray said, pointing at the terminal.</p><p>Nearby, Grade 10 exchange student Marina Cebrian said she was supposed to be back home in Spain early Sunday, but now won’t return to her family until Tuesday after enduring three flight cancellations.</p>
    

<p>“It’s distressing,” she said. “I was supposed to be at home today, like seven hours ago, but I’m not.”</p><p>Both WestJet and the Airplane Mechanics Fraternal Association have accused the other side of refusing to negotiate in good faith.</p><p>The union’s goal remains a deal hammered out through bargaining rather than by an arbitrator — a route it opposed from the start.</p><p>The union says its demands around wages would cost WestJet less than $8 million Canadian (US$5.6 million) beyond what the company has offered for the first year of the collective agreement — the first contract between the two sides. It has acknowledged the gains would surpass compensation for industry colleagues across Canada and sit more on par with U.S. counterparts.</p><p>WestJet says it has offered a 12.5% wage hike in the first year of the contract, and a compounded wage increase of 23.5% over the rest of the 5 1/2-year term.</p>
