                                        <p>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Prospective jurors in a <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-trial-gun-charges-delaware-cc96568ac3428802557c85876c820dec">federal gun case</a></span> against <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-trial-gun-charges-delaware-cc96568ac3428802557c85876c820dec">President Joe Biden’s son Hunter</a></span> were questioned Monday on their thoughts about gun rights and drug addiction while the first lady watched from the front row of the courtroom in a show of support for her son.</p><p>As the first day of jury selection broke for lunch, Hunter Biden walked over to his mother and leaned over the railing that separates the audience from the trial participants to hug and kiss her on the cheek. Monday was the first lady’s 73rd birthday.</p><p><span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/hunter-biden">Hunter Biden</a></span>, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days. </p>
    

<p>The judge planned to seat 16 jurors, including four alternates, and the effort was moving swiftly along. Out of 65 prospective jurors who were questioned, 29 had been dismissed by late afternoon. One who was sent home said she didn’t know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.</p>



<p>“It’s not a good one,” she replied when an attorney asked her opinion.</p><p>The case is going to trial following the collapse of a plea deal that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. He has pleaded not guilty and has argued he’s being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president’s son.</p>
    
<p>The proceedings are unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0">convicted of 34 felonies</a></span> in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.</p>
    

<p>In Delaware, prospective jurors who answered “yes” on a questionnaire were quizzed individually by Judge Maryellen Noreika to determine whether they could be fair and impartial. Their names were not made public.</p><p>The questions tested their knowledge of the case, surveyed their thoughts about gun ownership and inquired whether they or anyone close to them have struggled with substance abuse or addiction. Other questions focused on the role politics may have played in the charges.</p><p>One man was dismissed after telling the judge he had sold guns in the past and was familiar with the forms that need to be filled out. Also dismissed was a woman who said her husband was a friend of Joe Biden’s late son, Beau, and that she thought Hunter was a good man. </p><p>A man was dismissed because his family has a long history in law enforcement, and he said he could not be impartial. Another was excused because he was very aware of the case, and, “It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.”</p>
    

<p>Only one potential juror answered “no” to all the questions and moved on to the next phase. Another who was not dismissed said he holds a concealed carry permit and owns three handguns. The man said he has strong views on gun ownership and believes every law-abiding citizen should be able to own a gun.</p><p>“I believe the Second Amendment is very important,” he explained.</p><p>Attorneys jointly moved to dismiss a woman who expressed strong anti-gun views during questioning.</p><p>“I would like stronger laws in this country about certain types of weapons,” she said. “The ones with high repeat, you know, that kill children in schools.”</p><p>“I would ban them altogether to be honest,” acknowledged the woman, who also said she has donated to Democratic congressional candidates around the country and joined “one of the resistance groups” after the 2016 election.</p>
    

<p>Hunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September <span class="LinkEnhancement"><a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-federal-tax-case-california-bb2e2eb41eb2cd30206a47c40ba6044e">on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes</a></span>. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.</p><p>But Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.</p>

He is traveling to France on Tuesday and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later.

He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.</p><p>Defense attorneys have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden didn’t see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked “no” to the question on the form. They will also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.</p><p>If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it’s unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Long reported from Washington.

            “Our duty is and will always be to look after every single Mexican without distinction,” Sheinbaum said in a speech early Monday morning. “Even though many Mexicans do not fully agree with our project, we will have to walk in peace and harmony to continue building a fair and more prosperous Mexico.”

            While studying for her undergraduate degree at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), she became immersed in student politics, protesting against the privatization of public education. After graduating, she studied energy engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, where she became fluent in English and earned a Master’s degree, before returning to UNAM for doctoral studies.

            Sheinbaum entered politics in 2000, when she was appointed environment secretary of Mexico City by Obrador, then the head of the city’s government.

            After leaving the role in 2006, Sheinbaum committed herself to the study of energy, joining the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and becoming part of the team that received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

            In 2015, she became the first woman elected head of the Tlalpan district of Mexico City, serving until 2017. The next year, she was elected head of the government of the whole city – again, the first woman to do so – only stepping down in June 2023 to embark on her run for president.

            Sheinbaum has two children and one grandchild. Her partner, Jesús María Tarriba, whom she met at university while both were studying physics, is a financial risk specialist at the Bank of Mexico.

            Had the constitution allowed it, Mexico would likely have re-elected Obrador, one of those rare politicians who – like FDR and JFK – is known simply by his initials, AMLO. After riding the wave of AMLO’s popularity, some have questioned whether Sheinbaum will be able to distance herself sufficiently from her longtime ally.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwyv27id000r3b6j8ec1chs2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            One of Sheinbaum’s biographers, journalist Jorge Zepeda, has <a href="https://www.milenio.com/opinion/jorge-zepeda-patterson/pensandolo-bien/que-le-depara-el-futuro-politico-a-claudia-sheinbaum" target="_blank">argued</a> that, once in office, Sheinbaum will likely unfurl her own platform gradually: she will first act as “the faithful disciple of the leader,” before offering “glimpses” of her own program, taking care not to stoke instability in the movement’s base.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwyv27id000s3b6jfpk5a4c3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            But Zepeda has also noted clear differences between the two leaders. In an article for the Spanish daily <a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-06-02/claudia-sheinbaum-the-science-of-politics.html#" target="_blank">El Pais</a>, Zepeda recalled asking Sheinbaum what sets her apart from other politicians. “I’m someone who makes decisions based on the data,” she told him.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph-primary-core-light" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwyv27id000t3b6jhj95s0lm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true" data-analytics-observe="on">
            By contrast, Zepeda claimed Obrador could sacrifice data for party loyalty. “If (a piece of) data gets in the way, another piece is chosen,” he said, whereas Sheinbaum allows herself to be guided by the science.
    </p>

            Obrador will leave office with broad support and an impressive record of alleviating poverty, but his premiership was marred by his “hugs, not bullets” policy of not confronting cartels, allowing violence to spiral.

            “It’s stunning that the governing party could win re-election by a landslide as it seems… given the sweeping violence, the thing is the opposition didn’t seem to put together a much more credible set of proposals about what they would do,” Freeman said.

            In recent months, the US has relied heavily on Mexico to step up immigration enforcement and help stem the flow of migration to the US southern border. The election in Mexico has raised uncertainty in the minds of some Biden officials about what, if anything, will change with a key partner when it comes to border cooperation.

            One of the considerations in rolling out a new border executive action was doing so after Mexico’s election. The administration will likely need buy-in and assistance from Mexico to execute the order.

"The Cobb family has already been subject to vicious attacks while they were forced to endure this case being used as a political football. They deserved to hear the decision from us."</p>

She said she had never heard from the governor and didn't know if he planned to take away the case, as a police organization had requested, but she believed it was possible due the present "politicized environment," especially after the murder of a Minneapolis police officer last week.</p>

"I mean, I am capable of doing my job. I am doing it here, right? It will probably have some political consequences for me, but as I've always said, the people didn't elect me to make political decisions. They elected me to make courageous ethical decisions."</p>

The attorney, Chris Madel, said in an April court hearing that Londregan feared for his partner's life because he believed Cobb was reaching for Londregan's gun. Moriarty said the defense team had not previously raised this legal claim, and another review of the video showed Cobb's hand flailing upward, which the expert determined made the shooting lawful.</p>

"It is a situation of recognizing that, given all the barriers that are put in place in these types of cases and the new information that came up, we just can't ethically go forward."</p>

"I think it's because he looks at the political winds and which way they're blowing and I think that's what he reacts to. Which is horrible. You know, if we want people to trust the system, that's not the way to do it."</p>

She also criticized the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, a professional association for law enforcement that hired Londregan's counsel, for asking Walz to intervene while waging a concerted campaign against her credibility, leading to threats on Moriarty and her staff and uncomfortable spectacles for the Cobb family.</p>

"Some of them taunted Ricky Cobb's twin brother, Rashad. Members of our staff were frightened at the spectacle, which reminded them of Jan. 6.</p>

National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, in a briefing Monday, said the U.S. is awaiting an official Hamas response on the proposal the militant group received Thursday.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In Israel, Netanyahu political rival Yair Lapid urged the government to approve the deal and promised to provide a "political safety net" if the prime minister's far-right partners follow up on threats and pull out of the fragile ruling coalition.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"The Israeli government should agree to Netanyahu's proposal and send a delegation to Cairo today to finalize the final details and bring home the men, the young women, the elderly, the soldiers and the female soldiers who are imprisoned in the tunnels," Lapid said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The IDF on Monday also told the families of four people kidnapped during the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks that they are dead and their bodies are being held by the militants.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Biden said Netanyahu had offered a three-phase plan that included return of all hostages and Israel's complete withdrawal from Gaza by the end of phase two.

Last month, Israel seized Gaza's entire border with Egypt including the crossing during its offensive against Hamas in Rafah. The crossing was the primary access point for the flow of humanitarian aid as well as a lifeline to the outside world for more than 2 million Palestinians living in the Israeli-besieged territory.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant says Israeli forces are working to destroy tunnels between Gaza and Egypt used by Hamas to smuggle weapons and to escape the war.

The call came less than a week after Spain, Ireland and Norway joined more than 140 nations in officially recognizing a Palestinian state. Israel has repeatedly condemned such action, saying it strengthens Hamas. The U.S. has sided with Israel, saying a solution must be negotiated.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"This recognition is an important acknowledgement of the rights of the Palestinian people and their struggles and suffering toward freedom and independence,” the U.N. experts said in a statement.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt"><a id="gpd-1717424678530" class="gnt_ar_b_ba"></a> Maldives bans Israeli passport holders</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><a href="/story/travel/destinations/2024/03/31/maldives-bucket-list-tourism/73033661007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">Maldives</a> announced plans to ban Israeli passport holders from <a href="/story/news/world/2024/06/03/maldives-ban-israel-passports-palestinians-gaza-war/73954227007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/06/03/maldives-ban-israel-passports-palestinians-gaza-war/73954227007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a">entering the Indian Ocean island nation</a>, known for being a luxury travel destination, amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

    <div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Nigel Farage, the pro-Brexit campaigner and serial disrupter of British politics, announced plans on Monday to run as a candidate in Britain’s general election <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/world/europe/uk-election-sunak-politics.html" title="">next month</a>, dealing a new setback to the prospects of the country’s embattled prime minister, Rishi Sunak.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The surprise announcement from Mr. Farage, who represents an insurgent hard-right movement that campaigns to curb immigration, threatens to upend the campaign by taking votes from Britain’s governing Conservative Party. In doing so, he could make it even harder for Mr. Sunak and his party to narrow a double-digit gap in the polls with the opposition Labour Party.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Divisive, charismatic and famed for his communication skills, Mr. Farage was one of the architects of Brexit, which a slim majority of Britons supported in a 2016 referendum. An earlier decision by Mr. Farage not to run this year was thought by some analysts to have sapped momentum from his party, Reform U.K., the successor to the Brexit Party he once led.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Mr. Farage said last month that <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/world/europe/nigel-farage-donald-trump-uk-election.html" title="">he would not seek</a> a parliamentary seat because he wanted to prioritize supporting Donald J. Trump’s electoral campaign in the United States. Mr. Farage is a longtime ally of the former president and campaigned for him in 2016 and 2020.</p></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">But on Monday Mr. Farage reversed his decision, saying he would take over as leader of Reform U.K. for the next five years and run for a seat in Parliament.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">“I’ve changed my mind — it’s allowed, you know,” he said. “I am going to stand in this election.” He added that he would run in Clacton, a seaside area where support for Brexit has been strong.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The announcement comes on the eve of one of the biggest events of Britain’s general election campaign so far: a televised debate on Tuesday night between Mr. Sunak and Keir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Mr. Sunak is already under significant pressure, with his Conservative Party trailing badly in opinion polls and after a gaffe-prone start to the campaign.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The change of heart by Mr. Farage could worsen prospects for the prime minister because, according to analysts, Reform U.K. threatens to take a significant number of votes from the Conservatives. Until now, much of Mr. Sunak’s election strategy appeared to have been directed toward winning back potential supporters from Reform U.K., motivating his core right-wing voters to turn out and averting a big defeat.</p></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">But on Monday Mr. Farage claimed that the Conservatives were destined to be swept away on a wave of disdain for the political establishment and were “on the verge of total collapse.”</p></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Despite Mr. Farage’s profile and popularity on the right of British politics, electoral success in Clacton, where he plans to run, is not guaranteed. He has never been elected to the British Parliament at Westminster despite seven previous attempts, although he was a member of the European Parliament for two decades before Britain quit the European Union.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Under Britain’s winner-take-all electoral system, candidates from smaller parties struggle because they need to secure the biggest share of the vote in the area they seek to represent.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Nonetheless, Mr. Farage appears to have calculated that he has a chance of victory in Clacton, <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/world/europe/nigel-farage-brexit-party.html" title="">a staunchly pro-Brexit town</a> about 80 miles northeast of London. It was once represented by a lawmaker from the U.K. Independence Party, which Mr. Farage also once led and which campaigned for Britain to leave the European Union.</p></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">With the Conservatives trailing badly in the opinion polls, Mr. Farage has been increasingly vocal in predicting a significant defeat for Mr. Sunak’s party, even speculating that it could be on the scale of that suffered by Canada’s Progressive Conservatives in 1993.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">In an <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/nigel-farage-richard-tice-reform-uk-r6scpkmpc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview with The Sunday Times</a> of London over the weekend, Mr. Farage said that he had named his party Reform U.K. after the insurgent Canadian party of the same name.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">“It took them time, it took them two elections, they became the biggest party on the center right. They then absorbed what was left of the Conservative Party into them and rebranded,” he said.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Asked if he was suggesting a merger between Reform U.K. and the Conservatives, Mr. Farage replied, “More like a takeover, dear boy.”</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Mr. Farage has admirers on the right of the Conservative Party, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, a former cabinet minister who has even called for Mr. Farage to be invited to run as a lawmaker for the Conservatives.</p></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Since 2016, Mr. Farage has been vocal in his support for Mr. Trump, and last week he described the convictions against him on <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/nyregion/trump-convicted-hush-money-trial.html" title="">34 felony charges</a> as a “disgrace.”</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">In the 2019 general election, the Brexit Party did not run candidates in many parliamentary constituencies. That was to help Boris Johnson, a former Conservative Party leader, whose election promise was that he would “get Brexit done,” and who won a big election victory.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">But Richard Tice, Reform U.K.’s leader until Mr. Farage replaced him on Monday, has said there will be no repeat of that deal and has promised to fight the Tories across England, Scotland and Wales.</p></div></div></div>

<li>The Maldives' decision follows a recommendation from the country's cabinet and is seen as a retaliatory move against Israel's actions in Gaza.</li>
<li>Israel's foreign ministry responded to the ban by urging Israelis to stay away from the Maldives and warning that it may be difficult for the Israeli government to assist if they are in distress.</li>
<li>The ban comes as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) faces allegations that some of its employees participated in Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, which launched the war in Gaza.</li>
